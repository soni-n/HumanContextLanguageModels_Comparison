negative	after hours spent speaking with yodel customer support who stated that the address was wrong , when it couldn ' t have been more correct ( we had included every piece of info possible ).
negative	they made an attempt last_night at 0pm to a very clear business address !?
negative	!
negative	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
negative	what a waste of time .
negative	i bought a voucher for a bed_frame and returned the voucher next_day .
negative	i called numerious times and the customer_service was hard to go through .
negative	they did not have a record to proof i had returned the voucher .
negative	it is already over 0 months now and i still did not receive the refund .
negative	i suggest people do not use this website .
negative	it is very unreliable and inefficient .
negative	probably it is a scam .
negative	if anyone know how to take legal_action , please let me know .
negative	ths
negative	when i moved_into my property in december_0000 i looked around for the cheapest tarrifs .
negative	first_utility came up on price comparison_websites so i chose to stay with this company .
negative	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn ' t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
negative	when i recieved statements showing how much my balance was it turns_out they were still billing me for these months .
negative	i have had to send in copys of my tenancy agreement and also covering letters and was told somebody would get in touch but still nothing has been resolved .
negative	this has been gogoing on for months now and it is a complete_joke .
negative	when i phoned them to see if they habe received my cheque i was told this they didn ' t accept cheques by 0 advisor bit was advised by somebody_else that i could pay by this method .
negative	i have also had problems submitting meter_readings to fu and when i have managed to do this they " havent " recieced them .
negative	can ' t wait to pay off my bill and move to a respectable company .
negative	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can ' t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort out their diabolical mistakes .
negative	after been passed from pillar to post and been told that they don ' t have an account for me i have to ask
negative	0 , if there is no account and i don ' t exist on their system , why the hell am i receiving bills ?
negative	0 , why can 0 person find me then other people can ' t .
negative	i mean for god sake the only thing u didn ' t ask me for was blood .
negative	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
negative	when all i wanted to do is sort out this ridiculous account .
negative	don ' t take it out on me if your having a bad day !!
negative	!
negative	0 , why do i need to be transferred to a change of tenancy department when i moved in to my property nearly 00 months_ago when all this was done in december_0000 ?
negative	?
negative	this service is the worst i have received by any means .
negative	this company needs shutting down if all they do is rip people off .
negative	sick of fu completely now .
negative	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer_service and incorrect bills .
negative	wouldn ' t it be good if this company was on don ' t get done get dom !!!
negative	wander how they would try and cover that up .
negative	i first booked my return_flight from glasgow to beijing with budgetair on dec 00th .
negative	not long after , i received an_email informing_me that my flight was cancelled by the airline which is air france .
negative	they offered me an_alternative flight instead but i was not happy with the alternative .
negative	i emailed them back , asking weather i can change the date and i was told that i had to pay 000_pounds more .
negative	of course i was not happy with that because according the airline ' s rule i can get my full_refund back and just get another ticket .
negative	so i started this nightmare with budget_air ....
negative	0 .
negative	budget_air is terribly slow at getting back to me ( i first contacted them at dec 00th and it usually takes them 0 - 0days to write back to me , until now , my issue has not been sorted )
negative	0 .
negative	i was very upset about their service so on jan 0th i phoned their customer_service hotline showed on their website .
negative	first , it was almost_impossible to get to them , the hot line kept telling_me i have to wait , i waited for half an_hour and finally some one picked_up the phone .
negative	second , their customer_service is the worst ever !
negative	their employees do not even keep up their own word !
negative	i told them my situation that i am not happy with the cancellation .
negative	i was told that they can either ask the airline to get me a full_refund or ask the airline for me regarding my special situation .
negative	and they promised me to call me back either within 00_minutes , or phone me back in the very next morning .
negative	i was so happy that i told myself , this is a quite responsible company !
negative	0 .
negative	it turned_out i was just being innocent .
negative	i waited for their call - back until the very next_day lunch time -- i still got no call back .
negative	i called them back again .
negative	after 00_mins waiting in the line , which i expected already , i got to the line with another customer representative .
negative	first i asked him why they never called me back , the guy totally ignored me ," oh , yeah , my co - worked phoned the airline for you and they can ' t provide a date change for you ''.
negative	then i asked them to get me a full_refund as they promised .
negative	the guy over the phone started to hesitate ,'' please hold on for a minute , let me check for you '' '' oh , i am sorry but your ticket is non_refundable '' then he started to tell me all these bullshit like '' oh , you have to accept this , its unfair but you have to .
negative	you can either accept the alternative , or if you want to cancel the tickets , you will get no money back . ''
negative	he blamed klm for not giving me back my refund .
negative	then he told me , if i can get klm ' s agreement of giving my full_refund , budget_air would give me my money back .
negative	0 .
negative	i phoned the airline klm .
negative	i was told that i can get a full_refund in my situation because i didn ' t accept the alternative after cancellation by the airline .
negative	but i had to deal with the agency because i paid the agency .
negative	only the agency can give me refund .
negative	they also suggest me to ask the agency to contact klm because the trade department of klm would only deal with agencies instead of individuals .
negative	0 .
negative	i phoned budget_air again .
negative	its a woman this time with no passion at all picked_up the phone .
negative	she refused to contact klm for and told me there is nothing she can do .
negative	her service is the worst ever !
negative	please everyone , imagine those emotionless staff working at the customs at an airport , or someone who has depression working at a ticket office .
negative	i wish i recorded our conversation !!!!
negative	the hr must be drunk to hire her for a customer representative !!!
negative	!
negative	0 .
negative	after all these , i was so tired of waiting in the line , and talking to their rude customer representatives .
negative	so i decided to email them the refund and compensation rules on the klm website on jan 0th .
negative	then they just never got back to me !
negative	i have no_idea how a company like this can survive , just because of the cheap flights ???
negative	?
negative	until now , i haven " t heard back from budgetair !
negative	!
negative	i checked my phone balance , and i spent over 00 pounds on waiting in the line and phoning them for about less_than 0 hour talking in total , where as on their website , it says 00 p per_minute !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered some clothes , on their wesbsite it says that the delivery will be within 00 - 00 working_days .
negative	i waited a whole month but i did not get my parcel .
negative	i wrote many_times to them but i did not get any response .
negative	i think it is really rude and unacceptable and it is surely my first and last time i did order something from the website .
negative	do not buy anything from there .
negative	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
negative	i quicker to get in your car spend 0 hours in the supermarket and come home than trying to order a weekly_shop on this site .
negative	i will not use again until the site is improved .
negative	bad layout , bad company , bad seller , bad products , i will never use ebay again as long as i live .
negative	when receiving my bath suite the courier was going to leave it in the middle of my drive but eventually pushed it into my garage after explaining i had cleared a space .
negative	i had ordered what the plumber had told me so left it for him to check when he was coming , when installing it we soon realised we had the wrong sink 0 holes instead of 0 , when i rang up they apologised and said they would send the correct one out but couldn ' t send it out till the day after next as they ' d missed the courier however the plumber could not come back then as they had another job so i ' m without a sink when i received the correct one the plastic bit that goes in the drainage hole was snapped and broken luckily i had another from the wrong sink to replace it , the following_day after realising we had the wrong sink when the plumber was installing the shower tray the waste was missing to save time he popped out to buy one but the cheapest was £_00 i rang customer_service to tell them and by that time i was very frustrated i explained this was the second mistake and i was not happy they agreed to pass it on to the manager and the manager would ring me this was 0am in the morning it got to 0pm and still no phone call so i rang them back and i was told i had been given a refund i asked how much and i was told £_00 !
negative	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste pipe and having to pay £_00 for another waste pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste pipe so they couldn ' t give me anymore ... ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more_than £_00 i was told i had only paid £_00 . 00 for the shower tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for £_00 .
negative	i asked how i could make a complaint and basically was fobbed_off as that ' s the number i would ring to make a complaint or i can send an_email which is to them anyway so i did this i emailed and asked for a reply from the manager but i still didn ' t get anywhere it took 0 days to get a reply from the manager and was told i should of checked my items and they had given me £_00 as a goodwill_gesture .
negative	disgusting customer care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
negative	nespresso ( coffee machines ) have unfortunately chosen these_clowns for their warranty repair pick_up service !
negative	first , i had to listen to their pick_up man effing and jeffing for at_least a minute as he could perform the simple operation of opening a plastic box .
negative	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
negative	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
negative	0 weeks_later , with no forewarning ( this i blame nespresso for ), they attempted to redeliver on the 00rd of february .
negative	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
negative	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
negative	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
negative	i tried to call , but their " award winning call_centre ” phone line , said there " was a fault ".
negative	as it was out of their office hours , unlike the phone line was saying , i was unable to speak to a member of their team .
negative	i went online ; their website also said there was a fault .
negative	the next_day , i called .
negative	i followed the automated_system for collection .
negative	it gave me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
negative	none of these days were possible due to work / commitments .
negative	as the card said the item would be returned after 0 working_days , i felt under pressure to commit to a collection date .
negative	i went online to see if i could find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
negative	i found a number for their customer_services - after 00_minutes queuing , i realised none of the call_centre awards were for efficiency and gave up to continue with my day .
negative	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
negative	i called them the next morning .
negative	the man i spoke to said he could only look_into this if i had my consignment_number ( i find this hard to believe that a delivery company can ' t find you from an address ) but fair_enough , i thought i ' d take number with me to work the next_day .
negative	i called next_day with the number " no , we ' re just a depot , we don ' t deal with collections , i ' ll put you through ” i was put through to a lady , who said " i ' ll put you through to customer_services ".
negative	another 00_minutes on hold , during my break , i gave up .
negative	it was now friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned .
negative	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team ... sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ..." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
negative	this threw up the result ' your package has gone for re - delivery '.
negative	i suspect it has been returned to nespresso - dpd will no doubt charge for this and charge for nespresso to re - deliver .
negative	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
negative	this is basic stuff .
negative	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
negative	i intend to call nespresso on monday and complain_about this appalling company .
negative	the person who gave them a 0 star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
negative	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service – beware !!
negative	!
negative	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
negative	i was staying at home all day waiting for them , no calls no bells .. after they " fails to deliver " three days , i visited them personally and got my parcel ,... this time they sent me a message said it will be delivered between 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 ..
negative	i waited another morning , obviously i ' m being stupid again .
negative	nothing delivered .
negative	i decided to go out and do my own business at 00 : 00 , when i ' m away from my home , the mailman called me at around 00 , asking me to go out to the gate for the parcel , i was in a rush running back home he showed a massive impatient and unfriendly face to me .
negative	they will not refund you .
negative	so don ' t even try to get a refund .
negative	i bought a wowcher of £_00 .
negative	however on contacting the merchant i realized that it was not suitable for me so i asked wowcher to refund ( within 0 days ).
negative	i was told that my wowcher has been redeemed .
negative	i contacted the merchant again , and they said no it hasnt been .
negative	i informed wowcher of that , and they said they will verify from the merchant .
negative	0 weeks have passed by , and now wowcher is ignoring my emails .
negative	i tried_contacting the merchant , and they were helpful enough to inform me that they have not received any call / email / contact whatsoever regarding this issue from wowcher .
negative	i am never buying from them again .
negative	they are just a bunch of scammers !
negative	i have been waiting for 00_minutes now to speak to someone in customer_services .
negative	this company is absolutely abysmal .
negative	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
negative	after sending them email and promising them opening of paypal case and returning goods by royal maill and copy of their return_policy - they organised collection on monday .
negative	unprofesional will newer use again .
negative	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
negative	firstly , i have bought a few things from groupon which were all fine , until i had to call them about one of the merchants .
negative	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder mystery event on a particular date .
negative	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don ' t work .
negative	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
negative	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
negative	i waited another 00 days or so and called their call_centre again and they said that it had been passed only 0 working_days ago to customer care who would need another 00 working_days to investigate !
negative	i complained as this would take us beyond the date that the event was taking place , the agent i spoke to was unhelpful and a bit rude and said i either wait or have groupon vouchers - i actually just wanted to go to the event so i said should i go or not as we don ' t know if it is tracking place but the agent just said she could not advise and that the voucher did not expire for a few_months - how could this be when the event was in less_than 0 weeks ?
negative	i asked for a manager who was a lot more pleasant and said he understood and he would raise the issue again and explain that i need an answer in less_than 00 working_days as it is urgent , he also offered to credit me £_00 as a gesture .
negative	this entire conversation took over 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven ' t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
negative	i could not believe it , i replied_saying i had spent over 00_minutes on the phone only yesterday and it was ridiculous as i was promised this would be dealt_with not closed , i requested someone call me to discuss it , but it has been 0 days now and i have not heard_anything - even_though they advertise emails will be replied to within 00_hours .
negative	basically i ' ve been waiting almost a month and am no further forward , i don ' t know if i should turn_up for the event or not .
negative	clearly groupon ' s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
negative	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don ' t expect groupon to help !
negative	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
negative	and you can ' t verify yourself to make a review using your email .
negative	first and last time i ' ll use them .
negative	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn ' t turn_up .
negative	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it ' s too_late to make alternative_arrangements .
negative	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
negative	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .
negative	after spending the 0 hours scanning 000 odd dvds and packing them i was given a choice of collection dates .
negative	after picking one i cleared the whole day ( 0 til 0 is a long time to clear on a week your meant to be moving_house ).
negative	i even got an_email the day before the collection confirming i needed to stay in for 00_hours the following_day .
negative	come 0 past 0 that evening - nothing .
negative	i phone them the next_day only to be told there must ' ve been a booking error and what day did i want to reschedule .
negative	and that was all - very much a ' tough_luck , like it or lump it attitude '.
negative	i used to be a customer for freedom0surf and never really ran_into issues that required me to use their customer_services .
negative	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
negative	i contacted customer_services who were really unfriendly about the whole situation .
negative	they were rude and did not respect my choice to be removed from all their marketing / newsletter information .
negative	there is no need for rudeness of this nature and i will not be using this company again .
negative	in fact , i have since persuaded 0 friends from not using freedom0surf when they were considering using them for this very reason .
negative	i ' m sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
negative	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
negative	unfortunately some companies i order from do not specify which courier they use and i often have the unfortunate luck to have hdnl for some of my orders .
negative	about 00_% of the time , i am left infuriated with how the parcels are left at my house .
negative	i ' ve parcels containing electric items thrown over my 0 foot garden fence , parcels wedged into my gas meter box , parcels left in my recycling bin which was 0 / 0 full with garden cuttings and rotting vegetables , one time my wife had forgotten to lock her car and the parcel had been left in the drivers footwell ( this is something i ' m completely baffled about , do delivery drivers go around checking whether car doors are open for the houses they are attempting delivery at ??
negative	), i ' ve had parcels left with complete strangers ( it ' s amazing that delivery drivers think that just because they live a few houses away , that they can ' t be strangers ), i ' ve even had a parcel left behind my car and without having a note left ( car had been unused for a number of days and only after moving it did i find the parcel there .
negative	the parcel were chocolates which could have been ruined as they were out in the rain ).
negative	i really hate hdnl and make it a point to complain to the company i order from ( e . g .
negative	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .
negative	hdnl ' s customer_service is ridiculous as they have no quality_control and the delivery drivers do not seem accountable to anyone .
negative	i ' ve called npower twice - to set_up my account and then to find out about the next bill and both_times it was quite humiliating and unpleasant experience .
negative	already in the 0 : 00 o ' clock in morning they sound very annoyed to receive a call from customer , they got all the data wrong , the tone they spoke to me was quite demeaning and in general i would like to avoid talking to this company on the phone ( obviously they are not offering to do these services online , isn ' t it 0000 ?)
negative	not sure what ' s wrong with this company , i wouldn ' t recommend anyone this .
negative	i ordered a fridge_freezer that was delivered in time , but it was damaged and getting them to pick it up has been a nightmare , over two_weeks_later they managed to collect and after a further 0 days i got a refund , i reordered from appliancesdirect and withing 0days a perfect appliances arrived from two friendly drivers ,
negative	i ordered 0 items for christmas_presents ; sjp nyc x0 , halle berry gift set , oo0 spray with gift .
negative	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work colleague .
negative	the nyc ' s , i had to just give to my mum and sis because they were so small .
negative	not a good price .
negative	i am extremely disappointed in the fact that the oo0 bought for my step dad arrived with an elastic band holding the spray to the gift .
negative	surely , you could find a better way to package this so it doesn ' t look like i ' ve bought it off a market stall ?
negative	i have now had to purchase a box just to make this look half decent .
negative	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
negative	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra £_00 to the price .
negative	when i asked about it i was ignored .
negative	been trying to get my refund ever since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
negative	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
negative	worst website i have ever shopped from in my life the customer_service is just disgusting , i advise everyone to avoid this website .
negative	ordered my desk on wed and did not expect it next_day as it stated because it was late in the day , however i recived a text_saying it would be with me on friday , this was fine .
negative	i get a text on friday from city_link saying the delivery has been delayed in transit and a new date will be advised soon .
negative	this was not good enough for me , i called up customer_service and was told it had been sent to the wrong depo , i asked if something was noticed as 0 . 00 in the morning if it was logistically possible to make the delivery happen for the day still , the reply was city_link have let us down .
negative	i asked if it was possible for it to be delivered sat ?
negative	i was told yes / big chance / maybe ..
negative	i asked for a refund if it was not delivered on sat , i was ignored on that question .
negative	i got another text from city_link friday at 0 . 00pm ( soon ) saying it wont be with me till_monday .
negative	this company say they deliver a fantastic service but when something_goes_wrong its the worst customer_service , you have to chase the for answers , get told its someone_else ' s fault and then ignored when you want to cancel the order and get your money back , its to late now ill have to get someone to wait in monday as well as i am working .. nice one .
negative	this site is probably the worst site i have dealt_with .
negative	their communication is absolutely atrocious .. the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up ..
negative	i purchased my ticket on thursday and within 0 hours i was notified that my cc may have been misused by an_automated email .. i followed their directions of the things they wanted for proof ( still find it very strange since no other site has done this ) and have yet to hear back from someone .. that information was sent friday around noon i have yet to hear from them and its saturday evening ..
negative	my only solution now is to book my return_flight with someone_else
negative	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction .. the same day i made the purchase .. thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
negative	i ' ll also make_sure to pass on to everyone i know to never use your services
negative	when i booked the car online everything seemed fine .
negative	but when we went to pick_up the car at the arranged place it wasn ' t there and we had to wait 0 hours and take a taxi ( 00 euro ) to another location , then they didn ' t have the child seat i booked and i had to go buy one in the supermarket ( 00 euro ) and now i am stuck with that because they won ' t refund the money for either taxi or seat .
negative	when i went to return the car in the arranged place in nice it wasn ' t there ...
negative	surprise !!
negative	and i had to drive around town to find the parking lot where someone on top of all smashed into my door so i had to pay another 000 euro for a bump on the door .. everything has been problem and i will never rent a car through this company again and i strongly_recommend others to do the same !
negative	!
negative	we went to book a light to reykjavik and they had a good deal of £_000 for flight we went to book this straight_away and there website went down we took screenshots of the price and the technical_difficulties notice .
negative	the next_day ( there lines were shut ) i rang the customer_services the flights had gone up £_000 pp !!!!.
negative	so i said it was an issue with you website .
negative	kumar the manager said no issues send the screenshots over and we will refund the difference if you book the flight with us now , so i did and sent the email explaining everything to the customer_services referred them to the time of the call the kumar etc ( he said the call will be monitored ), i got a very sarcastic response saying they cannot refund difference otherwise they would be out of pocket !!!!
negative	so i now have a flight i cannot cancel and was more_expensive than other_websites .
negative	the worst company i have ever known !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered flowers 0 days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
negative	i ordered some goggles from here that said " in stock " online .
negative	i then emailed a week_later after hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
negative	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
negative	the same_thing was said , so i asked to cancel ( as i am shortly leaving the country and don ' t have time to wait around .
negative	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least £_000 below my price range ).
negative	i picked the goggles as they were a certain spec that i desired and the alternatives were none of these .
negative	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
negative	so why , before this did it take a day or so more ?
negative	they also didn ' t confirm my refund until i emailed them twice .
negative	they may aswell have chucked my money back at me .
negative	overall , i am totally appalled .
negative	what a shocking service !
negative	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
negative	paid the amount , instantly received an_email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .
negative	after appr .
negative	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn ' t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
negative	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
negative	if my payment didnt go through , why do they need my confirmation for cancellation ?
negative	not booking with them ever ..
negative	i just want to complain_about the service i have been receiving with regards to their repair and protect washing_machine package i bought 0 months_ago .
negative	their engineers come with one part and then leaves my house in 00 - 00_minutes apologizing they couldn ' t fix and then i have to wait 0 weeks for next to come .
negative	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
negative	they come with new part , try it , that don ' t work and go back .
negative	00th_sept , 00 was icing on cake as your engineer didn ' t turn_up .
negative	i was sitting at home whole day waiting for engineer but no communication , nothing and when i checked my status of repair , it was saying repair complete .
negative	no doubt , knowhow ' s facebook_page doesn ' t allow user to add their comments as people don ' t have much nice to say about the service they get i suppose .
negative	worst company i have come_across .
negative	stay_away
negative	i have been double_charged for my booking with car_hire 0000 and they are dragging their feet in giving me a refund .
negative	so quick to take your money but then they say " we are just a middle_man " when it comes to resolving problems .
negative	awful and unhelpful customer_service .
negative	meanwhile i ' m left with money gone from my account .
negative	this is one middleman you don ' t need - avoid .
negative	brought an item of ebay , was meant to be 00 hour courier .
negative	package was despatched next_day but delivery is now 0 days late !
negative	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .
negative	second time i was in the house the whole day , i was down stairs next to my drive window and no vans arrived yet tracker said consignee could not be reached !
negative	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
negative	doubt i will ever get my parcel and reckon the yodel employee who was meant to deliver it went and saw his mates instead of delivering anything .
negative	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
negative	join this campaign on [_link ]
negative	can ' t wait_until my contract_ends and i can switch .
negative	been complaining direct and via_twitter , just get the same rubbish reply to run silly tests .
negative	when in the office or at home i get 0 - 0 bars signal , but i get no calls or texts and most of the time i can ' t dial out .
negative	then suddenly i get several texts all at once with varying timestamps up to hours before the current time .
negative	tried my sim in other phones .
negative	same_thing happens .
negative	rubbish .
negative	they have had my product for over a week i had to call them to arrange for my product to be delivered as i had not been contacted after an_hour and half was agreed it will be delivered in the afternoon 0 days_later .
negative	received a message_saying delivery would be tomorrow between_0am - 0pm so called the office i was told its tough , the sales_assistant sonia could not care less and had the attitude of i will speak to my manager and call back if i have the time .
negative	this is a bed i had ordered that should have arrived on 00th i now have no bed to sleep on i suffer from a back problem where the lower part of my back is fractured , this company does not care at all
negative	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
negative	our broadband and land - line have not been activated now 0 days past activation date !
negative	has been over 00hrs we were told to wait to get a call back .
negative	no - one has called .
negative	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
negative	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone call from asda , nothing !
negative	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
negative	we were told we would be called back , but no one called back .
negative	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
negative	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
negative	so far it ' s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
negative	asda may say the fault here lays with the bank , however if asda had delivered the shopping that i had paid for , we wouldn ' t be in the situation .
negative	we have written a letter of complaint but are still_waiting for a response .
negative	after a non delivery you would think they would contact us , but i guess that ' s why they ' re cheap !
negative	we dispatch our goods world wide and have collections from every courier company available in the uk , all the other drivers park outside and walk up to the first floor to collect our goods without any_problems .
negative	hermes do not , they park down the road , or behind the office and wont walk up the stairs to collect from us ...
negative	upon ringing the main office the response was " our drivers are not allowed to leave their vans ".
negative	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
negative	come on hermes , step it up please .
negative	ridiculously_expensive i don ' t know how they justify their prices .
negative	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre .... we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
negative	i ' ve been a scottish_power customer for 0 years and finally i ' ve had enough !
negative	( 0 years previous address ( great service ) ... 0 years current address ) current home was intitially british_gas which i thought i ' d switch back to scottish_power
negative	this last_year alone i noticed everytime i topped_up on my pre_- pay card they were taking money at the same time .
negative	£_00 they would take £ 0 and leave me with £_00 credit .
negative	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer ... they put the blame down to switching from british_gas ... that british_gas owe me the money .
negative	phone british_gas .... i didn ' t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .
negative	phoned scottish_power they give me a pin to wipe it off .
negative	.... few weeks_later debt on it again .
negative	this time same reason ... only 0 weeks electricity was unaccoutnable for when i switched .
negative	i explained i ' ve already paid for my eletcricity ... i ' m not paying for it twice .
negative	same_thing again gave me a pin wiped it off .
negative	this time they were taking £ 0 ... this went on 0 - 0 times ..... were they wiped it clean .
negative	then the final time 0th or 0th time i flipped and had enough ...
negative	i topped_up £_00 ...£ 0 . 00 off ... i checked my meter ... it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
negative	bear in mind i hadn ' t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
negative	i contacted scottish_power who asked me for my meter_reading ... i gave it them and the woman on the phone said you are not £_00 .
negative	in debt your are now £_00 in debt .
negative	i asked how can i be in debt i do not get £_00 worth free of electricity .. i pay for what i use i pay as you go .
negative	this time scottish_power were not for wiping the debt off ....
negative	i ' d had enough i contacted consumer_rights ombudsman to put an official_complaint in about how badly we were being treated ... to investigate sp because surely this is fraud tapping into to pay as you go customers meters and adding debt on their meters without us knowing .
negative	this had happened to us 0 times .
negative	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip offs !
negative	so i switched only last_week because i can ' t take this with scottish_power anymore .... this morning had a phone call from sp on a sunday morning from a witheld number .... bearing in mind scottsh power are not open on a sunday said he was clearing the £_00 debt and he can see there was always a problem with the meter_reading ... that i shouldn ' t have been in debt because i ' m pay as you go ....
negative	so what about all the money i have paid weekly in debt ???
negative	... i ' ve never been given that back ... all as i ' ve been given is the meter wiped .
negative	not any of the money i have paid on this so called debt !
negative	.... sp only acting now because i have took it up with the ombudsman .
negative	i ' m just one customer they have tried to rip_off ....... how many vulnerable customers are out there who don ' t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
negative	my advice is put your key in and scroll through the options it will tell you if there is any debt and how much they are taking a week !!!!!!!!
negative	.....& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
negative	because this is theft of an energy supplier who already get enough of us customers !
negative	every time i make a purchase with this company there is a problem !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they ' ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags .... items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
negative	there is always an item out of stock ....
negative	and when you are really looking_forward to receiving something like a rare opulence ballerina dress they send you a shoddy side train dress not what i ordered and contacting them by telephone is terrible !!!!!!!!!!
negative	not only that they don ' t send you a returns sticker ..... i have to pay my own returns cost and wait 00 days for a refund !!!!
negative	avoid if you don ' t want to be disappointed because i ' m disappointed in every transaction i make
negative	talk_talk .
negative	what a load of s ** t . after several calls over the past few_months changing my wifes name and adding me to the account they still_havent listed me or changed her name .
negative	every time the same poor_excuse , from a scripted broken english operator .
negative	today was the last_straw .
negative	after calling regarding the broadband upgrade the same_thing happened again .
negative	it took 00_minutes to sort out the same old problem .
negative	with enough being enough .
negative	after another 00_minutes of arguing and not excepting their empty apologises i finally got to cancel the account .
negative	do yourselves a favour people pay a little extra for bt or sky .
negative	disappointed not to receive the flowers which were ordered by the date requested .
negative	it is difficult to allocated specific blame for this as appears to be a combination of factors including capacity to fulfil orders , weather , delivery logistics etc .
negative	that said , none of these issues are my personal concern , however , can be understandable to an extent .
negative	my main complaint with this company has been communication which has been appalling .
negative	telephones not being answered , online email messages not answered and the online_chat makes you wait a very long time between each interaction .
negative	i was given the advice that i should reject the order once this arrived late and i would receive a full_refund .
negative	i am still_waiting on this to happen !
negative	my overarching opinion is very negative , and sorting all this out is a giant waste of my time !
negative	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0 days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0 days ago .
negative	phoned customer_service and said they would check with hermes delivery and see what happened .
negative	i then had to phone back as surprise_surprise they didn ' t phone me !
negative	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
negative	again phoned back and told same_thing but that they always side with customer !
negative	what a joke my son was left gutted and i ' m hoping for a refund but i ' ve reported them to watchdog and to my bank for fraud so that ' s .
negative	how bad they are !
negative	i think some tramps hermes guy has spotted my parcel and lifted it as barca kids strips are hard to get right now .
negative	what a sad existence to steal from a company and make a fool of yourself !
negative	i tried to get cash back from my online shopping and i could not find mymzone or hungry_house on the list .
negative	how does it work ?
negative	not too friendly , is it ?
negative	i emailed them three_weeks_ago and have not gotten a reply yet !
negative	i guess this is one of those times when i had a bad time with the vendor .
negative	i was in london only for a week and i ordered takeaway for my host after she had showed me the whole of london .
negative	we had such a good time ( and tiring ) walking in markets , shopping ( which was fun ) that we thought ordering takeaway would be easier .
negative	the website was slow and sometimes non - co - operative and in the end , we ordered .
negative	the food was late and it was cold .
negative	the guy who drive the bike said that he had to travel a long way .
negative	i wondered why they were listed in the first place ?
negative	anyway , i am sad that i had to eat cold food and my host was not too happy about how that turned_out .
negative	in the end , i bought her a nice little shoe from mymzone and a big hug before i left to forget how it turned_out .
negative	i guess this is quite personal and it may not happen to everyone but guys , please look at where you are ordering from if you do not want cold food !
negative	half way through december_0000 , i wanted an early upgrade before i go on holiday so i went to see if i can upgrade early , and they said " yes " quite happily i upgraded then and there .
negative	while this was happening my sim never activated to the 0g_network for ee .
negative	so i went back to the store they happily sorted out the problem for me .
negative	but thats just the beginning of the whole issue .
negative	i went on holiday at the end of december till early january .
negative	the phone was on airplane mode for the whole holiday , bare in mind this is an iphone_0s .
negative	i turned the network back on as soon as i landed , and there was " no service " for a good day .
negative	so i spoke to a friendly advisor for ee over the phone .
negative	she arranged and advised that i go to an ee store for a replacement sim .
negative	£_00 would be credited to my account if i pay £_00 in store for the sim , thats standard procedure i said fine .
negative	as i carried_out the advice , i went to th ee store , the sales_assistant told me i did not have an ee account .
negative	i found this strange , so they investigated further and they found that the number for ee has been terminated and my t - mobile has been active .
negative	so they gave me a replacement sim for my t mobile old contract for the mean time to use until my issue is resolved .
negative	the gentleman serving me was utterly nice and apologetic but i did not like the fact i had to deal with ee and tmobile on the phone rather_than the assistant doing so .
negative	his " manager " on the other hand was rather rude , and commented that it was carphone_warehouse ' s fault for not processing my upgrade .
negative	and i snapped straight back and the way he implicated it was fault of ee there was no need to snap at a frustrated paying customer .
negative	so as carphone_warehouse is close by , i went to the store .
negative	and they has a little investigation carried_out .
negative	what they has found is that the processing of numbers in their office has terminated the wrong contract , instead of terminating the t mobile , they terminated the ee contract , they had told me that it would take a week for the processing office to respond to my request .
negative	i am furious at this point but i stayed composed .
negative	almost every day since that visit i have came to the store to see if it has been resolved .
negative	and it has now been 0 weeks since the issue occurred .
negative	and it has been concluded that as of now , i have no contract , no rights to either my ee or t mobile contract .
negative	and i find it utterly wasteful an ridiculous that anyone upgrades with carphone_warehouse .
negative	they are just merely the middle men in the phone network industry and i would advise_anyone to go straight to the store for their network_provider has carried_out their service .
negative	the service here is really unnecessarily stupid .
negative	and the manager at carphone_warehouse has issued me to refund everything including the phone back to them , the money it has cost me (£_000 roughly ).
negative	to conclude , frankly it isn ' t about the money .
negative	its just the sheer waste of time , and effort put into this whole stupid situation and apparently i am not the only one .
negative	if anyone has been experiencing the same problem .
negative	to those who are , my thoughts are with you seriously , such a big regret coming to carphone_warehouse .
negative	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
negative	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
negative	it ' s not , it ' s a lie .
negative	you will have to wait 0 - 0 working_days during which time you cannot cancel the order and no explaination will be given .
negative	do not order online with them .
negative	like many of you ordered my big_boy bean_bag !!
negative	via groupon .
negative	still yet to arrive !!
negative	ordered on the 00th_november_0000
negative	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
negative	last e . mail was delivery in feb before 00th , like others saying check site order page for details ... etc
negative	& an_email from groupon saying £_00 off next purchase .... i cant afford any of their stuff , so gave it to my mum ...( she informed me of these numourus complaints !!)
negative	at_least now i dont feel alone in the matter .
negative	i have contacted bbc ' s watchdog via their website , advise you do also .
negative	i ' m also concidering refund from groupon even if i loose my £_00 odd p_& p from infurn as seen similar priced / sized bean_bags instock at my local range store !
negative	!
negative	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
negative	i do however want answers from infurn and a definative answer as to when my itm will actually arrive !
negative	!
negative	was told feb 00th ..... well on site its now saying calender week 00 ... lets_see shall we ......
negative	the last four orders i ' ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
negative	i have now lost my patience and give up with them , most certainly will never order from them again .
negative	i ' m surprised they are still trading !
negative	paypal is worst payment_gateway .
negative	they have indian based customer support and their level of customer support is 0 ...
negative	i had many friends with same level of experience and we are moving to moneybookers now .
negative	i have had an absolutely awful experience with talk_talk .
negative	i should have know that it was going to be a hassle with them , as i had problems from the very beginning !
negative	i recently spent all morning on the phone with them over an issue i had and spoke to four different people .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager because i felt my issue wasn ' t being handled properly by the customer_service team and i was also being told different things from different people .
negative	i was absolutely horrified that the customer_service experience he provided could be even worse !
negative	i did ask to speak to his manager and make an official compliant , but he refused to transfer me .
negative	he said he was my last point of contact .
negative	my recommendation is to stay_away from talk_talk .
negative	it just isn ' t worth it an they are really not that much cheaper_than anyone_else in the market .
negative	i have been a customer of vodafone for around 00 years - when calling to upgrade my handset they would not offer me a better a deal only something thats more_expensive per_month or to upgrade to 0g for an extra tenner a month !
negative	i can ' t really afford £_00 extra ontop of what i already pay and all i kept getting told by your customer_service was ' theres nothing we can do sir ' later when i phoned back to ask if they could match a price i have found they told me a load of bs about how theres are a little more_expensive due to the customer_service they offer and putting their money in to that .
negative	what customer_service ?????!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i know now that once my contract is up unless they can offer me a better deal or match what i can purchase elsewhere they will be loosing another loyal paying customer !
negative	oh and to top it off i tried to send an_email to complain to try and get somewhere with this useless corporate company yet i get an_automated_response from mr rajesh sukumaran to say they do not deal with this type of query through email please ring them on 000 which i already have done !!
negative	- is there anything i can do to try and get through to anyone slightly_higher up in the company apart_from going round in circles !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will be leaving vodafone for a more approachable service provider who doesn ' t just palm you off !!
negative	!
negative	do not sign a contract with them you will regret !!
negative	!
negative	i booked two flights one for myself and one for my partner from beijing to kuala lumpur however the site crashed and timed out .
negative	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more_than happy to take your money !
negative	budget_air then charged my credit_card for each flight ( 0x £_000 . 00 ) informing_me i would have a refund within 00_hours for both charges .
negative	one charge was refunded and the other has not .
negative	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	no answer !
negative	i have emailed their customer_services .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	no answer !
negative	the impression i get from this is budget_air conduct themselves in an unscrupulous and dishonest manner with no regard to customer_services .
negative	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
negative	budget_air – please can you refund my £_000 . 00
negative	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns up .
negative	book the wrong tickets or need a refund and it will cost you dearly .
negative	not just the cost of the tickets but the numerous_calls to their indian_call_centres where they recite a speech - no matter how many_times you tell them otherwise they will repeat the speech ... nightmare .
negative	would never use again : 0 (
negative	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for £_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
negative	i continued to check the small_print which all seemed to pan out .
negative	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
negative	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don ' t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay ....
negative	in light of this i contacted " groupon " to be told that i had misread the fine print and because it was longer_than seven_days after i purchased the voucher i wasn ' t entitled to a refund and they could only give me credits ....
negative	i was furious ... why would i want credits i haven ' t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
negative	i payed with cash so i should be given a cash refund .
negative	avoid .
negative	regards sarah
negative	i returned faulty etymotic earphones in april for replacement under_warranty and 0 months later have not received a replacement .
negative	worse though , stone audio have not responded to my emails chasing it up and when i call to enquire and they say they will call me back , they never have .
negative	they have provided no information when i ' ve asked for updates , so i now have to turn to my credit_card company to chargeback for a refund .
negative	i will never deal with this company again .
negative	i ordered from this site at the begging of march , i only received my package three months later .
negative	they divided the shipment to two since some items were not available , they shipped one after two_weeks and the other after a month !
negative	the first shipment after 0 months showed null , i contacted their website they told me to wait then they said it was lost .
negative	they told me that they can only refund half the amount even_though i paid insurance !
negative	i told them i want the full_amount , and we kept sending messages ( no clear or fast action has been taken ).
negative	i received the second shipment , i ordered a black hand jewelry display and it came red and broken , i opened a rma and they have refunded me .
negative	the item was not packaged properly , just thrown there as if it is not fragile .
negative	i received the other shipment half of may .
negative	0 items were different than pictured , and the other hand display was scratched with white spots , i opened an rma , but they said they can only refund usd 0 !
negative	or i should return the items ( returning would cost even more ).
negative	so do not bother adding extra for insurance , i think it was just put there .
negative	wat are yous playing at do u actually know that i tried to book a hotel to tenerife and the consultant aske me was tenerife in england omg it took me 00_minutes trying to explain were tenerife is i know ur exploiting them for cheap labour but come on were customers at end off the day not dogs
negative	no wonder_why they are so cheap .
negative	the delivery guy was smoking and took his time to give me the parcel to sign .
negative	he was also very rude and unpleasant .
negative	unfortunately mandmdirect is now using hermes as their contractor company and i will not shop with them again .
negative	this is the crap bad as shit network i have ever come through dont ever get three network that will be your biggest_mistake honestly .
negative	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
negative	o0 customer_service is simple , easy and things are done pretty fast , in the other hand , three website is useless , their customer_service even more useless and their policies are ridiculous .
negative	i am a pay as you go customer , and never loved 0 anyways , but now i have it more then any other operator
negative	trying to get my phone ' s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message confirming that they had my details checked .
negative	after waiting over an_hour for the text , i got a text_saying that they couldn ' t have my age checked therefore they were unable to provide me with my adult content pin number .
negative	and i just want to watch a normal film
negative	wtf ...... not impressed , in fact really disappointed
negative	three is the worse mobile network in the uk
negative	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
negative	last_night i downloaded some software .
negative	got my browser highjacked by malware .
negative	took me 0 hours to remove it .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	there was no click or unclick box to let me know a bundle to software was going to be loaded .
negative	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
negative	what has happened to their standards ?
negative	this was the 0 star_review , which is now downgraded to 0 star , see far below .
negative	i ' ve used asda home delivery for groceries on and off since their days of the telephone order service ( with the lovely gentlemen from the north east of england taking the orders ).
negative	i use asda , now via a laptop , every couple of months .
negative	the delivery has normally been within the 0 hour_slot .
negative	occasionally early , but they have phoned first to check i was in .
negative	the quality of the groceries have been fine .
negative	the occasional substitution , but normally fine .
negative	although i have to say asda do get the prize for the most weird substitution , ordered - a packet of cigarettes , delivered - a plastic picnic set for one .
negative	the only similarity , they were both blue .
negative	i just had to laugh .
negative	the substitution was the healthy option !
negative	!
negative	recently for the first time for years i ' ve had need to phone their customer_service over a missing item .
negative	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
negative	they have promptly dealt_with my enquiry and refund produced in a few_days .
negative	i will_continue to use asda for groceries from time to time .
negative	i will also use tesco and sainsbury for my online groceries .
negative	for me the service from these 0 suppliers are about the same .
negative	just depends on what i need to order as to which one i use .
negative	update to asda review - it is now months after my original review .
negative	i have now had to stop using them completely as their website is now not compatible with firefox .
negative	i have emailed a couple of times and all i get is change to ie ( which kept freezing for me , so i gave up with it ) or change to google_chrome .
negative	as i ' m very happy with firefox i have given up with asda .
negative	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my £_00 per week will go elsewhere .
negative	i placed the order 0 minuted after 0pm and was told the order would processed the next working day .
negative	come to find out the items i ordered were not in stock .
negative	i called customer_service twice both_times the agent tried to cancel my order .
negative	i wonder_how they make any money if the customer_service agents simply cancel orders to make problems go away .
negative	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
negative	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
negative	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
negative	i feel this is a major issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
negative	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !
negative	i will never use this company ever again !
negative	i booked a theatre and meal deal through lastminute . com for my girlfriends_birthday .
negative	i didn ' t pay a lot for the deal so i wasn ' t expecting much in terms of meal and seats but i was planning to make the most of it all the same .
negative	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
negative	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
negative	so good so far , however , 00_minutes after ordering our meals and drinks , nothing had arrived .
negative	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
negative	i told the waitress who didn ' t even offer an_apology and took the food away .
negative	meanwhile , my girlfriends macaroni and cheese arrived complete with raw pieces of bacon in it !!!
negative	so again we told the waitress and again no apology and again took the food away .
negative	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it ' s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
negative	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn ' t had our drinks .
negative	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
negative	before we left i did notice that the meal offered would ' ve cost us £ 0 . 00 each , along with the £_00 theatre tickets , our so called " deal " should ' ve cost £_00 . 00 ...... i paid £_00 . 00 !!
negative	!
negative	anyway , the seats in the theatre were great and the show was awesome , apart_from the over enthusiastic woman next to me who hit me on the head and in the face several_times , to my girlfriends delight !
negative	!
negative	so to sum up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren ' t deals at all and cost more_than face_value .
negative	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
negative	!
negative	i am been trying to set_up drirect debt for for 0 years every time i try to set_up with them they say that you direct debt is not set_up and they charge you 0 pound for not having direct debt talktalk is so bad would book about how bad they are seriously
negative	booked two tickets to see paris st germain vs rennes for the 0th_may .
negative	game was rescheduled for 0th_may but unable to get refund for tickets - take note people !
negative	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
negative	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
negative	unable to list category 0 seat numbers for the game - supposedly a psg restriction - however , loads of other sellers ( of category 0 area ) are able to list their seat numbers and when i first bought them i was able to see what seats i was buying !
negative	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
negative	000euros possibly down the drain !
negative	poor poor poor - your customer_service stinks !
negative	do not use this company !
negative	!
negative	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
negative	i got £ 0000 finance and paid the rest with cash on the day of order .
negative	it was delivered broken .
negative	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
negative	instead , they ' d taped up a corner or two of the very badly_damaged boxes and shipped out regardless .
negative	i refused the delivery and sent photographic_evidence .
negative	i had to chase them for my refund .
negative	when it was agreed i was told it had just been processed and i would get my money in 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	it ' s now been 0 working_days and they still have my money .
negative	i ' ve been told i now have to wait another 0 working_days .
negative	this company doesn ' t in any way approach professionalism .
negative	they have absolutely no interest in making the customer happy or delivering anything remotely approaching quality .
negative	still_haven ' t received order .
negative	i have contacted you but apparently i have to wait_until wednesday next week .
negative	i have now completely ran out of both products and i ' m not happy with the service .
negative	this january after_reading good reviews i decided to sign for their services ... my worst decision ever .....
negative	it worked_fine for 0 months and after that a non stop for the internet problem .
negative	when contacted their servies informed me that i had a problem in the line and an engineer would be required and the cost would be £_00 ...... not happy with that but if their was a problem ... it needed to be sorted out .
negative	the engineer did come .. stayed not moore than 0 min and bum ... £_00 i was charged for that ..... after one month the problem started again !!!!!
negative	called talktalk customer_service ... spend hours on the phone with them ... no one is abble to help .. and when requested to speak to themanager of the faulty department he told me that the routter had stopped workinf .... fair_enough ... equipments to tend to brake .
negative	did send me new one and lasted 0 weeks ... called again and i was informed that the new routter that arrived 0 weeks_ago had a faulty problem ... so ... they send me a new one ... lasted 0 week .... so .. called again ... i have lost the count of the hours that i have lost with talktalk services .... the best was when speaking to inder ( faulty department manager ) ask me to wait and hanged_up on my face ..... not nice at all ..... this is the kind of service that you will receive from talktalk managers !!!!
negative	!
negative	so .. had to call again ... lost another fwe hours for the end the talk is the same .. there a problme in the line and i need to pay £_00 for an engineer to be there .... are their just joking with the customer ?????
negative	paid months_ago £ for aparently nothing to be done .. . and had to pay again ????
negative	lost all my patience ... and decided to just cancell the contract and finish with this crappy miserable service ...
negative	while speaking to ankita ( another maganer ) she told me that i had to call to the loyalty department to cancel , when requested a call back i was informed that that wans ' t possible .. and i had to call in the morning .....
negative	seriously ..... is the kind of service that we are supposed to received has been a customer ....
negative	i did called the next morning .. and i was on the phone from 0 . 00 until 00 . 00 ...... not aceptable at all !!!!!
negative	!
negative	in the end i have a engineer that will come to my house but the available date is 00th_december .... what a joke of a company ... until there no internet ... or has they suggested .. i will have to buy a dongle until the 00th_december .....
negative	not impressed at all .....
negative	will never recomend this provider to anyone .......
negative	_________________________________________________________________
negative	so .. after one month of no internet yesterday the engineer come to check our line ... so ... line working fine ... and .. what was the problem i asked to the engeenier ....
negative	the router they sent me was wrongly configureted ... what a useless company ...
negative	you will wonder that the people working there would now what they are doing ... but no ...
negative	in the end the problem was not in my house but with their own equipement .....
negative	if you want to work with a decent company ... never ... but never try talktalk .....
negative	hi there i was in touch with your customer_service the newattino was faulty and i have been told to send it back and they were sending a new one to me .... it was on the 00 / 00 more_than one month_ago ....
negative	i have been waiting for it .. but this situation is pissing me off ...
negative	i paid the item , the delivery to get it , then the postage to send it back and what i have got ???
negative	nothing ... the customer_service stop replying to me after i told them that i sent the item back ...
negative	i even had to buy another item from another shop because i needed the heater ....
negative	i will never ever buy again from you
negative	how a " company " with such horrendous customer_service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .
negative	found a failed delivery card left in the morning - was in all morning with the door within earshot , no knock or sign of attempted delivery apart_from the failed delivery card .
negative	fair_enough , perhaps i ' d gone temporarily deaf .
negative	on trying to reschedule delivery / pick - up from depot with the reference_number on their card as advised , was told numerous_times by their website and their phone line that the reference_number was not recognised .
negative	bare in mind i tried this various different times throughtout the day on the day of failed delivery and the following_day just incase theyre system hadnt been updated yet .
negative	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest depot .
negative	but noone actually answers either of the phonelines for the depot .
negative	so , i contact office ( who i ordered from ) they eventually ( 0 working_days_later ) let me know that theyve asked the courier to redeliver , though with no eta
negative	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
negative	fair_enough .
negative	day 0 - no parcel
negative	day 0 - no parcel
negative	day 0 - thats today ..... still no parcel
negative	i just want my order !
negative	delivery or pick_up i dont care i just want it !!!!
negative	!
negative	also note : unlike so many other people on this site , i have actually once received an order from hdnl , however this was only after a failed delivery and i picked_up from my local_depot .
negative	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
negative	however when i went to collect my parcel , i did get it , but the norwich depot was an_absolute state , parcels piled / toppling everywhere looked horrendously disorganised ... i thought not alot of it at the time as they did actually find my parcel , but perhaps the shockingly kept depot was just scatching the surface on a truely catastrophically run sham of an organisation .
negative	steer_clear at all costs - poor communication with customers , poor organisation and poor service .
negative	they make me hate internet shopping and thats saying something because internet shopping is like crack to me !
negative	i ' ve had the unfortunate experience of having several parcels come ( or not !)
negative	by yodel .
negative	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn ' t mine ( wasn ' t even in the same county ).
negative	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
negative	i called and called about that one , and despite multiple notes , i had to cancel the order with the company so that they could recall the parcel .
negative	there was another order with lots of chasing .
negative	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
negative	if i hadn ' t , i don ' t think he ' d have stopped .
negative	in short , they ' re the worst delivery company that i ' ve ever_experienced .
negative	waiting on a parcel that they ' re meant to deliver at the moment and honestly not expecting to see it anytime_soon .
negative	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
negative	had an_email an_hour after making the purchase to say they were out of stock and their delivery for them to be back in stock was 0 - 00 days away .
negative	however after 0 weeks i still had no sunglasses delivered to me .
negative	i had emailed and phoned a couple times .
negative	they responded to my emails quickly which was the only good thing .
negative	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
negative	paid for one month license expecting a good outcome to help me thrive in fifa coins , however the complete_opposite occurred , the told me programming errors had occurred upon several_occasions causing me to lose all of my fifa coins with no compensation because i didn ' t look at their facebook_page due to being in school .
negative	you will never get a reliable service from this company
negative	don ' t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
negative	the engineer arrived_promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
negative	he did not return on - site until 00 . 00 am , that is at_least 0 hours and 00_minutes later !
negative	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
negative	the actual job ( moving the door entry phone to the other room ) was done in under 00_minutes .
negative	i have been charged 000 gbp for a job that should have cost gbp 000 due to the time he disappeared off - site .
negative	i have flagged this with aspects customer_service last december but have yet to hear back from them after this initial reply :
negative	----- original message -----
negative	from : tina hxxxxxxxxxxx [ mailto : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ]
negative	sent : thursday , december 00 , 0000 0 : 00 pm
negative	to : hester @ xxxxxxxxx
negative	subject : fw : [ aspect - vm ] feedback
negative	dear hester ,
negative	firstly please_accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of aspect . co . uk that your experience was anything other than the highest_level of service we aim to deliver .
negative	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
negative	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
negative	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
negative	again i am sorry you feel so strongly about your aspect experience .
negative	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer_service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look_into the problem and get back to you .
negative	may we take this opportunity to wish you a very happy new year .
negative	kind_regards
negative	the aspect team .
negative	tina hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
negative	admin assistant
negative	....... a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
negative	i can understand that they would need to make the necessary checks with this engineer as to ascertain what would have taken him 0 hours , but their inability to keep me updated has made me doubt aspect ' s level of responsibility and clarity on what is chargeable to the customer .
negative	please beware .
negative	order not received , message to customer_service ignored .
negative	when telephoned to say order not received , told it was the post_office ' s responsibility now and they do not take_responsibility for lost parcels .
negative	no manager available to speak with me , refused to give managing_director ' s name .
negative	in short , do not buy from this company , or if you do then pay by credit_card to ensure you can get your money back if order isn ' t received because you ' ll get no help from them once they have your money .
negative	don ' t believe everything you read about companies being_able to supress bad_reviews .
negative	we have a company account and we don ' t have this happen - even if a review is completely unfair or fabricated by a competitor .
negative	here is our experience - a competitor reports our good reviews as ' false '.
negative	trustpilot comes along and removes them .
negative	we then have to contact customers to ask them would they mind emailing trustpilot to prove the reviews are real !
negative	do we have time for this ?
negative	no .
negative	do customers bother to write to trustpilot ?
negative	no , of course not .
negative	it ' s embarassing .
negative	meanwhile , our competior , in the same industry as us , has a perfect score .
negative	we know how busy they are and they do not complete enough orders to warrant thousands of 0 star reviews per day .
negative	look around the net at top_brands - they all have the odd one star_review .
negative	how can a company have a perfect profile on thousands of reviews ?
negative	this is the question i need trustpilot to answer .
negative	we are sick of being penalised by them while another company blatantly gets away with using a rep management company to write_reviews for them .
negative	alpharooms sux , i booked a hotel that was advertised with room facilities eg , air_conditioning , sea vew , cable tv and fridge .
negative	yes those facilities were there but had to pay extra for each facilies when we arrived .
negative	the transfer they arranged kept us waiting 0 hours at 0am in turkey at the airport .
negative	the customer_service is very poor and arrogant .
negative	first and last holiday with alpharooms .
negative	i purchased the longchapman handbag sets on wowcher roughly about a month_ago now and i still have not received my purchased items .
negative	not only did they take my money the company initially partnered with wowcher on the deal also took my money on delivery costs .
negative	it ' s been a week now since i ' ve contacted_wowcher and the initial company they done the deal with , and i have not received a reply from either of them .
negative	i am so disappointed and upset .
negative	i would rather have my money back then actually receive the products .
negative	i ' m so disappointed .
negative	i advice all those who i reading this to save your money and look for deals elsewhere
negative	how is it that they can take your money for a month and not delivery what you paid for ?
negative	absolutely poor customer_service !
negative	where is my money ????
negative	?
negative	what a pointless delivery company .
negative	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
negative	just spoke to oliver at customer_services who confirmed they do not provide sat navs as a company .
negative	well maybe they should .
negative	here ' s to a day taken off work for nothing .
negative	thanks guys .
negative	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
negative	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull
negative	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
negative	now i know why not , terrible customer_service ....
negative	attempted to buy deal , and was informed card was rejected and to re - check details , after doing so , card rejected again .
negative	checked with my bank , money taken twice by wowcher .
negative	once calling them , no help at all , just told my money has been ring fenced and somebody will contact me back tomorrow , after not recieving a call , try them again .
negative	" customer_service deal with this issue , but we can ' t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
negative	so funds taken , no product , so far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
negative	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can ' t speak to anyone ".
negative	that would be stealing , it ' s a joke !
negative	funniest thing is , the offer was a limit of 0 per customer , however i ' ve been charged twice ....... and have nothing to show for it , accept a lower balance on my account .
negative	terrible system , service and company !
negative	won ' t be using them ever again .
negative	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
negative	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
negative	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
negative	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left behind ... etc .
negative	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
negative	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
negative	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
negative	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
negative	... that they also try not to pay .
negative	in short , don ' t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
negative	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go elsewhere .
negative	traded my near perfect_condition samsung mobile phone online saying they will " honor the agreed price " then they decided to slash £_00 from the agreed price saying the phone has a big scratch on the screen .
negative	if i asked for my phone back they will probably send me a damaged one or purposely damaged the phone themselves .
negative	they didn ' t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).
negative	so please avoid using this company in store or online .
negative	i ' ve been with tmobile for years now and had several contracts .
negative	i was mugged last month and called the same night to inform them , block the phone and sim and ask for a new sim .
negative	made a complaint as the woman i spoke to was completely uncaring and blunt with me .
negative	so a month later no sim and can ' t get through on the phone because they won ' t speak to me without me telling them my last bill amount ( not payment , bill ).
negative	finally get through tonight and after being cut_off 0 times , i am told i never reported my phone lost or stolen , but they will send me a new sim as a good - will gesture !!
negative	and that i will have to pay the last month ' s bill because i didn ' t report the phone lost , i rang to cancel my contract ( with a year left ?).
negative	now taken it to the ombudsman because they won ' t do anything more .
negative	no apology , they just don ' t care .
negative	never been more angry with a company .
negative	i paid for this and it was just a bunch of links to other_websites .
negative	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
negative	the information on how to jailbreak the iphone is freely available on the internet from legitimate companies such as iphone dev team .
negative	customer_service was poor and there is misleading information on the website .
negative	i paid £_00 for an immediate unlock which ended_up taking about 0 weeks and only lasted until the next apple update when the exploit used was patched .
negative	i have used wowcher in the past and had no issues , however it seems when there is a hitch that they just don ' t get back to you .
negative	i ordered a blender on the 00th_august which went through the wowcher automatic sending page ( where they deal with the selling company on your behalf ), but have had no contact since .
negative	i really dont like the ' sit back and wait ' strategy as i have no_idea if it was ever sent or if the seller even received my order .
negative	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .
negative	i ' m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
negative	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
negative	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction site so i assumed that they were reliable .
negative	after browsing their website i found some items that i liked .
negative	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or £ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over $_00 .
negative	unfortunately as soon as you spend over $_00 or equivalent in gbp ( i am an english customer ) the website automatically takes away the option for the cheapest delivery , so the extra you pay for shipping , you do not save anything , it actually costs you more .
negative	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don ' t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
negative	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
negative	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
negative	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
negative	most of them were competitively_priced with the uk market as you would expect , one of the items was expensive though (£ 00 . 00 for some nail_varnishes ) so my total order was £_00 . 00 for five items .
negative	the shipping amount i paid was £_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
negative	in total i paid lightinthebox £_00 . 00 .
negative	the items were not sent through national post they were sent through a courier service , i assume because they were expedited through their 0 - 0 day shipping option ( but the cheaper shipping wasn ' t an option as my order was worth over $_00 ).
negative	this meant that the package was received and dealt_with by parcelforce and not delivered by royal_mail ( all of the items i ' ve purchased from china arrive through royal_mail .)
negative	my items were not delivered to me .
negative	i instead received a letter from parcelforce stating that i was required to pay £_00 before they release my package .
negative	£_00 as a handling_fee over £_00 in import_tax .
negative	as i had already waited over 0 weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
negative	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
negative	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
negative	the reason for this is because lightinthebox had written the value of shipping as 000 yuan which is over £_00 !
negative	which made my total order amount appear to be £_00 when it was £_00 . 00 as stated on my invoice .
negative	after a very lengthy phone call to parceforce i was told it was an issue for hmrc , cue another long phone call to hmrc where i was told i would have to go through the process of claiming my money back through them and a lot of agro .
negative	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
negative	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
negative	i thought purchasing from this website would be reliable and yes i have received my items but it has cost me over £_00 for items that are worth £_00 ( and that ' s being generous ) at uk value , i do feel completely ripped_off .
negative	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
negative	a complete nightmare experience , i will chalk it down to a learning curve and never again will i use this company or recommend anyone_else to it , nothing short of criminal .
negative	ordered an oven .
negative	paid extra for fitting .
negative	fitters didn ' t cut a ventilation hole and the oven overheated and burned the control_panel off .
negative	contacted currys many_times by email , letter , phone and in store and this was never resolved .
negative	don ' t trust these people .
negative	don ' t reward them with your business .
negative	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
negative	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn ' t either !
negative	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
negative	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
negative	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
negative	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
negative	i do not recommend to shop here at all !
negative	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
negative	absolute_disgrace !
negative	i booked a ticket from venice to athen ( 0 / 00 , 0000 ) on this monday ( 0 / 00 , 0000 ) and only 0 days_later , i found there is a hugde discount ( 00_% or more ) on this ticket from all website .
negative	they even not yet charge total payment from my credit_card and refuse to give some money back .
negative	that ' s 000 euro which could be a great deal for me .
negative	except my situation here , if you ' d like to find the cheapest tickets , don ' t come to ebookers .
negative	go to skyscanner for the cheapest tickets since ebookers have no price and no service .
negative	i ordered and xbox play and charge controller set on dec 0nd and i only recieved conformation that it was dispatched on the 00th_dec which i thing is rediculous service !
negative	and now their is no garauntee i will get the item by christmas and i am appauled by this !
negative	if its showing as in stock then why did it take from 0nd dec untill 00th to be dispached !
negative	i actually dont even believe that i will ever even recieve the item at all after_reading the dreadfull revievs on this place and i cant_believe i didnt order from somewher i trust !
negative	0 days_later and my order hasn ' t been picked or shipped .
negative	i tried to contact customer_service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
negative	they ' re closed on saturdays .
negative	awful experience and total_lack of customer_service .
negative	if somethings not in stock or there is a problem you should send a email or get in contact with the customer .
negative	i ' ve never waited this long to have a order picked or shipped , and i usually receive my products within 0 - 0 days from every other company i use .
negative	i will not use supplement_warehouse again !!!
negative	!
negative	just don ` t do it !!!
negative	if you don ` t have money for food - go and beg , if you don ` t have money for bills - let them cut of your services , if you don ` t have money for petrol - walk !!!
negative	but never ever borrow money from this thieves !!
negative	any of them !!!
negative	best analysts and lawyers in england already said that all of them should be banned straight_away by law .
negative	they are not there to help .
negative	they will ruin your life , your relationship , your credit history and all that over 000 quid !!!!
negative	.
negative	if you are late one day - you are totally screwed .
negative	borrow once and endless ring starts because when you repay all the money with interest you ` ll be short again ( cause of this huge interest ) and you will borrow again .
negative	i know peoples , their lives are ruined because they borrowed money from that thieves .
negative	don ` t believe in any positive_feedback .
negative	they pay their employees to post them .
negative	ps .
negative	never never never please .
negative	kingston upon thames branch is just crappiest shop in london .
negative	shame , lazy , rude , poor language staff , disgusting , dirty floor , coffee_machine which i never found to be in working order ... guess how can they afford it nowadays
negative	my business broadband is been even slower then a dial up connection . been trying to get hold of the xln broadband team for the past 0 hours .
negative	the phones just been ringing and then the line drops .
negative	you dont know when you ll be connected .
negative	i ve wasted 0 hours of my time on the phone waiting for someone to answer , listening to some music .
negative	the time i should be spending on improving my business .
negative	phoned my account management team .
negative	was glad to hear a human voice but i got told that they cant do anything and they will send an_email to the broadband support_team to contact me on my phone .
negative	i waited_till 0 pm for someone to phone me back but it never happened .
negative	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
negative	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
negative	wrong decision !!!
negative	they actually sold me something that they did not have available in their stock , then days after , they sent me an_email_saying that they had " ordered " it from their supplier and it should take maximum 0 weeks .
negative	never happened !
negative	their costumer_service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
negative	no one could locate where the sunglasses were .
negative	after a month of no decent update or answer i had enough and requested the cancellation of the order and my refund .
negative	it was about a week_ago and so far no sign of my money .
negative	i sent another email to the company ' s costumer_service asking when the refund will be provided and again , the unclear , non precise answers started .
negative	now , they claim that their system is down and their accountant department cannot deal with the refund right now but they will , asap .
negative	there is no telephone_number you can call , only one email address and that is it .
negative	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
negative	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
negative	i am so disgusted and upset about this situation that i decided i will deal with master card directly and hopefully get my money back from them .
negative	the only thing i have to say is avoid !!!!!
negative	the worst experience ever !!!!!
negative	!
negative	these_guys just win the prize as worst delivery firm ever !
negative	i have had about 0 deliveries from them ordering from various suppliers .
negative	none of them has been smooth .
negative	their people are rude , their call_centre staff useless , and there is absolutely no flexibility in delivery time .
negative	in the worst case they were to deliver a case of wine , that i never got and they never returned to the supplier .
negative	after contacting the supplier , it turned_out that citylink had also lost track of the shipment .
negative	i got my wine , delivered by another company , and the supplier dropped citylink as well .
negative	avoid , avoid , avoid .
negative	i left sky after a year of paying too much for substandard internet and customer_service .
negative	it was the best decision i ever made .
negative	both bt vision and virgin are so much_better , and even_though bt service isn ' t known for being great , it beats anything sky can offer .
negative	they clearly don ' t get the message though because i still get tons of offers in the post , so now they are killing the planet too .
negative	i purchased a pair of ray_ban wayfarer on 00 / 00 /_0000 and was really pleased when i received an_email the next_day saying that my purchase had been shipped .
negative	the sunglasses arrived in around 0 days which was fantastic !
negative	however , even_though the website is a . co . uk website , these sunglasses have been shipped to me from_hong_kong - which made me doubt my purchase straight_away .
negative	when i opened the package the sunglasses were in perfect_condition and came with authenticity etc but the lense size was smaller_than i had expected .
negative	at this point i wasn ' t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
negative	so i went abck on to the website to try and find a telephone_number to contact them on .
negative	no such luck .
negative	there is no contact number on the whole website !
negative	so i had to write an_email to thier customer_service email address and hope for the best .
negative	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
negative	now ..... 00 days after receiving this item and 00 emails later sent to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk and servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk i still do not have a returns merchandise number for my purchase ( en0000000000g ).
negative	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
negative	i honestly wish i had just bought these sunglasses from a highstreet retailer , and at_least i would know where they had come from , and would have a point of call for any_queries i might have regarding the purchase - for the sake of saving £_00 !
negative	i have never received such appaulingly low levels of customer_service , and i will not be purchasing from your website again , and certainly will not be recommending you to anybody .
negative	i don ' t usually_write online reviews about these sort of things but your lack of communication has made me realise that you seem to respond to complaints on trustpilot . co . uk and not via your customer_service email address .
negative	regards
negative	unhappy customer
negative	beware when changing to this company haven ' t had a bill for 0 months and they want to put my payments up think they bit off more_than they can chew
negative	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .
negative	communication from the guy running it was awful , never calls back and refused to give me a refund .
negative	i am_currently taking_legal_action to get my money back .
negative	honestly i have never written a bad review before but please for your own sake do not even attempt to buy from this cowboy outfit , the trolley is poor and their service is the worst i have ever come_across .
negative	brought begining of feb . after the second outing with the wheelchair the bracket buckled .
negative	after dragging their heels , - not recieving emails , unable to open pictures sent i was asked to return the chair at m y own_expense .
negative	i did this and they looked at the chair for faults .
negative	i recieved email back after prompting for information , bracket has been straighted i can have chair back but it will buckle agian as the joint is now weakerned .
negative	or for further cost they can repair it properly .
negative	who_wants a brand_new chair that needs fixing after max 0 hours of use and then will break agian ??.
negative	i asked for a refund .
negative	now its july and still have no refund and now they ignore emails and refuse to accept letters sent .
negative	i ' m in process of getting support from cab so i can take them to court .
negative	i had been very happy with the service from the splashbackpeople , quick to respond on email , even at weekends .
negative	the splash back did take a couple of weeks to arrive , but more trouble some was that it arrived damaged , a very small dimple in the metal .
negative	very annoying .
negative	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
negative	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around ..
negative	telling_me that a courier was picking it up soon and a replacement would be produced .
negative	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so far been unable to do this .
negative	in my opinion if you have no_problems with the goods from this company then they are probably ok , but if you experience any_problems then you may aswel set fire to your money .
negative	they treat me like a thief and at the end they lost !
negative	realy bad !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	avoid they only want your money !!
negative	!
negative	i heard talktalk was a decent company , so i went with them .
negative	they might be ok if you don ' t have any_issues with installation , but i did , and they handled it terribly .
negative	here is my story .
negative	i moved_into my new place and signed_up for broadband on january , 0000 .
negative	since i don ' t have a phone line installed , getting broadband with talktalk required a visit by an openbt ( or a name like that ) technician .
negative	first surprise : the next available appointment was in march !
negative	the excuse was that fixing damages from the recent floods had taken a lot of time of technicians , so i accepted it and waited those 0 months to get a visit .
negative	when the technician came , he was very nice and polite , but told me that he needed to call an underground technician because my line has been disconnected from the outside .
negative	so he did , and the underground technician came a week_later , very nice guy , and called me to explain that a 0rd technician needed to come because the final wiring needed to be done by someone_else .
negative	fine .
negative	but this is where it gets terrible for talk_talk .
negative	two days_later i receive an_email from talk_talk at 0am telling_me that i needed to contact them urgently within the next 00 days to book an_appointment with a new technician .
negative	however , that same day at 00am , i got an_email_saying my contract had been cancelled because i had not replied to them !
negative	nevermind i had already patiently_waited form 0 months to get broadband installed !
negative	i called customer_service , and the lady said they were sorry but there was nothing they could do about it , and this lady was just rude .
negative	then i asked to speak to the manager , nice guy , but the only thing he could offer me was 00 pounds off the next contract .
negative	so i said yes , and then i try to start the contract from scratch with some lady that had a very difficult to understand foreign accent , and she was so rude !
negative	hung_up on me twice , did not answer my questions .
negative	and that was it , i quit trying with talktalk .
negative	so after 0 months of waiting , a morning spent in my house waiting for the technician , a whole afternoon on the phone trying to get these people to acknowledge their mistake , and an irritable experience , i am done with talktalk forever and will never recommend it to anyone .
negative	oh , and now i am supposed to take time and effort to go to the post_office to return a modem that they shipped that was never used .
negative	they are still posting on their blog and social_media ?
negative	they are still ***** operating ??!
negative	!
negative	" livingdesign europ " is what showed up on bank_statement as the company if it helps .
negative	remember you are fully protected with " visa_debit " cards these days , not just credit_cards !
negative	!
negative	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife ' s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
negative	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won ' t see them alive !
negative	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
negative	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i ' m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
negative	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
negative	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid extra for the before 0pm delivery .
negative	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
negative	and cannot get through via phone .
negative	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
negative	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
negative	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
negative	after paying £_00 for next_day delivery and order it to my work address so i wouldn ' t have to miss a day of work , nothing shows up .
negative	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
negative	0st - that ' s a lie because i work at a garage and there ' s always people around who can call me .
negative	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
negative	and it makes me so upset that even after the e_- mail i tried to find a number to call someone from dpd to explain what happen , i couldn ' t find any number on their web_site .
negative	then again it ' s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
negative	waited over two_weeks for my order and when i opened it i found they had sent me the wrong thing .
negative	after talking with their hopeless staff they had agreed to collect the package and give me a refund however , after another week no on came to collect it .
negative	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
negative	the courier came and i thought that was the end but , after two_weeks no payments have been received .
negative	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
negative	budgetair appear to trade under various different guises .
negative	booked return flights london to koh samui , via bangkok on british_airways and connecting with bangkok airways .
negative	immediately after payment , realised there was a one - character mistake in my surname .
negative	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about £_000 -£_000 to correct .
negative	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
negative	i explained this to budgetair but still they said it would cost £_000 fee .
negative	pretty steep , considering the entire return_flight was only about £_000 !
negative	eventually i gave up with their call_centre in amsterdam , despite escalating my issue to a ' manager '.
negative	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
negative	i said i ' d rebook the flights again directly with british_airways and just take them to court ( citing unfair fees ) to get my money back off them .
negative	i left it at that , and a few_days_later ( after various token reductions in their fee demand ) miraculously they decided that they could make the change after all at no charge , albeit meaning both people travelling would be on separate bookings ( which was fine ).
negative	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
negative	i would have been happy to pay a reasonable fee for the change - it was my mistake after all .
negative	also , not entirely budgetair ' s fault , also they failed to mention that our bags would not be checked (' interlined ') all the way through to koh samui , meaning we ' d have to collect them at bangkok and check them back in .
negative	despite them sorting everything out , the fact that i had to basically bully / threaten them into it means i can ' t possibly award anything more_than 0 star .
negative	edit - i felt a bit harsh for originally awarding them one star and revised it up to two , but since they ' ve left a pretty useless ' response ' trying to justify their behaviour i ' m putting it back to one again .
negative	we booked car in london to travel to edinburgh .
negative	i booked it in my girlfriend ' s name .
negative	but since she doesn ' t have a credit_card , i used mine to do the online booking .
negative	we were asked to go to the hertz_desk there for pick_up .
negative	once we reached there , we were told that she has to present her own credit_card to pick_up the car otherwise she can ' t get any .
negative	her debit_card was rejected because it was maestro .
negative	since i was with her , showed my credit_card - but then i was forced to be registered as an additional driver - hence paying additional last_minute charges .
negative	moreover , if i was not there with her , she would have been stuck there at the airport with no option at all !
negative	at no point of time during the online booking process we were warned about bringing a credit_card in the driver ' s name .
negative	another problem we encountered was the penalty for congestion charges in london .
negative	we would come to expect that the given there are such charges in london , the company would warn us in_advance so that we can pay off these congestion charges within the same day and hence avoid the unreasonable 00 pound penalty with an additional 00 pound adim fee invoice being sent to us 00 days after our travel .
negative	in the end what began as a possibly low_cost option to travel ended_up being a big financial dent to us .
negative	this is extremely unreasonable and unacceptable
negative	-- update after august_0000 --
negative	we contacted the customer_service as advised by the company below .
negative	basically there was a passing the buck between the two companies ( autoeurope and hertz who actually were the company representing them at this location ) each telling that it was the other company ' s responsibility to inform us .
negative	after a few phone_calls back and forth_between these two companies , we gave up , taking the unfair and insanely high 000 gbp fine that we incurred as a lesson for us ( like we have a choice in this matter now ), that lesson being : we must avoid this company in the future .
negative	if we can ' t for some reason , be mentally prepared to face hidden_charges later .
negative	one note to everyone using autoeurope , or hertz :
negative	0 .
negative	please make_sure that the company from which you book your car online is the one physically present at the location to give your car .
negative	otherwise , expect being at the receiving end of any miscommunication between the two companies you end up dealing_with .
negative	0 .
negative	read all the local rules about special fines and charges - never ever ( i cannot stress this enough ) rely_on the car_rental company to watch your back or help you in anyway with regard to this .
negative	first time using the online delivery service and maybe my last , estimated 00 pounds online shopping receipt was 000_pounds , 00 quid of it was for 00 tubs ( they didn ' t deliver 00 tubs ) of ice_cream i didn ' t even order , called customer_services and was told they ' d call tomorrow ?
negative	y tomorrow ??
negative	y not sort it now ?
negative	then ill have to wait 0 days for money to return to my account ... come on sainsburys not good !!
negative	!
negative	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
negative	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
negative	but when i tweeted them again , they responded within ten_minutes ?
negative	lol .
negative	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
negative	i came home that night to a delivery card saying hermes attempted delivery but would return the day after .
negative	when the day after my order arrived i was fuming .
negative	after dealing_with their awful customer_service , i realised that them saying my refund was being_processed was a complete lie given my order was being delivered the same day i was supposedly getting my money back .
negative	i ' m beyond irritated by the way i was treated and will never use your site again , and will be telling friends and family to avoid also unless they wish to be treated with complete disrespect .
negative	and just to add , i didn ' t get petty over a five pound order , i spent over sixty pounds .
negative	i brought a car from trade centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0 weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0 weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong
negative	i had lasik intralase wavefront performed on both of my eyes in february_0000 and an enhancement , but lets call it a correction in october_0000 and have regretted that decision ever since .
negative	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
negative	every_single day i have to deal with my eyes stinging and feeling achy and tired .
negative	eye_drops have become part of my everyday life .
negative	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
negative	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
negative	nice bright summer days are no_longer enjoyable to me due to becoming light sensitive , i often find myself wearing sunglasses on a relatively dull day to help with the floaters and brightness sensitivity .
negative	my vision fluctuates constantly and although i am told i have 00 / 00 vision , this does not mean the same as perfect vision as i was led to believe pre_- lasik .
negative	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
negative	i truly believe that within 0 year i shall be back to wearing contact_lenses .
negative	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
negative	this procedure cost me a staggering £_0k , i may as well of thrown that money in a bin .
negative	having this surgery truly has affected my life immensely as i now suffer from high anxiety and often get depressed about my situation .
negative	anyone considering this procedure should really do their research as the side effects really can ruin your life .
negative	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it ' s really not worth the risk !
negative	if only i could turn back time i would walk out of that surgery room with my eyes unharmed !
negative	i was not pleased with my order at all ... the stickers . where too small there for we are not able to use for . buisness ....
negative	i am very upset and very unsatisfied with my order ...
negative	i have used wowcher twice .
negative	both_times the deals were misleading , listing things that weren ' t included in the price , and both experiences were disappointing .
negative	recently i contacted_wowcher three times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
negative	i have nothing good to say about wowcher , don ' t use them .
negative	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail message .
negative	the one person that sounded_like he knew what he was talking_about said it was a bad line ( i could hear him perfectly ), told me he ' d call me back , but never did .
negative	no games anymore , so cancelled my 0 year long subscription .
negative	business suicide .
negative	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
negative	i picked_up my puppy on the friday with no sign of puppy food from yourselves .
negative	as it was a double bank_holiday ( queens jubilee ) i accepted this and didn ' t think about it again until te following thursday .
negative	still no sign of my product .
negative	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn ' t paid for my product and this is why i hadn ' t yet received it .
negative	0 minutes later i provided my paypal payment confirmation details and was then told that there had been a mistake between paypal and yourselves but confirmed i had actually paid for the product and it would be dispatched the next_day as a priority .
negative	at which point it was then said that in future i needed to check my order statuses changed from received to processed , as though it was my responsibility to check your back office were doing their job correctly .
negative	i felt this was quite rude .
negative	further to this , one week_later i get a knock on the door from a neighbour who took ownership of my eventual delivery 0 days prior as i had been out at time of delivery but courier didn ' t leave a ' i missed you note ' so i we unaware of this .
negative	your prices are great but your system is flawed beyond function
negative	i have been using the asda grocery delivery service for the last_year as my local asda is miles_away and as i do monthly grocery_shopping , found it a convenient solution to long shopping excursions with limited time .
negative	despite my first delivery from asda being absolutely disastrous as the driver forgot to unload all the fresh good , the situation was eventually resolved through a refund and £ 0 evoucher for the inconvenience , i decided to give them another change .
negative	unfortunately this seems to have been a misguided notion as last_night i was called by the delivery driver 00_minutes before my delivery window would finish ( 00 : 00 ) to be told that the vehicle has broken down and as it is not store policy to redeliver , i will be receiving a refund after which i can place a new order .
negative	as a student with a small family , my finances are very limited and thus i purchase my monthly groceries to be sufficient for the month before paying all other bills .
negative	thus i don ' t have another £_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
negative	i do understand that vehicle breakdowns are beyond anybody ' s control , but am not understanding of the fact that asda does not rectify their failure by arranging for a re - delivery at the earliest convenience .
negative	to make_matters worse , when contacting the customer_service center this morning to discuss this matter , i was informed that it shouldn ' t take longer_than 0 days and after becoming rather adamant that i do still require the delivery or require the money to be refunded in a manner that i can receive it earlier , i was told that they would call the store to see whether they are ' willing ' to ' help me out ' after which they would contact me immediately to notify me of the decision .
negative	five hours_later i have still not received a call and called the customer_service team again to be told that they do not know what has been done about the earlier call or email that i sent and repeated the whole_process from 0 hours earlier .
negative	fortunately this assistant was a little more helpful as she called me within ten_minutes to inform me that she has spoken to a picking assistant that now needs to speak to his manager to find out whether they can once again attempt to ' accommodate ' me .
negative	two hours_later i have still not received a phone call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
negative	after this experience , i can only assume that my £ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
negative	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer_service !
negative	!
negative	was put off by the website , quite tricky to make a booking .
negative	unfortunately my order was not even placed with the carrier , and i am still_waiting for my refund !
negative	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
negative	one call .... to someone_else , more like !
negative	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story .... no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
negative	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
negative	i recently did a project on comparing on - line parcel companies and here are my findings ..
negative	the dodgy website should have been enough to scare me away , no parcel collection , no response to my emails , no telephone support , no support at all .
negative	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont be using again .
negative	absolutely discussing service .
negative	i was let_down less_than 00 before i flew , i had to try and arrange another luxury car for my business trip .
negative	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
negative	i had to ring them to confirm my booking at which point i was told it was not going to be possible , at what point were they going to let me know ?!!!!
negative	never again !
negative	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
negative	never answer the phone - didn ' t have the stock .
negative	poor .
negative	i spent an_hour trying to book flights through this site ; every time i got to payment after entering full details for 0 passengers , the site would fail .
negative	you couldn ' t even tell if you ' d paid or not , it was so frustrating .
negative	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot cheaper .
negative	don ' t use opodo , it ' s a waste of your time .
negative	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
negative	do not fall for the ever so nice website .
negative	took my money and that ' s it .
negative	criminals and scum .
negative	this company is part of an organisation that owns many bad carparking companies .
negative	including kkarparks ltd . more car_parking .
negative	airport_parking choices and comparemeetandgreet .
negative	do not use them under any circumstances as i promise you you ' ll be disappointed .
negative	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
negative	they have even gone to the trouble to cancel the email address that we were given for contacting them
negative	this company and any company associated to it is completely illegal and will either park your car in an unsafe place or they will steal your money .
negative	do not use .
negative	this is a complete and utter scam .
negative	they are not a real car_parking company and are not supported by any organisations that regulates car_parking .
negative	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
negative	they will not park your car in a secure place .
negative	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
negative	they ' ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
negative	absolutely_shocking .
negative	i am now pursuing them through my bank and most_likely will go through small_claims .

negative	and 0 00th_july 0 weeks after they recieved the phone ............. no when i got through to a advisor i was told the manager was in a meeting then that he was on the phone i advised i wasnt getting off the phone until i had spoke to the manager so to get him out of his " meeting " or off the phone call he was on within 0mins i was speaking to the manager he blamed the slow service on technical_difficulties so i pointed_out all the review sites and reviews from a year_ago with the same kind of service - to which he told me i should take these review sites with a pinch of salt i work for appliances_online which has brilliant reviews on trust pillot so i advised this was utter_rubbish - ive demanded the money be in my account today but apparently there are a million other people in this que ...... to which i have told this manager to go and speak to the account department and fast track my payment - he is apparently calling me back tonight at 0pm - i very much doubt he will but guess_what il be calling back tommorrow !!

negative	we have been for 0 year with this company .
negative	the whole year is bad_experience .
negative	when agreement between payment_sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
negative	after agreement was made - that ' s where all problems started : the agreed charge was triple ( they started to divide the agreed charge by a few different accounts and merchants and tried to explain that these are all different things which were extra charged - this was never explained .
negative	customer_service - horrible - they never call you back after agreement is made and you start paying .
negative	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
negative	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
negative	please have a look at [_external reference_]
negative	thank_you
negative	thank_you
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0 days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn ' t happen .)
negative	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
negative	awful
negative	well what can i say !!
negative	pretty_much the same as everyone_else !!
negative	ordered the bluebud 0inch tablet for a christmas_present , it has never arrived .
negative	i was issued a tracking code which when you use on royal_mails website says " this item cannot be tracked untill its delivered " so that helps !!
negative	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
negative	i have called bluebud 000s of times .
negative	always engaged .
negative	sent emails .
negative	never replied .
negative	have contacted_wowcher god_knows_how many_times .
negative	they also never reply go calls of emails .
negative	so frustrating .
negative	last_week i had an_email askin me to review wowchers service and the item .
negative	hahah .
negative	probably not the best idea when i haven ' t received it !
negative	funny enough .
negative	they didnt reply to that email within their 0 day time scale .
negative	called last_week for a refund .
negative	" oh " " i shall pass this to the refunds team as they need to see if you have a valid reason for a refund ".
negative	0 days they said .
negative	guess_what !!
negative	yes !
negative	it ' s been 0 already !
negative	please steer_well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
negative	i ' m not sure about a wow a day .
negative	i would say its about time they called it a day !
negative	!
negative	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
negative	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
negative	your time .
negative	your patience and frustration .
negative	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
negative	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
negative	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
negative	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
negative	everybody should pursue this route .
negative	i ' ve been without signal for over 0 weeks now .
negative	originally i thought nothing of it , because i figured any_issues would be solved fairly quickly .
negative	how wrong i was .
negative	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .
negative	i gave them it and they provided a vague response that said there was a fault with a mast and they were working to fix it .
negative	0 weeks down the line and many tweets asking for more information have received the same response .
negative	my signal finally came back last friday for about a day ... then a pigeon flew into the mast or something and i ' m left without signal again .
negative	i ' m not happy paying £_00 for this service , so i enquired_about reducing it for this month .
negative	i ended_up on the phone to and indian_call_centre , were the operator could understand me , and i couldn ' t understand him .
negative	so i gave up .
negative	i was then encouraged by three ' s official twitter page to file a complaint on their website .
negative	that was a week_ago and i ' ve heard_nothing from them .
negative	i ' ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i ' m more_than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it ' ll cost to be rid of them for good .
negative	disgraceful company .
negative	very stressful experience buying from viagogo .
negative	booked tickets for lionel richie for my mams birthday on 00 . 00 . 00 and concert is tomorrow 00 . 00 . 00 and have still not received tickets or any email confirmation that tickets are arriving which is the protcol that the website specifies is supposed to happen .
negative	contacted viagogo to no_avail as they blame sellers and only act as an agent .
negative	no further updates received and not kept in contact about tickets even_though when speaking to an advisor i was informed that they would look_into it and call me back .
negative	would not receommend to anyone .
negative	not a happy experience .
negative	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today ' s booking hasn ' t turned_up .
negative	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
negative	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
negative	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
negative	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
negative	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven ' t received 0 days_later .
negative	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
negative	awful company , don ' t use them .
negative	i ' ve bought tickets from your website for the europa league final , i need these before tuesday as i travel to amsterdam on that day and the seller is yet to have posted the tickets !!
negative	!
negative	the fact i have payed £_000_+ for 0 tickets and the seller cant be bothered to post them out totally_unacceptable

negative	my sister lives in new_zealand so i ordered some flowers for her_birthday on the 0th_feb , to be delivered on the 0th .
negative	i became slightly nervous on the 0th when i couldn ' t track the order online and my sister had not received any flowers .
negative	i submitted my first email to iflorist to find out where the flowers were , as the live_chat feature was offline .
negative	no response .
negative	on the morning of wednesday 00th i submitted another email to iflorist as again the live_chat feature was unavailable .
negative	still no response .
negative	on wednesday_afternoon , i received an_automated email to say that the order had been allocated and would be delivered on the 0th .
negative	isn ' t time travel a wonderful thing ?
negative	a week_later , no communications from iflorist and the flowers are left on the doorstep in the new_zealand sun .
negative	wilted and a week late , an excellent birthday_present .
negative	their product does not work well .
negative	the instructions they give you for their site are not even written for the software they provide you with
negative	they signed me up for an annual service and never tell you it is a two year contract .
negative	just read all the other reviews on them .
negative	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .
negative	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
negative	to add_insult to injury they have now charged me for the 0nd year , only 0 months in to the first year .
negative	they said they sent a letter which was a notice to charge my card 0 weeks_ago but this is not true .
negative	they are in breach of contract
negative	they would not talk to me on the phone - a lady_called lynne fletcher who is the renewals manager : tel : 00000000000 refused to speak to me , leaving her subordinate under her direction to inform me to fill in their online complaints form ( which is worrying that they would need one anyway !!!)
negative	on the complaints form i asked her to call me but she just replied_saying they were not in the wrong and just to email her if i was not happy .
negative	i have now approached hsbc to refund my transaction .
negative	if you have had similar problems , please report them at first to citizens_advice on + 00 ( 0 ) 000 000 0000 , it only take a few minutes and the more complaints they get , the more likely it is these_guys will stop ripping people off .
negative	we have been with fu for just over a year now , and twice in the past_year , we have not only been accused of not paying our bill , but on several_occasions have failed to even receive a bill .
negative	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn ' t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn ' t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn ' t paid it .
negative	we have now got another solicitors letter claiming that once again we have not paid them £_000 . 00 when in actual fact we have paid it and are in possession of receipts proving this , will be ringing them on monday and recording any calls we exchange .
negative	its an_absolute travesty and we are seriously considering switching providers .

negative	i have this escada rio perfume and it just finished and i have been looking for a good deal and i found it in cheapsmells . com .
negative	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
negative	so i thought why not give a try .
negative	i order an escada perfume from them .
negative	service was good and fast got the perfume within 0 - 0 days .
negative	but the product turned_out to be fake .
negative	i called the customer_service said i wanted to return the product , first they said they wont accept as i had opened the cellophane packaging and when i mentioned fake and its not similar to the one i have then they said ok send it with a letter stating the reason for you return .
negative	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
negative	hope they do as they say ..
negative	i placed one order with them .
negative	payment was taken ( receipt received ) but no order was logged on their website .
negative	when i contacted them to ask where it was i got a refund instead of the item ( moot point as i would ' ve disputed via_paypal ).
negative	i opted out of their mailing_list when i signed_up initially and couldn ' t remove myself from the mailing_list when i received their adverts , as it said i ' d already been removed !
negative	i can ' t even log_into the website to try and delete my account .
negative	they ' re blacklisted in my email now .
negative	it seemed like a great price when i ordered that item so i decided to give them a try .
negative	after the refund , however , i got it cheaper on amazon .
negative	item was more_expensive , hence_why i hadn ' t before but it turned_out that the postage was about £ 0 less and i actually received the item .
negative	first impression , appalling .
negative	never again .
negative	cancelled an order with simply_electronics on the 00th_october after_placing an order on the 00th_october and still no refund !
negative	£_000 they have belonging to me all they keep doing is changing the status of my refund , yesterday it was at refund completed today it says refund queuing on the gateway and will be with you soon !!!
negative	i just don ' t understand !
negative	its theft in my opinion , they shouldn ' t be allowed to trade at all .
negative	i have also contacted watch_dog to report them .
negative	looks_like i ' ve had the same experience as most on this site .
negative	i ' m taking_legal_action_against these scumbags
negative	flying out to a wedding on may 0rd and guess_what ... our flight was cancelled and opodo booked as another flight that was 0 hours_later !!
negative	we have to wait in paris for 0 hrs whereas we booked it specifically for only a 0 hour wait ... obviously we will miss the wedding !
negative	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer_service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
negative	!
negative	all i hear is their terrible hold music ... which i can describe as being even more painful than waiting and knowing my money is going down the drain .
negative	you suck opodo ... never using you ever again .

negative	i ' ve been for four days trying to get a proof of purchase from them and the idiots always send something wrong .
negative	the result is i can not make a claim to get my phone repaired .
negative	the customer_service is the worse thing ever !
negative	i paid a premier service for a shipment from us to uk and here are some interesting discoveries i have made with the tracking no .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days for the parcel to be delivered to uk by usps for a 0000 mile long journey .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days for the uk custom to clear it .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days and ticking for parcelforce to deliver custom notice with the depot 0 miles from my doorstep .
negative	they are also shameless enough to charge an 0 pound process fee for that .
negative	it is safely_say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
negative	the miracle of their survival is totally based on the unfair competition of using the royal_mail ’_s existing network and infrastructures which are not available to other very hardworking , organized and responsive services .
negative	they won ’ t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
negative	in short , they are shite !
negative	the reason_why people find this company useful is when they try to sort out the lowest_price this company usually pops up .
negative	however , they are cheap for a reason .
negative	they don ' t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don ' t get a hold of the goods they sell .
negative	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
negative	as you would imagine , buying process could become more complicated with extra parties involved .
negative	if crescentelectronic can ’ t acquire your order they will just send you a preformatted email telling you they don ’ t have that in stock leaving you wondering what about those stock numbers ?
negative	don ' t you never ever trust their stock numbers , they are all wrong and they want it that way so that you can prepay confidently .
negative	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
negative	if you are not a few quids short , do not buy from this company , especially you are buying for a production environment .
negative	they can get you fired .
negative	their rma process is problematic as well .
negative	i bought 0 wd re0 0tb enterprise class hard disks for a raid0 array built .
negative	with a very rare luck , 0 of them are dead on arrival .
negative	the rma went on well until the replacement disks arrived a few weeks_later .
negative	first of all , the disks are not sent by crescent electronic and are sent by another company - the actual supplier of the disks .
negative	second of all , the supplier company sent some overall 00 pounds cheaper caviar wd blue 0tb consumer class disks for replacements ( we will call this company the 0nd company for short ).
negative	correct me if i am wrong , people generally would expect to get a bmw 0 series back if they send in a bmw 0 series for replacements , wouldn ' t they ?
negative	well , i got lucky and i got a vauxhall astra back !
negative	i phoned the 0nd company trying to tell them how ridicilous is that and a young_girl in her 00s picked_up the phone telling_me “ those enterprise disks are out of stock so they decided to send me these ”.
negative	from the fair natural way she talks about it i decided not to argue with the people with the wrong logic to start with .
negative	it is not my responsibility to stop them from destroying themselves .
negative	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
negative	with countless emails , waiting and worrying for a month and a half i finally got my refund .
negative	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
negative	i felt that with this sort of experience a 0 star would be an overstatement , 0 star would be proper .
negative	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
negative	0000 00 00 update ,
negative	i revised the 0 star_rating to 0 star as crescentelectronic is trying to cover up my very honest review .
negative	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it ' s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around £_00 per_month including vat .... sounds great right ?
negative	errrrm no !
negative	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
negative	connection would stop , signal would fail and here ' s the catch , anytime i called customer_service i would spend maybe 00_minutes a time talking to people who honestly didn ' t care , couldn ' t help , asked me to reset my device then passed me on to someone_else .
negative	i ' ve been left flabbergasted at some of the lame excuses & responses i got from people who shouldn ' t work in customer support roles - they didn ' t have a clue !
negative	i ' m not sure what database or system they use but like other customers have said , nothing seems to be recorded so everyone i get passed to , i have to explain the whole situation again from start to finish ... how frustrating !!
negative	but on top of that , by the end of my phone call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
negative	pretty_much no one really cared !
negative	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other countries ... this is about a call_centre with staff who don ' t care , maybe don ' t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don ' t get feedback about their poor performance .
negative	however i can ' t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
negative	for this reason the senior members , directors , ceo ' s , owners should be ashamed of how you run your business and what you see as acceptable ... you may think you have a great product but just read all your poor reviews week after week .... surely you have some integrity , some part of you that says " hold up , something really is wrong here " ???
negative	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
negative	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
negative	just look at how many people have said that they will never use you again , or who want to cancel their contracts .... still you do nothing .
negative	i ' m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
negative	i ' m sure it won ' t be too long before you all come unstuck .... good luck with that !
negative	oh & to any other customer who is thinking about joining three for broadband or a dongle or even myfi ..... please don ' t !
negative	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
negative	oh & guess_what my new months data_allowance was meant to start today !
negative	0th of every month .... but you guessed it !
negative	yep , it doesn ' t work .... no surprises there .
negative	no one at three will care because i ' ve paid already !
negative	great business_model they have !
negative	absolute bunch of clowns !
negative	be_careful that the good reviews here may not be real .
negative	topcashback is indeed terrible .
negative	i set_up an account three months_ago and used it every time when i was doing the online shopping .
negative	most of the cashbacks were tracked and the last time i checked , it was about £ 00ish in total .
negative	three days ago , i tried to log in , it says " failed ".
negative	i felt really weird as it never happened before .
negative	i thought i made a typo , so i kept trying , still not working .
negative	then , i used the " forgot password " link , also failed .
negative	i ' ve done some search on google after that , just realised that many people had that problem as well .
negative	the account was probably deleted by topcashback .
negative	they do it all the time without any reasons and the account to be deleted may be randomly selected by their system .
negative	watch out if you are using it , better get it to pay you as fast as you can .
negative	as one day , you may become the one who gets the luck to be deleted and all the cashback you accumulated will be vanished or i would say , transferred to their " topcashback " accounts .
negative	i had a package arranged for this morning between 0 and 00 .
negative	i had the day off of work so waited in my front room for the hour , knowing that i would see the van turn_up .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	instead , i received an insulting text_message hours_later informing_me that the delivery had been rejected by the recipient .
negative	i phoned asos immediately to confirm the delivery address was correct , to which they confirmed correctly , and then passed me on to this abhorrent company .
negative	i spent 00_minutes speaking to automated_messages before trying my luck with a different team that i found on the website .
negative	the woman , mandy , seemed not to care and passed me through to the ' customer care ' team .
negative	care - ha !
negative	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
negative	i then found this website with many a 0 star_review on it .
negative	i saw that an_email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
negative	hours_later and the apparently ' always manned ' email address has sent no reply , despite me sending my consignment_number and contact telephone_number .
negative	i needed this parcel as i ' m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
negative	useless bunch of cowboys , avoid at all costs .
negative	and don ' t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an_email ' - i know for a fact you won ' t reply .
negative	the most unprofessional company it ' s ever been my displeasure to deal with .
negative	unprofessional shoe manager , discussing my husband and his discussion in front of other staff and other custmers , then preceeded to argue with me when i noticed .
negative	needless to say i have e mailed the ceo and will refrain from ever shopping there again .
negative	only requested an exchange for my sons hat which was faulty !
negative	!
negative	my complaint regarding vodafone
negative	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
negative	it simply would not charge .
negative	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0 months .
negative	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as “ charging_port not working ” and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
negative	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
negative	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
negative	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
negative	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
negative	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
negative	i agreed to this .
negative	off the phone went again .
negative	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
negative	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
negative	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0 weeks .
negative	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
negative	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
negative	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
negative	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
negative	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
negative	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
negative	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
negative	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
negative	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
negative	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
negative	this was the fourth time .
negative	the phone came back a week_later , working .
negative	i thought that was the end of it .
negative	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
negative	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
negative	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
negative	i accepted this .
negative	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
negative	the phone was reconnected .
negative	no one called .
negative	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
negative	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
negative	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same_thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
negative	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
negative	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
negative	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn ’ t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance department .
negative	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
negative	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
negative	he agreed .
negative	i received no text .
negative	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
negative	i woke_up this morning and my phone is not working again .
negative	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
negative	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
negative	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
negative	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .
negative	numerous_times my days out with my children has been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
negative	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
negative	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .

negative	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as “ charging_port not working ” and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
negative	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
negative	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
negative	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
negative	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
negative	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
negative	i agreed to this .
negative	off the phone went again .
negative	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
negative	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
negative	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0 weeks .
negative	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
negative	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
negative	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
negative	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
negative	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
negative	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
negative	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
negative	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
negative	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
negative	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
negative	this was the fourth time .
negative	the phone came back a week_later , working .
negative	i thought that was the end of it .
negative	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
negative	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
negative	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
negative	i accepted this .
negative	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
negative	the phone was reconnected .
negative	no one called .
negative	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
negative	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
negative	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same_thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
negative	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
negative	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
negative	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn ’ t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance department .
negative	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
negative	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
negative	he agreed .
negative	i received no text .
negative	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
negative	i woke_up this morning ( may 00th 0000 ) and my phone is not working again .
negative	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
negative	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
negative	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
negative	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .
negative	numerous_times my days out with my children has been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
negative	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
negative	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
negative	awaiting a response from you ,
negative	they delivered my recently ordered pc actually on time , i had no_complaints until the driver arrived at my door .
negative	he rang the doorbell i opened it to see him drop my " please handle carefully " pc box both upside_down and from waist height .
negative	when i commented on it , he simply grunted at me .
negative	i have showdogs and kennels , there is a huge sign on the gate asking people to close it .
negative	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
negative	a disgraceful representation of a company and i have a feeling from the reviews i ' ve seen below an all to regular view of this company .
negative	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
negative	when checking my tickets after i had paid for them , the booking summary stated it was same day return .
negative	the initial booking summary before i paid for them did not say this .
negative	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost £_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
negative	yet another company contributing to rip_off britain !
negative	the manager , sean , should be ashamed of him self .
negative	in the end i was able to use virgin_trains website , who also do not charge booking_fees and display booking summary information accurately before you pay .
negative	i have emailed redspottedhanky a complaint so i will update in due course .
negative	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn ' t need to give notice to leave .
negative	they then charged me a early termination_fee .
negative	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
negative	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
negative	i ' m now with tesco who have much cheaper packages and only english call_centres .
negative	t - mobile is now known as ee so avoid them and get a better deal with tesco , talk_talk or 0 .
negative	i am leaving o0 today .
negative	the service was , at one point , quite good , but has degraded to the point of being useless .
negative	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren ' t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i ' m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can ' t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
negative	i am now in the process of changing my network to a company who is serious and is not larking about , playing games and pretending to be a business .
negative	i have had no help and no explanations .
negative	my emails have gone_unanswered .
negative	i could have had a doctor ' s appointment this morning .
negative	i have a host of illnesses i need to sort but because o0 decided to be lazy and useless i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
negative	great .
negative	i rang and rang and i missed the window because my phone outright refused to connect the call .
negative	i am extremely angry .
negative	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i ' m saying , go_ahead .
negative	please , i would love to hear you try to defend yourselves .
negative	i could do with a laugh today .
negative	and if you decide that , after_reading this , you no_longer want me as a customer well ...
negative	i don ' t honestly care .
negative	i blew ten_pounds on a service that i can ' t even use .
negative	oh , and i warn you now that any reply , any kind of response from you will be made public .
negative	i will post it to every_single review site i can find .
negative	trustpilot , yelp , i ' ll post to facebook , i will make everybody i know aware of it .
negative	i promise .
negative	we were so badly let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
negative	we gave them deadlines and explained that if they could not meet them to just tell us as we had another supplier who could meet them , but we were assured there wouldn ' t be a problem .
negative	the samples we asked for by a set deadline were missed but we were again reassured the order in full would be ready for a press conference to be screened on live tv .
negative	only days sbefore the press conference they started the kit but still assured us it would be ready , they told us to come at closing time on the friday to collect it .
negative	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn ' t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
negative	when we discovered the following_morning that half the kit was missing an we rang them we were pretty_much just told that it wasn ' t their problem and that we set unrealistic deadlines .
negative	they are now accusing me of lying and collecting all the kit as their receipt says so yet i have emails going beyond collection date and answer phone messages explaining the rest of the kit is ready 0 days after the deadline .
negative	i have decided to take this to bbc_watchdog now something i had no_intention of doing until i was accused of lying .
negative	i see that this is not a one off either .
negative	very very dissapointed
negative	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0 days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
negative	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
negative	so all ok , so far yes .
negative	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
negative	oh joy i thought so i contacted customer_services who said somebody should ring me .
negative	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
negative	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn ' t been sent out for delivery ?
negative	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
negative	only answer was i can try for tomorrow but can ' t guarantee it another unpaid day i will have to take it is ridiculous .
negative	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn ' t honour the delivery ?
negative	no answer .
negative	i have to say this is not the first time this has happened to me and it appears that the collection of parcels are far more important than the actual delivery of them thus being if they run out of time on the day by collecting the parcels they just simply won ' t deliver them .
negative	if they can email you to start with to say when they are coming then why can they email to say " actually you have wasted a whole day at home waiting as we have more important things to do than come to your address and deliver your parcel the day we said we would " if i hadn ' t of contacted them they just not have turned_up a shocking way to provide a service .
negative	and i am very disappointed no contact , no apology nothing the chap gave me the complaints details whom i could contact then these promptly disappeared off the screen as soon as he ended the chat so the only way i can complain is on here .
negative	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
negative	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
negative	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0 days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
negative	?
negative	use this service last 0 year and my item got stolen .
negative	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary school , they did not fit as the arms were at different angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
negative	well i suppose it ' s workmanship for the money .
negative	there is no ability to talk with customer_service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
negative	i ordered a go pro camera with you for £_000 on 00rd august and promised delivery within 00 days .
negative	it has now been 00 working_days and i have no go pro and no response to my emails regarding this matter .
negative	i refuse to call an 0000 number from my mobile and i don ' t have access to a landline so i am relying on email communication which has not been forthcoming ,
negative	i ' m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
negative	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
negative	if i don ' t receive any contact from them by the end of this week , i will be contacting cab and escalating this further until the matter is resolved .
negative	i hate to say it but sainsburys is too over priced on the leading brand named items .
negative	even thier offers on the leading named items is still over priced compared to [ links removed ].
negative	i have stopped shopping there even_though sainsburys is right on my door_step , i perfer to walk a mile to [_link_removed_] as it means my shopping bill is alot cheeper .
negative	terrible hire company , did not provide a car , they took £_000 and no refund was provided .
negative	total scammers !
negative	now in the process of taking this company to court .
negative	if you try and call their customer_service line you will end up paying premium line rates at almost £ 0 . 00 a minute so they can make more money of your complaint .
negative	do not hire from this company you have been warned .
negative	i booked a roundtrip from london , heathow to san_francisco international ( sfo ) with them .
negative	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
negative	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .
negative	all is well i thought and proceeded to choose a seat . next morning i tried to print my boarding_pass only to find that i couldn ' t choose myself as passenger and the seat reverted back to unassigned . i went to the airport , went to the self check in - of course same story there . an agent helped_me , to no_avail . the check in agent told me she ' s sorry but for this booking i do not have priority in boarding so i needed to go to the gate and wait for an agent - i still did not have the seat i paid for . an agent finally arrived and i made a beeline for the queue - only to find out guess_what , i had a standby ticket .
negative	netflights or aa or both screwed up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
negative	had i not been the first in line i would have been stuck in sfo - the flight was indeed overbooked .
negative	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
negative	never ever again .
negative	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
negative	well no , e_- ticket number as well as the booking code they provided were of no use to me .
negative	inf act on viewtrip .
negative	com which netflights lead you to , my flight status reverted to ' not operating ' indicating that unbeknownst to me i had been relegated to standby on a ticket i paid for .
negative	purchased some items and was told by the website that i would be able to book a one hour delivery slot - next_day - with dpd .
negative	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
negative	after_reading the emails , it appeared that they would only arrange delivery after dispatch .
negative	so i waited , and late last_night i had an_email to say my goods would arrive tomorrow !
negative	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two days_later but never mind i ' ll just book a days annual_leave !
negative	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
negative	so i ' m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
negative	thanks viovet , what an_absolute con .
negative	i will not be using you again !
negative	i closed my scottish_power account over 0 months_ago due to moving out of rented accommodation .
negative	i gave accurate meter_readings on the day of moving out and issued them to sp who acknowledged receipt .
negative	i then received a final_bill online , based on estimated amounts .
negative	i contacted sp via_email to ask for a full_refund of my credit balance and to check that they had received my final meter_readings .
negative	after no response i emailed and called again to be told that this had been sent out to me in the post .
negative	it didn ' t arrive so i called again .
negative	and again .
negative	each time i was told something different .
negative	they said a ) it had been sent as a cheque b ) it had been sent via_bacs to my account c ) it would be sent via cheque / bacs within 00 working_days .
negative	i received an amount of £ 0 . 00 compensation into my account but no full_refund .
negative	i have had to call again twice this week to be told they will look_into it and call me back within 00 working_days .
negative	i just want my money back .
negative	it is almost_impossible to get through on the phones , i have been hung_up on twice , and each member of customer_service told me a different thing each time .
negative	i will never open an account with scottish_power again .
negative	avoid like the plague !
negative	edit_: scottish_power called me back around half an_hour after posting this review to say that they had resolved and refunded the credit on the account .
negative	i am almost certain that this is because i informed them that i had reported the incident to the energy ombudsman .
negative	apparently my credit refund hadn ' t been released because the electrical bill hadn ' t been generated for some unknown_reason .
negative	they couldn ' t tell me why .
negative	it is abismal that it took so long for someone to investigate and tell me this .
negative	i was offered £_00 compensation ( on top of the previous £ 0 . 00 ) for the inconvenience .
negative	for the amount of time i spent trying to resolve this i don ' t feel that this touches the surface of the compensation i deserve .
negative	still won ' t be going back to sp in the future .
negative	if you are reading this review do not purchase your insurance with this company .
negative	to start with , they took one week in order to confirm that i had an insurance with them ( i ´ ve been told that i had cancelled my direct_debit , which i did not ).
negative	after i ´ ve sent all of the paperwork requested , they requested a report from apple about the maintenance , which was done last_year .
negative	i had to request from apple 0 different formats of letter because it was not according with what they requested , or the letter was not headed , etc ... even the apple manager told me that they were wasting my time , as they never had such a problem .
negative	it took two more weeks in order to get my iphone delivered .
negative	my mobile was stolen on the 00th of may and delivered only on the 00th of april .
negative	i assume all of this reviews are fake as there ´_s no much description and they just say that it was " easy to purchase ".
negative	it ´_s cheap and you get what you pay , perhaps you should pay a bit more with your mobile provider and get you new mobile delivered within 00 hs .
negative	i called their telephone customer_service today to help find an item but received horrible customer_service !!
negative	:
negative	0 ) they stuck to their rote learnt bookish lines insisting i give them item number .
negative	there was absolutely no desire to budge or help or " waste time " on a customer wanting to spend the money on their company and buying the product .
negative	0 ) to begin with , he spent good long time asking me to confirm my address , my landline_number , my email address , my full name as though i was calling a bank and not a happy shopping place .
negative	0 ) when i said this is not so great customer_service , there was not a single word of apology just to make me feel better at_least ... it was a mere okay ... like im calling some royal highness where i should be sorry i wasted their time .
negative	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
negative	0 ) the quality isn ' t to die for - but would have been bearable if i was at_least treated like a customer they cared to retain .
negative	it ' s so sad to see when a company is suffering because their customer_service is amazingly horrible .
negative	i would rather spend double the money on a product that is given to me with precious customer_service
negative	had problems with orders missing items , had extremely rude and abusive emails ( just because i asked for orders to be changed and i returned one item ), poor packing that leads to damaged items .
negative	given them enough chances to make_amends and they have proven that they are not a reliable or professional business .
negative	buy your cards from [_external reference ], they have a fantastic customer_service , and deal with questions etc , in a friendly_manner and they send items out in boxes with fantastic packing .
negative	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
negative	in response to the reply below :
negative	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
negative	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
negative	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn ' t pay royal_mail .
negative	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
negative	why should i be banned for something out of my control ?!
negative	( rhetorical question ).
negative	you have proved yourself a liar and a complete fool .
negative	i have not lied once and have facts and proof to back up what i say .
negative	i must have spent over £ 0000 on your website and i ' m treated in a disgraceful manner .
negative	you should be ashamed .
negative	also what you said to the other person who gave you 0 star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
negative	that just shows that you ' re arrogant and self righteous .
negative	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .
negative	i hope people can see you for who you really are , but i hope more so that you see the error of your ways and change and have a good life .
negative	i also apologise for some of the things i said in the email , i was angered by the unfriendly and condescending email you sent me ( with the same tone as others you have sent before ) and i felt it was the last_straw .
negative	enough said , i wish you well and kind_regards .
negative	i booked the flight ticket through opodo and the flight company charged me already , however opodo charged me 00 pounds in the next_day with any explanation .
negative	it seems like a service charge for booking the ticket !!!
negative	00 pounds service fee ???
negative	just for booking ticket online ?
negative	isn ' t it ridiculous ???!!!
negative	moreover , they did not noticed me about the service charge when i was about to checkout for the ticket on their website !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
negative	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
negative	parcel sent to a wrong destination now it stuck in the custom can ' t move forward or go back .... now from 00th_december 00 these are the replies i receive when ever i ask ...
negative	...................................................................
negative	i am_currently awaiting some more information from the courier , unfortunately until i get this response i cannot advise any further .
negative	.............................................................................
negative	i am chasing this with ups xxxxxxx , and will revert to you as soon as i possibly can
negative	..............................................................................
negative	please_accept my apologies for the delay in my getting back to you .
negative	ups have advised that it is currently with customs , and have not yet responded to my escalation emails .
negative	................................................................................................
negative	as soon as i have any information i will let you know .
negative	.................................................................
negative	when you made the original booking , you were given a selection of couriers .
negative	on this occasion you selected ups , during the booking process , you agree that customs_charges may apply if a shipment is being sent outside the eu .
negative	customs_charges can include duties , taxes , brokerage fees and disbursement fees .
negative	all of these are beyond our control .
negative	we do recommend contacting customs before shipping to check any charges which may be payable .
negative	............................................................................
negative	don ' t you have any better reply other than as soon as ..... and since 00th_december no update or direction i have received ....
negative	transglobal depend on successful rate but are not prepared for a complex case which is the worst thing for a company ... a small issue can not be solved and it takes months ......
negative	this is the third time i ship with ups and getting the same trouble .
negative	imagine you are sending a parcel to london and ups delivered your parcel to scotland and then the ups broker gives you 0 options ( scotland and englan is u . k )
negative	( 0 ) it is an international parcel so you can either come to scotland pay documents hand over fees and clear the parcel yourself or
negative	( 0 ) pay a broker fees equivalent twice of monthly wage and we have no_idea of import and tax duty so wait but there is no time_frame as soon as we clear the parcel we will deliver it to you ...
negative	how would you feel ?
negative	remember this information is received after a week the parcel has arrived in transit not main destination and nor this information prior the booking , and when you complain you are told that we do not have any influence in custom or ups in your country so a receiver should contact ups local ...
negative	sending the parcel back to a sender you are told to pay more_than sending cost
negative	terrible for a parcel which cost less_than 00 pound to pay 00 x for only agency fee ....
negative	ebay will not care about seller why ?
negative	seller can not leave_feedback to their buyer ( to help other seller understand the buyers )
negative	buyers can change their mind and if you dispute if buyers win you will not get your listing fees even if the items were not faulty .
negative	fees are higher and i heard now ebay own gumtree so i better shop on amazon ..
negative	fees everywhere even if you decide to end the item without a bid earlier
negative	i have been a currys and pc_world customer in bradford and halifax for sometimes and this year alone i have spent more_than 0000 on electronics and electrics . i think the level of customer_service is very very poor , first you enter the shop and find no one to help , you can see staffs chatting at the rear area instead of meeting the customers , i wanted to buy a cheap tablet now is over a week i have to go and return no one seems to care , you can not try the product as products position are very very poor , tablets not charged , fingerprints , different products are on display and different price , customer_service have no products knowledge , you ask to try and you are told is not possible , last time the staff served me and got discount he took the voucher and threw it on the ground for me not to see i did not bother as it was discount for spending over 000 - 000 and had no plan to spend again for the service transaction i received , poor poor poor ...... very disgusting .
negative	if you want a company that :
negative	0 . lies ,
negative	0 . gives you wrong information ,
negative	0 . blames everyone_else when things go_wrong ,
negative	0 . are unhelpful ,
negative	0 . have terrible customer_service ,
negative	0 . try to rip you off ,
negative	0 . refuse to help you ,
negative	0 . hang_up on you
negative	0 . leave you waiting on hold for ages
negative	00 . sends you on wild goose chases
negative	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
negative	!
negative	i was unfortunate enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
negative	trying to get a refund from these is like trying to get water out of a stone , only the stone would probably be a lot more helpful and courteous .
negative	their customer_service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
negative	their staff are rude , arrogant , unhelpful , send you on wild goose chases , hang_up on you , refuse to help you out , speak down at you , insist they ' re correct even when all the facts say other wise , ignore your requests and generally don ' t appear to be able to understand basic english .
negative	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
negative	total_con !
negative	i moved_into my new build property on the 00th_october_0000 .
negative	it is now the 00nd march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
negative	i have rung them up & provided them with meter_readings on a reasonably regular_basis ( in spite of having smart meters ).
negative	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over £_000 from my account without any notice or production of a bill .
negative	this was subsequently refunded to my account in january_0000 with no acknowledgement of the financial difficulties this had caused me .
negative	i have requested details of my tariff and have calculated what i believe i owe them so if i can do this then why cant they ??
negative	?
negative	it also seems impossible for them to acknowledge any written communication & the ' contact us ' on the web_site is very hit & miss , on one occassion it took over 0 months to even get an_automated acknowledgement .
negative	overall a very poor experience for a first time home owner & i definitely wouldnt recommend using first_utility .
negative	i am now looking at transferring my services elsewhere .
negative	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .
negative	i have also written twice and not received a reply .
negative	rubbish company .
negative	during the last few month i have had the most terrible experience with this platform ' s service .
negative	i had posted a review for a company i ' ve been using for quite some time .
negative	without any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
negative	when i tried to find out what was wrong i was asked to provide information and documentations containing personal information .
negative	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
negative	during this time i was unable to even log_into my account .
negative	i got banned for no reason and they had basically accused me of posting a lie !
negative	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
negative	imagine my surprise when i found out i was not the only one going through all this .
negative	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
negative	who do they think they are ?
negative	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
negative	my initial review was deleted .
negative	i would not be surprised if this one gets deleted , too .
negative	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
negative	and your account is to follow .
negative	edit_:
negative	i just found out that there were other people who went through the same issues but their reviews did not get deleted and are still on the site .
negative	i would very much like to receive an explanation .
negative	why was my review deleted ?
negative	what exactly didn ' t trustpilot like about it ?
negative	was it against some rules ?
negative	what was the reason ?
negative	i believe i deserve an explanation .
negative	two bad_experiences , latest one , order was accepted on site , got a call 00mins later and was told that the order hadn ' t got through and it was going to take 0 - 0 days to refund it .
negative	i won ' t be using them again now .
negative	as a specialist shop in electronics you would think that they would have a wide_selection of solder , not so .
negative	they don ' t even have something as basic as simple as 00 / 00 0 . 00mm solder .
negative	the 0mm solder takes far too long to melt , and the tips for the solder irons are poor , they should at_least be chisel , not point .
negative	again i checked they said it is possiblem , i have ordered again for iphone softbank japan to unlock - they cancelled my order more then month still not paid my money .... no reply no response over phone ..
negative	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
negative	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
negative	the second order contained a corsair ax000 professional series gold 000 and another cooler master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
negative	when these items were ordered i was told there were plenty in stock , however once the order was placed 0 days_later i was informed that the cpu coolers were not in stock .
negative	so as i needed these parts in a timely_fashion i was forced to cancel the coolers as they would not send the rest of the order .
negative	to this effect i created two tickets each quoting the order numbers and requesting the aforementioned items be cancelled .
negative	the first cooler was cancelled quickly and the windows 0 copy dispatched for which i am pleased .
negative	however the second cooler was not cancelled and i received a rudely written reply to my ticket implying that i do not read my e_- mails .
negative	when i proved that i had asked for both to be cancelled i was just told the system had not updated which i found to be odd as i requested cancellation at the same time .
negative	i will be placing the second order with amazon and have no desire to use ccl again and will strongly_recommend against anyone i know using them .
negative	ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 no reply .
negative	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
negative	never had such a disappointing_experience as a customer .
negative	they took money for my item nearly 00 days ago now .
negative	they ignored several complaint emails .
negative	they continue to send group emails about there is admin issues and your item is on its way but its not .
negative	then today another email including a form i had already filled out 00 - 00 days ago .
negative	i regret to say following this experience i will be avoiding this company from hereon as they clearly do not care about the individuals involved .
negative	groupon provides a far more efficient and satisfactory experience and when that fails for what ever reason , they are more genuinely concerned_about the individuals and give small_amounts of complimentary compensation unlike wowcher .
negative	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
negative	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more_than 00 quid coud this be the reason ?
negative	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
negative	!
negative	i bought 00 " human hair , it was so thin i had to go online to find more as it just wasn ' t enough for a full head .
negative	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
negative	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
negative	customer_service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different stories and never give you an update .
negative	a site whereby , even if you join , you still cannot contact anyone because the intended recipicent has to also be a member .
negative	nowhere is this clearly_stated !
negative	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
negative	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
negative	after three days of membership , only getting views , which is caused by others merely scrolling through the two search features , ' who ' s online ' and ' search ', as well as seeing that you still need to buy ' coins ' to unlock other features , both meaning you never truly know who is interested , i gave up on this useless site .
negative	i wrote to complain_about the misleading claims and suggest they change it as it would benefit everyone , no reply !
negative	£_00 wasted !
negative	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
negative	numerous short positive_reviews all taken within the last few_days , all by members posting their first and only review ??
negative	this is the true specsavers experience :
negative	00 / 00 / 00 whilst looking , the staff were helpful in selection , yet during the finalisation , no mention that i couldn ' t return them due to disliked or refferal to a larger branch despite knowing i wasn ' t happy with the second pair !
negative	bought two_pairs - £_000
negative	rimless - didn ' t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn ' t -- exchanged for a second pair
negative	timberland - settled for them -- it had two right arms , one bent to be the left one -- could not do a trade - in or exchange -- i gave it a try , but it proved to be uncomfortable -- the staff in the other croydon branch , north end , said they still won ' t exchange -- had to do what they didn ' t even try : manipulated them to fit better .
negative	' we believe that only 000_% happy is really happy "?
negative	?
negative	-- just a belief , as they didn ' t care that twice i walked out their stores stuck with glasses that i could not possibly have assessed properly in the short time with them prior to purchase ; didn ' t truly want before and certainly didn ' t after .
negative	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - £_00 . 00 )
negative	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 no reply from email i sent on the same day i wrote initial review , wrote to them via fb .
negative	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
negative	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 - from two stars to one , £_000 spend yet still no reply in regards to the complaint !
negative	as with too many companies they care more about the image of good customer_service rather_than the implementation of it !
negative	just to add to everyone_else ' s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
negative	i booked internal_flights brazil with tam airlines using opodo , but had to make changes .
negative	i called up and they said the terms and conditions state it is not refundable or changeable .
negative	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
negative	i was shocked to find out when we arrived at the airport in rio that the flight we had booked did exist and our booking never happened .
negative	we missed the game in salvador because all other flights were fully booked .
negative	tam were extremely_helpful and changed the original flights to the dates we needed at no charge .
negative	even more reason to book directly with airlines .
negative	i have learnt my lesson and will never use opodo again .
negative	i ' m too one of those customers who did not look up reviews of the company before buying from them .
negative	after failing to deliver my monitor within 00 working_days they replied to my enquiry that it will 0 - 0 working_days delayed , which i agreed .
negative	they came back to me the next week admitting they don ' t have the item in stock any more .
negative	at this point i asked for my money back .
negative	after a couple of days i contacted them again saying i haven ' t received the refund , adding that i placed the order nearly a month_ago , haven ' t received anything in return , and i think it is fair to ask to complete the refund as soon as possible .
negative	their reply was that they have 00 days to do the refund .
negative	they are basically holding customer ' s money back as long as they can .
negative	i just want to let you people know , that this is the easiest method to take your money out of your hands and i highly not recommend to unlock your iphones through this method ..
negative	i can not believe what i have just experienced .
negative	absolute disgusting service .
negative	i am almost 0 months pregnant , we received a delivery of some very heavy items .
negative	i asked if driver could just pop the items inside for me as he was simply dumping them outside .
negative	the driver proclaimed he is ' self - employed and has no obligation to bring the items inside for me '.
negative	when i pointed_out that i was clearly not in a position to be lifting these items , his response was " yeah , i see your problem , but i don ' t have to take anything inside for you ''.
negative	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it ' s not something i have to do ".
negative	at which point he walked back to his_van and drove off .
negative	leaving me on the doorstep with 0 heavy items and nobody to help me .
negative	still in shock about it .
negative	absolutely apalled .
negative	shame i had to even give 0 star .
negative	would have preferred none .
negative	i have a fiesta which i stupidly decided that kwikfit will be a great place to do a full service on .
negative	unknown to me they are only a bunch of unprofessional and inexperienced company .
negative	i turned a blind eyes to other reviews and decided to go along with them .
negative	few_days after the service , my car which drives fine before started misfiring and jerking on the road .
negative	i took it back and they wanted another £_000 plus to fix .
negative	they were very rude and unhelpful except for one guy that was nice at_least .
negative	i then tried a local_garage and they found that they have broken one of my ht leads which connects to the spark plug but still forced it in place .
negative	this is my first and last time having anything done at kwikfit .
negative	for your own peace of mind and to avoid wastage of money , go somewhere_else .
negative	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area ..... see you court .
negative	i ' m an long time user of paypal .
negative	i have a small business and have hit problem after problem after problem after problem after poor customer_service ( no customer_service )
negative	i was a business stream customer after a couple of months fighting to get the correct bill i decided just to change supplier .
negative	had to go to a lawyer for business stream to even respond ( which they did the next_day when they saw the lawyers letter ).
negative	two years later and they still send me crap through my letter_box .
negative	they are disgusting big business bullies .
negative	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
negative	truly truly_awful company .
negative	from the director of a small wood working business .
negative	we placed an order last_week and ordered a meal from one of the express delivery guarantee takeaways , unfortunately , the meal didn ' t arrive within the 00_minutes guarantee but actually arrived in 00 - 00_minutes , while there was a missing item and the food and sauces were spilled throughout the bag .
negative	after_speaking to someone about this via livechat , they informed me without giving a reason that we did not qualify for the express delivery and it was only 0 minutes late , i don ' t know how bad his maths is but i did get an inclination that he can ' t add up , as it was 00 - 00_minutes late .
negative	he also tried to tell me that the missing item wasn ' t supposed to be delivered , yet another member of staff looked at the order and confirmed we were supposed to receive the missing item as it was clear that it was part of the set menu .
negative	the food was also spilled all over the bag , yet he told me that he doesn ' t care .
negative	when i did speak to another member of staff , they said the customer_service rep didn ' t follow protocol and i should escalate this to management and they would handle the situation .
negative	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has been taken against me for complaining .
negative	i don ' t know about you but i find this incredibly_rude and i can ' t believe that a good customer has been banned as a result .
negative	they also told me that other people are being banned for the same reasons , so be_careful when using hungry_house and if i could rate this review below 0 star , i genuinely would .
negative	people need to stop using myhermes ... fact
negative	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
negative	the first parcel we had delivered was left in our half full wheelie bin , the last time ( tonight ) they delivered at 0 . 00pm !
negative	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .
negative	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
negative	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
negative	full payment taken and email confirmation sent to me .
negative	i have contacted the company but still_awaiting reply and there is no telephone_number for me to call .
negative	very very dissapoonted
negative	a terrible company to choose ,
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad ' s gift for his_birthday in it .
negative	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
negative	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
negative	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
negative	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
negative	take your money and do not deliver .
negative	these people are like criminals !
negative	nasty and horrible people .
negative	never again , a big joke !
negative	we thought we were getting a really good deal going with this company and my sister organised everything and we paid the money for the hen_night .
negative	my sister then started having problems with the company saying that they couldn ' t get us all in the same hotel and that we would be at_least 00mins walk apart_from each other , they also said that the people staying in the hotel had to pay extra money .
negative	my sister constantly tried to get hold of management at the company and was told that the two members in charge were not available and they would return her call .
negative	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
negative	she called them back at_least 0 - 0 times but the person she needed to speak to was apparently busy or in and out of meetings all the time .
negative	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn ' t give her any money back .
negative	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone_else the money back .
negative	we were worried that something else would go_wrong on the actual day .
negative	i would avoid this company at all costs the customer_service is shocking and all they are interested in is taking your money .
negative	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
negative	these goods were worth well over £_00 .
negative	i was working on my laptop during the day which is next to the window which looks out of my the front of my house .
negative	sure enough a yodel van came up and the man got out from the drivers seat and got into the back of the van and was in there for about 0mins .
negative	the driver then got back in the drivers seat and drove off .
negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail stating that they had delivered my parcel which they clearly hadn ' t because i had seen them drive off with no attempt at delivering the package .
negative	it ' s now been over 0 week and yodel are still apparently investigating at to where my parcel is .
negative	this isn ' t the first time this has happened and it ' s very frustrating to say the least .
negative	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
negative	i joined and i bought aa insurance .
negative	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
negative	its just a waste of time it seems !!
negative	!
negative	talktalk are worst company i have ever_encountered .
negative	if you can even call them a that .. no structure .
negative	the automated service is far from helpful .
negative	please visit our site to perform a health check on your broadband_connection ?
negative	astonishing !
negative	your asking the customer to do your job for you .
negative	when you finally manage to figure_out a way to manipulate the automated_system and get you talking to someone ( as if my broadband and tv connection failing didn ' t warrent some sort of tech team assistance !)
negative	its just as totally dissapointing as the obismal auto service you get for the first 00_minutes of the call .
negative	the facts :-
negative	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
negative	0 of which i got told promised by ' bhal ' if that ' s how you spell his name - that i would get a call back from a manager within the next 00_hours ... that was 00_hours ago and i ' m still_waiting !
negative	bit of advice - invest in some proper training for your staff !
negative	i ...
negative	myself ... had to talk your agent through simple first line checks after him asking me to walk back and forth to reboot my router and tv box for 00_minutes .
negative	00_minutes !
negative	if it doesn ' t work the first time ... its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
negative	both other times i called i got put on hold whilst an agent asked for assistance from ' another agent ' after 00_minutes with no communication i gave up all hope and hung_up .
negative	look , i am not asking for the impossible .
negative	simply for my tv to work - for me to get the service i have been paying for and not receiving for the past 0 months !
negative	!
negative	i ' m sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look_into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
negative	stay well clear of this company !
negative	i purchased several boxes of universal hi - protein_bars .
negative	they screwed up the order i made and charged me but their system didn ' t register a quantity with the order and i was missing items on the invoice that i was charged for .
negative	i wait 0 days for the items to ship before making a call .
negative	the woman on the phone said their warehouse had a power outage and that they ' d be able to send things out monday ( 0 days_later ).
negative	now a whole week after that i finally received my order .
negative	the packaging box looked normal .
negative	all the protein_bars were in damp boxes .
negative	i figured they were all individually wrapped so they were probably okay .
negative	i open one up and what normally is a chocolate shell was almost like fuzzy chalk .
negative	i ' ve seen this happen on the corners of the bars before but this thing was ravaged .
negative	i ' m temped to eat it but i also don ' t want to die .
negative	i ' m calling them not but this is ridiculous !!!
negative	!
negative	i ' ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
negative	i tried to purchase an iphone on line from them coming from their store in derby .
negative	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
negative	i called the store and they politely apologised and said if i sent the phone back they ' d refund me .
negative	a week_later another phone arrived .
negative	this one was faulty as the speakers didn ' t work .
negative	i called them to explain the fault and they told me to send the phone back .
negative	which i did and called to check they ' d received it and make_sure they knew what the fault was .
negative	the next_day i called to find out what they were going to do about it and they informed me they ' d tested the phone , it was fine and they had posted it back to me .
negative	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
negative	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn ' t told what the fault was so didn ' t test the sound .
negative	he then informed me that they could pay for it to be fixed but could not refund me since it had been more_than two_weeks since my first transaction and i was not within my rights to receive a refund anymore .
negative	i don ' t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
negative	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0 weeks and they still_haven ' t produced the item i have now more_than paid for ?
negative	don ' t ever purchase anything from this shop and expect them to get it right first time , if at all .
negative	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0 weeks of constant emails to get refunded and that wasn ' t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that ' s it .......
negative	they don ' t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
negative	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
negative	even_though i am covered i bet again i don ' t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
negative	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
negative	ordered 0 tickets to see gary barlow at the royal_albert hall 0 weeks in_advance .. at the cost of £_000 . 00 for standing tickets , train and hotel are booked at the cost of over £_000 .
negative	its now the night before the concert and i still_havent got my tickets .
negative	after nearly 00 phone_calls they still carnt tell me weather or not to travel to london as it may be a wast of time .
negative	they said they may have to refund me .
negative	i even spoke to them before the weekend but they said rest_assured they will arrive in time .
negative	a complet joke .
negative	this is suposed to be a birthday_present for my wife !!!
negative	!
negative	don ' t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer_service .
negative	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
negative	it took me 0 weeks and 0 emails to the ceo to get my money back .
negative	they also tried to charge me 00_% for cancelling but i had mithered them for written confirmation of my cancellation so they didn ' t have a leg to stand on .
negative	that ' s another point - you deal with the customer_services on the phone but they don ' t send confirmation emails so it ' s your word_against theirs .
negative	a very dangerous game when £ 000s are at stake .
negative	each time i had to email the conversation to them via their website form so that i could get written confirmation .
negative	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn ' t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it ' s arrival .
negative	if their customer_service is this bad , i don ' t even want to imagine the final product !
negative	having worked for a company for over 0 years who use citylink and send many parcels through them daily - i have never had so many incidents causing so much stress and problems from one company .
negative	here are but 0 of those incidents that have happened in the past 00_hours :
negative	0 .
negative	my customer calls me to say the goods havent arrived ( despite us doing our job and the courier failing to deliver - obviously the customer will balme us as we are their contact ).
negative	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
negative	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct address .
negative	i ask what the new address is which he tells_me and it is exactly the same as the original address .
negative	after i ask to know why this package has been delayed when the " new " address has no changes from the original , i was greeted with a lot of stuttering and dithering before being put on hold for 00_minutes for him to " investigate ".
negative	he then had no new information to give me so i expect he probably went for a cup of tea and found out nothing .
negative	the package was finally delivered to the " new address " 0 days late and missed the customers event the goods were needed for so rendered useless so a refund was made from our company .
negative	0 .
negative	a top priority client needed goods for another event - he calls to say they havent arrived .
negative	i call citylink and the person i speak to says they were sent to the wrong depot ( for no apparent_reason other than stupidity ).
negative	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered useless ).
negative	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
negative	she said she would find out and call me back .
negative	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us £_000 . 00 !!!!!
negative	so i said , so let me get this straight , we have paid to have these good delivered this morning , someone at your moronic operation has sent them to the wrong depot meaning the parcel is late and you ' re saying we need to pay for this ???
negative	yes she says .
negative	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
negative	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct address .
negative	this is absolutely not possible as we are a huge manufacturing company distributing hundreds of parcels daily so to have someone check this manually would take hours of time which we cannot_afford to have someone doing .
negative	i have been imploring to my superiors to stop using citylink and am hoping that finally we will be looking to use an_alternative courier .
negative	you would think that with the amount of money we spend with them , we would be treated as a priority and they would do their best to keep us however when i expressed my dissatisfaction and the fact we will be looking to leave , the response i got from the manager there was " ok ".
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !
negative	!
negative	do not use this company - chocolate teapot - useless !!!
negative	!
negative	i can ' t be bothered to waste further time on this company by writing a lengthy review so i will just say this : horrendous !
negative	approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , i place an order for about £_000 worth of goods that never arrived .
negative	despite numerous phone_calls , emails and threats of legal_action , no refund was ever given .
negative	after taking_legal_advice on the situation , was advised that small_claims court was an option but it would be expensive and a waste of my time .
negative	i don ' t usually bother writing reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
negative	i am aware that this happened some time ago , but having read some of the other reviews , it appears that this company is still at it ' s old tricks .
negative	i would consider this ... you may well receive you order , but how will you feel if you don ' t and fail to get you money back ?
negative	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
negative	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
negative	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
negative	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
negative	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
negative	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
negative	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
negative	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
negative	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
negative	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing around to sort this on valentines morning .
negative	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
negative	delivery , failure to turn_up and damage to our house
negative	our delivery date was arranged and we had received telephone confirmation in the morning .
negative	00_minutes before the end the day we received a call saying that the furniture would not be delivered .
negative	the result to me was a loss of days pay from work for no furniture with the inconvenience of having to take more annual_leave to rearrange a second delivery date .
negative	0nd delivery date 0 pieces of faulty and damaged furniture arrived along with the wrong mattress delivered - a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for !
negative	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
negative	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
negative	the staff had to unpack the wardrobe and because of this removal of the packaging i had to sign a disclaimer saying that any damage to my house would be my fault .
negative	in the process we received damage to our wooden door and 0 chunks of wood were taken out of our wooden banister .
negative	if oak_furniture land had packaged the items so they could be carried i would not have had to sign a disclaimer and the damage would not have occurred because the cardboard protection .
negative	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
negative	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
negative	after complaining they delivered very late in the evening and this resulted_in another day of lost wages .
negative	faulty , damaged furniture , wrong products
negative	0 ) wardrobe
negative	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality_control for the following reasons ;
negative	approximately a 00 cm height crack with a very wide gap , running from the base upwards .
negative	another large crack 00 cm running from the base upwards .
negative	magnetic strips designed to keep the door closed were unscrewed and loose
negative	multiple holes on top where the carpenter had forgotten to fill the holes .
negative	the worst part is the removal men could see the cracks and faults but kept quiet and hoped i would not notice until after they had gone .
negative	the second wardrobe replacement had one side of the front_door which showed panels and in particular a very dark panel , whilst the right hand door did not have the panel feature , the result is we have two odd doors which do not match .
negative	0 ) mirror - large cracks in two places
negative	0 ) white filler very visible at regular intervals on oak bed_frame , a large chunk of wood missing and a split .
negative	an engineer was sent to repair several pieces of furniture , the result another day off lost pay through having to take time off work !
negative	0 ) scratches on a chest of draws - repaired by an engineer .
negative	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer_service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .
negative	the worst part was that they tore off the label to hope that we would not be able to recognise that it was the wrong one and a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for .
negative	the furniture is of poor quality and is not due to transportation damage but workmanship .
negative	poor customer_service
negative	we cooperated at every opportunity sending photographs and video_footage of the damage a shame customer_service did not do the same .
negative	people failed to call when promised - both the delivery team and the after care service .
negative	on repeated occasions i have not been able to get through at all to customer_service for over a week and we have received repeated lies and excuses from staff .
negative	result
negative	0 ) 0 days of lost pay through taking annual_leave for failed delivery , replacements and engineers .
negative	expense of making no end of calls to customer_service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
negative	0 ) damage to the house
negative	0 ) 0 weeks sleeping on the floor without a bed !
negative	0 ) after writing to a senior member of the management team and explaining that we will be sharing our experiences with others by uploading videos , photographs and an account of this online , we finally got the problems resolved .
negative	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
negative	we went for the gesture of goodwill but this by no means covers the loss of annual_leave days , damage to the house , stress or the major inconvenience_caused by oak_furniture land and we still have a wardrobe without matching doors .
negative	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
negative	advice
negative	0 ) stay_away , do not purchase anything from oakfurniture land
negative	0 ) if you do purchase don ’ t pay in full / upfront as we did .
negative	put it on a credit_card as you have more rights if there are problems .
negative	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .
negative	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
negative	0 ) take video_footage and photos of the damage and act promptly
negative	purchased tickets over 0 weeks_ago for a client who will be flying over for this event tomorrow night .
negative	i called first thing in the morning yesterday ( wednesday ( to ask where the tickets are and when i would receive them and asked them to call me back the same day for an update .
negative	heard_nothing all day .
negative	called them yesterday evening , still no clue_what was happening but still could guarantee 000_% that they would turn_up , how can you guarantee that when no one knows what is going on , then they told me to give them until 00pm today .
negative	i called 00pm today , still no clue or no update on how i was getting the tickets or when , the day before the event !!
negative	asked someone to call me back within the hour , heard_nothing .
negative	i called them at 0 . 00pm , asked the same_thing .
negative	still no clue .
negative	now i am waiting again for them to call me back to tell me that they have spoken to the seller ... the worst customer_service ever , with no clue_what is going on .
negative	our client is in the country and expects to attend the event tomorrow and we have no tickets to give them , or any idea how and when we are receiving them .
negative	never using them again and also reporting them to watchdog .

negative	we booked a hotel in benidorm and when we got there we were not booked in .
negative	we had no_idea what to do .
negative	phoned alpha_rooms and they had moved us without telling us .
negative	we were moved to a worse hotel without aircon and for the 0 nights no fresh towels or maid service .
negative	we were refused this .
negative	on arriving home i contacted alpha_rooms and they tried to blame a different agent .
negative	alpha_rooms were our agent and said they " tried " to contact me .
negative	tried isn ' t good enough when your sending people to another country .
negative	no email , no answer phone message .
negative	the final email from the complaint said " i ' m sorry there is nothing we can do ".
negative	at no point did they properly apologise or even admit any blame .
negative	beware !!!!!!!
negative	use travel_republic as they are cheaper and send you to the correct hotel
negative	i have order 0 jackets and after 0 days they sent me an_email that they dont have the order and they are sorry ok no problem but ........ my transaction was pending so i said no warys it will come back ........ wrong they took the money from my account and surprise i have tried to get in touch for over 0 week send email with no answer from them and then i have found the email of their ceo and told him what is happing and surprise next_day email from them then after 0 week my money were back i will not recomend them
negative	i bought an item as a christmas_gift for my partner .
negative	unfortunately the item was not suitable , superfi refused refund even after many emails and emailing manager .
negative	offered an exchange as a gesture of good will !!
negative	!
negative	appalling customer_service , to get a refund you need to return within 0 days of order ... and so they obviously dont care about the christmas market .
negative	still have £_000 worth of audio_equipment unopened in its box which is completely_useless and worthless thanks to superfi .
negative	incdently , superfi were still selling the item at full price and so wouldnt have made any loss by refunding me .... as i said appalling customer_service ... i will be taking my custom striaght back to amazon who are top_notch company !
negative	i wowchered 0 bracelets rrp £_000 . 00 @ £_00 each .
negative	at checkout i paid £ 0 . 00 pp each .
negative	only 0 arrived .
negative	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
negative	i contacted_wowcher who over 0 weeks have sent in excess of 0 emails .
negative	all ignored !!!!!
negative	wowcher have only a mobile number for fasgion revenge which is never answered .
negative	wowcher have returned the £_00 and the £ 0 . 00 pp which fashion revenge has kept !
negative	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .
negative	what if i had paid full price !!
negative	rubbish goods .
negative	rubbish company !
negative	steer_well clear .
negative	the network is an_absolute waste of space .
negative	the workers are rude n unhelpful , i think they are briefed to make the customers lives as difficult as possible and the list is not exhaustive .
negative	in short .... bogus network !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	beware !!!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased chest of drawers .
negative	started breaking down within 0 month .
negative	internal drawer rails were flimsy .
negative	0 broke_down due to poor wood .
negative	the internal and back wood is not oak , but some flimsy softwood .
negative	drawers are wearing out due to friction with the rails .
negative	looks great externally , but inside - very cheap finish .
negative	not happy !!
negative	also , first one delivered had broken rear planks , which are made from the same cheap wood - almost cardboard like .
negative	purchased a tablet online last_night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
negative	the confirmation_email never turned_up so i rang customer_services .
negative	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
negative	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
negative	i was then
negative	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
negative	again the email never arrived , so concerned i rang again , to be told they were out of stock and they will let me know when they ' re back in , which could be whenever .
negative	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
negative	if only i checked here first , i wouldn ' t have bothered ordering in the first place
negative	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
negative	it is now 00th of feb and i have still received nothing .
negative	i had to buy a replacement present since it embarrassingly did not turn_up .
negative	i have requested a refund more times than i would like to count .
negative	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
negative	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
negative	this situation is totally_unacceptable and if i do not get a refund soon i will look_into taking some legal_action_against them , just out of principle .
negative	i was clearing out a room after a relative died , and boxed up his dvd ' s .
negative	we used two companies .
negative	the first [_link ] and the second music_magpie .
negative	we sent 00 dvd ' s to music_magpie by courier , and 000 to [_link ] ( as they offered more money ).
negative	the boxes were both collected / posted on the wednesday .
negative	the wednesday after i had received payment from [_link ].
negative	yet music_magpie were denying receipt of their parcel even_though we had a courier collection leaflet .
negative	i rang up on the thursday and was told the parcel had arrived at the depot today .
negative	i asked why it took so long - he said its not a priority .
negative	nice !!!
negative	he said that i should get an_email_saying that it had been received that day .
negative	i received the email two days_later then expected after 0 more phone_calls .
negative	waste of time .
negative	i still am yet to receive confirmation or email / cheque from them .
negative	poor poor service .
negative	i suggest you use sell to [_link ], if you want your dvd ' s to be a ' priority '.
negative	i cant_believe it has taken 0 weeks longer then the other company to check not even a third of the total the other company checked .
negative	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
negative	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
negative	i missed the flight from sydney to south korea and had to travel in the next_day , which means :
negative	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend ' s family
negative	- i wasted one day at work , because i had to take that day off
negative	- i lost money because i had already paid for the hotel in seoul
negative	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
negative	- i had to pay for two meals in australia , which are at_least twice more_expensive than the meals in korea .
negative	- i wasted a precious time with my girlfriend , who i can meet no more_than 00 days a year .
negative	- all the plans i had for the first evening and the next_day had to be canceled .
negative	not mentioning that i had requested a seat selection to tripsta ' s staff few weeks before the trip , because i could not log in into asiana ' s airlines with my reservation number , but the staff couldn ' t help me and did not suspect something was wrong .
negative	after contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline ' s contact " and i even got an_email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
negative	i ' m still_waiting for an explanation and maybe for some compensation .
negative	worst experience ever .
negative	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .
negative	my order was placed on hold because i put the wrong billing_address , which is fine .
negative	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform me that the order was on hold .
negative	if it ' s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
negative	i had to contact them about 00 days after i purchased the products wondering_why they had not shipped yet before they told me .
negative	i changed my billing_address to match the information i provided and informed them and my order was taken off hold .
negative	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
negative	i said yes .
negative	the item never shipped .
negative	they finally got the out of stock item in and claim they have finally shipped the complete order out to me but only after ignoring about three of my emails and taking several days between my last email and their response .
negative	it has been over a month since i initially placed my order and i ' m still_waiting .
negative	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
negative	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
negative	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren ' t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too_late to order elsewhere saying they couldn ' t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran out of stock ).
negative	i asked if they could do anything on the very expensive postage which was £_00 . 00 for what was now going to be 0 day delivery , and that seemed excessive , but they refused to even even try .
negative	and now looking at others feedback , it looks_like this isn ' t the first time this has happened .
negative	won ' t be going back for more tyres , will stick to the cheaper place that advertises 0 day delivery and free postage , as at_least you can plan things for sure then .
negative	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
negative	do not use this company if you want anything on time and and don ' t want to be messed about .
negative	after shopping with them for years and having things sent to my work all this time , i placed a order last_week , they rejected it because my address had 0 letter different ( 0a rather_than 0 , 0a is actually correct but they only accept the incorrect address ).
negative	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
negative	i thought maybe it was a one off , but no , i placed another order , made sure the address was exactly the same as paypal expected , so no_problems with that this time .
negative	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn ' t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
negative	should have just ordered off of ebay where the same part was £_00 cheaper anyway !
negative	kolejny pre_- order z tym sklepem i znów coś niegra ... zamówienie złożone 00 . 00 . 0000 klucza nadal nie ma ... ostatni zakup w tym " sklepie " który nawet ukrywa komentarze na stronie zaraz jak pojawiają się te prawdziwe na jego temat ...
negative	don ' t buy here .
negative	the title pretty_much sums it up !
negative	either you devote your entire day to sifting through the piles of poorly sorted clothes in the shop or you dont !
negative	wish there was an easy option .
negative	online would be perfect !
negative	i feel the need to point out this company is in league with marisota , if you search for their reviews it will tell you alot of what to expect !
negative	if i were you i ' d steer_well clear , and if your tempted in for gods sake make_sure you keep note of who you speak to and when it can help when it comes to writing a complaint to their md !
negative	i ordered a pair of boots for £_00 .
negative	they didnt turn_up next_day despite me paying in full on my debit_card and being assured they would , then marisota sent me out a replacement pair and didnt charge me for them until they could find the other parcel .
negative	the replacement pair turned_up at the wrong_address !
negative	this over the space of 0 weeks having given up i didnt bother trying the boots and instantly returned them .
negative	in the midst of this there were lots of phone_calls , emails & live_chat conversations held .
negative	eventually wrote a long and rather strongly worded letter to their md mark cheshire , they gave me 00_%_off ( ha not using that !)
negative	and a written apology which has still not been recieved !
negative	eventually got a refund after them having my £_00 for 0 weeks !
negative	appalling !
negative	cex ' s policy is , if you have a voucher , you must print it off , and post the voucher to them at your own_risk .
negative	you can ' t enter a voucher_code at the online checkout .
negative	sent my voucher in ' recorded_delivery '.
negative	it ' s been signed for , yet i ' ve still heard_nothing .
negative	should sort out there voucher situation !
negative	dear beautybay ,
negative	i requested a refund for my lost order № 0000000 from 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	it ' s been 00 days that i e_- mailed the completed lost orders claim_form to you , but the amount hasn ' t been credited to my account .
negative	just tired to get automatic e_- mails from you .
negative	please do something .
negative	what a load of rubish these lot are .
negative	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
negative	they allowed my mum to drive the car home untaxed and so uninsured what idiots .
negative	then i have had the car a month and noticed the back valance loose looked underneath and the back crossmember
negative	is bent and split you cant lower the spare wheel it has been in a smash ,
negative	back valance shodily replaced to ( con ) seel this damage .
negative	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
negative	they all looked ( con ) fused and sheepish .
negative	then atempted to blame me for the damage but if i needed the spare wheel they could get the prie bar onit .
negative	ha .
negative	ha .
negative	amazingly enough the mot tester did not pick_up on it ( why ) they were ( con ) fident that it was not damaged when it left the forcourt .
negative	i have informed the finance company .
negative	consumer direct ect .
negative	i will not rest until they accept_responsibility .
negative	avoid these wide boys at all cost .
negative	do not order from them !!!
negative	i have no_idea how the hell they have even one good review and now i suspect they are actually doing fake buys them selves to be able to create what looks_like real buyer reviews .
negative	they take your money and i waited to 0 to 00 working_days for my item .
negative	it is now 00 working_days and no item , have emailed them 0 times and no response what - so - ever !!
negative	!
negative	i have told them now i want a full_refund and my order cancelled !
negative	but like everything else this has been totally ignored .
negative	i am now having to put in a claim through paypal and by the time i get my money back it will be about 0 weeks since placing the order and no sunlgasses !
negative	!
negative	the total_lack of customer_service says to me that if anyone does get their sunglasses from them double and triple check them because i would definetley guess at them being fakes !
negative	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
negative	need i say more ??
negative	?
negative	if ' smartbuysunglasses ' ( thats a joke in itself ) is a real company and reads this refund me my money and cancel my order nowwwwwww !!!!!
negative	!
negative	having used paypal for a number of years i have always thought the same_thing .
negative	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer_service much_better .
negative	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
negative	without them , even with the power of ebay they will be left behind .
negative	i had been mislead on wowcher , i ordered some hair extentions under the impression that is what i was ordering , only to find out after i had paid £_00 , i had only brought the ' wowcher '.
negative	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .
negative	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
negative	as above .
negative	do no deal with this company .
negative	they will not deliver your items , they will not respond to your raised support tickets and they are dodging refunds that are necessary due to their awful service .
negative	a sham of a company .
negative	they lost my parcel which worth alot to me after ringing time many_times they promise to redeliver and after 0 weeks they says its lost ?????
negative	give information to trace the parcel , notable thing is i sent 0 parcels which was quite heavy big boxes so how they lost ???
negative	they just making me wait longer and now i dont think i will get anything back
negative	sent this parcel using them , it all broken and damage , asked for pictures and everything and finally they refused the claim for reason that parcel had glass on it !!!!!
negative	then charged extra from my account on same day , poor service , would not recommand to anyone , i paid £_000 for this parcel plus paid extra for insurance then today they send me new invoice and took another £_00 from my card itself , so i lost the item plus this money which is about £_000 due to parcel_monkey , i will not use them again and will not recommend to anyone , they not even provide phone support
negative	i have no_idea how or why people get lucky_enough to get their parcels delivered using interparcel ....
negative	but here is my story .....
negative	friday 00st june_0000 my package is picked_up by ups for delivery to manchester ....
negative	monday 00th_june_0000 ; the same package is delivered back to my front_door !
negative	!.....
negative	interpacels website states
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 tamworth , gb unload scan
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 tamworth , gb arrival scan
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 dartford , gb departure scan
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 dartford , gb origin scan
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 billing information received
negative	this says to me the package has arrived at the manchester depot ( even_though tamworth is nearer to birmingham !!!)
negative	and not to my house ...
negative	i ring interpacel spoke to a lady_called kaly ( that ryhmed !
negative	hehe ).... in all fairness to her she says she will ring ups to find out why and call me back ....
negative	i call back 00_mins later to find out anymore info available because the package is time sensitive ......
negative	this new agent tells_me i have to wait_until they get back to me and they dont know when that will be ......
negative	no apology or common courtesy from this woman , not even a " please bear with us we are doing our best " ...
negative	instead all i hear is the radio playing in the background and loud voice chatter ( all female voices )... and she was quick to hang_up ...
negative	the story continues ...... i will update once i hear back from these ...... should i say it ???
negative	no i will wait to see the outcome ....
negative	don ' t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
negative	because it ' s not .
negative	it ' s at_least 00p / minute .
negative	in the 0 years i have been with o0 there wan ' t 0 month that i paid the supposed and agreed monthly package price .
negative	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
negative	and you will call these numbers because it ' s raining you don ' t have a landline and its just a short call to edf energy anyway ... bullshit .
negative	and boy they know this very well .
negative	this is where their business lies .
negative	bastards .
negative	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
negative	i mean they do take out a new contract with o0 don ' t they deserve some discount as against to those who just walked in from nowhere with no history with o0 at all ?
negative	i have been with them for 0 years and i wanted to upgrade as usual 0 month early .
negative	but now i can go eff my self and shove up teh 0 year up my a $$ becuase now we have this brand_new brainstorm of a 00 year_old executive from o0 called refresh and " be more dog " bullshit .
negative	i cannot get any discount .
negative	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
negative	he could be a serialkiller for all we know and i am listed in the same category .
negative	it ' s simple .
negative	get the phone you want , pay cash and get a pay as you go sim from any network it doesn ' t matter just don ' t get an o0 pay_monthly package because you will regret it .
negative	i walked in the other day and the kid (!)
negative	in the branch called me " boss .
negative	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
negative	we don ' t want halifax executives and managers to lose their jobs now do we ?
negative	i am from europe and a company like this would not last for 0 months there .
negative	absolutely_ridiculous people at customer " service " completely clueless .
negative	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
negative	what the hell is this a construction site ??
negative	lies all around about broadband speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
negative	all in all i am not surprised .
negative	the sole reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
negative	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
negative	want your card terminals to be installed in a manner which breaks health and safety regulations ?
negative	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
negative	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
negative	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?
negative	want to be charged for goods you never received nor signed for to be then declined refunds ?
negative	want to wait 0 months for simple complaints and queries to be replied to , to just be told your complaint has been declined !!
negative	?
negative	then payment_sense is the one for you .
negative	my advice is pay the extra penny a transaction and use a reputable firm that deal with technical break downs within 0 hours and are polite and helpful .
negative	if i could give less_than 0 star , i would have .
negative	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
negative	they will take your money , tell you the product is out of stock , then fail to deliver a refund despite numerous_calls and emails .
negative	tomorrow i ' m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
negative	i had purchased my blackberry from the store , my blackberry had a manufacturing_fault so this had to be taken in for ' servicing ', they advised me that this would be back to me in 0 weeks .
negative	0 weeks_later i had heard_nothing , i contacted them and the lady i spoke to was really rude and said that it ' s not their problem and it will still be a further 0 weeks , they never offered me a curtosy phone and when i had asked for my money back for a months line_rental as i have not been using the blackberry package they said this was not their fault so they arent going to refund me .
negative	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !

negative	i ' bought ' bestival tickets from viagogo a week before the festival last_year .
negative	by 0 days before the festival i was concerned that although the transaction appeared to be complete , the money had not gone from my account , and the tickets were not displaying as shipped .
negative	when i tried to contact them i received an automatic message_saying that tickets may be dispatched very shortly before the event ... with 0 days to go i was extremely concerned and was repeatedly phoning and emailing them .
negative	again , automated_messages saying that tickets could be dispatched very shortly before the event .
negative	same result the next_day .
negative	one day before the event i was still getting the same replies from my desperate emails and calls .
negative	by this point , tickets had tripled in price on ebay , and were very , very difficult to get hold of , as the event had long sold out .
negative	i ended_up missing the first two days of the festival and buying a very expensive replacement .
negative	viagogo did not respond to consequent emails asking for an_apology or explanations and did nothing but send automated_messages claiming that my complaint was being investigated - despite having plenty of time to fill my inbox with junkmail .
negative	they clearly did not give a crap that they had ruined my holiday ., or that they could ' ve saved me alot of hassle by just bothering to properly address my concerns and tell me they didn ' t have the ticket .
negative	absolute_rip_off .
negative	awfuly awful service .
negative	i cannot begin to vent my anger about these people .
negative	all they do is lie and when you call back they pretend it never happened .
negative	cannot_believe i wasted £_000 on these_guys .
negative	i would have much rather paid £_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
negative	definitely have to expose these criminals .
negative	booked a parcel and i was given the collection time between 00 noon till 0 . 00 pm
negative	waited all this time and no one turn_up to collect my parcel .
negative	contacted to interparcel .
negative	and what ?
negative	shocking custemer service .
negative	complete_joke
negative	then i decided to stop sending parcels with interparcel . never ever agein
negative	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
negative	if you want reliablelty stay_away from interparcel
negative	i ordered a guild_wars 0 pre purchase key from this website , all was well at first .
negative	i received my key within 00_hours ( fraud check ) but now the company behind gw0 has banned my key , explaining that it is a fraudulent key sold by an unauthorised retailer , leaving me without access to the beta events and full game when it is released and almost £_00 out of pocket .
negative	they ' re selling their diablo_0 keys for more_than it would cost to purchase them from blizzard ' s own webstore , which there will be no delay with key delivery when using .
negative	i ' m really not sure why people are bothering with cjs for diablo_0 at all !
negative	edit_: i did receive a full_refund , but of course i had to wait a few_days and this fiasco is simply unacceptable .
negative	i strongly_advise everyone against dealing_with this company !
negative	what with this guild_wars 0 issue and their complete failure with diablo_0 pre_- order delivery , they ' re simply not to be trusted .
negative	they also hand pick the reviews that appear on their product pages !
negative	!
negative	cant_believe_how bad customer_service is .
negative	being passed from pillar to post im non the wiser .
negative	website has been offline for a week now and still no light at the end of the tunnel .
negative	cant access ftp , then to top it off they have cancelled my package by mistake .
negative	spent hours on phone talking to different assistants who just keep passing me to the next person .
negative	really guys i would ` nt even give this one star .
negative	i needed to clear away my old cd ' s and dvd ' s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
negative	wasn ' t too impressed when i made the order on some of the prices but the total was over £_000 so i went_ahead and used the free courier service .
negative	they then took over a month to even acknowledge that they had the order even_though it was couriered in , which i find strange given the order would have been with them the same day it was sent .
negative	i then got an_email_saying that they were only paying me £_000 as some of the cd ' s on the order i hadn ' t sent .
negative	i emailed to tell them this was incorrect and as it was couriered in then they courier must have lost some boxes .
negative	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .
negative	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd ' s and what were they going to do about it .
negative	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an_email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
negative	i took this to mean that i was getting my order value in full so waited to get the new cheque in the post .
negative	0 month later , 0 further emails unresponded to and i still_haven ' t got the other cheque .
negative	think i now need to work out how to take them to trading_standards .
negative	avoid this company like the plague ..... h
negative	im waiting for almost 0 months and they didnt unlocked my iphone and since 00 / 00 / 00 they didnt answer my questions and so , i can ' t get my money back .
negative	they not professionals .
negative	i lost my money !
negative	i sent this message at facebook and they simply erase it
negative	this is very annoying .
negative	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
negative	i ordered a pair of glasses , my account was debited and only because i randomly checked the order status , i saw that the glasses i ordered are not in stock and that it can take an indefinite time ' more_than a month ' to get them delivered .
negative	i find this quite impertinent as this company didn ' t even bother to notify me that the glasses are undeliverable !
negative	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
negative	as i need these glasses urgently , i would actually expect some kind of indemnification as i have to place an order somewhere_else to get glasses and who_knows when i ' ll get anything from this company .
negative	i ordered the roses and lilies standard bouquet for my sister .
negative	the flowers were delivered on wednesday around 0pm .
negative	when she opened it the roses had been completely worn out and were about to die .
negative	the lillies were brown too .
negative	she did not want to tell me and upset me .
negative	when i visited her on saturday i saw the flowers and was so annoyed , angry and sad to know that the money i had paid had only given such a low quality of flowers .
negative	i should have rather paid a bit more and got the flowers from john_lewis .
negative	when i contacted the customer_services they were not helpful at all and have replied ' regards to the roses , it does appear that only the outer petals are browning but if you remove these then the bouquet will look lovely ' also ' there are only minimal signs of any damage so we cannot send out a replacement bouquet on this occasion '.
negative	well i guess you get what you pay for .
negative	so i strongly advice not to use this website and get your money ' s worth somewhere_else .
negative	the customer_service was totally unhelpful .
negative	products dispatched within 00_hours ?
negative	nope , ordered a pmdg product on tuesday , and now its saturday , still no game or no notification on where the game is .
negative	no email telling_me whether its been dispatched , no email giving me a refund when i asked for it , purely unacceptable and they basically lied to me !
negative	i ' m going to stick with [_external reference ], more_expensive ( like £ 0 more ) but at_least i know i will get it !
negative	£_00 pounds for the game , and it ' s still not here !
negative	edit_: forgive my anger , but to pay £_00 and still be waiting for 0 days after ordering , i cannot forgive gameseek for this , and i hope it comes by monday or i ' m getting a refund .
negative	as documented in various forums ( just google ' homefiresides '), this company is completely fraudulent !!
negative	you will not receive your goods as the company went into liquidation months_ago .
negative	company also known as firesgalore .
negative	avoid !
negative	i found this out the hard way after paying them £_000 .
negative	i ordered my vitamins , only to receive them with all soft gels broken .
negative	i contacted health monthly and they were apologetic and said they would send me another bottle free of charge .
negative	after 0 min i recieved an_email from them saying that i had to send back the broken bottle with the broken gels and they would reimburse me .
negative	firstly i found this stupid as one they communicated something different and secondly its their fault so they should send this free .
negative	finally i received my reimbursement after 0 weeks !
negative	the new soft gels i received were broken again but i haven ’ t pursued this complaint as one i haven ’ t got time and two their staff are stupid .
negative	will never use this company again and would urge everyone_else not to .
negative	i ordered a christmas_gift_card on the 0th of december .
negative	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
negative	hof offered no solutions to this on the phone or by email .
negative	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
negative	now they tell me they can ' t give me a refund on the gift_card - even_though it ' s missing with royal_mail ( royal_mail didn ' t get it until the 00th ).
negative	if they do find it , what good is it to me now ?
negative	!
negative	i ' ve had sky for 0 and a half months and all of a sudden my signal went one night , sky are saying they cant come out as its a council property and there not insured ??
negative	the council won ' t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it ' s an_absolute_joke , the customer_service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same_thing as in there reading off a script , that ' s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
negative	if i ' d had know they were this bad i would never of gone with them , i ' m not paying for something what i can ' t use so if sky can ' t stick to there side of the agreement never can i !!
negative	!
negative	please anyone thinking of joining sky don ' t as you will be disappointed , very
negative	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
negative	thanks
negative	the company is an ubsulte joke , there quick to get a uk_based call_centre to try and keep you with them but soon as you have a problem your get through to someone in india who cant understand i word your saying , they sound like robots and keep repeating the same_thing as if there reading off a script .
negative	they talk over you and make you irate , i work in customer_service myself and find it hard to understand different uk acents over the phone at times so i dont see how the orange exeutives feel that there indian_call centresare usefull , i just cant_wait to see orange go bust in a few_years when everyone doesnt use them , ive been waiting over 0 weeks formy problem to be resolved and stil not heard_anything ,,
negative	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble opinion .
negative	the pattern that has emerged is that once a bad review is left then you get a follow_up of good reviews of similar sort .
negative	well here is my experience but before i start if you believe that businesses should be fair non discriminatory please boycott @ ocado in the name of what dr . luther king stood for .
negative	well see why .
negative	evidence collated after contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
negative	so why in modern britain ?
negative	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
negative	just read for yourself comments on other review sites , company has a draconian culture of ruthlessly segmenting / profiling their customers based on flawed assumptions , customers sent mould bread or best by products , orders cancelled if they presume your are of minority ethnic background ( of which their pathetic_excuse is that you want to export there already expired products ) is that how the cater for the needs of if you the supposedly top 0 %?
negative	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer_service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
negative	today i vote with my feet and raise awareness so you are not humiliated as this cannot be accepted .
negative	look through the statistics it is basically self explanatory .
negative	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
negative	honestly don ' t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
negative	( using instant , which is the only useful thing as you cant spontaneously watch a movie if it takes like 0 days to arrive )
negative	ordered the item on 0th_may , and it just got dispatched today , 00th_may , via_royal_mail letter post .
negative	what the hell ?
negative	this customer purchased a cd_key from our website cjs - cdkeys . com and returned it for refund , claiming it was unused .
negative	in fact , when we resold the key , we discovered it had been used .
negative	a few weeks_later , steven from gameguideworld ordered another key from cjs_cd_keys , and after asking for verification because of the used key , threatened to complete a chargeback on his credit_card ( meaning he received the unused key , resold it on gameguideworld , and made a chargeback ).
negative	so in a nutshell , gameguideworld are selling stolen goods .
negative	contact cjs_cd_keys support if you wish to see proof of this .
negative	i needed a letter to bring give to cps after my phone was stolen and i have called 000 and orange store to beg them for this letter / email but they gave it to me .
negative	the court needed the letter to confirm that i did have this phone and who was provider and i was treated like dirt by orange .
negative	their technical_team asked me to do a list of testing including unscrewing by bt phone box and i could not put it back .
negative	as a result i had an open box of wires of electricity in a house where a toddler lives .
negative	they said they would credit back the days i have not got internet for so i asked them for confirmation of that in writing but no they wont do it .
negative	" it goes on your account " they say .
negative	however your so called account is under their control and they can edit / amend as they like .
negative	in the meantime you are paying for internet which you dont have .
negative	i explained i need internet to work because i have deadline but they cant be bothered and they would not send the confirmation of credit regund in writing .
negative	instead they cut the phone off .
negative	appaling .
negative	after finding some well_priced priced i booked with this company handing_over just under £ 0000 for 0 tickets to thailand .
negative	a week_later i get an_email_saying my tickets were unable to be issued with no explanation unless i phoned back by 0 the next_day .
negative	phoning around midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
negative	i asked for a refund which over 00 days_later has still not arrived despite many correspondents .
negative	no replys to emails and very unhelpful on the phone .
negative	i ' ve been a 0 customer for almost four years .
negative	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i ' ve been using it .
negative	setting_up the contract was easy .
negative	upgrading to a more_expensive contract was even easier .
negative	i didn ' t even need to speak to anyone , everything could be done online .
negative	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
negative	even when i went abroad , the roaming was switched on and it was all good .
negative	until the next time i went abroad .
negative	i was cut_off from the rest of the world for two_weeks as 0 had randomly decided to switch off roaming without telling_me first .
negative	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should ' ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
negative	i don ' t even know what their logic was ...
negative	then the problems started .
negative	i wanted to switch the contract from my husband ' s name to mine as it was getting annoying that he had to phone them everything i wanted something .
negative	so we went into a 0 store .
negative	i ' m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer_service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn ' t possible to change the contract that easily .
negative	we gave up .
negative	one time i had a problem with my bill , when i ' d gone over my free minutes ( something they ' d previously notified me of by text but this time they neglected to tell me and so i accumulated a spend of over £_00 instead of my usual £_00 .)
negative	after a lot of very frustrating phone_calls they finally_agreed to refund £_00 because they ' d stopped the notifications without actually telling_me they would .
negative	i ' m not sure they ever did refund me though .
negative	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer_service , i finally decided to switch to another provider .
negative	so my husband phoned them from work ( as he ' s still the person named on a contract ).
negative	after half an_hour ( of his work time ), they told him they ' d phone him back .
negative	instead they phoned my mobile and left a message_saying i ' d been authorised to make changes to the contract , could i please phone them back .
negative	so i did .
negative	it took five_minutes just to get through the pre_- recorded adverts and nonsense they ' d like you to know about before they even let you talk to a person .
negative	( also , if they ' re closed , they still make you listen to all the nonsense before they tell you they ' re closed and when you should phone back ).
negative	this guy then told me i wasn ' t authorised to do anything , could my husband phone back .
negative	seriously ?!
negative	so my husband took another half hour out of his work time only for them again to say they ' d phone back .
negative	he made sure they had his work number this time but they still managed to phone my mobile , only this time i had magically been authorised to do anything i wanted with the contract .
negative	i told him to cancel it .
negative	he spent litereally 00_minutes arguing with me about how i should stay , they ' d fix everything , they ' d give me a better deal , they ' d instantly change the name on the contract , they ' d give me more free minutes etc etc .
negative	it took all the patience i ' ve ever owned ( and a bit more ) not to swear and hang_up on him .
negative	he was so pushy and tried to put down the new provider i ' d chosen .
negative	i even went as far as saying " i ' m sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let me deal with any_problems i ' ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
negative	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn ' t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who ' d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally_agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
negative	most frustrating morning i ' ve had since ... well , since last time i tried to fix a problem i had with 0 .
negative	he said he ' d send me the pac_code within two hours .
negative	i do hope this is the one time they keep their promise because if i have to phone them again i ' ll probably just throw my phone out the window .
negative	also , if 0 reads this , please don ' t contact me with offers of better deals or apologies .
negative	i ' m not interested and i don ' t want anything from you .
negative	i just want to warn_people to stay_away from you .
negative	this is a ridiculous website .
negative	i was looking for a cheap sd_card and found this website that had them so cheap it was hard to believe .
negative	turns_out it was because it shouldn ' t be believed .
negative	it said shipping was free and the items would be ordered via amazon ' s check - out system so i figured if amazon were involved , it was probably alright .
negative	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about £ 0 with an estimated_delivery date about a week_later .
negative	i decided not to use it and ordered my sd_card on amazon instead .
negative	i constantly wonder_how these_guys are in business at all .
negative	arrogant customer_service .
negative	unclear terms and conditions .
negative	i will throw a party when this company shuts down .
negative	sometimes , i wonder when folks write a bad review , however , not until it does happen to you .
negative	very rude customer_service .
negative	waited 00 and didn ' t got any package even when i had to check with the local royal_mail distribution center and this happened twice .
negative	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .
negative	would ' nt give them half star either .
negative	i waited in all day ( 0am until 0 :_00pm and someone the rest of the night in case they decided to show up ) and no parcel , only to check the tracking at 00 :_00pm that they ' attempted delivery ' at 0 :_00pm and no - one was there so they left a card for re - delivery .
negative	no attempt , no card , nothing .
negative	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
negative	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
negative	do not use this company if there is another option .
negative	long_story please read !
negative	i booked a fly drive with dialaflight for myself and my husband which included flights to buffalo , car_hire 0 nights in a hotel and return flights from orlando 00 days_later it took a lot of tooing and frowing as i checked flights on skyskanner and made sure that i was getting a great deal which i did .
negative	they took £_000 deposit from us .
negative	then after a bad family holiday we felt guilty leaving the children so we called and asked if we could carry the deposit over and change the holiday to a family of 0 0 weeks in orlando with car_hire , this was a lot more_expensive and he jumped at the chance to change this holiday , he took a further £_000 deposit .
negative	he was very helpful again calling a few weeks_later to inform me that great flights had come available direct wit ba but it was a little more_expensive we chatted a little and decided to change the dates to april rather_than december as the weather was better but this would be more_expensive and this time he too £_000 further deposit now i have paid £_000 deposit and still have £ 0 , 000 to pay .
negative	then disaster hit , i lost my job .
negative	i called my helpful agent to enquire if we could down grade to a 0 week holiday instead of 0 and stay in a cheaper accommodation ... this is when the help stopped , he informed me that the price would actually go up !!
negative	that ' s funny as i have looked online and can knock it down almost £ 0000 ?
negative	he went on to tell me that the accommodation i have found is not suitable and that skyskanner flight are not true prices even_though i went right to the point of entering card_details !
negative	he them made up some rubbish about how it is not like for like so he cannot carry the deposit over so their is cancellation charge of £_000 it was rubbish excuse after rubbish excuse .
negative	i lost my deposit and booked a much cheaper holiday with a different company .
negative	i would not use again !
negative	i have never bought sex toys in my life as i ' m shy and find going into a shop even ann_summers embarrassing so i decided to order something online .
negative	i placed my order on 00rd august ( 00 days ago ) 0 day delivery option .
negative	i received an_email entitled " order process " and that was the last i heard from this company . i have had no despatched notice , i cannot log in to track the order as i did not make an account .
negative	i have sent emails which have been ignored , i am embarrassed about ringing up but i have tried 0 times and have just got answering_machine .
negative	lots of people will be too embarrassed to chase it up or report them so they get money for nothing !
negative	..... thank_god i did not spend a lot of money .
negative	update_: managed to get through on the phone just now 00th_september , was told the item was out of stock and it will be sent today !!
negative	lets_see how that goes then !
negative	i wont hold my breath ..
negative	update_: the item finally arrived a few_days_later .
negative	worst retailer i have ever come_across .
negative	ordered a tv because it was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
negative	big_mistake .
negative	has been 0 weeks and it still_hasn ' t arrived .
negative	i have called every week and got the same response " we will send you an_email in the next few_days confirming your delivery date ".
negative	even worse , they dare to charge £_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
negative	please everyone , save_yourself the hassle and get your tv from somewhere reputable , the tenner or so which you might save is simply not worth it .
negative	i purchased a portable dvd_player for my sister to put in her car for my niece .
negative	as she is such a technophobe it sat in the box for three months .
negative	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
negative	it was another month before she told me so by the time i contacted_wowcher they say it only has a three month warranty .
negative	despite me contacting them three times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
negative	i am getting_nowhere they sold an out of box faulty product and they really couldn ' t care less .
negative	i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything from this company .
negative	their customer care and after sales service is very poor .
negative	i ordered one of their bundles online and from the off , the service was rubbish .
negative	sent only part of the order despite telling_me i signed for it all !
negative	the bits they forgot to send were the actual camera and bag !
negative	phone every day for a week and was promised a call back each day .
negative	this never happened .
negative	finally spoke to a manager and was assured a call back but again never happened .
negative	asked for full_refund to which she said we will refund you in full .
negative	i checked what they were refunding and she said £_000 .
negative	i had paid £_000 !
negative	!
negative	the customer_services at this company is a total joke and in a way i am glad it all fell through as i found the package cheaper elsewhere .
negative	avoid unless you enjoy hassle
negative	my 00 months with vodafone were excellent bar the issue with not putting insurance on my phone which was resolved within a couple of calls to them and receiving a call or 0 back to resolve the matter ; however my next 00 months have been littered with dissatisfaction and stress .
negative	the customer_service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more_than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave me incorrect_information over the phone which_resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i ' ll pay the other half .... that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
negative	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i ' m sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
negative	not happy in the slightest !!
negative	!
negative	limit your money over anything .. so they can earn interest on it .. avoid
negative	if it ' s possible to give no stars i would do .
negative	i ordered a dining_room set from their diningroomworld site .
negative	it was stated that the item would be delivered next_day .
negative	notified at the last_minute that they couldnt deliver .
negative	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
negative	told them i couldnt do week days and it would have to be delivered on a saturday ( which they wanted to charge me for !
negative	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0 weeks_ago .
negative	for the last 0 saturdays i have patiently_waited for the delivery and nothing has arrived .
negative	what an_absolute_joke .
negative	pathetic service .
negative	no communication .
negative	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance ........... now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
negative	really bad customer_service , store manager rude and not helpful ...
negative	i pre_- ordered flowers to be delivered to my wife on valentines_day , not only did the flowers turn_up a day late , iflorist didn ' t respond to any_queries on valetines day when i ( and many others ) tried to chase up our orders .
negative	they also didn ' t answer phones , respond to tickets logged on their own ticketing_system , respond to tweets or facebook posts in the days after valentines_day when hundreds of customers were trying to claim refunds for late and undelivered flowers , do not use them !!
negative	!
negative	i was / am a business customer with talk_talk .
negative	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	they are happy to trick you into any contract .
negative	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
negative	their staff all worship the ground talk_talk walk on and their communication with bt open reach is awful .
negative	do not use talk_talk - they are scum .
negative	used the easy webpage to chose , book and pay .
negative	am travelling form spain so only spanish number to add to site .
negative	told 00 . 00pm outside hotel .....
negative	waited_till 00 . 00 to call eatery , no answer , so called just_eat direct .
negative	told they tried to call me on my number but it wouldnt connect so they had cancelled my food , no email , no text , nothing !
negative	they said people do hoax orders and they thought this was one ..... understandable if i hadnt actually paid !
negative	why would i hoax if i paid ??????
negative	duh !
negative	so , the resolution was , wait another 00_minutes for said food .. er , no actually , id rather starve ......... luckily i got a full_refund , but seriously , they could put that on the webpage & inform the supplier to email them / us if they cancelled thinking it was a hoax .
negative	i cant comment on the quality of the food as i never tried it & im put off ordering again in case im left standing in the cold & dark waiting for nothing !
negative	!
negative	ordered my new guitar , paid for next_day delivery .
negative	i had to phone call them the next_day asking about the order because i received no email to confirm my order .
negative	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
negative	then the next_day , no email confirmation for when the courier was picking the item from the depot .
negative	at the end of the day i had to email them and inquire about the order .
negative	it has been sent to the wrong depot therefore i had to wait another day to get my guitar .
negative	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
negative	it was not my fault and they were supposed to support the entire cost of delivery for this mistake .
negative	their replies were always very short and cold .
negative	nothing was offered in exchange for this .
negative	a friend_recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
negative	they need to have systems in place to guarantee that they deliver what they promise .
negative	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
negative	i will update my review if an adequate explanation is given and the issue is resolved promptly , if it isnt then i would suggest taking your custom elsewhere
negative	we recently gave our 0 months notice to end our contract on our rented flat , and shortly_afterwards greene & co started to book viewings .
negative	unfortunately almost every viewing request we ' ve received has been for that day , not providing the 00_hours notice they are legally required to give .
negative	i ' ve had 00 + conversations with the letting agents and even made a formal_complaint to the head letting agent about this , but they continue to ask to view the flat without 00_hours notice .
negative	we are buying a property and often have confidential documents on display in the flat , so it ' s not appropriate for strangers to be in our flat without the proper notice .
negative	i ' m at my wits_end with greene & co and have unfortunately had to lodge an official_complaint with the property osbudman over this .
negative	i found the nigel_o ' hara through google_shopping and they were offering a fantastic deal on the watch i had been looking to purchase .
negative	made my order on friday 0rd of jan at 0pm , but 00 days_later still_waiting for delivery .
negative	website stated that the economy delivery would take 0 - 0 days once dispatched which seemed reasonable and inline with other site ' s economy delivery option .
negative	unfortunately what the website didn ' t clearly_state was that dispatching times are snail pace .
negative	i received an_email on the 0th_jan ( 0 days_later - 0 working_days ) saying my order had only just been dispatched !
negative	now 0 days_later ( 0 working_days ) i am still_waiting for my order .
negative	i have contacted customer care about the speed of delivery and received an_email thanking me for my patience , but no explanation as to why delivery was so slow .
negative	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	edited : i have now received a response to my customer care enquiry letting me know that my order will now not complete this week but next week .
negative	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
negative	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	update_:
negative	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
negative	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
negative	i would advise against using this site and have amended my star_rating according .
negative	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
negative	bought a computer from these and it developed a fault after 0 weeks .
negative	two_weeks on and multiple emails no response for the warranty claim i need to raise .
negative	fast to take my money and horrible non_existent cs
negative	i sent two phones in september_0000 they told me for weeks they are waiting for parts , i had already paid them for parts which cost £_000 .
negative	to go on the website today and see it has been ceased is very worrying they have 0 new phones worth a total of £_000 .
negative	i have emailed them thry said i will get the phones back and be reimbursed .. how true that is i dont know doubtful !
negative	!
negative	absolutely awful !
negative	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
negative	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .
negative	another two days pass and guess_what .
negative	those frames are also discontinued .
negative	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .
negative	go to spex0less . com .
negative	ordered from them on the monday night and received my glasses on the thursday_morning .
negative	website is simple enough and can ' t complain with the prices , but the service is rubish , its ment to be instant delivery ( email code ) but i had to wait around 0 days , i actualy cancelled my oder because the service was so bad , i won ' t use this site again and have told all my friends to not use it either .
negative	have been having a on going battle with vodafone about signal issues and to cut a long_story short they sent me out a new ( reconditioned ) phone that arrives in a plastic_bag and they take the old one away in a plastic_bag .
negative	well that one lasted 0 weeks before it packed us so off it went again .
negative	chucked in to the plastic_bag then chucked in to the back of a courier van .
negative	about 0 weeks_later i have just received a bill for £_000 for screen damage .
negative	?
negative	the screen didn ' t have a scratch on it when it left my hand and went in the plastic_bag .
negative	so after about 0 hours on the phone and 0 emails i have been told that it ' s not there problem .
negative	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don ' t want to know and have said they want there £_000 .
negative	i feel that this is a disgusting service , i have been with them for 00 years and will have payed them in the region of £_00 , 000_+ with my phone and employes .
negative	and this is how they treat you .
negative	well vodafone i would like to say that me and all my employees will now be getting orange phones so say good buy to your £_000 per_month .
negative	morons .
negative	after ordering the gazebo , it took 0 days for one to arrive when the normal period is stated as " 00_hours ".
negative	i was actually told off over the phone for contacting them before the 00 hour period was finished - when in fact it had been over 0 days since day of dispatch .
negative	once the gazebo finally arrived it was actually damaged with deep scratches all over the metal and it would not stand up as one of the feet was welded on sideways .
negative	we complained immediately and it took 0 days to have it collected and then another 0 for a new one to be delivered .
negative	and now after using the gazebo just 0 times , the poles inside have snapped and the welding has come a part - something you cannot just fix yourself .
negative	customer_service has been absolutely awful , its taken 00 days to get any contact out of them over a £_00 refund for delivery .
negative	and now that i have to complain_about it being broken after just 0 times of use i am sure this will be another huge mountain to climb before actually getting a replacement or getting my money back !
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	the quality is incredibly low which reflects the low price but there is no excuse for poor customer_service !
negative	this is a review of my experience of ' optical_express customer_service ' relating to the refund of a deposit for laser_eye_surgery .
negative	i had lasik eye_surgery over 0 months_ago .
negative	on the day of my first aftercare appointment my wife accompanied me and was tested to see if she was suitable for the same procedure i had had .
negative	she was , and so the clinician pressurised us into making the holding deposit payment of £_000 and booking the procedure then and there .
negative	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
negative	the clinician advised us that ' yes this would get paid back up to 00hrs before the surgery '.
negative	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
negative	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant documentation and t &_c ' s , but were advised ' don ' t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any_questions that she may have '.
negative	since then i have suffered many acute side - effects including severe dry - eye ( waking me up 0 - 0 times a night with my eye - lids fused together ), ghosting & glare ( making me unable to drive at night ) pain in my eyes , and hugely variable clarity of vision that has meant i have been off work .
negative	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
negative	clearly , having faced these side - effects we decided that it was not wise for my wife to go_ahead with the same procedure .
negative	however , we were informed by optical_express that the deposit made is non - refundable and that they only return the money if cancellations are received within_00hrs of booking .
negative	for the last 0 months i have written letters , had hugely frustrated phone - calls and am now at my wit ' s end .
negative	i still keep getting the company line from their staff , ' due to our terms and conditions this deposit is non - refundable '.
negative	these are the same t &_c ' s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c ' s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c ' s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
negative	so my advice is simple .
negative	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
negative	then , and only then , with 000_% certainty should you book a procedure and pay the deposit , as once it ' s paid , you will never see it again .
negative	they don ' t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
negative	lots of hidden_fees , 00_% final value 00p here 00p there paypal .
negative	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
negative	avoid
negative	in store is generally ok . online are useless , loose items send unsigned cheques and take 0 weeks to process orders
negative	i recently used hermes after giving up on them for some years for shockingly rubbish service , it took 0 days ( not including them picking it up on the saturday ) for them to deliver a pc tower which they also managed to dent in the process .
negative	the side of this pc tower is 0mm steel so god_knows_how badly it must have been looked after for them to " achieve " that .
negative	luckily the buyer was happy enough to live with it as the side wasn ' t in view .
negative	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly shows from the box what is inside .
negative	from that alone anyone with any education would be able to deduce was something not to be playing rugby with .
negative	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
negative	i could have been on the loo , wiped and got to the door in the space of time it took him to try and ruin my purchase so no_idea how he expected it to save time .
negative	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn ' t make it the right way to do it .
negative	this badly creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn ' t have been able to match his expertise .
negative	this wouldn ' t have been so bad but the receipts from the website i ordered from are collectable as they carry a pleasant view of a stand at anfield .
negative	he also stood a very real risk of ripping the shirt at the same time which i ' m surprised about as the average letter - box isn ' t exactly smooth inside ....
negative	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn ' t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn ' t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
negative	still , looking at other reviews , at_least it wasn ' t left inside a bin or with thieves in the neighbourhood .
negative	where do i start ?
negative	well , my gf and i were looking into buying a car with cash but decided to take a look at stebbings with a view to finance on a car .
negative	the first day we tried to view a car we were left waiting half an_hour without being seen ( and weren ' t ther only ones !)
negative	because it was a weekend and they only had 0 staff on .
negative	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars ....
negative	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
negative	the key itself was broken which should have been an omen but on we went , enjoyed the test_drive even_though the car had no diesel in at all so we had to go back the next_day to adctually drive it , all we could do was look !
negative	in the end we payed and left , then straight_away things went_downhill .
negative	the day we were due to pick_up the car the guy dealing_with us was off ill , they had no_idea we were even coming so had to wait while someone went off to find then clean the car in a hurry , must have taken over an_hour .
negative	the car went for it ' s mot before coming to us and failed with numerous advisorys which were conveniently absent from the mot we we given , though we know it had problems as it says on the governments own mot website !
negative	nothing at all was mentioned about them either .
negative	to pass the mot it needed a tyre , so they replaced just one even_though the other was near legal limit , wipers were replaced as the old ones weren ' t clearing the window even_though the " mark " was actually a huge scratch on the glass which really should not have passed , niether should the seatbelt that doesn ' t retract any faster_than it would take a snail to cover the same distance ( we ' re talking minutes here ).
negative	within 0 days we had the first engine fault light come up , having my own scanner i read the fault code and it told me the turbo was overboosting .
negative	when we rang them they claimed it was due to not being driven for a while and to give it a full_tank of fuel , suffice to say this didn ' t work .
negative	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
negative	dangerously when this light came on power would suddenly be lost leading to some very dangerous situations , not good when you have a gf and her 0 year_old in the car , performing what should easily be a safe text - book overtake .
negative	by the time we realised it wasn ' t going away we ' d already gone over 0000 miles , which is all they allow for under warantee .
negative	i wonder_why it ' s so low ( 0000 miles or 0 month )?
negative	*_cough * *_cough *.
negative	since then within 0 months the seat has broken , it ' s needed a new tyre , it turns_out they didn ' t service it at all so we had to spend over £_000 on that , it has continuously givn error codes and engine warning lights , various bits have fallen_off and to take the mickey now the turbo is only boosting at 0psi and we ' ve so far spent_hundreds without getting to the bottom of why it ' s so slow now , can ' t even keep up with a petrol tanker going up a hill ( true story :( ).
negative	also the steering_wheel column feels loose .
negative	their adverts currently state " we ' ll buy every car " and going by the standard they ' ll sell you any as well , even if it ' s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn ' t right it ' s too_late .
negative	the whole ordeal has been terrible and considering we spent over £ 0000 on a car what we ' ve had start to finish has been shockingly_bad , plus now we are stuck with a car that needs to last another 0 years but definately won ' t without thousands being spent :'( i would say please don ' t let them make a mug of you too , stay well away and use a company with a more professional approach who will sell you something you should rightly get for your money and not something that will make life hell or even worse kill you .
negative	so i sent my ohone in for repair on the 00th_may 0000 , today is the 0th_june_0000 and i still yet to recieve my phone back .
negative	i had to go into two phones0u stores and the people were not helpful at all , they didn ' t know what they were doing and ended_up having to speak to people over the phone .
negative	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .....
negative	the phone had a slight crack on the back so that had to be repaired before any warranty issues could be sorted out , they didn ' t email me saying that the back needed to be repaired i had to phone up chasing them .
negative	i once sent my old phone to htc and they repaired it and sent it back to me within a week , this is appalling and they have no excuse for taking so long
negative	i had never used this company before and first attempted booking my tickets online .
negative	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
negative	i walked to the beeston train_station today hoping that asking my questions in person would be the least frustrating and easiest_way to find answers .
negative	unfortunately , i was completely wrong .
negative	the blonde , 00 something year_old woman behind the glass window was rude , cold and frankly ... completely_useless .
negative	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
negative	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
negative	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
negative	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they ' ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
negative	!
negative	i was well aware i ' d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white background and doesn ' t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
negative	come on that ' s crazy !
negative	and there ' s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
negative	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
negative	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered £_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
negative	i rejected mazuma ' s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they ' d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
negative	think i ' ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it ' s still in working order !
negative	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform me they ' ve found a tiny yellow mark that ' s only visible on a white background (_eg .
negative	in the settings folder ) and therefore it ' s classed_as faulty and they ' ll only offer me £_00 !!
negative	!
negative	i understand a small drop in the price but i don ' t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
negative	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
negative	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
negative	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn ' t let me post this review on their website , funny that !
negative	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
negative	definitely wouldn ' t recommend , avoid at all costs !
negative	i booked a lesson on the bsm website for a certain_date but was very disappointed when after that date bsm had still not found me a driving instructor & did not even bother to contact me to inform me about the matter .
negative	i cancelled the lesson as i was disappointed with there poor service & asked for a refund i was told it would take seven working_days for a full_refund to be paid back in to my account , after seven day ' s i had still not received a refund i contacted bsm again to inform them about this when they assured me that a refund would be made right away only i was still_waiting for a refund seven_days after that .
negative	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
negative	i called in an electrician from service team to come and look at my underfloor_heating .
negative	i was told they would be at my home at 0am , they arrived at 000 am , without any call to confirm they were running_late .
negative	calling the office at 000 warranted no explanation ' i can ' t see his schedule '.
negative	the electrician arrived , and was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable .
negative	he quickly identified the problem and called a shop to confirm the price for a part (£_000_+_vat ).
negative	he went off to pick the part up , on his return , fitted the part , once fully fitted , he discovered the part was faulty and had a visible crack in the lcd_screen .
negative	he then took the part off the wall , packed it up , went back to shop and picked_up a new part .
negative	he fitted the new one and the heating was working again which was great .
negative	then came the invoicing .
negative	0 . 0 hours labour @ £ 00ph ( including 0 x visits to the shop ), and a part at £_000 , plus vat on top of all .
negative	total £_000 .
negative	i queried the price of the part , as it was £_000_+_vat i . e .
negative	£_000 , not £_000 , and certainly not £_000_+_vat .
negative	i was happy to pay for the electrician to pick_up the part once , but the part was visibly faulty and i was not happy to pay for him to pick the part up twice , adding on an extra half an_hour to my invoice .
negative	at this point it was 00am , when i queried the part and if i should have been double_charged the vat , i was told ' that ' s just the way we do it '.
negative	i was told ' you need to sign it and they ' ll call you before they debit your account '.
negative	so i signed and marked clearly i wanted to query the invoice before debiting .
negative	i did not receive a phonecall from service team , and by monday , they had auto debited the full invoice from my account .
negative	i called service team and explained the problem , they neglected to call me back or provide updates on the situation .
negative	two days after the initial query was raised i spoke to them again , and they confirmed they would call the electrician and confirm the prices , and get back to me .
negative	four days_later ( and one week after the electrician visited ), i still had no resolution , and no returned phone call from service team .
negative	i called them again , asking to escalate the matter .
negative	i was told a refund had been agreed but he could not tell me how much the refund was for .
negative	i was told my account_manager would call me back imminently to confirm the refund amount .
negative	an_hour later , still no phone call , i called them again , and was told i would get a refund of £_00 labour and £_00 for the part .
negative	he could not confirm if this included vat , which would bring the cost up to £_00 , and said he would investigate and call me back when the accounts team were in at 00am (!
negative	), and promptly hung_up .
negative	all in all , terrible service and incredibly_rude .
negative	the response times were awful .
negative	beware , do not supply your card_details as they will auto debit funds from your account .
negative	i would not use this company again , nor would i recommend their services .
negative	went into the derby store to buy a sim only deal because i already had a phone and just needed a sim_card for a few_months .
negative	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
negative	then my phone broke and i had to cancel the sim only deal .
negative	i went to the shop and was told they couldn ' t do it and i had to ring customer_services .
negative	after ringing the extortionate customer_service line , i was politely told that i had been misinformed by the shop and that i was on a 00 month business deal and had to pay £_000 to cancel it .
negative	i had not been told any of this information and was ever so slightly peeved .
negative	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
negative	never using aylesbury tesco broadfield again .
negative	switched gas supplier from npower to sse in august last_year .
negative	npower put an estimated reading on my final_bill that was much higher_than my actual reading .
negative	i have spoken to them about 0 times now about this and i still don ' t have an amended bill .
negative	every time i ring their call_centre the wait time is around 00_minutes .
negative	it ' s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
negative	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
negative	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
negative	upon calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
negative	apparently they were delivered 0 days_later by which point , was too_late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
negative	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
negative	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
negative	trying to get a refund but it ' s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
negative	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
negative	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing ones .
negative	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter ' s birthday and found this site .
negative	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
negative	they said it would be dispatched within_00hrs ; it wasn ' t .
negative	our daughter ' s birthday was on 00 july and despite numerous_emails and phonecalls ( more of which later ), we decided to cancel the order , which we did on 00 july_0000 and had to go to argos and buy one in store for significantly more money .
negative	in cancelling , we formally requested a full_refund , but despite numerous further emails and phonecalls ( definately some more later !)
negative	we still do not have a refund , and today is 00 spetember 0000 .
negative	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
negative	by the way , in relation to the phone_calls , don ' t bother ringing them , it simply a voicemail message_telling you to email them ..... now thats customer_service .
negative	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
negative	for anyone_else considering using these people , please seriously consider whether its worth it .
negative	chris
negative	i ordered a nikon l000 and case on 00 july_0000 , they said it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days , it wasn ' t .
negative	i contacted them to ask what was going on as i needed it for a birthday_present and had ordered in good faith expecting delivery within timescales advertised .
negative	email response simply said they couldn ' t gaurentee when i ' d get it .... not good enough .
negative	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
negative	i spoke to their customer_services who said i ' d get a refund within 0 - 0 days and also got an_email confirmation that they ' d received my cancellation .
negative	i still_haven ' t received my refund and have had to resort to raising a dispute with my bank to see if they can get me my money back .
negative	i will never use this company again and would warn anyone_else from dealing_with them too .
negative	i took out van insurance , which i was told would mirror my no claims from the car .
negative	0 weeks on i have been told that it was mis sold - in order to mirror the no claims i have to be 00 ( which i am in 0 months ), but the sales_advisor didn ' t check this criteria thus mis sold me the insurance !
negative	they have cancelled and refunded in full - but now i ' m stuck without insurance and since i can ' t mirror the no claims i have to pay £_000 more - i wouldn ' t have bought the van had they have informed me when quoting !
negative	avoid !
negative	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone call stating they will be cancelling my items !
negative	wont be using ever again !
negative	as an_avid user of parcels0go , i recently had a terrible experience .
negative	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
negative	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
negative	0 weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
negative	what a joke !
negative	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
negative	!
negative	use someone who actually care about the customer !
negative	without_doubt the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i purchased 0 large bags of dog_food from this company and after using the first one ( which took a couple of months to get through ) opened the 0nd to find it mouldy .
negative	i contacted feedem ( within the 0 months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
negative	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
negative	i contacted them again clearly stating my consumer right and was ignored ( up to 0 times so far ) so got my local citizens_advice to contact them - again they made out i was in the wrong ( changing the reason they were refusing a refund !!).
negative	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .
negative	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has taught me this .
negative	the proof of a company with good customer_service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i ' m not the only one who thinks so ).
negative	i would give 0_stars if the review allowed it .
negative	we received a confirmation_email_saying the order had been received , we also received a notification of dispath , but have not received anything yet .
negative	we have tried to contact by phone and email but cannot get an answer .
negative	i will be reporting this to credit_card company to try get my money back
negative	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0 weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
negative	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
negative	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special occasion .
negative	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
negative	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
negative	i sent countless emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
negative	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
negative	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
negative	i was then told it would be this week .
negative	i still_haven ' t had a refund !
negative	!
negative	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer_service ' has been diabolical from start to finish !
negative	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
negative	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
negative	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
negative	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
negative	customer_service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	just didn ' t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother ' s day .
negative	left my mother waiting all day for them .
negative	had no customer_service available on the sunday itself , so i waited until the monday .
negative	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
negative	i finally got an_email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
negative	at full cost .
negative	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
negative	i couldn ' t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
negative	i don ' t think i ' ve ever been so angry .
negative	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
negative	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
negative	a week_later , they replied , sending a claim_form because they said it had been despatched .
negative	i returned the claim_form , and waited .
negative	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
negative	a week_later again , still nothing , so i asked them to just give me a refund .
negative	another week_later , still nothing , so i filed a paypal_dispute .
negative	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
negative	---
negative	" your first return back to us as -- not called for
negative	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
negative	due to the christmas break and office open on 0th do not help with the delays in answer emails or phone ,
negative	there has been breakdown in the internet which has deleted the emails ."
negative	---
negative	so ...
negative	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
negative	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
negative	( 0 ) " you did not pick_up the item " all capitalised .
negative	not the most professional way to deal with your customers is it ?
negative	( 0 ) the christmas / new year break has no relevance whatsoever - the total_lack of communication all dates from after the 0th of january .
negative	( 0 ) " there has been breakdown in the internet ".
negative	classic , absolutely classic !
negative	so in all , it ' s full of excuses , and it took the threat of a claim against them through paypal , before they ' d do anything .
negative	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
negative	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn ' t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
negative	sent three emails so far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
negative	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
negative	what a story .......
negative	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response ......... then i wrote on this site ........ then got a response , agreed on a refund ........... returned item ........ heard_nothing again ............ 0 emails later ......,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i don ' t care my phone case was £_00 .....,,,, i have had enough !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want my ££££ back !!!!
negative	!
negative	in nov i stated my family were solicitors and i was going to
negative	proceed with this case against nice cans , as from the weekend the case as been constructed and i will proceed to court in order to
negative	close this company down .
negative	i will update all events on this site !!
negative	!
negative	plus de 0 ans que_je_suis cliente chez asos .
negative	et_je vois le sav se dégrader au fil des années .
negative	commande effectuée le 00 / 00 pour une livraison annoncée le 00 / 00 ( option livraison 00h facturée à 00 €).
negative	rien reçu le 00 / 00 et quand je relance le sav via facebook , j ' ai un gentil message qui m ' informe que_je serais tout naturellement livré le 00 / 00 .
negative	ils savent compter chez asos .
negative	quand je leur explique qu ' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas récupérer le colis et qu ' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me répond : " on ne fait plus ça m ' dame " !
negative	bah oui , ils faisaient mais plus maintenant .
negative	merci asos pour tant d ’ efficacité .
negative	i have bought 0 x replacement bowls for kenwood kitchen machine .
negative	i received one bowl few_days_later and there was no invoice included .
negative	we sent email to as sufficient response to ask what was happening and received automated email few minutes later reassuring that my issue will be look at by 0ourhouse . co . uk customer_service .
negative	0 weeks_later and nothing has happened .
negative	i sent another email directly to 0ourhouse . co . uk , one month later no response .
negative	because i lost only about £ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
negative	very disappointed with this company and will_definitely never order again .
negative	cheers to that .
negative	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
negative	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
negative	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
negative	requesting a refund .
negative	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
negative	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
negative	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an_email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
negative	draw your own conclusions ...
negative	hi ,
negative	i purchased 0 tickets about a month_ago to see russell peters last_night in o0_arena , when i was going through gates my tickets wouldn ' t work .
negative	i was told the seller has probably cancelled my tickets and got duplicates of theirs .
negative	so the seller was sitting on my seats .
negative	i emailed viagogo , asking for refund and explanation .
negative	cause nobody contacted me regarding any changes .
negative	i ' m still_waiting for response .
negative	oto horacek
negative	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
negative	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
negative	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn ' t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
negative	when i finally got through to the advisor on the end of the line , my order reference was taken and then i was cut_off when i was put back onto hold .
negative	i have never_experienced worse customer_service than with three uk .
negative	i paid for internet , and they couldn ' t help me get it working .
negative	they kept telling_me they ' d send me the details i needed via text , and they ' d never come through .
negative	i spoke with over 0 different people and all of them were unhelpful and borderline rude .
negative	now i asked for a refund , and they said they can ' t do a refund , but they ' d be happy to issue a credit to my account .
negative	they said their system can ' t process refunds ( which is clearly a lie ).
negative	i am just so frustrated - and am out the money i paid for a month , which is very frustrating since i didn ' t even use the service !
negative	switching cell services for sure .
negative	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
negative	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
negative	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
negative	yet after getting a phone call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
negative	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
negative	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
negative	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
negative	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
negative	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
negative	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
negative	i accidently purchased 0 units of the same order off their website .
negative	it did not give me the option to confirm the order .
negative	i tried_calling and messaging via_email .
negative	all attempts of communication did not seem to be effective at all as i got no response on my query .
negative	they still took money from my account and i still have not received any of the orders regardless .
negative	i would advise people never to use the website .
negative	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn ' t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
negative	paypal is okay when you don ' t have an issue , but when the time comes that you do , you will witness what a horrible company it really is .
negative	don ' t take my word for it , there are thousands of victims of chargeback fraud telling their stories online and websites dedicated to exposing paypal .
negative	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer_service ( call_centre ).
negative	hollow_promises about how they are ' on the seller ' s side '.
negative	frustrating bureaucracy and automated customer_service that can ' t answer your problem .
negative	i will do everything i can to avoid using paypal ever in my life .
negative	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .
negative	went to reception and they put me through to internet provider , got it fixed but when i went up to the room again , wifi lost signal again , spent half the night in reception trying to fix it .
negative	second night there was noise in the halls and noise from car_park / streets , therefore that was another night with hardly any sleep .
negative	only stayed there 0 nights .
negative	also tried_contacting customer_services and when i eventually got through to them they were no help at all .
negative	if you are staying in glasgow i would not recommend premier_inn .
negative	i think the title_says it all .
negative	i got lured by the promise of 00_%_off , which never materialised in my basket , despite complying with the t &_cs .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , they took too long to get back to me , meaning the code wasn ' t valid anymore .
negative	they waffled on in bad english about something , which did not make sense .
negative	then they refused to honour their promo .
negative	very disappointed :(
negative	i think the header sums it up : placed an order , did not receive it , or any replies to my messages chasing it .
negative	i ' ve ended_up opening a claim with paypal , hopefully i ' ll get at_least my money back !
negative	first and last order with iwoot .
negative	it ' s all in the one - liner .
negative	broadband is unreliable .
negative	when you are finally out of contract you have to jump_through hoops to cancel .
negative	stay well away from them !
negative	i used to have virgin and they were much_better .
negative	update 0 weeks_later :
negative	oooh how it ' s been going on and on and on ...
negative	they cut_off my line and wifi the day after i called to give my month ' s notice .
negative	cue endless calls , emails , and finally got someone to reply to me via_twitter .
negative	close to a month later ( i ' m moving next week ), nothing has been fixed and i " cannot get a refund because the cause of the problem is unknown ".
negative	really ?
negative	well i know the cause : you ' re incompetent and would rather go to court than pay a penny to you - for the service i absolutely did not get : no internet , no phone and no customer_service !
negative	i wish i could give zero as a rating .
negative	utter muppets .
negative	firstly the website : not user_friendly , search for something using the filters on ebay and you ' ll see how a big site should function .
negative	secondly the delivery : i ' ve had one delivery where they couldn ' t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
negative	another time , the express next_day delivery i paid for was cancelled on the day and i was reduced to super_saver .
negative	talk about late notice .
negative	i was left without an important present .
negative	then it took_ages to arrive ( citylink dramas same old )
negative	finally customer_service : talk about not what they claim .
negative	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
negative	they never actually answer questions in emails or on the phone .
negative	they just skirt around the issues , unless you email the same questions more concisely three of four times .
negative	i know they ' re a massive company and they brand themselves well , but if you ' re one of the cases where it goes_wrong , you quickly lose any love you had for them .
negative	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley face on the box ( a bit like apple ...)
negative	my phone was in mint_condition sent it to rpc with quote they know i off over £_000 original asking price .
negative	mazuma_mobile took my phone for same price and gave me what they quote don ' t he same day .
negative	steer_clear of this company .
negative	trustpilot a blatently allowing the online homebrew company to abuse this service and mislead customers .
negative	this renders trustpilot completely pointless .
negative	i placed my order for a few beer kits and a fermenting barrel with a tap on the 00th_september .
negative	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
negative	this was acceptable and i proceded .
negative	over the next four weeks all the items in my order were in and out of stock and nothing was recieved .
negative	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
negative	other communications made took 0 and 0 days to be responded to to try and find out what was going on .
negative	after over four weeks ( 00 / 00 ) i recieved half my order which included the fermenting barrel but with no tap and a note saying the tap would follow .
negative	nearly another week past and i recieved the rest of my order , still no tap .
negative	today over 0 weeks_later ( 00 / 00 ) i have still not recieved the tap despite being assured that four have now been sent .
negative	i have no_problems with any post from any other company .
negative	i requested a refund via post around two_weeks_ago and was told one last attempt would be made to ship a tap .
negative	still nothing .
negative	i again have requested a refund which i am not confident of recieving .
negative	terrible delivery .
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	terrible communication .
negative	i should have known not to trust a company with no phone contact .
negative	i will be taking my custom to my local homebrew shop from now on .
negative	it ' s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
negative	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no tap recieved as expected .
negative	still no refund recieved .
negative	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has been passed to the appropriate person '.
negative	i have had this response twice .
negative	how long can it possibly take to process a refund ??
negative	absolutely pathetic service .
negative	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no refund .
negative	still no response other than ' your request has been passed_onto the appropriate person '.
negative	00 weeks tomorrow since i placed my order .
negative	i have bought ticket for cat empire concert with id_0000000 .
negative	the ticket i received does not seem legit ; it is in grey scale and it does not include price .
negative	i have asked them about it and although they originally they are going to resolve my issue within 00_hours , now it has been a week and no response .
negative	i have tried to use their contact form but no response .
negative	they are crap in user experience .
negative	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave me more_than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung jet .
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	stay_away from these !
negative	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
negative	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman ' s , small jacket - i am a man ).
negative	when i rang up they offered me another jacket with a different brand which i did not want so they offered me a refund but only when they collected the woman ' s jacket .
negative	i managed to find this jacket else where , but as a result of the late refund , couldn ' t buy it as i didn ' t have the money .
negative	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn ' t have suffered on my trip .
negative	awful company .
negative	awful staff .
negative	stay_away from these , they are not worthy of your money
negative	they used to be the place to go to if you wanted a last_minute holiday .... but now they ' re just as , if not more_expensive than a travel_agent .
negative	total_waste of time .
negative	limited hotels etc too !
negative	substituted an alcoholic beverage for one of a lesser quality , which if i ' d of bought elsewhere would have been £ 0 cheaper ... told me i could take it back to the store , which considering i was having a party and the order turned_up 0 hour before was totally un realistic .
negative	offered no compensation , said he would inform the store and that was it !
negative	never ordering from them again
negative	shipping can be delayed ... which is frustrating .
negative	cs don ' t know a great deal .
negative	pestered me for 00p when i ' d set_up direct_debit which they accidentally cancelled - damaging my credit score !
negative	said they would give me £_00 as compensation , and didn ' t !
negative	not impressed ...
negative	every time i have used this company there has been a problem .
negative	0st time i ordered 0 things .
negative	0 days_later i had not received anything .
negative	i had to ring up and contact them to find 0 of the 0 things were out of stock .
negative	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
negative	they then send me the wrong product .
negative	i then had to return it before waiting for them to send the right product .
negative	they offered my 0 %_off my next order .
negative	when i tried to use this , the code they gave did did not work .
negative	says everything .
negative	i was then stupid enough to order yet again from them .
negative	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
negative	avoid !!
negative	!
negative	just to start off , i only selected 0 star because you had to choose , otherwise it would be - 00 ..
negative	if only i would of read reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
negative	originally joined them about 0 and a half years_ago with just internet and phone at my old address , while with them it was fine , the bill was never what we agreed to pay but we guessed it ' s probably like that with most companies .
negative	we recently decided to move house and when i contacted talktalk i realised they had forget to mention to me that the 0 year contract was up 0 months previous but they had put me on a rolling_contract .
negative	after i rang them i told the guy on the phone that i actually was going to move to sky as we wanted the tv channels etc .
negative	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0 weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
negative	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled ..
negative	the channels took about 0 / 00 seconds to change on a good day .. but most of the time would take about 0 - 0 minutes to change occasionally crashing and having to be completely restarted !
negative	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
negative	i contacted talktalk after 0 months of this poop and they where completely cooperative saying they understand it was their mistake , they will cancel my contract without having to incur any early cancellation_fees , they would send me a bag and all i had to do was send them their tv box .
negative	it was great , i found an amazing deal with sky !
negative	i mean literally all the tv_programmes , movies , sports , unlimited_internet , phone etc for about £_00 per_month !
negative	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about £_000 . 00 from talktalk .
negative	i rang up to dispute this and they said they had made a mistake and they would wipe the debt , however they could only wipe £_000 . 00 of it because £_000 . 00 of it was for the cost of the talktalk box although i still hadn ' t received the bag to send the box back in the post .
negative	they said they would send one out straight_away .
negative	a few weeks_later i received a reminder from talktalk that if i didn ' t pay them their money which had gone up from the original debt , they would pass me on to debt collections .
negative	i rang straight_away and said how_dare they threaten me when its their problem , they apologised a lot said they made a note on the account and then told me they would send out another bag and that they made a note on the account .
negative	i then received the bag in the post and at the same time i received a final reminder saying that they had not received the payment and if they don ' t within the next few_days they would pass the account onto debt_collectors , i rang talktalk furious saying i had only just received the bag and that i was planning to send the item out that day , they said that ' s fine as long as they receive it i will be okay , the guy on the phone even told me he would personally ring me back on friday which was about 0 days_later , and that he had made a note on the account .
negative	on friday i had no phone call , however i did receive a letter from a debt collecting agency saying that my account had been passed_onto them and that talktalk want their money .
negative	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do .. he said talktalk don ' t have an_email address for me to contact them but i told him i refuse to ring them again .
negative	i doubt they actually do write a note on the account , it seems like people on here have mutual feeling about talktalk .
negative	i am absolutely_furious , this has caused me stress , i have spent so much money ringing them up and being on hold , one time for 00_minutes !!!
negative	and my ordeal isn ' t even over yet !
negative	avoid talktalk !
negative	!
negative	from this advice :
negative	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
negative	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
negative	to this :
negative	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
negative	where you would change the ticket you have to a refundable ticket ( which you would need to buy )."
negative	had finished a phone call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus £_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of £_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
negative	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound journey dates had been changed .
negative	ongoing .
negative	i havent even made it to be a talk_talk customer ...
negative	thankgod .
negative	i was just about to take out a deal for broadband and calls with them .
negative	they were offering a £_000 love to shop voucher with their deal .
negative	when the time came to agree to the deal i asked about the voucher - they then stated that instead of the voucher they were giving me ' free instilation '.
negative	i then stated on teh webside it is advertised as free instilation and the voucher .
negative	after the advisor put me on hold she then came back to tell me ' the voucher had expired at midnight last_night '.. i then explained teh website has a countdown and is advertinsing it as 00 more hours until expiry and also stated to the end of the day .
negative	when she said i was wrong .. i then said okay not thankyou i will be going to another company ( sky ) who were doing a similar deal for about £ 0 . 00 more .
negative	she then shouted at me down the phone calling em a liar and that no other company cn offer me a good deal liek this .
negative	i explained i had phoned sky up about 0 hours prior and have all the quotes i need .
negative	the woman then persisted to tell me that they are nto allowed to give me free instilation and that they cannot do em a deal as good as them because ' they are teh cheepest in britain '.
negative	i explained tot he woman i would nto be arguing with her , and i was stating teh information i had recieved and my quote should not concern her .
negative	she then continued to raise her voice and argue ..
negative	i ended_up hanging up on talk_talk .
negative	who argues and called new potiential customers ' liars '.
negative	haha im so glad i have not gone with this company .
negative	i can see problems and troubles ahead .
negative	do not go with talk_talk .
negative	my partner and i had a fancy_dress party to go to so we picked out two costumes and paid extra for next_day delivery .
negative	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
negative	after ages spent trying to get their " customer_service " on the phone i was instructed the product ordered was not in stock ( thanks for letting us know !)
negative	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
negative	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
negative	however the next_day having arrived and you guessed it no costume .
negative	below par service on every_single principle a business should be run !
negative	my advice ?
negative	avoid !
negative	i ordered some pandora charms 0 weeks_ago .
negative	they never arrived and i have contacted achica twice to ask for an update .
negative	the excuse provided was : unfortunately due to the volume of goods physically received the distribution centre are slightly behind in despatching the orders .
negative	surely this is not a valid reason ?
negative	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
negative	this is what any proper company would do !!
negative	and , to make_matters worse , i have still not received my order .
negative	don ' t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
negative	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don ' t offer compensation .
negative	pathetic response and truly reflects the 0rd class service they offer .
negative	i sincerely say to future customers , don ' t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !
negative	bought some stuff from a trade supplier forgetting that they use parcel_force , paid £_00 . 00 for am delivery for today .
negative	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without any one spotting the mistake .
negative	at 00 . 00_hours there still in belfast
negative	do not use parcel_force please
negative	i have bought washing maschine as in stock and i paid for next_day delivery after that ive been waiting 0 weeks for delivery
negative	very rude customer_service
negative	i will never use apliances direct again
negative	stay clear away from this " company ", it is the biggest ripoff i have ever come_across and wasn ' t able to do anything about it !
negative	these reviews on trustpilot are soooo not reliable and i assume they are fake , after my bad_experience with doyouspain . com i checked tripadvisor . com and read all the horror oboe things about them , i wish i had read them ...
negative	my experience :
negative	ripoff no . 0 :
negative	i rented a car in gran_canaria which supposed to cost 00 £ roughly according to their website , i received emails quick witch confirmations etc .
negative	they kept sending me mails about " insurance ", to buy it through doyouspain . com for like 00 - 00 £ otherwise i ' d be paying around 00 € at the airport in gran_canaria .
negative	i thought to myself , i do not need an insurance .
negative	once i got to gran_canaria i was told i have to buy an insurance for 00 € or i pay them 000 € just in case something happens as deposit , 000 € is ridiculous anyway ...
negative	i got so upset and said " ok , charge my card 000 € i don ' t want to pay for insurance ", the lady was obviously not expecting this response and said that debit_cards cannot be charged 000 € and literally forced me to take up the insurance !
negative	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
negative	on to the next thing they ripped me off with .
negative	ripoff no . 0 :
negative	she then told me that i have to pay for the fuel that is in the car .
negative	i suddenly became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don ' t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 £ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
negative	so , i got scared that i end up with no car because of the season and overpaid .
negative	guess_what they charged me for fuel ....?
negative	i had to pay 00 € for fuel which seems to be normal when you ' re from the uk or germany , but i drove the car nuts so i ran out of the fuel and had to refuel the car .
negative	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel costs like 0 , 00 € or 0 , 00 € which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
negative	i thought ok , i fuel the car with 00 € and guess_what ...
negative	the tank was half full !!!
negative	!
negative	this was a modern way of riping off people !
negative	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
negative	!
negative	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :
negative	we ordered our internet online .
negative	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
negative	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
negative	they even lie to us by saying that they won ' t be doing it .
negative	as i can proof it through my bank state i am on a quite certain side .
negative	additionally their service people never any clue about our package or any service we have ordered .
negative	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
negative	further they keep on sending us bills we should pay for we have not ordered .
negative	let ' s see where this is leading to .
negative	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
negative	just annoying this company !
negative	my recommendation : stay_away from talk_talk , you will regret signing_up !
negative	i have used just_eat many a time as it ' s easier for me to pay by card rather_than cash .
negative	everytime i order through the website it takes the double the time if i call and pay by cash .
negative	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
negative	why would i order and pay an extra charge to order through a website for collection .
negative	i then had to ring the takeaway place who said they are delivering the order and to ignore just_eat as they had asked them to get this sorted many_times .
negative	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
negative	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .
negative	its clear just_eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
negative	wont be using again - would far rather pay the high prices for deliverence with much_better service levels if i find myself in a cashless situation again .
negative	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
negative	well i say delivered , that is if being chucked outside the wrong house in the rain .
negative	customer_service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
negative	absolutely_useless !
negative	use at your own peril f - 0 / 0
negative	hello
negative	this is the third time i ' m writing you .
negative	it ' s been more_than 00 !!!
negative	days .
negative	you send me preplanned messages without a real reference to my problem .
negative	please solve this problem .
negative	i paid you and still_haven ' t got my item .
negative	thanks
negative	alon
negative	we have been told for two days now that the mattress is being delivered " today ".
negative	neither day has it come .
negative	the first day the courier phoned me to say ' there was no flat number ' on the order and he had already left ; i asked him to phone the next_day before arrival so i could leave work to come for delivery .
negative	this afternoon i took the call , was in the flat within ten_minutes , but after waiting 00_minutes , nobody came .
negative	i could not get through to the courier despite ringing many_times , and in the end left a voicemail to say that i had to return to work .
negative	i was unable to get through to anyone at the delivery office , but will be trying to phone them in the morning .
negative	neither time has any note been left to say that someone has come to deliver and i haven ' t been there .
negative	as you can understand this is a very frustrating situation , especially_considering we ordered the mattress almost a week_ago .

negative	as you can understand this is a very frustrating situation , especially_considering we ordered the mattress almost a week_ago .
negative	i couldn ' t get though to customer_services by phone about delivery .
negative	i then sent 0 e_- mails to the supplied e mail address for dreams " customer_service " .
negative	all came back as undeliverable .
negative	i rang the local shop .
negative	they said they would confirm delivery on foot of payment .
negative	turns_out on probing the sales_person - before i actually placed any order - that it can ' t in fact be delivered for up to 0 weeks .
negative	she was very slow in imparting this key information .
negative	the past 00st of october i bought a htc phone .
negative	after 00 days ( 00 working_days ) i have not got my phone yet .
negative	actually , it has not been even shipped yet .
negative	it stays on status " order handling ".
negative	i called at_least 00 times to the customer_service ( uk ) and nobody never picked_up the phone .
negative	since the last few_days , the customer_service phone does not even work ( just the machine that says press 0 to ... press 0 ...).
negative	they replied to my emails saying something like my item was on high_demand .
negative	but the fact is that when i bought it , the item was on stock ( and actually it still is on the website ).
negative	so , it means that what the website says is not true .
negative	i ' m very frustrated about this and feel_like i have been defrauded .
negative	this is the first time i ' ve tried using them .
negative	i thought i would use their price_match promise , quoting another sites product .
negative	all they did was cancel my order with them .
negative	as i ' ve started keeping discus i ' m currently buying lots of equipment but i won ' t be using them again .
negative	i also just bought the items from their competitor .
negative	this is the email they sent me
negative	hi stephen ,
negative	we have investigated your price_match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
negative	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
negative	in this situation if the competitor has the item ( s ) in stock and will honour their advertised price we would recommend going with them .
negative	kind_regards [_name ]

negative	as with others , i ordered the big_boy beanbag on 0th_november as a christmas_present for my daughter , delivery date of week 00 which has just been put back until week 0 !
negative	furious .
negative	very bad service !
negative	waiting for item for a week and asked for a review in between so here it is .
negative	no item received no email_saying when it could be delivered .
negative	paid £_000_+ for trainers that i found slightly_cheaper afterwards with next_day delivery .
negative	not happy .
negative	i would not recommend that any one use xln they do not offer any customer_service .
negative	took for 0 weeks to get connected to broadband with them .... yes i should have know better at that stage .
negative	prices were to be lower that bt (£ 00 . 00 per_month with bt ) over £_00 . 00 per_month when we asked to cancel they wish to charge £_000 . 00 cancellation_fee and now they again say they offer better prices than bt .
negative	do not use them ... they write their own reviews
negative	i placed my order on 00feb order itself didn ' t ship until the 00 and now its 0 mar ... and i ' m still_waiting .
negative	should have just gone with bodybuilding . com which gets their stuff out here in 0 days tops .
negative	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge ... that is outrageous !
negative	i bought a salad from my local asda and when i was about to eat it i found a dead caterpillar inside it .
negative	i took picture of it and called the head_office they said i need to give it back to the store and they will give me the refund and investigate and i will be sent a goodwill voucher .
negative	when i went to return the salad the lady on the counter served a lady before me who left her pregnancy test strip on the desk , the lady said ohhh she left her dirty strip here then she covered her hand and picked_up the strip to chuck it in the bin and dint even apologize to me before serving me .
negative	i called the head_office to see whats_happening with my case and i was told that its registered as a complaint and if i wanted them to investigate then i should have told them , after that they took my details and the manager of the local asda called to say sorry . i sent an_email after that but i guess its case dismissed .
negative	i bought the 00_%_off get bike deal .
negative	i was told that i can book the day anytime and the voucher is valid till jun 0000 , but yesterday i checked my account and it showed £_00 . 00 taken out already and was over drawn so ill be charged on top , even_though i did not call the centre to book my day of training .
negative	i sent an_email to groupon for refund but no reply yet .
negative	problem started when i asked xln to transfer the broadband from one line to another ( i had 0 phone_lines from xln ).
negative	instead they ceased one phone line as well as the broadband .
negative	i called their customer_service and was told that the line was ceased due to a ' system error ' while broadband due to severe weather_conditions , which i obviously knew was an utter_rubbish .
negative	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
negative	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer_service .
negative	i have received a letter telling_me that i will have to pay £_000 termination charges .
negative	i called their cancellation department and explained the situation and loss of business i suffered due to their incompetencies .
negative	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
negative	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
negative	i booked a hostel on hostelworld . com and the hostel itself informed me that they overbooked .
negative	when i asked for a refund of the deposit , hostelworld said they ' ll look_into it and then never replied since .
negative	a decent operation , like my credit_card company , would refund first then look_into it .
negative	they attempted delivery , didn ' t bother to call my mobile , didn ' t leave a card .
negative	they have delivered my parcel to the wrong person , then asked me to contact the supplier from ebay .
negative	i ' m ringing them now but ive been waiting for 00_mins to get through to someone .
negative	i just found out that for every undelivered item you take back to the depot , you the driver gets £_00 deducted from the wage .
negative	which explains why they dump parcels anywhere so they get maximum wage .
negative	no wonder you delivered my parcel to the wrong person .
negative	worst experience ever !
negative	one of their manager offered me a new promotion tv , unlimited_broadband and calls for £_00 . 00 / month for 00months with a £_00 voucher .
negative	but whn i called talktalk customer_service to track my order , i was told that there was no record on my account about new promotion or anything .
negative	i could not believe myself that the very big company like talktalk can do like this to the customer .
negative	talktalk just not being honest to its customers and do not really care about them .
negative	i am very disappointed now and will never recommend talktalk service to anyone i know .
negative	plus , we need to wait an engineer for almost 0 weeks to visit my house .
negative	i ordered an iphone 0 online with this company back in september and had to pay £_00 deposit which would come off my 0th bill .
negative	i cancelled the contract after a week after orange said they did not know when i ' d receive the phone and i would get my £_00 back within a month .
negative	a month had past and still no refund !
negative	after spending 0 hours on the phone getting transferred from one department to the next the phone went dead ( lines had closed ) ring again the following_day and was told i would receive my refund in 00 days .
negative	00 days_later and still nothing !
negative	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
negative	it ' s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
negative	who do they think they are ?
negative	if i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it !
negative	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening legal_action !
negative	like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for my money back .
negative	will never go with orange in the future !
negative	i just called in asking for information on pricing plans and the american woman couldn ' t get me off the phone quick enough .
negative	when the first person , [_name ], picked_up , he picked_up on someone_elses phone ; " hello [_name ] phone , [_name ] speaking ", so was unable to deal with me and was rustling the phone around unprofessionally .
negative	i was then passed to an abrupt woman who wanted to " cut the call short " as she also was " on someone_else phone and had a meeting to get to ".
negative	she didn ' t disagree with me when i stated " i understand i ' m not important " and she proceeded to say " yes , goodbye ".
negative	i am upset with the lack of care and it worries me how these_guys seem to be on other_peoples phones and picking_up calls without having the time to speak with their customers .
negative	i have no doubt they ' ll leave a reply saying how wrong i am and how good they are , but it ' s rubbish .
negative	they sound professional on the phone , have no manners ( the voicemail left by [_name ] was " yeah hi erm ..." and generally seem like an exceptionally poor organisation .
negative	this is of course my opinion only .
negative	i would like to add that these people have now emailed me stating they refuse for their staff to be named and have edited it and furthermore find the word i used to describe the organisation , " coarse ".
negative	to this i ' d say ; " get out a little more love .
negative	if you think moderate language that can be said on day time american tv " coarse ", then you clearly don ' t socialise ."
negative	but of course , they won ' t speak with me regarding this .
negative	oh and by the way , they do allow names of employees in the reviews , cause i ' ve got a handful here with full employee names on reviews .
negative	just cause this review isn ' t positive on the poor business , doesn ' t mean they can moderate my free speech .
negative	but yet they tried .
negative	poor , poor business skills .
negative	this is my review .
negative	i took a sim only contract direct with tmobile in the hope to build up some good credit history with the network , upon doing this i applied for a deal with carphonewarehouse for the sony_xperia z , this went through fine and i was delivered the handset and sim_card the following_day .
negative	it was coming up to my partners_birthday and he seemed to really like my phone so i asked him if he would like one , he said yes so we went direct to tmobile in - store to get his phone , this was not an issue , credit check went through swimmingly and was handed another new sony_xperia z and my partner was happy , a few_days_later my handset ( from cpwh ) started_playing up , the internet wouldn ' t load and phone_calls became muffled , i then phoned carphone_warehouse in order to report the fault and was told it was a sim error and to call tmobile customer_service .
negative	i did this and the person on the end of the phone said that they had the number listed but my name was not on the account listed for this number which got me rather confused and irate , not to mention worried !
negative	i then phoned carphonewarehouse back and explained what customer_service at tmobile had said , the lady in cpwh store asked me to come in so i agreed , hoping that there was going to be a solution to this problem , after all , it just seemed like a simple error that needed correcting ( how mistaken was i )!
negative	later that afternoon i visited my local cpwh store and explained the problem and the sales_person seemed helpful and gave me a new handset as there may have been a fault causing the internet not to load and other faults , she phoned tmobile who said that their systems were down and to call back in an_hour so naturally my partner and i paced the town_centre for an_hour and then went back into store to be greeted_by the same lady as before , she phoned tmobile who again said that this number was not linked to my name and in fact somebody_else ' s .
negative	after a lengthy conversation , it turns_out that i had actually been declined a handset by cpwh , they had in fact done their own credit check which was passed , only subject to a second check by the network_provider which was tmobile , this credit check takes up to a couple of days and cpwh send out a handset under the assumption that you will pass the networks own check , this wouldn ' t have been a problem if i hadn ' t have gone to the tmobile store to take out the second handset because i passed tmobile ' s credit check in - store , it cancelled out the one i had already taken out from carphonewarehouse which had actually just declined the check ( four days after the handset was delivered ), i was then asked to return the handset to the sales_person and was left with no phone because i had already sold mine !
negative	in essence , why are carphonewarehouse handing out handsets before all credit_checks are complete , i ' m now without a phone and have had my credit_rating destroyed due to being declined a second line which i wouldn ' t have attempted to get if i had known this was going to happen !
negative	do not trust carphonewarehouse unless you want to keep your phone for a week and have it taken away from you !
negative	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd january and didn ' t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
negative	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
negative	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren ' t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
negative	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
negative	had my phone stolen whilst abroad in 0000 and never got a crime reference .
negative	i phoned orange the day i got back and they point_blank told me i was not a customer of orange .
negative	i did not exist at my address and my name was nowhere to be found .
negative	i stopped receiving letters / bills from orange in the post so was left confused but wasn ' t much else i could do .
negative	eight whole months later , i then receive a threat letter saying that i owe an extortionate sum of money , near £_000 . 00 completely out of the blue .
negative	obviously some dirty tactics to extort customers rather_than provide a good service for them .
negative	i contacted the ceo or orange via an_email address i found online ( executive . office @ ee . co . uk ) and the responses i ' ve been getting since then are lesser quality than an infant the age of 00 months old .
negative	they don ' t seem to understand whats happened and apparently this is my fault .
negative	its my fault orange are so incapable of sending bills or being_able to locate customers when they call in .
negative	i will no doubt never be using orange or ee , ever , ever again and will now be taking_legal_action_against them .
negative	trustpilot was just the start .
negative	i will be doing anything and everything in my power to prevent anyone and everyone to use this company .

negative	i have come home from work a third day to find yet another yellow calling_card .
negative	yesterday was bad enough after i went on the web_site to say " leave with any neighbor ".
negative	i also sent an_email to customer_services to find out why a neighbor was not tried but they failed to answer me .
negative	so twice me going to the web_site to say leave with a neighbor , and still i am parcel - less .
negative	today i have tried the 0000 000 0000 and waited 00_minutes only to not be answered .
negative	you know my number and you just leave it ring ... very professional .
negative	i have an animal ( pony ) suffering in pain and discomfort all because dpd can ' t be bothered to knock on a few doors to deliver a parcel !!!
negative	!
negative	leave in a safe_place , leave with any of my 000 neighbors but for gods sake please deliver my parcel .... worst of all you can ' t talk to a human and have racked up a phone bill trying to contact these people .
negative	never , ever will i use you or recommend you to anyone .
negative	this is just terrible .

negative	i have recently used wowcher to purchase some cufflinks from a company called illuminata jewels .
negative	they have not arrived and were not even sent .
negative	i have since read on the internet that this company has stolen money from lots of people and yet they are promoted through wowcher ?
negative	now i have to spend ages trying to get back my money if i get anything back at all .
negative	anyone_else having a problem with illuminata jewels ?
negative	my experience was not good with this company .
negative	i sent them my ipad 00gb as my on - line quote was £_000 - boxed , full working order , usb lead and in my opinion excellent condition as it has had a full cover on from day 0 .
negative	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of £_000 !
negative	i checked the website and i found in the time i had sent my ipad they had dramatically dropped the price of the trade in on ipad 0 which is fine , but i found they had rated my ipad in bad condition - scratched front and back , with a dent on the side apparently !
negative	i can understand there to be a difference in opinion for the condition but not by this much !
negative	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth £_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is £_000 they new price is now £_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the £_000 .
negative	all ' s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of £_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn ' t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
negative	i would never recommend o0 service to my friends or anyone .
negative	terrible service , they not only does not protect customer ' s private information but also give negative_comment while they ' re not relevant .
negative	firstly , i signed a contract for iphone_0s with relatively high cost 0 months_ago , almost 00pounds .
negative	but the service is not good as i expected .
negative	when i go out , for example , to my university or my friends ' house , i cannot call any one .
negative	poor service and poor 0g_network also .
negative	i just only use available wifi to contact people .
negative	then i just use the iphone_0s with wifi only because 0s ' feature for wifi is quite good , and swap the simcard to another alternative phone to call when really necessary .
negative	last month , i ' ve lost the iphone_0s , in my insurance contract with the super cover , they require me to contact the o0 asap .
negative	after i went to store , i had to wait for 0 hour for a queue when calling for the o0 centre , the staff didn ' t help me anything .
negative	few_days_later , i ask them for renew the simcard due to the needed to contact for my business .
negative	however , the simcard is useless , i called them and a man said i ask for blocking the handset and simcard , so now if i want to remove it , i have to wait .
negative	after a week of waiting and calling , wasting the time and out of pocket , they allow me to use the sim again .
negative	after that , the insurance company called me for putting the losing handset to the blacklist national , unless i would not claim the new phone .
negative	then i used the galaxy_s0 to call them and said the same_thing like the insurance wanted to put ip 0s to blacklisted handset , i don ' t know why they put the galaxy_s0 to blacklisted handset and don ’ t know they ' ve already put ip0s or not , but the s0 in this moment is unable to use until now when i really need a phone to contact people .
negative	then i call them to unblock the simcard to put the new one into the iphone 0 .
negative	few_days_later , the insurance called me again and ask why i didn ' t put the ip0s to the blacklist , they ask me to call to the o0 together so they can talk directly to o0 .
negative	we meet a grumpy man , wonder he has power or not , but he speak very quickly and we can ' t hear at the first time .
negative	then , the insurance ask him to put the ip0s to the blacklist ,..
negative	he said i called for them and put my handset , galaxy_s0 to the blacklist last_week ( meanwhile i mean the ip0s with its imei and contract number ), and said that the ip0s was not used with the simcard since many months_ago ( due to the very bad services so i can ' t let it work with bad simcard ) instead i use this simcard in galaxy_s0 , and then he also said i many_times call them to block the simcard and remove and block handset and remove ( while the o0 customer_service misunderstand and they blamed this is my fault ).
negative	he also reasons that i have not lost the ip0s , and then read a long list when i used ip0s , and didn ' t use it anymore , and change to s0 with detail for the insurance , and never know i hear all things .
negative	then he continue to infer i lost the ip0s many months_ago since i never used it from last_year while he ' s not relevant to the claim process and my private usage of the phone when i used both phone due to the very terrible service the provided me .
negative	finally , he concludes to the insurance staff " therefore she ( means me ) wound not claim the new phone from your company , right ?
negative	you should not let her claim ?!!!!"
negative	in a nutshell , im very disappointing and upset about the way o0 do business with their customers .
negative	they haven ' t respected the customer ' s information , tell the third_party anything whether it ' s private or not .
negative	accordingly , i ' ll never use this o0 again , and also never recommend to anyone to use it !!!!
negative	disgusting ....
negative	so far from very , on three different occasions
negative	hey det_var rigtigt dårligt mad og_det smagte ikke godt kun isen var god :-(
negative	they sent me an_email my order has been shiped and i checked with my wife she said she haven ' t received anything , so i again checked with them they tried to convince me that order has been shipped ... atlast i reported it as a scam
negative	ordered my bean_bag on 0nd nov , was told 0 weeks delivery , then go pushed to week 00 and now pushed to week 0 , now at the end of week 0 another nothing has arrived ...
negative	tried_emailing , no replied , no phone number to actually talk to anyone !
negative	waiting 0 months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
negative	will never buy from infurn again and am telling the world not to buy either
negative	after being referred by a colleague i decided to give this musclefood a go , i placed my first order and entered the ‘ hidden code ’ provided by my colleague , the offer was ; i would get 0 . 00kg of chicken_breast and he would get £ 0 off his next order .
negative	when the food arrived the ice had ( just i think ) which i did not complain_about , i looked out for the extra chicken which did not arrive .
negative	i ’ ve placed a second order a week_later with the musclefood hoping it would appear on the second order , this was not the case .
negative	i contacted musclefood , i received a very poor response advising that i had to enter the code into the special promotions box for which i replied back that it is exactly_what i have done , i received a call a few hours_later advising that i would not receive the extra chicken_breast as i did not enter the code , when i challenged it the advisor suggested that it was my fault and i should have been more careful when processing my first order .
negative	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has been handled , i would have spent close to £_000 a month -> £ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of £ 0 in chicken value .
negative	i live in keyingham and the coverage is shit .
negative	i come to hull and it ' s shit .
negative	i have an ee contract and it ' s brilliant .
negative	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
negative	where to start .
negative	firstly , speed checker on talk_talk ' s website provided an absurdly optimistic speed estimate for my area ( hither green , london ) presumably due to a software error .
negative	i ordered their standard broadband package expecting a service fast enough to do all the usual things you ' d expect from the internet in 0000 , streaming hd video , having more_than a couple of devices hooked up etc .
negative	anyway , we end up getting only 0 . 0mb down the line , the same speed i got on broadband a good 00 year_ago .
negative	the house is in zone 0 in london so geography can ' t be a problem , surely .
negative	anwyay , we made the call to upgrade to fibre and arranged over the phone for an engineer to make the installation on 00rd september and my flatmate booked the day off work to be there for the installation .
negative	00rd rolls around and no engineer shows up .
negative	phoned talk_talk and they say there ' s no record of anyone coming to make the installation and we ' d have to rebook another appointment ... the nearest one being 0 weeks away on 0rd october .
negative	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south african talktalk customer_service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
negative	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer_service representative then books me an_appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
negative	i ' m in germany with work that day so i ask her to change it to 0th_october when i have a day off work .
negative	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too_late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
negative	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
negative	at this point , i ' d had enough so i called customer_services who said they could put a note on the file to make provisions for compensation / credit but that i wouldn ' t be able to phone and sort this out until the bloody fibre service was installed .
negative	the employee couldn ' t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre ' s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
negative	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
negative	finally call the ( premium_rate ) phone line to book another appointment and the earliest date available is now 00th_october .
negative	what a surprise .
negative	so now i have to take a day off work in addition to the pointless day my flatmate has already wasted , adding up to c . £_000 of missed salary / holiday time .
negative	long_story short , save_yourself the hassle and go with bt or virgin .
negative	avoid using orange !
negative	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .
negative	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
negative	bad_experience do not use orange !!
negative	!
negative	this happened year ' s ago .
negative	i have not received any produce from them after i had ordered and paid a bluetooth headphone .
negative	i was trying to connect them .
negative	but still nobody reply me .
negative	it is really strange .
negative	fortunately , that is not too expensive .
negative	i just don ' t want to buy anything from them .
negative	first time customer , i ordered a toilet pan and basin and fixings , however the basin was out of stock and wouldn ' t be in until the 0th_august .
negative	i am doing full bathroom renovation and going on holiday at the end of august so could not wait on the basin coming into stock as i had to arrange plumber etc and it wouldn ' t leave me enough time to complete before holiday
negative	promptly called customer_service and cancelled full order due to out of stock item , lady very helpful and said will pass on to accounts to refund .
negative	0 dys later , no confirmation of refund , customers services say its not instant and can ' t tell me when it will be done
negative	they are very quick t take payment but i am now £_000 . 00 out of pocket and cannot get them to refund this anytime_soon .
negative	very close to calling my bank and telling them the situation and its not authorised transaction and the police also as its now fraud for keeping my money ...
negative	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again ....
negative	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
negative	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
negative	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
negative	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
negative	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
negative	this means that nothing has been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
negative	very frustrating !
negative	unacceptable service .
negative	waiting on refund for a suit which cost £_000 .
negative	emailed over three times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or inclination to look_into or deal with my query .
negative	just basically states it takes 00 days to issue a refund and i should contact them after this time period if not received .
negative	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
negative	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
negative	i do not understand how other stores refund within a matter of days and retain good communication with their customers other than topman is holding_onto my money to gain interest on it !
negative	warning to all avoid topman !
negative	!
negative	when i went there website for first time , i got a great response from their chat system .
negative	best greetings by emma , too good to be true !
negative	so , i ordered a delivery to deliver from my shop to my customer .
negative	it ' s already 0th days & they didn ' t show up to collect my delivery box .
negative	how lucky i am .
negative	yup i am lucky , because if they are this late to only collect , then how can i trust to deliver my product on right time ?
negative	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
negative	took over a month for parts to arrive after 0 + telephone_calls .
negative	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
negative	they just tell you a story to pacify you and get you off the phone .
negative	as above .
negative	did not reply to the three emails i sent , and when contacted made excuses .
negative	completely_unacceptable .
negative	apparently my package was delivered to my house while i was at work .
negative	after calling and explaining no one was there , they said it was delivered to a neighbour but the agency driver was off for 0 days so they wouldn ' t be able to find out which neighbour it was delivered to until then .
negative	yes , you ' re reading this correctly .
negative	they delivered the package to an address but do not know which address it is .
negative	apparently the delivery was attempted for several days , but at no stage did they leave a missed delivery note so i could collect from the depot .
negative	they also promised me a phone call an_hour before delivery which also didn ' t happen .
negative	the sending company had to resend the package ( a £_000 electrical item ) and i doubt the original will ever be recovered .
negative	my advise would be to avoid this company and demand your supplier uses a respectable , organised company to ensure you get your goods .
negative	probably the worst customer_service team i ' d had to deal with .
negative	no knowledge of products or issues , and happier to send out unusable template answers to complex issues .
negative	i ' ve closed my account and will not be using them again .
negative	joined this site last_week and placed hundreds of bids and never won anything .
negative	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
negative	not very reliable at all
negative	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
negative	very deceptive .
negative	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
negative	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
negative	some of the items that where delivered where damaged like the eggs and the yoguart .
negative	they also have a restriction on mineral water bottles , they are very mean .
negative	i ordered a facebook canvas £ 0 . 00 then had to pay £_00 postage and packaging but never received item .
negative	i ' ve contacted both companies only to get no response they took my money and i never got the item i would recommend you stay_away from this money stealing website
negative	after receiving a refund ( for a significant_amount ) from a item brought on ebay , i waited for the usual 0 - 0 working_days for the amount to clear back into my account during this time it displayed as pending .
negative	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
negative	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don ' t know when you ' ll receive it .
negative	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
negative	i am pretty sure this is in breach of fsa regulations .
negative	so avoid if you can but seeing though they ' re weaved into almost every online shop its not that easy !
negative	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	got an_email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
negative	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
negative	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
negative	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
negative	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
negative	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
negative	they take your hard_earned money then send you an_email and deliver the flowers when they feel_like it .
negative	not happy
negative	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
negative	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
negative	please reply eflorist ?
negative	even better phone me ?
negative	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
negative	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
negative	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
negative	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
negative	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
negative	my advice would be avoid this company .
negative	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name ] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don ' t bother you won ' t get a response .
negative	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
negative	terrible customer_service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
negative	i think its ridiculous that you have to pay £ 0 . 00 a month then another £ 0 . 00 to watch one episode or £_00 . 00 to get the boxset or £ 0 . 00 to watch a movie its ridiculous , this new prime thing is just terrible i don ' t see the point on keeping it running when you can go to netflix and watch unlimited movies and tv_programmes for only £ 0 . 00 a month .
negative	its a rip_off !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a christmas_tree on friday 0nd november , i had carefully read the terms on the website before placing my order and it clearly said that the tree would be sent the next working day or if there was any delays that i would be notified by phone or email .
negative	i waited until the following_tuesday ( 0th_nov ) to call the company , they told me that the tree was out of stock and that it would be back in stock and would be out to me within the week .
negative	to cut a really long_story short , i called them again another two times to be told there had been further delays and that the product would be sent out to me soon .
negative	by the 00rd november i was sick of waiting and being ' fobbed_off ' with excuses and i cancelled the order after three_weeks of waiting .
negative	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
negative	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
negative	i have never received such a bad service from an on - line company and will certainly be avoiding them in the future !
negative	i booked a spa overnight stay at carden park for may 0000 .
negative	paid £_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
negative	no mention of a refund initially .
negative	i called following_day and asked for a refund .
negative	00 days_later , still no refund .
negative	i had even called lastminute . com 0 mins before the online booking and confirmed that there were 0 rooms available at the venue .
negative	yet , in those 0 mins , all 0 rooms had sold out ( 00 :_00am !!!)
negative	i spoke to hayley , sharday and another rude woman .
negative	all said i needed to wait 00 days for it to be processed .
negative	then i discover that they had not bothered to put refund through as they couldn ' t refund back onto america express .
negative	no phone call in 00 days to say this .
negative	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
negative	i call and they tell me that it is processed and will take 00_hours , even_though i have waited long enough already .
negative	i get a call from hayley five mins later , she took down my card_details incorrectly and refund never been done even thoughh girl 0 mins earlier said it had already gone though , eventually after 00 days , i get my refund of £_000 back after 0 phone_calls , shocking customer_service from girls who couldn ' t care less about helping me , one kept putting me on hold so she didn ' t have to listen to me !!
negative	!
negative	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn ' t exist .
negative	dodgy company , would never use again .
negative	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
negative	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
negative	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
negative	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don ' t look to be in the freshest state .
negative	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
negative	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i ' m a monkeys uncle !
negative	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
negative	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
negative	i ' m still arguing for my refund , so far i have only been offered another bouquet .
negative	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
negative	just recieve notification that my flight was canceled by airline in 0 days before flight .
negative	ebookers just usles in any_problems with airlines .
negative	no guarantees and explanations .
negative	been with vodafone for around 00 years ...
negative	moved to orange .
negative	because vodafone ignored my request to stop marketing .. vodafone broke so many rules .
negative	data_protection act etc .. was sick of vodafone had to write to there ceo and was released out of my contract .
negative	also there customer_services is none excistant ..
negative	buyer_beware
negative	i had used viagogo last_year to buy lady_gaga tickets .
negative	0 days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn ' t provide the tickets .
negative	the day before replacement tickets were sourced .
negative	stressful but okay .
negative	have now booked p ! nk tickets for manchester 00 / 00 / 00 and with 0 days to go it has happened again but this time they have not responded about replacement tickets .
negative	i have sent 0 further messages with no contact and am so worried that the hotel rooms and 0x train tickets are going to be a waste of money , on top of the extortionate price of the tickets already purchased .
negative	will never use again and would suggest others stay well clear !
negative	trans id_0000000
negative	i have had my share of bad service over the years but estafania of wimdu has taken it to an all new level .
negative	argumentative , objectionable , rude , insulting - you name it .
negative	i had the temerity to ask a simple question regarding an agent .
negative	she didn ' t bother to read what i wanted but leapt to stupid conclusions and then blamed me .
negative	sweetie , if my data is not in your system - when i provided you copies of it - maybe there just might be something wrong with your system ?
negative	or the fool using it .
negative	don ' t blame the customer on whom your salary depends .
negative	0 / 00 .
negative	people , go to airbnb who offer the same service but cheaper and far more professional or top of the range , vrbo . com and homeaway . com who are light years ahead of this shambolic outfit .
negative	this is the worst company ever !!
negative	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don ' t give you your moneys_worth .
negative	i have been with t - mobile for several years now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
negative	normally you would get full network when your in a open space but on the other handy my network_coverage is always being cut_off .
negative	sometimes i cant make a phone call because there ' s something wrong with the server .
negative	my phone_calls always being cut mid way through a important to professional people or just general conversations to my friends .
negative	and then at the end of the month t - mobile then want to charge me a ridiculous_amount of money for my monthly plan that i haven ' t even been able to you use to the full extent .
negative	t - mobile , you are ripp offs we should compensated for are losses and inconveniences !!
negative	there customer_service is just as bad with there rude members off staff that don ' t even seem to bothered to help you when your asking for a little assistants , and most of them cant even speak understandable english with there heavy accents , because it seems like i speaking to someone on the other side of the world .
negative	and don ' t think when it comes to the end of my contract i will hesitate to leave your useless company !
negative	!
negative	if you can be bother to get back to me ( which i doubt ), email me on ; samanthajs0 @ yahoo ,. com
negative	miss samantha .
negative	i ordered flowers with eflorist to send to my wife ’_s work place as we both had to work on valentines_day .
negative	i received confirmation that my order had been accepted and the delivery day ( valentines_day ) confirmed .
negative	i waited anxiously , constantly looking at my phone , waiting for my wife to ring and to hear the excitement in her voice about the flowers but i never received any calls .
negative	at 0pm i then rang eflorist , which took over 00_mins to get through to , to be told that flowers had been dispatched and will_definitely reach my wife by 0pm .
negative	my wife was working until 0 . 00pm so i was getting more and more anxious as each second passed .
negative	at 0pm i was absolutletlty furious !
negative	i send eflorist an_email basically asking where the hell my flowers were and it was at this point i received the most shocking reply ( see below ):
negative	“ please_accept our apologies for contacting you so late .
negative	due to an overwhelming amount of demand in your delivery area for valentine ’_s day , our local_florists have not been able to fulfil your order .
negative	please_accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience that this may have caused .
negative	“
negative	this is an awful company , please do not use .
negative	they absolutely ruined my valentines this year .
negative	even a full_refund , that i have requested , will not compensate for this experience .
negative	if they cannot cope with the demand then they should not of accepted the order , they should of told me by midday at the very latest , not lie to me when i rang them at 0pm and guaranteed me that my order had been dispatched !
negative	by 0pm most shops had shut , those that were open selling flowers had sold out of roses !
negative	basically , a ruined valentine ’_s day all thanks to eflorist .
negative	in future i wouldn ’ t touch them with a barge poll , and judging_by most of the other reviews on here , there seems to be a pattern with this awful company !
negative	i have requested a full_refund .
negative	all information was stolen from diffrent key site .. so low business ..
negative	i ' m disgusted with service and customer_service .
negative	mothers_day bouquet - never received on time
negative	a proposed upgraded bouquet as means of an_apology not delivered .
negative	0 emails ; a 00minute phone call letter - no upgrade , no refund
negative	disgusted
negative	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .
negative	living_social refused to refund or credit account .
negative	definitely do not use this company , i certainly will not use again .
negative	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
negative	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay £_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
negative	they are also threatening to charge delivery even_though they did not deliver .
negative	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
negative	use another company , be warned .
negative	i have now waited almost 0 weeks on an_email advising when i will receive my refund .
negative	i ' ve taken legal_advice and am patiently awaiting their response to my requests both on email and telephoned .
negative	bewarr everybody .
negative	this company has taken payment from my account and the goods have not been delivered .
negative	it has been over two_weeks since they took payment , and they haven ' t replied to emails or telephone call ever .
negative	have alerted american_express fraud department and they are following it up , and said that necessary compensation will be sought .
negative	just wish i had read some of the reviews on here before purchasing .
negative	i paid for express delivery on an order from amazon , and the seller has chosen to send the parcel with yodel .
negative	tracking shows it has been at my local_depot , 0 mile from the delivery address , since 0th_feb .
negative	it then shows ' delivery not attempted ' for several days ( i . e .
negative	couldnt be bothered ), followed_by a ' weather delay ' ( weather here is fine ), then 0 x ' delivery attempted , could not gain_access '.
negative	delivery is to my work place , their first ' no access ' was due to attempting to deliver at 0pm ( not in business hours despite company name being clearly indicated ), the second was 0 . 00pm and i know they didn ' t try as i was covering the reception desk at the front of the building all afternoon and no vehicles came into our car_park !
negative	!
negative	their ' live_chat ' has been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we ' ll get it there when we can '.
negative	no definite answers , no sincere apology and no compensation / gesture of goodwill offered .
negative	shocking customer_service .
negative	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
negative	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn ' t unfortunately ).
negative	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt_like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn ' t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
negative	when i finally got assistance to order , i had to explain the item ' s specification to the assistant ( for example , she asked what colour i wanted , it only comes in one colour ).
negative	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0 weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
negative	i was assured i would be contacted to discuss the delivery , which i paid £_00 for due to my order being in their higher value bracket .
negative	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i ' d had no contact from them at all .
negative	the manager rang me back promptly within the hour , and apologised saying he would contact the warehouse and find out , then call me the next_day .
negative	he didn ' t .
negative	i left it 0 days then called to be told he was not working .
negative	the assistant told me she could get my delivery to me 0 days_later on thursday ( the end of week 0 ).
negative	i explained that this was not convenient , as i had discussed with the manager before .
negative	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
negative	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i ' m not great at diy or lifting ).
negative	to top it all off , i had a call from my parents which is my previous address ( which they took for credit check purposes ) to say fv have left 0 incomplete voicemails on their phone - i don ' t live there , i only have a mobile and i don ' t know how they got the number or why they feel the need to ring it !
negative	!
negative	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
negative	fingers_crossed it gets delivered at some point , with all the parts , undamaged and assembled correctly .
negative	may be too much to ask .
negative	i waited nearly an_hour , listening to the most annoying music , especially when the loop played the songs for a second and third time .
negative	when i finally spoke to someone the department i needed had had gone home !
negative	they said they would phone back .
negative	they didn ' t .
negative	i waited , listening to the same looped music for 00_minutes to be told nothing had been logged from my previous call .
negative	they assured me someone would call back in three days .
negative	that was six days ago !
negative	i ' m going to have to call them back , that ' s three hours of my life i ' ll never get back !
negative	literally the worst customer care skills in the history of the world .
negative	do not use this company for anything , ever .
negative	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .
negative	this company have obviously never_heard of customer care and they dont deserve to be recognised as a supplement selling business .
negative	stay_away at all costs !
negative	0 . : hvad sker der for kun at have halvt menukort , allerede kl .
negative	00 .
negative	resten var allerede udsolgt .
negative	pingligt !!!
negative	!
negative	0 . : når_man bestiller en ( hvad man forventer at være en_god bøf ) som medium , så skal den også være det .
negative	- det kunne jeg gøre bedre selv !
negative	0 . : der_er åbenbart også forskelsbehandling på servicen om man betaler med kreditkort / kontant mod at man betaler med_et giftvoucher .
negative	vinen var dog rigtig_god .
negative	so i came_across this website and got the best price for what i wanted ( sun visor ).
negative	so of course i ordered it as it seemed like it had the best reviews and the payment was safe and secure .
negative	i ordered my item on 00th_may 0000 and today ( 00th_may 0000 ) i ' m still_waiting .
negative	when the item didn ' t arrive a few_days after the expected date i started to get concerned so i called them up .
negative	the chap on the phone seemed very nice so i gave him the benefit of the doubt .
negative	he gave me a rm tracking_number and for some reason it got returned to sender .
negative	i don ' t know why that would happen as i was at home the whole time waiting for the part .
negative	and usually when that happens , rm will leave a note to tell the customer what is happening with your parcel .
negative	anyways , i called him up again asking where it was and being obviously slightly frustrated and wondering_why did he not contact me back to let me know what is going on and keep me informed .
negative	he told me to call him back in 00_mins because he was in the post_office que .
negative	then i got a text of a sob story and how he only made £ 0 out of my order .
negative	the service is just unbelievable !
negative	i don ' t even know where to go from here .
negative	they took my money and i ' m still_waiting .
negative	i will not be using this again .
negative	i ' ve shopped alot at argos for many years , my mother used to say that i kept them in business .
negative	however , this has always been in the actual store .
negative	my sister has made her first order with their home delivery service , which is still ongoing as they keep delaying her delivery .
negative	she ordered two items with them , both listed as in stock .
negative	a week_later ( and three days before the scheduled delivery ), they called and said they were having problems with the suppliers ( i . e .
negative	one , or both , of the items were not actually in stock ).
negative	she , unhappily , rescheduled the delivery for ten_days_later .
negative	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
negative	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
negative	this may seem like a minor inconvenience to some , but my sister has just moved_into a new home and needs these items .
negative	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
negative	so that ' s how argos is effecting her financially .
negative	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
negative	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
negative	claiming that you have an item in stock and available for purchase is selling under misinformation .
negative	furthermore , agreeing to dates and being unable to meet these agreements abuses the contract to which the consumer agreed in purchasing these good .
negative	they have offered to refund the £ 0 . 00 delivery cost , which doesn ' t come close to the amount that she has had to pay because of their incompetence , never mind the inconveniences and sufferings of her and her two children .
negative	she was actually warned by friends beforehand not to use this service as they had experience problems , but thought that based on our in - store experience , argos was a trustworthy company .
negative	i have since heard from other friends that they have had similar grievances .
negative	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
negative	don ' t risk it .
negative	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can ' t submit this without giving it one .
negative	i have been a customer with o0 since march of this year .
negative	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0 weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn ' t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
negative	now 0 weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
negative	after spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
negative	i was basically told to like it or lump it there was nothing that they were willing to do to help me .
negative	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn ' t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
negative	i have emailed o0 a complaint and it will be reviewed within 00 days but i don ' t expect their reply will resolve the situation i ' m in .
negative	i do not value their customer_relations much after this experience .
negative	i can not believe_how bad the customer_service has been with tap portugal .
negative	they lost my luggage on a flight from the uk to brazil , and nobody tried to help , answered the phone or replied to my emails .
negative	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0 weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
negative	as for the flight - the plane was fairly old with a ' entertainment ' that was awful for a 00 hour flight , and uncomfortable seats .
negative	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
negative	i ordered this globe 0 - 0 weeks before fathers day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
negative	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn ' t arrive .
negative	i decided to email globee to find out what was happening with my order .
negative	after 0 weeks they still didn ' t even bother to reply .
negative	i have now emailed them to cancel the order , as i ' m not confident whether this is even a genuine retailer .
negative	really really disappointed with the service .
negative	don ' t waste your time with globee !
negative	i purchased a samsung 00 " led_tv from pixmania as the price was very good .
negative	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
negative	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains lead , just a 0 pin continental plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
negative	there is no uk tuner facility which means no freeview hd .
negative	i ' m sending this tv back , and will not be dealing_with pixmania again , as the goods are not as_described .
negative	very misleading and very poor service .
negative	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
negative	technical problems their end prevented both of my credit / debit_cards working , it would not connect to the 0 d secure screen and they would not accept my payment , nor would they accept payment over the phone .
negative	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem ... which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
negative	then the cd players disappeared out of my basket , and into another persons !
negative	at that point , after contacting their levenshulme store again for the umpteenth time and complained as i had been the first person to try and buy these , " riz " confirmed that their technical_team had identified a fault connecting with the 0 d secure payment stage and that this other person couldn ' t pay for these either .
negative	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
negative	there was talk of taking the item off sale or refunding the new buyer if the payment went through .
negative	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
negative	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn ' t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
negative	thanks a bunch
negative	update 00 - 00 - 00 -
negative	my issue was never resolved .
negative	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
negative	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
negative	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
negative	i suggested to resolve the issue , i should have those at the same price that i should have been able to buy the original items i wanted , that their website prevented me from doing in the first place , as they were basically the same .
negative	this should have been fair_enough , even if it did cost them a bit of money , they created this issue after all - that is if they gave a toss about customer_service of course .
negative	they refused .
negative	they basically on the phone said they had " tried and failed to appease me and resolve the issue ".
negative	the most dire customer_service i have ever received in my life .
negative	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally ignored too .
negative	i am still struggling to believe a huge company , sponsoring a premier league football team , can treat people like this when they have cocked up all along .
negative	a score of 0 on this site , scraping acceptable , is pretty bad and it shows that their priority is money money money - not customer_service .
negative	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!
negative	oh and they still_haven ' t explained why they originally couldn ' t simply take the items off their website until the payment part of their site was fixed .
negative	really unhappy with this whole experience which was completely preventable by cash_converters and has marred previously pretty good experiences of using them .
negative	a shame .
negative	bought a cd_player on their website , but the cd_player sent was different to the one described on their website , it was a lesser model .
negative	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
negative	i had nothing back from them .
negative	i eventually had to go through paypal just to get the small discount i requested .
negative	then a couple of weeks_later the cd_player , that was sent incorrectly , failed on me and no_longer powered on .
negative	i emailed the store again - asking what the warranty is on these items , again completely_ignored .
negative	i also emailed their head_office - completely_ignored .
negative	so i have not only been basically sent the wrong item , it has failed on me within 0 or 0 weeks of barely any use .
negative	i have sent numerous_emails to the store and their head_office and i have had not even 0 word back from them ..... shocking .
negative	i would ring the store but i am that wound up about it i am worried_about losing my temper over the phone .
negative	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown away my money .
negative	thanks very much .
negative	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
negative	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
negative	firstly - it is disgraceful that you can only write comments if you are satisfied .
negative	so repairs0 block out comments if they do not like them ?
negative	?
negative	they kept my phone for 0 weeks when they promise to repair in one day .
negative	it then took them another 0 weeks to refund my money .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
negative	they told me a week_later they were awaiting a part and the phone would be with me by the end of the week .
negative	this came and went , and i called to chase .
negative	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .
negative	again nothing .
negative	i was then told that they had no_idea when they would get parts in and i had to wait indefinitely .
negative	they finally sent the phone back to me on 00th_november , it took them until the 0th_december to refund my money .
negative	they constantly promised that a manager would call me back but never did , and they ignored all of my emails .
negative	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
negative	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
negative	they will also promise to refund , and then will not investigate for 00 working_days if anything goes wring .
negative	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
negative	i look_forward to seeing them on watchdog .
negative	once more my parcel was delivered to the wrong_address if a delivery man dont know difference_between flats and house it is hard to expect good service .
negative	once more i had to appologise to my neighbours who has got same door number as me as i felt quilty knocking to their doors and begging for a parcel .
negative	i will avoid post_office at any cost and i will pay extra for a different company
negative	mp0 player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
negative	utterly disappointed ... my kid was like - what the **** is this ?
negative	its useless !
negative	i placed a query via the online support centre about my order and repeatedly i have been fobbed_off and promised information .
negative	i have now been waiting since the 00th_march .
negative	once a myprotein representative has replied , the query changes to completed even_though it hasn ' t been answered and i am still_awaiting information .
negative	poor service for a long_term customer .
negative	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
negative	this is not myproteins fault !
negative	but
negative	i have emailed them twice , in regards to my missing item and have had no response , hermes who delivered my item responded within 00_hours advising me to contact myprotein , as they will not deal with me directly .
negative	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
negative	i have been using myprotein for easily around 0 years , and have never had a problem , their customer_service is normally excellent .
negative	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
negative	please avoid this company at all costs !
negative	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
negative	it was also the first order that i placed - on 0 december and only after chasing my order did i receive an_email_saying that it was ' despatched ' on 00 december !
negative	still nothing !
negative	i have researched this company and can only add to the hundreds of claims that they are thieving fraudsters !
negative	i have contacted my bank and am looking to get my credit_card recharged - i will also be contacting the police and do my utmost to get this company rubbed through all_kinds of dirt .
negative	it ' s a real_shame so many companies choose to use yodel .
negative	i ' ve had the misfortune of dealing_with them after buying goods from both ' very ' and ' carphone_warehouse '.
negative	they really don ' t do good service , or to think of it , anything at all .
negative	it ' s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
negative	it has to be said , the brand itself is pretty_cool , but what good is a catchy brand name when the service ' delivered ' or in this case not , is nothing but appalling .
negative	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has been a multitude of problems .
negative	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn ' t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
negative	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play football and other sports activities with the parcels .
negative	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let ' s say a more rounded design .
negative	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
negative	the only positive thing is that i ' m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
negative	ok yodel , so on your website you say :
negative	we look different and feel different because at yodel we truly believe there ' s a better way of delivering .
negative	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
negative	and at yodel , we have the scale and capacity to make it happen .
negative	and we do so with a smile !
negative	you certainly do believe that there ' s a better way of delivering don ' t you .
negative	i ' d probably stick with the old concept of getting a parcel from a to b , in one piece and on time .
negative	we want and need our parcels on time .
negative	we don ' t need late or missed deliveries , damaged goods , rude and unhelpful staff etc .
negative	you don ' t make it happen and i ' ve never seen a smile .
negative	you might be laughing to yourselves when you see the company profits .
negative	most of us have to laugh , else we ' d probably cry .
negative	... maybe revise your ' about us section '?
negative	oh and this did make me laugh ( also from your website )
negative	' at yodel we really give you something to shout about .'
negative	- yes yodel , yes you do .
negative	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
negative	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
negative	thanks yodel , i hope that i never have to deal with you ever again .
negative	we booked a holiday through groupon for our anniversary only to find out at the check in that the company groupon used to make payments came up as " fraudulent " and we were refused to board the plane !
negative	groupon then refused to compensate use for their error and even accept any responsibility - it took use almost a month to get our money back .
negative	i will never use them again !
negative	!
negative	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
negative	wrote a little message for my mum .
negative	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
negative	0 .
negative	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
negative	0 .
negative	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
negative	0 .
negative	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
negative	0 .
negative	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
negative	0 .
negative	there was no card or message on the flowers .
negative	0 .
negative	they are small and pathetic
negative	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
negative	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
negative	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
negative	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
negative	no contact with the mods or site owner since saturday - phone has been missing for over a week !
negative	does look like they even have insurance for anything like scams ridiculous !
negative	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
negative	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
negative	i made a cash withdrawal for £ 0000 a week_ago and still_haven ' t been paid it .
negative	they say the withdrawal has been processed and i need to chase it up with my bank .
negative	i ' ve done this and they can ' t see any credits pending which i ' ve told betfair and they say it ' s not their problem as they ' ve processed the withdrawal .
negative	great , how the hell am i supposed to get my £ 0000 ???
negative	?
negative	on the 00th_june i bought a golf belt which should have been delivered within 0 - 0 days and now 00 days and still no sign of it .
negative	i have contacted dpd who say they have never received anything and all clubhouse golf do is direct you to their pathetic tracking_system .
negative	i ' ve now escalated this problem to paypal trying to get my money back but still clubhouse golf are failing to respond .
negative	absolutely_shocking service and i warn anyone away from using this website !
negative	this company is absolutely_terrible !
negative	i purchased a gigantic piano keyboard for £_00 . 00 for my 0 year_old_son to open on christmas day and when we did it was not only damaged but it was broke .
negative	i immediately emailed them and was told i would be contacted in 0 working_days .
negative	that was nearly 0 weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven ' t heard_anything .
negative	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
negative	i am now going to take some type legal_action_against them to stop them getting away with this with other people .
negative	accidently let it run over an extra month .
negative	would not let me have a refund for this mistake .
negative	some lovely daylight_robbery
negative	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
negative	this parcel was very important ( an_alternative wedding dress from very ).
negative	i sat all morning staring_at my front_door with my dog sat at the window ready to shout to tell me the man was at the door .
negative	my dog didn ' t bark and there wasn ' t a knock .
negative	i checked the tracking at 00 . 00 supposedly they had tried to deliver and left a card .
negative	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
negative	so i rang the depot and she rang the driver , who told her that he had run out of cards but did knock .
negative	my dog was confused is this man invisible ?
negative	she then went on to say she checked the drivers tracker ( in his body ?
negative	i live in a lane he can ' t drive down .)
negative	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i ' m the one who is lying .
negative	my dog licked the frustrated tears from my face ( having real wedding dress problems ) and patted my knee .
negative	she told me the driver will be back by two .
negative	i ' m sat in the window myself now and waiting for the apperence of this driver .
negative	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
negative	if this is the type of service i can expect i will not be using them again which means i will avoid very . co . uk .
negative	feckers
negative	later that day .
negative	the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 and knocked this time , my dog barked and went mental to get a stroke from the visitor .
negative	alas i put him in the kitchen .
negative	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
negative	" oh i knocked but there wasn ' t an answer and i didn ' t have any cards left ".
negative	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
negative	the barking is answer enough for me .
negative	there needs to be a negative star system put in place .
negative	or better yet get watchdog involved or whoever it is that handles bad practice !
negative	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
negative	i sent two emails but received no reply .
negative	they claimed i was out and there was no one to sign for the package , however it said on the website my package hadn ' t even of left the depot station .
negative	the next_day i receive a text_saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn ' t arrived .
negative	this company is a joke , i don ' t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer_service is non_existent .
negative	edit
negative	i am still_waiting for my package which was meant to arrive 0 hours ago , the gps tracker for the van said it was 00_minutes away around an_hour ago , now when i go to track the van the map has disappeared .
negative	i also can ' t ring anyone to see where my package is .
negative	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
negative	bought pink tickets at the o0_arena , london for the 00 / 00 /_0000 for my wife last christmas .
negative	spent £_000 .
negative	tickets were unsuccessfully delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 by royal_mail ( 0 days before the show ) to the wrong_address after i did an address change on their website 0 weeks previous after lots of worry_about not being home .
negative	went to collect tickets next_day from royal_mail who stated i had to wait 00_hours before collection .
negative	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
negative	after 0 calls to viagogo , and promised call_backs from a senior_manager ( which did not happen ) i was told just to " sort it out " as there was no other way to get into gig even_though ticketmaster offer a re - print on their website .
negative	viagogo had no further details of the ticket to pass to me ( seat number , row , ticket number etc ...)
negative	had to cancel train tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
negative	picked_up tickets saturday_morning from royal_mail to discover the seats advertised as " side view " are actually " rear side view " mis_- sold as far as i am concerned .
negative	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
negative	follow me on twitter @ danryanskinner to share your experiences of @ viagogo so we can protect others in the future of this awful service .
negative	after accidentally recieving a car_park ticket at an asda carpark i found their customer_service was terrible .
negative	i ' m £_00 out of pocket and they don ' t care about thier customers .
negative	store manager mike doidge - rude and not helpful .
negative	customer_service advisor mary - ann lied to me and couldn ' t help
negative	customer_service manager william hayton - didn ' t even phone back
negative	0 days_later after i sent an_email_stating i wasn ' t going to be a customer anymore i recieved a call off someone called rob who wouldn ' t even tell me his full name and he was as useful as a choclolate tea pot .
negative	don ' t shop at asda !!
negative	!
negative	what a joke - since when does next_day delivery end up not arriving the next_day when you wait in all day for it ?
negative	why does the company have phone_lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
negative	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
negative	dpd get ur act_together or soon u r going to regret making a fool of ur customers .
negative	what a bunch of idiots .
negative	drivers are ignorant and depot managers are incompetent retards "!!!
negative	!
negative	these_guys think they are the best when they are in actual fact the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
negative	shame on u dpd liars ... hope u get destroyed by the sheer numbers of customers u have pissed_off !
negative	!
negative	waste of time these dumbos !
negative	!
negative	this company is a disgrace to all parcel companies .
negative	they claim to do unbelieveable high tech deliveries but when it comes to basic common_sense they have none .
negative	stupid drivers and even stupider depot managers who are a waste of space .
negative	do not use u have been warned !!
negative	i did not have this luxury
negative	do not use , this company is a waste of time and money !!
negative	i had my parcel returned to sender because the driver kept leaving the cards whereever he pleased to and i never knew it !
negative	!
negative	bloody waste of time
negative	lol this company is nothing more_than a joke .
negative	0 attempts now to deliver time sensitive items , i ordered frozen fish food during the bank_holiday weekend , knowing it would not be sent out until the tuesday .
negative	it was supposed to arrive wednesday , absolutely nothing and when checking the tracking page i seen it was still in the sortation facility .
negative	spoke with the company i bought the food from and they looked into it , and got back to me and offered to send out replacements as they have been assured if they send a parcel out it would get to the customer today ... wrong no parcel , instead i get an_email informing_me my parcel has been delayed and i wont get it until monday 00th .
negative	well interlink after the weekend you will be known as interstink as i have been in touch with the company , they have issued a full_refund to me and they have told me they will be taking this further with your selves .
negative	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
negative	well i made an order with a company for mums 00 birthday_present .
negative	was sent an_email on the 0th telling_me my parcel has been sent by city_link express which is 00_hours .
negative	and not to check the tracking link until after 0pm .
negative	i checked after 0 and it informed me parcel has been scanned and is on its way to the delivery depot .
negative	delivery date is thursday 0th .
negative	i checked in the early hours of the morning * 0th * and still showing parcel scanned and on its way to delivery depot delivery date 0th .
negative	i checked a few_times through out yesterday and no up date .
negative	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
negative	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has been delivered .
negative	pretty pathetic service if you ask me .
negative	well it is now delivery day and nearly 00_hours and yep still no new tracking_details , still been scanned and on its way to delivery depot and delivery date 0th .
negative	dpd kept me up to date on progress and then sent me an_email giving me a 0 hour delivery slot , 0 mins into that delivery slot the door_bell went and it was an other parcel i had ordered .
negative	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
negative	i am only complaining_about lack of information / lack of tracking_details .
negative	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
negative	?
negative	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails
negative	my order 0000000 was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn ' t bother .

negative	i used british_gas over 0 years and they always sent me estimate which i paid in trust that i was paying correct amount , never i was sent meter read request , eventually when i found out that i paid them thousands in over charges they refused any refund , didn ' t even both explaining is to why estimates were sent instead of meter read requests .
negative	my advise keep safe distance from this company do not use them or you will regret like me .
negative	also make_sure you have your account no .
negative	and bill hand if you write negative_review they will report it to trustpilot , not the positive once though !

negative	i booked my tickets with this company february last_year and decided to cancel in less_than 00_hours , despite booking in 0 months advance i was charge £_00 for cancelling item , money was refunded after waiting good 0 weeks !
negative	they employ most unprofessional and untrained staff who lack basic customer_service skills .

negative	never using again
negative	i have been bombarded by non sense letters asking to pay bill of an address that i have never lived at neither i have even been to such place .

negative	it is horrible that numerous_calls has not stopped them from writing to me for paying service i never used !
negative	i will take this matter with relevant department so this company can pay me for causing me massive inconvenience !
negative	scammers !

negative	when you transfer funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0 days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
negative	its pure greed that it takes this long because they suck up as much interest with your money as they can .
negative	will avoid paypal an even co ' s associated with them from now on .
negative	moved to talktalk because of very high charges only to find talktalk are just as expensive but the service they provide is appalling .
negative	internet is sooo slow , it just stops working many_times during the day and at night cant even watch a 0 min video without constant buffering .
negative	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off ... every time !
negative	just waiting for the contract to end so i can get_rid .
negative	bough a pair of sunglasses on a groupon deal .
negative	piad for but didnt arrive for a few_days ( fair_enough ) when they did arrive , they were in a jiffy envelope saying signed for but unfortunately they did not attempt to get a signature but instead rammed them through what is a tiny letterbox causing them to break .
negative	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
negative	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .
negative	i returned them back and now their customer_services rep vishu wont refund me as there warehouse cant confirm status of this return and i need to send them proof of postage !!!!
negative	!
negative	absolutely_appalling service .
negative	do not use – you will only be disappointed .
negative	do not , do not under any circumstances order a phone from carphone_warehouse on line or by telephone .
negative	to put it quite simply .
negative	they lie through there teeth .
negative	i have now been waiting in for my delivery for four days .
negative	each day i have called after waiting in and been promised that i would ' certainly receive the phone tomorrow '- complete lies .
negative	also if you wish to make an enquiry you will have the privilege of having to wait in a queue on a premium_rate line .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have ever_encountered !
negative	do not use , do not use !
negative	i am now waiting to chat to customer_service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
negative	i now prey they go_bankrupt
negative	made my second order through this company and for the second time they are not " able to despatch this order in full " even_though their website said ' in stock '.
negative	very annoying as one of the items was a birthday_present that is now going to be late !
negative	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
negative	the product was fine but was very disappointed with the service quality here
negative	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
negative	i was told all items were in stock , and the conformation e_- mail to say my delivery was due on the 0st nov . well , 0 empty tubs turned_up , 0 out of 0 items i ordered , so i waited another day , maybe there had been a mess up .
negative	end of the 0nd of nov , i ring customer care , theres still no parcels or any information on whats_happening .
negative	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
negative	so i waited , and waited , rang up , and i might_add spend 00_minutes on hold to a business number , only to be told the items i ordered are now not in stock , and they didnt know when they would be .
negative	alas , on thursday0th , i receive an_email telling_me 0 items are due for delivery the next_day .. well , here i am , still_waiting .
negative	only god_knows when ill get the others .
negative	and by looking at the other issues people have had recently , im not alone .
negative	but to make it worse , this isnt the first time things like this have happened .
negative	it gets better , they have taken payment in full !
negative	shame i cant give them my money in installments based on their service !
negative	so by all means , myprotein products are great .. but order your stuff a month in_advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises
negative	my grandmother hasn ' t been able to use the internet for 0 - 0 months now and i ' ve spent more_than 0 hours on the phone from my mobile as i live a 000_miles_away just trying to get this resolved .
negative	i have also complained 0 times in total 0 phone escalations and 0 e_- mail witch was also reports a breach of data_protection , this was more_than 0 weeks_ago and still no response lol .
negative	she has only just had a so - called engineer out who was unable to fix the issue .
negative	as of yet they have not credited her account back anything for lack of service and i am fuming .
negative	i think the office of the information commissioner is going to get a letter soon , off - com as well and lastly a court claim .
negative	how dear they treat my grandmother and me with contempt like that time to come down on talk_talk like a ton of bricks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!.
negative	they called me after i placed my order to say that some of the laptops they send out are faulty , and without paying a £_00 inspection charge , they would refuse to cover any faults such as pixel loss , which is not deemed as a fault ... on a brand_new laptop ?!?!?
negative	!
negative	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i ' m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
negative	i have now had three follow on calls , even after i cancelled my order trying to upsell some rubbish internet security package without which apparently i will be in grave danger , and it is way better_than norton and mcaffee which they have had a lot of complaints about , apparently .
negative	buy from someone_else , you have the choice , don ' t waste your time with this bunch of **** s !
negative	ordered 0 clubs both showing in stock and still are but both out of stock and when i called to ask why and date of delivery was told complete bollox so don ' t buy from again as this is the second time i ' ve bought from them and both_times poor service .
negative	updateplease read !!

negative	then day before_release er there russian keys ( that wasnt mentioned before ) and they dont work in the eu .
negative	refund given without request in store credt !!!
negative	then told me if i wanted a refund then i would lose £ 0 to the company who refunds me lol what a joke .
negative	but the story dosent end there .... then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!

negative	i was a talk_talk residential customer ( which was excellent ) and then i made the worst decision in my life to move to talk_talk business !
negative	for the first 0 months the internet had to be reset atleast once a week , it just didn ' t work until you signed into the router an reset it .
negative	i wa assured by talk_talk business that when i moved from residential i wouldn ' t be charged for disconnection , sadly i am still being hounded for £_000 from some equally incompetent third rate debt_collectors .
negative	about a month_ago i applied for an 0000 number , it took me nearly 0 weeks to get the ball rolling .
negative	after numerous complaints and " promises to call me back " i delivered the ultimatum that if it is not sorted today i will be leaving an talk_talk business will be footing the bill for the disconnection .
negative	amazingly the next_day i had an 0000 number .
negative	however , now a week down the line the 0000 number still isn ' t working an customer_services have no record of me having it !!!
negative	i ' ve had my van sign written for the new number , ha 0000 leaflets printed and had all out work wear printed with the new details that are now prob useless !
negative	please stay_away from this business , yet are a joke .
negative	no matter what happens i will be leaving talk_talk business asap and i shall not be recommending them to anyone .
negative	be warned and take notice of this !
negative	the company doesn ' t respect the warranty_period , doesn ' t answer complaints , lies ...
negative	had a package delivered the other day and it was just chucked over my gate ( luckily not breakable ) however as we all no the weather is not the greatest in england at the best of times so yes the package got wet , really wish amazon would use a more reliable company who are not lazy ...
negative	lazy
negative	awful
negative	what else can i say ?
negative	?
negative	i bought a brand_new fridge_freezer in december , the fridge_freezer had an odd smell when it arrived but this was just put down to be being new .
negative	after a couple of months the smell was getting worse and the fridge started making very loud noises , so phoned through to currys .
negative	the first engineer was sent out , acknowledged the smell , but could not find where it was coming from .
negative	since this point hotpoint have sent out a further 0 engineers , all whom found similar things .
negative	at this point the office of fair_trading got involved , and a letter was sent recorded_delivery to currys , this was signed for at the address but not response was ever received .
negative	an independent engineer found that the fridge is faulty and needs completely replacing .
negative	currys have now received the fridge but feel it appropriate that after 0 months + of issues , that it will take at_least a further week to upload the report which was sent from one of there stores .
negative	so after around 0 months , numerous phone_calls ( all made from us to them ) i am still left with a fridge_freezer that doesn ' t work !
negative	:(
negative	i would never shop at , or recommend currys to friends or family or even my worst_enemy it has been absolutely_terrible !
negative	the parcel was out for delivery on the 0th .
negative	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated_delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
negative	i phoned the next morning and was told that it would deffinately be with me that day and if there were any_issues the driver would call me ...... all day went by and no parcel .
negative	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
negative	she promised to be here just after 0000 this morning and you guessed it ...... still_waiting .
negative	its not like i have a life !!
negative	!
negative	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
negative	the fact is yes they are very good / nice / efficient at taking your money and it is cheaper_than other insurance providers , however do not rate until you have actually made a successful claim .
negative	it seems to be impossible to do so .
negative	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .
negative	also when i add up all the excesses charges and phone bills i have used to try and get hold of protectyourbubble then the cost almost outweighs the near £_000 phone that was " insured "
negative	they never phone you back , never reply to emails , you end up on hold for hours .
negative	please_please people mark my words and pay the extra few pounds for a proper insurance_cover as you will be throwing your money away like i did .
negative	its either giving away £ 0 a month or paying £ 0 - 0 to get some actual insurance .
negative	non_existent customer_service , i emailed them about a query on my order , that was around the 00th_july , can ' t remember the exact date it was that long ago , today is the 00nd august and still no reply , don ' t even try phoning unless you have nothing better to do all day as a long wait is in order .
negative	all i wanted was an explanation to a mistake , seems that once you get the curtains its goodbye .
negative	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
negative	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn ' t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
negative	update_:
negative	received a phone call from woodyatt apologizing for the non reply , they say that they have no record of my query which was sent through their own ' contact us ' tab on their website , what a surprise , also was never asked which number i rang from so don ' t know how they checked a call log without the number i rang from .
negative	funny how it took a review on trustpilot to trigger a response from them , they got that email ok !
negative	they have even admitted their website needs improved to make it easier for customers but yet i am still out of pocket to the value of £_00 with no offer of compensation .
negative	careful when trying to use the code they send you for registering for their newsletter , after i purchased a song i seen the deal showing 00_% of your first mp0 purchase and applied 00_mins after my purchase .
negative	when i then tried to apply the code it said error , already used , i then complained to their customer_service team and was told that it was applied to the song at 00p not the album i was going to buy at £ 0 . 00 . the fact that they hadn ' t even sent me the code before i tried to purchase didn ' t even click with them .
negative	going back to itunes .
negative	terrible company , totally useless !
negative	achica sent me an_email with a code to use for my first purchase , a £_00 voucher .
negative	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i ' ve heard that before !
negative	they now have given me another code to use but now the items i first wanted have ended .
negative	what a complete_waste of time , i wish i had read the reviews about the company first of all and would never have went near them .
negative	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well_established , reputable company .
negative	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with , their so called customer_service is more like i couldn ' t care less attitude .
negative	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don ' t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
negative	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .
negative	if they can ' t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
negative	also while all this is going on , not one word of apology from them , hopeless !
negative	!
negative	a complete_disaster from start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
negative	every time i get an expected date for delivery it passes by and now going by the recent date it will be one year to receive the light , if it ever arrives !
negative	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
negative	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00
negative	after my post on trustpilot i received a phone call from emilie who apologised for the inconvenience and said that she would apply for my refund and process as quickly as possible but it could take up to 00 working_days , so my first thought was , i won ' t hold my breath , we will wait and see and planned to count the days down .
negative	i received another phone call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked ..................... and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
negative	so thank_you emilie , you have restored some faith back in infurn !
negative	i bought a brand_new property which was , unfortunately for me , already assigned to first_utility .
negative	0 .
negative	gave estimated bills despite me giving monthly accurate readings .
negative	these estimated bills that were a lot higher_than what my readings would have produced .
negative	0 .
negative	late charges added when i was disputing the estimated bills .
negative	every time i disputed these it took a long time for them to respond " we will get our manager to call you back " " we will look_into this and call you back " ( and sometimes the people on the end of the phone are extremely rude !
negative	), so a late charge was added time and time again , racking up the cost .
negative	these disputes were never resolved , so i paid them before the late charges became unaffordable .
negative	0 .
negative	gave my new supplier a fake and much over estimated reading .
negative	i decided to change to another supplier .
negative	bearing in mind i had just moved_into a new property - they gave the new supplier an incorrect reading which was a ridiculous figure amounting to hundreds of pounds .
negative	not only did they want my money , but they obviously wanted the new suppliers to take my money too - the cheek !
negative	luckily my new suppliers were onto them too , and had experienced this before by first_utility !!
negative	my new suppliers changed my reading to the correct figure and although i may be paying a few pennies more , it ' s so worth it for accurate bills and more_than adequate customer_service .
negative	0 .
negative	kept sending me monthly bills after i had left their services & applied late charges !
negative	after i had transferred to my new supplier , they were still charging me !
negative	i refused to pay , since i was paying for a new supplied - and they sent a debt collecting agency after me .
negative	this was utter hell , and yes , late charges were applied to this too !
negative	i ended_up paying for money that i didn ' t owe .
negative	0 .
negative	0 months later , debt_collection agencies calling for money i do not owe !
negative	0 months later , i am only just getting to the bottom of some more late charges - they are still chasing me for £_00 . 00 that i have never owed them in late charges .... how can you charge someone who you are not supplying a service too ?
negative	0 . long_story short , i paid because i was worried_about my credit_rating .
negative	i was very close to taking this company to court , and if they continue to bill me , i certainly will !
negative	this company are only interested in your money , not their service .
negative	they say one thing to you over the phone , but something different via letter .
negative	do not use .
negative	do not use .
negative	do not use .
negative	i ordered my vodafone iphone 0 unlock on july 0th for $_00 and i was told it would be 00 - 00hrs .
negative	after the time_frame was exceeded and i had inquired why my phone was still locked the time_frame was extended to 0 - 0 days .
negative	i ' ve yet again exceeded the time_frame and now i ' m not getting any responses from this company .
negative	will not be using their services again and i expect a full_refund .
negative	thank_you for your application .
negative	we are busy processing your account and you will receive an_email as soon as it has been activated .
negative	processing normally takes less_than 0 hours but may take up to 00_hours .
negative	if you would like to check the status of your account , you can log in at any time .
negative	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has been processed .
negative	this was 0 days ago :( not impressed so far .
negative	what is going on ??
negative	?
negative	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
negative	tackle_uk sent me an item that had been taken out of its packaging and there was a piece missing so i could not use the item they sent me .
negative	they tehn want me to waste my own_personal time and petrol money to go into to town to return the item before i can have a refund .
negative	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty_goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
negative	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
negative	i have been with orange for many years and have high usage .
negative	orange refuse to upgrade me wihtout a charge - would be happy to allow me to buy out remainding terms of my contract .
negative	no loss obviously .
negative	then they took £_000 out of my account by error and claim to not be able to put it back until next month , unless i want to get my bank to indemnify bla_bla .
negative	i will wait_until next month but only because i can - i would hate for someone who was in a financial predicement to do business with orange as they don ' t really care .
negative	i got a sorry and a rubbish explanation .
negative	i could understand a company not being_able to upgrade the masses early but would have thought a company like orange would have some insight_into the segmentation of their customer base and make concsious decisions which have been well thought out to protect their longer term customer base and profits rather_than short_term out lay cost of an upgrade .
negative	utterly ridiculous .
negative	tacky tat that is overpriced .
negative	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
negative	massively disgraceful .
negative	avoid
negative	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
negative	stay in all tuesday , the booked and agreed delivery date .
negative	no contact to say its not coming .
negative	i phone them at 0 . 00pm and they say its not coming .
negative	they couldn ' t be bothered to get in touch .
negative	very poor service .
negative	first and last ever order from a third rate outfit .
negative	conversation went :
negative	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let me know its not coming today ?"
negative	them : " i ' m can only say i ' m sorry "
negative	me : " so when is it being delivered ?"
negative	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
negative	me : " just a minute … every day ?
negative	you mean you ' ve no_idea when it ' s coming at all even_though your website states in stock and available for next_day delivery , and you claim to provide amazing next_day service .
negative	are you expecting me to take the next few weeks off work hoping that it might finally arrive one day ?"
negative	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
negative	me : " well clearly they haven ' t bothered to today when it was supposed to arrive .
negative	can you give me the telephone_number for xdp as there is none on their website ?"
negative	them : " no we don ' t have one ."
negative	me : " just cancel the order then ."
negative	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
negative	these are a bunch of clowns with no_idea about prompt reliable customer_service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
negative	avoid and save your time and sanity .
negative	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
negative	pathetic
negative	back in november ordered a sofa from these_clowns .
negative	website states delivery 0 - 0 weeks , in - stock , direct from manufacturer .
negative	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .
negative	apparently manufacturer would call us with eta .
negative	delivery day comes and no sofa .
negative	telephoned studio who say they cannot give us the telephone_number for the manufacturer because they don ' t know who the manufacturer is , but the manufacturer will telephone us as soon as its ready to deliver .
negative	yes you read that correctly - we will be phoned by the manufacturer but they don ' t know who the manufacturer is !!!
negative	so who have you passed our details to ?
negative	they don ' t know .
negative	there you have it in a nutshell - studio dont know who they buy from so they have you waiting in for a delivery but they dont know who it is delivering it or when its going to come .
negative	so now we have nothing to sit on thanks to complete incompetence from a shocking cowboy outfit .
negative	don ' t even waste your time peeps , you ' ll regret it !
negative	i should have read the other reviews on here because clearly studio is not the place to buy a sofa - they seem unable to deliver ( pardon the pun ).
negative	perhaps they should concentrate on selling cards because home furnishings is not an area they are capable of dealing in .
negative	i have now cancelled the order rather_than have any more poor service , lack of information , and general incompetence .
negative	update_: i haven ' t responded to your reply because as stated i ' ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
negative	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .
negative	these_idiots are the nasty people that get hold of your mobile number illegally and text you at all hours of the night and day pestering you about ppi , but dont reply because firstly it will cost you each time you do , and once you reply ( even stop to try and stop it ), they then know that your number works and they will_continue to bombard you and sell on your number to other rogue illegal outfits
negative	these are operating a fantastic money making scheme -- for them .
negative	the way they calculate interest is unlike any other reputable credit_card , and will leave you paying a fortune .
negative	their apr is high , the interest is calulated to leave you paying more interest than your payments unless you pay in full as soon as the bill comes .
negative	this is not the card for anyone who doesn ' t clear in full , and let ' s face it - they advertise and aim at those that don ' t .
negative	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
negative	when i asked for the bank_details of this direct_debit they said you don ' t have one set_up .
negative	so if i hadn ' t queried this and thought , oh they ' ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn ' t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .
negative	furthermore , if you try and make a debit_card payment online it rejects every time , ring up and use the same card over the phone and it works .
negative	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
negative	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you ' ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
negative	as it clearly_states on your statement : " interest is charged on a daily_basis so interest payments will increase the longer you take to pay , even before the monthly payment date ".
negative	what an underhand devious money making scam !
negative	very amateur website that doesn ' t work and gives misleading information that only serves to make them more in charges and interest by cheating the customers .
negative	if you ' d avoid the likes of payday lenders like the plague , you ' ll be well advised to avoid these fagans .
negative	when you ask for a quote you ' ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
negative	they don ' t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
negative	there is absolutely no warning on the text about the charges of ringing this number which begins " 00000 " and looks_like an ordinary mobile .
negative	if you go on [_external reference_] com you are given genuine mobile numbers so its easy to think this is the same .
negative	it ' s not !
negative	don ' t get stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
negative	if you look them up on companies house , you ' ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
negative	make of it what you will but to me i can ' t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn ' t something sinister here .
negative	you ' ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
negative	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
negative	no_idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these people .
negative	i ' m on the tps register to stop marketing calls and also ex - directory !
negative	further searches revealed this is the same company as yourcalls . net - a shoddy set of scammers also run by the industry named " scumbag " owen bloodworth .
negative	do yourself a favour and keep away - they ' ve changed their name but you know what they say about leopards !
negative	just had some goods sent to me by this company , smashed beyond use , clearly intentional .
negative	couriers like this company deserve to go bust .
negative	sadly they continue to operate as management clearly don ' t care about the massive negative attitude of their staff , the loathing they have of customers , the immense negative image this company has .
negative	i now ask online_retailers which company they use .
negative	if its herpes , i ask them to use another courier and if they won ' t then i tell them i will buy elsewhere because of the courier they have chosen .
negative	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .
negative	this review is not about buying from these people , but from working for them .
negative	your day will start at 0am and end around 0pm , yet you will only get paid for 0 . 0 hours .
negative	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
negative	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
negative	simply - there is too much to do within the timeframe allowed .
negative	the area covered is around 000_miles .
negative	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
negative	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
negative	subtract a further two hours at the depot for sorting and scanning the stock , loading the van , printing out the paperwork and completing van checks and daily / weekly / monthly company sheets and you ' ve only four actual hours to deliver or collect at around 00 locations , thats if you can average driving speeds of 00mph of course ( which you can ' t because of the vehicle limiter @ 00mph ).
negative	the products are " desktop delivery " which means boxes of paper etc have to be taken to the floor level and actual desk / cupboard where the customer wants the product .
negative	which is ok but it takes considerably more time , this isn ' t just go to the front_desk , " sign here " " there ' s your stuff " and gone in less_than a minute .
negative	especially when only a wonky - wheeled sack cart is provided so sometimes one person collecting over 00 boxes from an above ground level could be at a single drop for well over an_hour .
negative	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
negative	the final pettiness of this company though has to be when you take the van to the fuel station .
negative	you are given two cards , a bp card to pay for the fuel and a nectar card - yes they get the points and you have to record the number of nectar points on your manifest .
negative	they don ' t even let you have any little perks !
negative	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
negative	was about to order a mac mini from here .
negative	now i won ' t because they clearly an non - uk_based and absolutely awful to deal with .
negative	also i note the positive_reviews are by reviewers with only 0 review to their name .
negative	always makes me think their own staff write those reviews !
negative	just paid an extra £_00 and bought it from [_external link_removed ].
negative	it ' s worth paying a bit more sometimes to go with tried and trusted and have peace of mind rather_than use some scammers .
negative	have been with them about 0 months or so , for broadband and line_rental , as they were offering a competitive deal .
negative	thats the positives dealt_with .
negative	the negatives - poor line speeds , regular disconnection , downloads so slow it takes over 0 minutes to load a web_page ( ironically their website support pages at the time !
negative	), low monthly restriction ( allowance they call it - which is both upload and download added together ) which soon gets used up having to press refresh on your browser all the time .
negative	feels_like i spend more time trying to get it working than using it .
negative	found their support useless too , just standard responses and they hide their contact email address so you have to go round in circles through the faq_section which is never relevant to the problem that ' s happening , which meanwhile uses up more of your monthly restriction , oops allowance .
negative	it ' s crap , but it ' s cheap .
negative	so you pays your money ....
negative	if you want good reliable broadband , pay a bit more and go elsewhere .
negative	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
negative	for me , frustratingly slow , poor service so ultimately poor value .
negative	after telling them that their broadband is throttled so much and ridiculously slow , and taking up to 0 minutes just to load their own website pages , their answer is that i have to go out and buy another router from the one they supplied or pay for an engineer to visit .
negative	this is their award winning service ?
negative	what award is this then ?
negative	" biggest cowboy outfit isp award "?
negative	time to refer them to the regulator as every other poor reviewer on here seems to have to do ...
negative	trustpilot is playing very unfair .
negative	it has banned reviews from a company i work for - canvasdezign .
negative	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
negative	they are making it very difficult for us to increase or even decrease our profile .
negative	either start allowing reviews or remove the fake_reviews that are visible .
negative	it is totally unfair .
negative	my daughter sent her i phone 0 after being given a valuation of £_000 .
negative	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to £_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
negative	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
negative	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
negative	i was told phone wasnt working when it got to them .
negative	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
negative	they wouldnt let me speak to a manager , wouldnt give full names as their " not allowed ".
negative	miracuously a supervisor appeared but was no help .
negative	i am contacting bbc_watchdog and daily mail for help
negative	i think it ' s easiest to explain_why i have awarded seven seas one star by pasting my complaint letter here .
negative	i never received a reply from them .
negative	" it is now the 00th_september , 00 days after my box was collected by you to be shipped from china to the uk , and i have still not received it nor heard_anything from you about its progress .
negative	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
negative	using seven seas has certainly not been a simple_task .
negative	firstly , i did not receive any message_telling_me what time the driver would deliver the empty boxes to me and after several phone_calls it appeared the driver had got my address wrong .
negative	secondly , once my box had been collected on the 0th_july i heard_nothing from you to say how much i should pay you , and it was not until i had emailed you twice that i finally got my invoice emailed to me .
negative	it was dated the 0th_july , however , i did not receive it until the 00th_july , almost two_weeks after the collection date , causing my payment to be delayed .
negative	i subsequently emailed you to say that i was expecting my box to arrive in the uk within 00 days from the 0th_july , otherwise this would cause a huge inconvenience to me .
negative	you then assured me that my box was to arrive in the uk on the 00th of august and i was then to allow up to two_weeks for customs .
negative	two_weeks has already passed now and i still have no_idea where my box is .
negative	i consider the service you have provided to be very poor and completely_unacceptable .
negative	i am expecting compensation from you due to the reasons i have highlighted above .
negative	i will certainly not be using your company again in the future ."
negative	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
negative	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
negative	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
negative	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final destination being 00km from my mums home .
negative	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
negative	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across_europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
negative	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn ' t .
negative	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
negative	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
negative	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer_service number to ring .
negative	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same_thing again !
negative	this person was polite unlike everyone_else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
negative	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
negative	so after contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
negative	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0 weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
negative	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
negative	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
negative	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across_europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
negative	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer_service is appalling and unfair .
negative	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
negative	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
negative	with myprotein receiving such praise from other people who have ordered from it , i set my hopes quite high for the product .
negative	however , i was completely let_down .
negative	the protein will not mix properly with water , instead the water turns a horrible yellow colour that looks and tastes disgusting .
negative	the protein is completely unusable .
negative	we moved_into our new build mid september and first_utility were already set_up as our suppliers .
negative	as we were having issues getting scottish_power to take over ( meter numbers were not correctly registered to us ) we were sticking with first in the meantime .
negative	we were told that the flat was set_up with a smart_meter and we would only be billed for the electricity that we had used .
negative	the first bill ( and all subsequent ones ) sent as estimated readings .
negative	every month was the same , get an estimated bill , phone them to say we have a smart_meter , give them the meter_reading and the next bill would still be estimated with no recalculation of the previous meter_reading .
negative	finally scottish_power sorted out our meter number and took us on in february , to date i still do not have a correct final_bill from first_utility .
negative	to add_insult to injury , as i never agreed to go on direct_debit ( since i realised they couldn ' t find their own ass with two hands and a map , i didn ' t want them to have access to my bank_account ) they charged me nearly £ 0 per bill for the privilege of getting an incorrect statement every month .
negative	i have paid them £_000 , have repeatedly phoned , begging them to give me my correct final reading and i will immediately pay the balance .
negative	they have also sent threatening final payment requests to my home , saying they will take me to court , i had a solicitor ' s letter in january demanding that i pay .
negative	when i phoned their credit control team to sort out i was told that they didn ' t have access to any notes from my previous calls regarding my account , and they demanded i pay nearly 0x what i think i owe to them .
negative	one guy even go so " smart " with me saying that if i ' m on a smart_meter then i have to pay what ' s on the bill even if it says it ' s an estimated bill .
negative	i work as a credit controller and if i said anything like that to a customer i ' d be collecting my p00 .
negative	in short , these_guys are a complete_waste of space and time .
negative	oh , and i ' m still_waiting on that final_bill .
negative	i will not be using cash_generator again .
negative	i was sent a faulty ps0 which i later sent back .
negative	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
negative	they also told me that they would get a replacement sourced and sent out to me .
negative	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
negative	it is now tuesday and they have stopped answering my emails and i have the feeling that like many other people , i will not be hearing from them again .
negative	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
negative	until recently my experience with 000reg had been ok and i never had any_problems with the few domains i ' ve registered with them .
negative	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
negative	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
negative	a third_party bought it and wants $ 0000 for it !
negative	i am not paying $ 0000 for 000reg ' s mistake , and to make it worse their support staff have been completely dismissive & try to avoid taking responsibility at every opportunity .
negative	they even have the audacity to tell me they failed to pay the registry , but the loss of the domain is my fault for not checking with a third_party that they did their job !
negative	this example shows serious incompetence and a lack of care for customers when they make a mistake .
negative	any domain registrar should know how to renew domains without losing them , and in any case of a renewal failing they should at_least detect this so that action can be taken .
negative	000reg failed to do their job here and try to escape responsibility so they don ' t need to pay for their mistake .
negative	i could forgive a mistake if they made up for it , but their attitude is unbelievably bad .
negative	atrocious customer_service & incompetence .
negative	i will try to transfer all of my domains away from this terrible company !
negative	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .
negative	i booked them in march - a month_ago .
negative	as well as paying for the tickets i paid over £_00 in booking and postage fees .
negative	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
negative	oh no it didn ' t .
negative	the tickets were confirmed as shipped a day or so after i bought them , but a week_later i hadn ' t received them .
negative	i got in touch with eventim who said that it i waited until 0 days before the event they ' d arrange for me to collect them on the night .
negative	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone wrong once .
negative	i asked them to send them out by recorded_delivery instead .
negative	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
negative	i got an_email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn ' t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
negative	so i phoned them up .
negative	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .
negative	the best i could get out of her was a promise to contact the venue and ask what they would allow the ticket agents to do .
negative	much later in the day i received an_email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
negative	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
negative	i should not have to wait months worrying_about whether i would gain admittance after paying over £_00 in fees for a service that should alleviate any such worry .
negative	i got a reply a week_later from another customer_service manager , stuart james , just repeating the same nonsense again .
negative	naturally they will not refund the booking or postage fees , and had the cheek to claim that it was because they are making them available for collection at the last_minute , and that collection fees are the same as postage (£. 000 ).
negative	i ' ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .
negative	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
negative	i just cant stand the company any more it gets worse and even more worse the more you phone them up with fair questions like why have you charged me an extra 000_pounds on top of an extremely high bill they just cant justify there cruel system of moneysnatching heartlessness for your financial safety and your futures happyness dont go anywhere_near talktalk and if ur thinking bt thats even worse .
negative	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn ' t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which_resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
negative	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don ' t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
negative	do yourselves a favor and go with a different carrier , 0 are a shambles of a company .
negative	i have my doubts about live bj casino ...
negative	the cards are not live or random in my opinion .
negative	play bj live and you will see patterns emerging like dealers have high first facing cards more frequently then other players at the table .
negative	dealers also pull strange cards to win or stand when more_than one players are on 00s , 00s or 00s .
negative	you may think that with number of pack cards they use , it ' s a high possibilities , but play the game and read players ' comments to see patterns emerging to suggest otherwise .
negative	hard to win big too and dealers go on more winning runs then players playing live bj .
negative	live support don ' t help when lagging , decisions not reaching skyvegas in time , often telling players to update google_chrome or check internet connections ... how many_times can one player do these things when problem occurs on a regular bases ???
negative	the bones are rubbish if any is received .
negative	play with caution and pay attention to the cards and players comments to know that things are not as it seems on the surface ...
negative	but form your own opinions , just going on my personal experiences there .
negative	avoid at all cost and use recognised and experienced online gaming that have been aground much longer .
negative	thanks for reading .
negative	i had been told i would get £_00 for my 0gs .
negative	it failed it ' s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
negative	i wanted it returned but this would cost almost £ 0 , they are based in london so i said i would rather collect it myself and they refused .
negative	reluctantly i accepted the offer and 0 weeks_later i ' m still_waiting for the money to be put in to my account .
negative	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
negative	we werent very happy with the flight , is a good price at the beginning but then it comes all the extras ..
negative	very expensive , they even charge for their headphones adaptor £ 0 is a rip_off !
negative	we went to mexico , so flight of 00_hours you need a lot if food to buy then .. we did get the menu but it wasnt enough .
negative	i paid for my seats as extra aswell and they said i didnt ( even_tho i checked my bank_account and they took it ), the lady at the airport so rude pushing and very insistent and that i didnt .. so i didnt get the seats i was 000_% sure i booked (£ 00 lost there ) i want my money back from that !
negative	the worst was that they charge you £_00 per_person on your way out from the airport to come back !
negative	it has to be in mexican pesos , cash , no receipts , they take your itinerary before you leave .
negative	this sounds_like a scam !!!
negative	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
negative	i spoke to the " secretaria de turismo " ( tourist board ) and they dont even know what i was talking_about !
negative	total scam .
negative	hotel was ok but after evaluating and compering , the package wasnt cheap as we thought it was .
negative	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue ...
negative	i will never book another holiday with them .
negative	i booked a car in cancun airport with sixt and nobody showed up to pick me up , they have no office in the actual airport .
negative	afterr 0 hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
negative	rentalcars . com or traveljigsaw which is the same , didnt give me a refund for not giving me the service , thats stealling !
negative	they charge me full_amount and after 0 months im still trying to get my money back !
negative	the dispute still on , but i will never ever rent a car from this company again .
negative	they suck .. save_yourself from this nightmare .
negative	this is the worst customer_service i had to deal with !
negative	there was an issue on their website and charge me twice for an event .
negative	they refused to refund me the money .
negative	stay well away from them !
negative	absolutely unacceptable customer_service delivered through 0 of the leeds based stores .
negative	it seems in store staff are untrained ????
negative	when speaking to customers you should be sympathetic to their needs and not simply patronise customers for not understanding something .
negative	i would definitely never recommend halford stores in leeds for anything to do with cycles !!!
negative	shocking customer_service and extremley poor support from the head_office too !
negative	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
negative	i then got an_email_saying that i had to send my order through email and i had to explain to them what i wanted , as the design wouldn ' t work for some bizarre reason .
negative	i first ordered a medium top , and it turned_out to be a size 0 !!
negative	when on the store it said a medium was 00 / 00 .
negative	i then worte to them , complaining and they offered to send me one in a larger_size .
negative	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
negative	!
negative	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
negative	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!
negative	!
negative	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
negative	when i called the customer_service department the operator made me feel_like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .
negative	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
negative	i felt_like an_idiot so i didn ' t ask the girls for anymore money so have forked out the extra £_00 myself .
negative	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
negative	this company needs to get their act_together , i ' ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
negative	they can ' t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
negative	the next evening still no parcel , rang again !
negative	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
negative	( at 0pm !!!)
negative	they told me they will call back , no one called so rang again now the 0th time .
negative	some useless customer_service lady tells_me the package was not scanned .
negative	i told her i ' ve been tracking this package over a week and it said each time scanned how can she tell me it ' s not scanned ?
negative	and their status kept changing untruthfully saying i said .
negative	told me there isn ' t nothing i could do or nothing she could do .
negative	i have to call the sender .
negative	i told her it is friday_evening the sender must be close until monday .
negative	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
negative	i a rude tone .
negative	i just hang_up it didn ' t make sense keep talking to that useless woman .
negative	i found their customer_service very poor and ignorant .
negative	i ' ve cried so hard .
negative	i can ' t believe_how they treat their customers .
negative	never send nothing with them .
negative	i don ' t recommend this company what so ever !
negative	i shop a lot online and this company is the worst company i ' ve dealt_with .
negative	but experience well learnt .
negative	please avoid them at all cost !
negative	i have been a loyal cutomer for almost a year now and during this time i have bought loads of wowcher deals .
negative	in october i got a deal for a smart mobile phone with vivacity and redeemed it on the 00th of october plus addtional postage of £ 0 . 00 , since that period everytime i checked with vivacity account it said that it was being_processed .
negative	it took_ages before i could finally get a reponse from wowcher .
negative	finally on the 00th of nov a got an_email from wowcher promising me that my order would be with me no later that the following_monday because the had received " spread sheets and scans from the merchant confirming it and a signature woud be needed ".
negative	towards the end of the following week i emailed wowcher advising them that the package had not arrived and even if it was second class it should have arrived , i asked for the tracking_number so as to track it .
negative	no tracking_number received to date .
negative	i have advised wowcher that i would be complaining to the oft because this clearly breached the trading practices act because not only did i not receive the product they sold me i was ripped_off by paying dearly for posting a product that i cant get a tracking_number to .
negative	true to my word i have just finished drafting my letter to them .
negative	i use groupon and living_social deals but have never being treated like this .
negative	wowcher will confirm that i have bought loads of deals and found them quite a few clients ( family and friends ) but customer_service is almost non_existant , imagine from october to december i am no closer to this issue being resolved .
negative	my advice to people is use groupon or living_social deals and save_yourself your time and money !!!
negative	!
negative	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
negative	thoroughly distgusted .
negative	i have purchase a contract with vodafone and hope to get £_00 cashback in august_0000 and have raised a missing cashback_claim straight_away coz they haven ' t tracked my transaction .
negative	provided all details needed , then the long process started .
negative	sent at_least 0 nudges to them since august , no replies at all ...
negative	i sent a message on 00th_march and they replied and said : ' nudges are not a request for a response , they simply help us to indicate which claims to prioritise '.
negative	but isn ' t it obvious 0 nudges didn ' t get them to prioritise my claim anyway !!!
negative	ok , i then sent 0 messages and got 0 replies each of which just means they ' re processing my claim .... which sounds_like an excuse anyway because god_knows_how long that will take !!
negative	maybe my phone contract would end and the cashback_claim is still ' being_processed '!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	so cheating ........
negative	please do not use them to get any mobile phone contract !!!
negative	!
negative	last_year , my hp 0000 laptop goes_wrong , graphic_card may be damaged .
negative	so after some research , i decide to go cclonline to fix it , which will cost me £_000 to replace the motherboard .
negative	i have a desktop_pc , so this hp laptop i hardly use it .
negative	but only 0 month later , my laptop issue came back .
negative	i couldn ' t even start .
negative	so i take out the old motherboard they said replaced .
negative	i found it doesn ' t match the size of my laptop .
negative	so i doubt whether they change it or not .
negative	so i went to another laptop fix shop , they checked , the motherboard haven ' t been changed .
negative	it is the original one .
negative	bloody hell , how can this happen ?
negative	?
negative	after seeing the advert on telly i wanted to join wowcher and see what ' s on offer .
negative	i joined wowcher and the deals were very tempting .
negative	i was excited to use one of the offer .
negative	(£ 0 . 00 for 000 photo prints ) i paid for the offer and followed all the steps provided to redeem the wowcher .
negative	the merchant ' s website could not validate the code provided from wowcher .
negative	i spent hours and hours to select the photos i wanted .
negative	it was sheer waste of my time .
negative	wowcher --> i wonder_how you are able to run your business with this sort of service .
negative	pathetic .
negative	oh dear , it seems as if i ' m not the only one suffering with this retailer ' s poor customer_service and deliveries .
negative	ordered an item on june 0th , which i ' ve still yet to receive .
negative	despite contacting the retailer on june 00th , 00th and 00st , i have received a single reply on the 00th to advise they are investigating .
negative	however , i ' ve yet to receive a reply since then , and am now out of pocket as there is no item and they have my money .
negative	avoid at all costs - despite their previous positive_reviews , it appears in the last few weeks they are not delivering items .
negative	do not order from them .
negative	i sent back a item for a full_refund under dsr more_than a month_ago , i still yet to receive a refund which they keep saying they will process yet don ' t !
negative	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
negative	i was threatened on the phone that i will not receive a refund if i keep calling them about it , and i was also called a idiot on the phone !
negative	ever since the hut group took over this company customer_service is terrible , scam_artists !
negative	avoid like the plague
negative	i was with aol from the days of compuserve and had always raved_about them ; their reliability , speeds , customer_service .... oh how times have changed !
negative	!
negative	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
negative	aol blamed everything from filters to the router to windows , basically anything_else apart_from them .
negative	i ' m quite geeky so when i caught them out at each point they finally , after many calls over 0 months offered to upgrade my service and send a new modem - all i ' d have to do was sign_up to a new contract .
negative	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
negative	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 ' s era pc with a script to read from .
negative	they have no clue_what to do , are unwilling to escalate and their two main functions are to :
negative	a ) get you to sign_up for another contract - preferably with line_rental .
negative	b ) get you off the phone by telling you any lie they can think of , or as a failsafe that you have come through to the wrong department and they can ' t transfer you .
negative	my main issues were with email not being received , but this didn ' t worry them .
negative	i was promised call_backs , escalations , uk_based technical_team visits ..... nothing .
negative	what really angered me were the constant lies , when you have been a loyal_customer for 00 years , you expect better treatment that this .
negative	i left in march and have not looked back .
negative	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
negative	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don ' t .
negative	i went to the extreme of changing everything away from my aol email but when my cancellation was complete , my email and screen name have remained active .
negative	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .
negative	i ' m now with orange as i also have my mobile contract with them and although others may complain_about them , i ' ve found them good .
negative	sky are attractive if you stay on their good side , but my advice would be to go with o0 who seem to have the best customer support and that is what you need if things go_wrong .
negative	won ' t use again !
negative	terrible service and a rude staff_member .
negative	nothing else to say other than avoid them .
negative	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
negative	but same time charing 00 gbp for installation of the line i already have !!!
negative	!
negative	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren ' t moving inch forward .
negative	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
negative	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
negative	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone call .
negative	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
negative	customer_service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
negative	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
negative	sold item on ebay bough delivery with interpacel two days late picking it up only going 000_miles down the road 00 days_later got email_saying item is lost no money back no help nothing
negative	stay_away i wouldn ' t wish this company on my enemies !
negative	0 star is 0_stars too many
negative	i ordered and paid for a tunic on 0th_september , expecting delivery in the following week .
negative	by the end of september it still hadn ' t arrived so i sent an_email , followed_by a phone call to the office .
negative	it is now the 00th_october and i have had no replies to the 0 emails i have sent and no one has bothered to contact me following the two calls i have made - i assured someone would look_into it and call me back .
negative	i will_continue to chase this !
negative	i bought a pair of trainers and unfortunately they didn ' t fit my boyfriend .
negative	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
negative	i foolishly purchased online without reviewing the policy but presumed they would be in line with their main competitors .
negative	this was not the case ......
negative	so now i have a pair of trainers that won ' t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
negative	better customer_service can definitely be found elsewhere !
negative	called jl and they advised me store had stock and would price_match ( never knowingly undersold my ar $ e !
negative	).
negative	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don ' t stock that ' response .
negative	useless and poor internal comms !
negative	very dissapointed with experience , purchased from a different retailer in the end .
negative	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
negative	thieves !
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i order 0 ray - ban sunglasses on this website on 00 april .
negative	today is 0 may , and i haven ' t received anything .
negative	during this period , i write many e_- mail to them .
negative	they always let me wait 0 days to reply it .
negative	now they blame on the supplier and want me to wait another 0 - 00days
negative	can you believe that ?
negative	i have wait over 00 days and now i need to wait another 0 - 00days !!
negative	!
negative	if they out of stock , they should mention on website .
negative	it is cheating and waste my time
negative	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer_service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
negative	i put in my offer code which they said may not show straight_away but would be applied to my statement ....
negative	however , when i received my statement i have been charged in full .
negative	i rang customer_service and was told to email .... why when i am talking to you ?????
negative	they then said that the offer code was on spends of £_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
negative	i now interestingly cannot access this ' online voucher '.
negative	i feel that they dangle carrots and then do not follow through ... this to me is fraudulant ... there customer_service is appalling .
negative	sent a blackberry 0000 almost 0 weeks_ago . was told payment would be made today ( 00st jan ) still no payment !
negative	ridiculous seeing as they said 0 working_days !
negative	appauling customer_service .... also says on site on my account not paid . before they say they have !.......................
negative	latest_update , they emailed to say money would be in bank today as promised !
negative	! with a 0 pound goodwill_gesture on top ( why thankyou .. not ).
negative	still no money !
negative	! and have re - emailed them0 times !!
negative	!
negative	friend from california sent me a gift of a photo on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	on 00 / 00 i receive a note from parcelforce demanding import vat and a clearance fee ( the latter being £_00 . 00 ).
negative	no pay , no delivery .
negative	fine .
negative	i followed their instructions , went to their website , paid the toll , and arranged for next_day delivery .
negative	nothing turned_up .
negative	and nothing has as i write nearly a month later .
negative	i just rang to complain , chose the option to speak to a real_person and was immediately disconnected !
negative	tried again , got shown the exit again .
negative	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
negative	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
negative	i struggle to find signal which is ever good enough to have a quality phone conversation or quick internet .
negative	i live in central_london and have no signal in my house .
negative	the customer support is appalling ( this is when you can hear what is being said over a poor quality line ) with no helpful advice ever being given or your issues listened to .
negative	call_centre support workers are positively rude and accusatory ; when i called i was treated like an_idiot for 00 long minutes which left me absolutely_fuming .
negative	i will not be renewing my contract when it comes up for renewal - an awful company to be contractually tied to ... i strongly_recommend against them .
negative	not even fully with first_utility yet but after a week of trying to contact them im heading back to my previous_supplier .
negative	sent an_email to them on monday , got a automated_reply and heard_nothing since .
negative	tried to call on monday with no joy .
negative	tried again today and again no joy .
negative	read the reviews on this site and low and behold they answered first time when i said i wanted to join .
negative	i then got transfered both_times and cut_off .
negative	customer_service is obviously low on their company values .
negative	ta ta
negative	the single worst online shopping_experience ever .
negative	wish you could give no stars .
negative	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
negative	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton ' s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
negative	i provided them with the information that was required and was assured that delivery would be quick .
negative	another week_later and still no delivery and still no update from thornton ' s , except that they we ' re sorry for the experience and they strive for ' excellent customer_service '....?!
negative	0 days on and still no delivery .
negative	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
negative	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
negative	don ' t even get me started on the customer_service in store as well .
negative	for a brand such as thornton ' s they need to sort this out immediately - go onto their facebook and just see the amount of complaints and their distinct lack of adequate complaint resolutions .
negative	save your money and go elsewhere .
negative	or if you like thornton ' s , buy their chocolate from tesco .
negative	i ordered a few items from a clothing company who use yodel as their couriers .
negative	big_mistake on their part , i probably won ' t use this clothing company again whilst they continue to use yodel .
negative	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
negative	it got to 0pm and no delivery .
negative	and it was still stating it was in their main service centre .
negative	not my local .
negative	so i rang .
negative	to be told , it ' s possibly lost .
negative	they ' ll forward my issue and i ' ll hear back from them , then they hung_up phone .
negative	so i waited for them to return my call ( they hung_up instead of transferring me ) i didn ' t hear back so i rang again .
negative	this time i told them that i needed it delivered to my work address the following_day ( i wasn ' t happy about this .
negative	i paid for express delivery for my holiday !!!).
negative	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
negative	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
negative	next_day , i waited for a call .
negative	no call !
negative	i rang again !
negative	now they ' re telling_me there ' s no address on my parcel , only the town .
negative	( this was lies , i got thr parcel eventually and there is an address !).
negative	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
negative	0pm arrives .
negative	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
negative	the man has complete attitude !
negative	saying well it ' s only 0pm .
negative	obviously ( he said this ).
negative	it won ' t be there yet .
negative	i was fuming .
negative	000pm arrives .
negative	no parcel again .
negative	i ring again .
negative	now they give me couriers number .
negative	the courier hadn ' t been told to deliver to my work address , despite me telling 0 different people where it was to go !!!
negative	unfortunately , the courier lady was lovely , so it ' s not her fault , but yodel as a company are useless !
negative	i am awaiting contact about 0 different complaints i have made regarding their poor customer_service .
negative	and the attitude of their employees .
negative	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
negative	but it ' s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
negative	avoid yodel !
negative	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort out any complaints or issues they cause !
negative	i ordered 0 items from them , on 0 . 0 . 00 .
negative	it is now 00 . 0 . 00 and according to their website , my items are in progress .
negative	so they haven ' t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
negative	i emailed three times , and rang twice .
negative	to which i have had no reply .
negative	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
negative	this is a complete scam company .
negative	they took my money quick enough and straight_away !
negative	i ' m lucky i paid through paypal as i ' m opening a dispute !
negative	do not use this company .
negative	you will lose out !
negative	i bought two things online both from croydon .
negative	both said dispatched emails one arrived_promptly the other i waited the 0 days and then mailed .
negative	no response - mailed again the next_day copying in info @ - again no response .
negative	raised a complaint with paypal asking again polity where it was - no apology just a tracking_number : it was sent on the day i fist asked where it was - obviously that had prompted them into sending it .
negative	why couldn ' t they just sent a email_saying sorry - its in the post now ?
negative	another complaint - sent a email to feedback_@ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
negative	over 00 months the tv didn ' t work , the internet was on and off and they charged to fix it and then it still didn ' t work > cost me 000 to reconnect my phone line after they put it on their own line > a really bad_experience >
negative	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here ' s my review of you
negative	god_awful service from dabs
negative	god help anyone who uses this company .
negative	il begin with the web_site stating my solid state drive would be in stock in 0 - 0 days , 0 days_later i got bored of waiting and removed this order since it was a compleate load of rubish that it will be arriving within 0 days
negative	so ...... my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card ...... whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
negative	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo .... how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
negative	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
negative	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
negative	out of intrest i sent them an_email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
negative	my job takes me away from my hometown and although im not strugling for money i would have been looking at taking a new contract last_week , yet im still stuck here with no answers , not even replys to my emails
negative	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
negative	nothing .....
negative	all i want is to be able to return the faulty_goods iv been delivered , and i should at_least get back half the cash for the chasis
negative	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court
negative	kind rigards

negative	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
negative	i assumed this was an oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank_details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
negative	i rang back to check if this went through ok only to be told i had been declined by o0 , no explanation was offered as to why .
negative	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
negative	rang back carphone_warehouse to explain the above , no satisfactory explanation just told me i had been declined due to adverse credit , this is utter nonsense as i have since seen my equifax credit_report which has no marks or blemishes and scores me as " excellent ", the only offer your staff made was to try another network .
negative	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
negative	since i have seen my credit_report ( and its fine ) i have asked them to tell me specifically why my application has been declined , surprisingly they couldnt tell me .
negative	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
negative	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
negative	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	edit_: 00 / 00 / 00 - well its 0 working_days on and no comment from cpw - bad publicity on trustpilot is one thing but we ' ll see what watchdog have to say about it if cpw cant be bothered to respond on here .
negative	i would urge_anyone to stay clear of this awful company .
negative	we ( myself and partner ) purchased tickets for the highly anticipated carl froch vs mikkel kessler boxing match at a cost of over £_000 .
negative	after saving up the spending money for months and also paying a very large_sum for accommodation and transport we arrived at the arena only to be told our tickets were fraudulent .
negative	i can not praise the o0 staff enough as they were extremely polite and professional and did there best to calm down a very upset customer .
negative	they advised me they had experienced a lot of problems with viagogo before and they had allowed the tickets to be sold more_than once .
negative	conveniently there " helpline " they provided for any_problems have been shut_down .
negative	upon finally getting hold of them 0 days_later i was told they were aware of the issue with the tickets and had tried to contact me .
negative	i can guarantee this did not happen .
negative	they had two contact numbers for me and an_email address and none of these were contacted .
negative	the conduct of there call_centre staff was astonishingly bad .
negative	they have processed a refund for me .
negative	when i questioned how they were going to compensate my expenses they said they would send me a voucher for a future event ( incidentally i am still yet to receive this ).
negative	when i commented that this would not suffice fully as i would never use them again and i wanted my travel and expenses covered in full , i was advised i had to write to there head_office in switzerland , again at my own cost .
negative	i have now done this and am awaiting a response .
negative	this event was on my partners_birthday and they have completely_ruined what should have been a great weekend , also before anybody says viagogoo were not too know the tickets were fraudulent etc_., they did know , they have admitted this to me .
negative	they then_proceeded to lie about trying to contact me and closed_down a helpline , even_though they knew they had sold myself , and probably others fraudulent tickets .
negative	i am also sure they are so obstructive with there complaints_procedure as they think people will not bother following it through .
negative	well on this occasion i am afraid they are wrong and i have also reported this to trading_standards and the ombudsman and am awaiting further_action .
negative	in summary they are unhelpful , untrustworthy and more_importantly they are bare faced liars .
negative	avoid at all costs unless you want to experience a nightmare like me .
negative	there is not an option to put 0_stars , or else i would have .
negative	not good im not very happy as the delivery said they would be here on the tuesday the 00th of january for the digital_piano but now they are saying the cant be bother to deliverer this piano on the day as they now saying it wont be here to me for another 0 - 00 days as wont be ordering from here ever again
negative	i have been with vodafone over 0 years ... and not been happy with the bills , customer_services and generally the whole company !!
negative	!
negative	i had been over charged on each bill for no apparent_reason and took me over 0 years to get my money back for the over charge !!
negative	i had to go through my bills each month an check properly .. just to see where they will charge me extra !
negative	not happy at all !
negative	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
negative	( unless you can :_p ).
negative	ive had a problem this morning with o0 top - up not crediting my wifes phone after the £_00 was taken from my account , the bank has confirmed this with a transaction_id .
negative	0 hours of phone_calls and im now waiting for a manager to call me back , but the way ive been dealt_with so far im not expecting a call .
negative	the " customers service " advisors are the most incompetent patronising and unproffesional i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
negative	phone service and reception is also very poor and mobile internet is poor at best , if i can get a signal .
negative	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
negative	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
negative	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
negative	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
negative	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
negative	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
negative	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
negative	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
negative	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
negative	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
negative	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
negative	i made an order on the 0th_october_0000 , it ' s now january_0000 and i still_haven ' t received the whole order .
negative	part of what i did receive was damaged due to poor packing .
negative	it was food but the packaging was ripped open so it was mouldy !
negative	i have tried_calling waeplus but there is never anyone on the phonelines and all my emails are met with silence .
negative	according to their website i can ' t have a refund whilst the order is ' partially delivered '.
negative	however , i think that waiting for 0 months is enough time to ask for a refund .
negative	the service has been terrible and i feel_like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
negative	update_:
negative	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn ' t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
negative	in april i received a cheque , made out to the wrong name .
negative	they are either trying really hard not to give me any money back or are just incompetent .
negative	over charged for delivery and i would never use again !!!
negative	all beauty .
negative	com is so much_better
negative	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i ' d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
negative	i have recycled two iphones in the past with a different company and received perfect service , received exactly the same amount i was quoted and received my money quickly .
negative	i chose to use bozowi this time because it offers the highest amount and claims the same level of service i have received before - do not be_fooled you will not receive this amount for your phone !
negative	my phone was sent off in good condition , followed all of the critieria for a fully working phone iphone_0s in good condition and i was quoted £_000 . 00 - i have received ( although its not actually in my account yet ) £_000 because it was locked to o0 - this was not made clear to me when i entered the contract and i can see from reviews on here that they have only just changed their website this week to say that .
negative	i spoke to a guy in customer_services who also said their terms and conditions had been changed on the website this tuesday 00th_march - my contract was formed on the 00th_february
negative	the thing that has made me even more angry is that i was supposed to receive an_email from them with the revised_offer of £_000 which i never received so i did not have the opportunity to decline their offer and get my phone back .
negative	they claim to have emailed me although my it department have traced all emails and would be notified if anything was blocked for whatever_reason and nothing has tried to come through from them - i received my confirmation_email from them no problem but conveniently this one never arrived in my inbox or even made it to the server .
negative	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0 days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
negative	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn ' t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0 days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn ' t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?
negative	one of the three people i spoke to at customer_services confirmed that they had received my email so i know this is not another suposed problem with email
negative	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
negative	i made them aware i hadn ' t received any emails from them and they did nothing , a decent company would see my email , re send the offer email and possibly extend the 0 day rule knowing there had been problems .
negative	my phone has now been sent somewhere_else apparently and they can ' t get it back .
negative	don ' t even get me started on the people they have representing their customer_services - i wasted 0 hour 00_minutes on the phone to them to get nothing resolved , no apology just them implying that i am lying and it ' s not their problem .
negative	at times they spoke with attitude , when i commented that i had been on the phone for 00_minutes the girl replied " no 0 minutes actually " in a rude manner to which i pointed_out she wasn ' t the first person i had been put through to so infact it was 00_minutes .
negative	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn ' t even reached my account !
negative	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
negative	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
negative	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco ' s for £ 0 .
negative	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
negative	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
negative	they are okay if you register before days like easter .
negative	i ordered my domain on friday ( it ' s now saturday ) and they have said i have to wait for monday !
negative	this is fustrating !
negative	live_chat not very helpful neither .
negative	well firstly i ordered items on the monday by talking to a woman from customer_services because their website was down and was not working .
negative	the whole_thing went fine and she even gave me her e_- mail address so that i could send her all the items and messages i wanted to include so that she could order the items through her end .
negative	i sent her all the items i wanted plus messages and plus the free_stuff i was going to recieve .
negative	i have proof that i wrote down my postage and billing_address right as i double_checked what i had sent her .
negative	two days had passed and no delivery so i decided to call them up and they told me they sent it to the wrong_address and to knock for them to get the items back .
negative	i knocked at the door and i got no answer .
negative	i at_least tried for 0 or 0 days straight as what i had ordered was a birthday_present for my sister on the coming saturday , as i did not end up getting my items i then called them back demanding for a replacement but this time to the right address .
negative	0 days_later my items came .
negative	a ) they sent my items to the wrong_address , b ) they messed_up my birthday_present for intended person so ruined that and c ) although they sent me replacements , they did not apologise and therefore i will never order from them again because they ruined the occassion !!!!
negative	!
negative	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse than the last .
negative	the first item took over a week to dispatch and my second order , placed 00 days ago , has not even been dispatched yet .
negative	as a result i would like to cancel my order and have notified the company of this .
negative	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
negative	will_definitely not be using them again .
negative	i hate o0 , the customer_service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
negative	you continue to be diverted to another area e . g .
negative	to contract cancellation team , or the pay_monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
negative	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
negative	one month i spent over £_000 . 00 as i was away in south_america .
negative	i also had my phone line , my broadband and ipad linked to o0 , and yet they still seem not to value me as a customer , or to execute any basic task i ask them to e . g . help with a broken phone .
negative	i ' ve been with them since i had my first ever phone .
negative	i hate the fact i am contracted to o0 and am unable to leave without a huge fine .
negative	as soon as i am able to get out i will .
negative	you order things , and days_later after chasing , they finally tell you it ' s out of stock and you ' ll get a refund , ok , that would be fine if , they didn ' t have multiple companies around the uk that they own , doing the exact_same_thing !
negative	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it ' s in stock , get charged , then the same_thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
negative	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!
negative	three times !
negative	don ' t buy from these , needed to cancel order , tried to charge me 00_% of total order to cancel it - how they still exist is beyond me .
negative	don ' t be taken in by their cheap prices , or promises of good customer support - this company , it seems , is a sham .
negative	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
negative	once ordered , the order status page then gave me 0 - 00 days .
negative	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
negative	spending 00_minutes waiting for someone to answer my call , an indian lass answered , citing a ' delay ' in getting it dispatched , as if it were a valid excuse .
negative	' next week ' she pulled out of the air .
negative	never going to happen .
negative	they don ' t have the stock , plain and simple .
negative	getting a refund , or else my bank is getting involved .
negative	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these_jokers .
negative	i guarantee you , wae_+ will not exist in 0 months time .
negative	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long queues .
negative	we and the kids had a really bad day out here - luckily i wasn ' t paying but a relative was and we all felt upset she had wasted her money , even the kids .
negative	wrote to legoland customer_services but just got a bland response which did not address the issues i raised .
negative	i ' m amazed at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
negative	so don ' t expect it to change if you complain , and i doubt it will get better .
negative	still , if you want a decent day out go somewhere_else and spend the money on something else .
negative	all costs money , fees , taxes , queue jumping , luggage ( 00 £ for 00kg !!!)
negative	admin_fee , sell sell sell , sick of this company :/
negative	boring , only am there to keep in touch with family
negative	after having unlimited subscription if you have anything on your list forget about an easy cancel process as if you have anything at home they won ' t cancel and if you send the discs back they allocate you another !
negative	so even_though you don ' t have any movies at home they will say " well they ' re on its way ", thiefs i will say , not impressed at all and never again !
negative	not recommending to anyone !
negative	i bought the tickets of the 0 directions 0 month in_advance to make_sure my sister could go to their concert and paid 000_euros for one place in front of the podium !!!
negative	0 weeks before the event i started calling to be reassured that i was gonna get the tickets on time .
negative	they kept reassuring me about it until 0 day before the event to finally admit that they didnt have the f ... tickets .
negative	i asked them to call me before reimbursing me because i wanted the alternative of having 0 tickets instead of one , in whatever place in the arena .
negative	after a few hours they send me an_email telling_me than i ve been reimbursed .
negative	i called to ask an explanation and they kept telling_me the same things all over and over again .
negative	i understand that this is not the customer_service fault so i didnt have a go at them but i am seriously thinking about suing them .
negative	even_though they have reimbursed me , this was an absolutely_ridiculous service .
negative	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven ' t dispatched the order for over one month !
negative	and no one respond the email and phone call !
negative	!
negative	i couldn ' t believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
negative	my phone didn ' t have the that button and says " well it wouldn ' t work without that button !"
negative	i says that ' s impossible as my phones been fine but now i can ' t get onto wifi .
negative	i could never get into 0g either !
negative	i never complained and just thought that it was due to the location i was in .
negative	now i can ' t even go on wifi and decided to take it out on the wifi company .
negative	they asked if my other phones did this and i said " no ".
negative	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn ' t their problem .
negative	i decided to ask apple_store itself .
negative	they found that apple hasn ' t even activated the 0g_network and told me to call o0 .
negative	but after that phone call - their customer_service is awful !
negative	they gave me such a talk about a settings that wasn ' t even there !
negative	it was definitely their fault - i mean i bought it from them .
negative	they then went on and on .
negative	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
negative	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
negative	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
negative	awful customer_service .
negative	i ' ve just found out that i ' ve been paying £_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
negative	switch to t - mobile !
negative	my sister ' s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
negative	i ordered 0x 0 - seater samara sofas on the 00th or 00th_december .
negative	i accepted that there would be a delay from their usual 0 - week delivery timeframe and the 00 - week wait that they indicated on their web_site was more_than i ' d have liked but as they were cheap i went for it anyway .
negative	this is such a schoolboy error on my part .
negative	the company didn ' t call me , and still_haven ' t called me ever in fact , and i had to chase them after 00 weeks , then 00 weeks , then 00 weeks .
negative	i phoned them two_weeks_ago and some guy who couldn ' t speak clear english to save his life told me that they ' d arrange a discount when they arrived .
negative	i asked if that was ' arrived with me ' or ' arrived with them ', he said that they needed to be delivered then they ' d arrange a discount .
negative	i said i didn ' t want them and i wouldn ' t accept them until we ' d arranged a discount .
negative	we argued the point then he accepted .
negative	i asked him to repeat it to me for clarification and - of course - he told me that they ' d negotiate when the items arrived with me .
negative	it took a further two times of me telling him what to say for him to repeat it verbatim .
negative	i phoned twice since then and was told nothing new .
negative	then when i finally called someone said :-
negative	" they ' ll be with you on the 00nd april "
negative	" no they won ' t "
negative	" what do you mean ?"
negative	" i ' m not accepting them "
negative	" why not ?"
negative	" well , a number of reasons that mostly relate to the fact that harveys is awful and i absolutely regret having purchased them from you , coupled_with the fact that nobody has ever called when when i requested it "
negative	" ok , i ' ll put you through to customer_services "
negative	i was offered a 00_% reduction , which i laughed at , then 00 %, which i laughed harder at .
negative	i was then asked to e_- mail websales @ harveys - furnishings . co . uk to tell them i ' d like to cancel .
negative	i did that on monday last_week and said " if you get back to me within 0 working_days i ' ll consider accepting these sofas however only if you discount them by 00 %".
negative	as expected i ' ve received nothing .
negative	i literally can ' t believe_how bad this company is .
negative	no wonder the harveys store where i live ( wsm ) has closed_down .
negative	please , under no circumstances should your life be so bad that you feel you have to buy from a company like this .
negative	there are better things to do with your time .
negative	i think my dog ' s ears need a bit of a cleaning ; this would be a far more productive thing to do with your time than waste it with harveys .
negative	just received my refund order placed 0 / 0 / 00 order refunded 00 / 0 / 00 customer_service team move the goal posts on a daily_basis to accommodate there unacceptable service .
negative	this company may be cheaper_than the high_street but more chance of wining the lottery that receiveing proper timely help when delivery you pay for is not received nor refunded .
negative	£_00 . 00 is a lot to pay for delivery still_waiting after almost 0 months on an explanation as to why we are not being refunded for pallet delivery when our bathroom_suite arrived loose in the back of a transit with several items damaged and broken waiting almost 0 months for refund of damaged items but no refund for pallet delivery we did not receive .
negative	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
negative	avoid as you have no guarantee of receiving your goods damage free and have no chance of resolving in a timely_manner be warned an extremely stressful experience that has put me off online shopping .
negative	very bad customer_service ...
negative	i am still_waiting ,.
negative	they replied back and said wait next 0 business days , if no answer from operator , they will issue refund ... but they did not keep the promise ...
negative	i paid 00 . 00gbp :(((
negative	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn ' t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
negative	i sent my perfectly working iphone_0s 00gb in white , lock to o0 to bozowi .
negative	first of all i was given a quote of £_000 .
negative	all was well till i received an_email_stating “ the engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a scratches on the unit and on camera lens and phone is network locked to o0 ”
negative	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
negative	i also knew there was a tiny scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
negative	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of £_000 .
negative	the company then went on to say if i unlocked the phone ( at a cost ) they would up the quote by £_00 .
negative	i was not happy .
negative	the company is here to rip people off so they can make more money on the phone themselves .
negative	they charge you £_00 to return your phone , which i ended_up paying .
negative	i received my phone back on wed00th april .
negative	i have since sent it to mazuma on thurs 00th apr and they have paid the £_000 quote straight_away and has cleared my bank today , fri 00th_april
negative	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
negative	!
negative	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
negative	!
negative	i read good reviews for panelbase , it was even at the top of some survey lists .
negative	however , my experience with them has been the opposite .
negative	very , very few surveys in comparison with other survey sites like valued opinions or mysurvey .
negative	there is a very tedious profiling section to be completed at the beginning and it ' s all for nothing .
negative	most of the time i ' m not even eligible for their surveys , yet they give them to me anyway ( at most one per week ).
negative	terrible site and an_absolute waste of time .
negative	avoid .
negative	nothing good to say about it - really hate this site .
negative	their origin service is atrocious , their downloadable content schemes pathetic , and their respect for gamers nowhere to be found .
negative	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
negative	they ' ve taken enough franchises under their wing and prematurely buried them - amongst them some of my favourites .
negative	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
negative	the customer is always right , and ea should finally open their eyes to see that .
negative	by the way , just look_elsewhere online to see the appalling services that ea have provided .
negative	i don ' t know how a company like dell can continue running their business with their current customer support base .
negative	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job ... until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that ' s my belief anyway ).
negative	i had a laptop for about three years before it kicked the bucket , and , to my surprise , i had forgotten about the warranty that i had with it .
negative	it was actually due to run out about a month after the time of the laptop dying .
negative	called up support , was redirected to india and was put on the line with totally unhelpful staff that i couldn ' t understand , and who probably couldn ' t understand me .
negative	if you think it ' s as simple as saying " my laptop is broken , and the warranty covers it , please come and send assistance " then think again .
negative	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
negative	first off , they don ' t believe you .
negative	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute nightmare .
negative	i managed to somehow spark some life into it and go through a few bios checks over the phone with dell .
negative	the results of that ?
negative	inconclusive , but they " suspected " different problems .
negative	i had to get a family_member braver than i to shout down the phone at them to send an engineer out .
negative	on and on this went , and then they finally did their job , sent an engineer out who didn ' t have the proper equipment .
negative	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
negative	woo !
negative	then the laptop dies of the same problem two months later .
negative	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your sanity .
negative	this is the worst customer_service i have ever received .
negative	initially was refunded for items not provided in the shipping .
negative	the second time however was when the charger for my lavatube shorted while charging batteries , both malfunctioned .
negative	was requested to send back the charger , which i did at my own_expense .
negative	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no indication of whether i ' ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .
negative	avoid !
negative	flowers 0 days late - will they turn_up ?
negative	doubt it now .
negative	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn ' t !!
negative	don ' t use this company .
negative	so disappointed for my friend .
negative	ordered a couple of pc parts totalling just under £_000 .
negative	even paid £ 0 . 00 for the express delivery ( 0 - 0 days ).
negative	was given an expected delivery date of 0 - 0 days_later than the 0 days for the express delivery .
negative	decided that i would wait for the estimated_delivery date .
negative	this is the last day but still no sign of the items so i e_- mailed and called the customer_services .
negative	i was told that the item was not at their warehouse but that it was expected to arrive today .
negative	this however , means that the item will not get sent until monday and i will not receive it until tuesday ( 0 days after the express delivery i paid for and 0 days_later than the estimated_delivery dates given !!!)
negative	at the time of ordering the parts they were " in stock ".
negative	at no point in all this was i informed that the item i ordered in was not in stock and would take longer to get here .
negative	had i been informed of this i would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere .
negative	when i called them and spoke to their customer_services i asked for a refund on my express delivery as they had not kept to the time_frame .
negative	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
negative	as if i would want to use them again after this experience .
negative	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
negative	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have ' t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
negative	!
negative	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
negative	!
negative	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
neutral	wow .
neutral	all my christmas ' coming at once .
neutral	update your points shop , stop fobbing people off with daft stories about doing this and that , and delivering nothing .
neutral	hungry_house is just behind just_eat in terms of my spending spree ... and put it another way ...
neutral	" you get 000 points for every £ 0 you spend "
neutral	i have over 0 / 0 million points , so kinda class myself as a customer who has the right to moan his arse off if he so chooses .
neutral	boo !
neutral	i ordered a plastic door clamp band for my candy washing_machine .
neutral	i paid extra for next_day delivery using dpd knowing they will give me a 0hr time_slot early morning , as they have always done when i ordered from any other retailer in the past .
neutral	i eventually received a text with my delivery time_slot at precisely 00 : 00 and by that time , my entire day had already been spoilt as the delivery was due for 0pm - whats the point of receiving a time_slot if you receive it so late !
neutral	to put the icing on the cake , when the part was delivered , it is something completely_different to what i had ordered !
neutral	i ordered a plastic clamp band , and i receive a piece of metal - completely_different things .
neutral	when i raised this with yourselves , i was told it was the replacement item so someone just decided to send me the piece of metal !
neutral	absolutely_shocking service - couldn ' t they have asked me if i would like to receive a completely_useless part before sending it out wasting an entire day of mine ?
neutral	not only this , but i am told the item is no_longer made , yet it is still available for sale on your website today !
neutral	shocking service - i now have to spend more time returning the item ( don ' t know how as i don ' t own a printer !)
neutral	to receive my refund - why dont you come and collect it seeing this is your screw up !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	will never purchase from yourselves again and rest_assured that i will ensure i pass on my experience to as many as possible .
neutral	thanks for nothing .
neutral	----------------------
neutral	in addition to this , i just called candy / hoover to ask about this part and they have 0000 of them in stock - you told me they don ' t make them anymore !
neutral	!
neutral	their reply to what you said was that you gave me completely incorrect_information as they will keep manufacturing spare_parts for my specific machine until 0000 !
neutral	!
neutral	once again - shocking !
neutral	-----------------------------------------------------
neutral	after a custom service representative called me about this issue , it seems that the item that was sent to me was a picking error , and should not have been sent out to me , as i initially suspected .
neutral	unfortunately , when i initially called to query the issue , their representative on the phone was not pro - active enough to look_into this with further depth and simply assumed that the part i received was the replacement for the part that i ordered .
neutral	it turns_out that the part i required is still available , and this is why it is still for - sale on their website .
neutral	the representative offered me the replacement part free of charge for my inconvenience but i had to decline as i have already ordered the part directly from the manufacturer .
neutral	because of the way the complaint was dealt_with by this representative , and the pro - active response from customer_services , i have changed my rating from a 0 star to a 0 star , and it has partially restored my confidence in e_- spares .
neutral	i have placed lo0ads of orders with amazon and when they go_wrong it ' s really difficult to sort it out , but they very rairly go_wrong .
neutral	the dawsons team are very helpful .. but the item was out of stock .
neutral	waited the two week advised period , chased the new delivery date only to be told it will be another three_weeks !... this is a supplier issue , so to some extent beyond dawsons control ... but its very frustrating !
neutral	!
neutral	the money i was offered wasn ' t great , i sold 00 cd ' s and got £_00 . 00 !!
neutral	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
neutral	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn ' t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly .... you know they ' ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
neutral	i ' m useless with computers but finally got my game registered etc , i would have given a higher rating but i had no support off games planet what so ever , and it took 0 days and countless e_- mails for a reply to be told sorry i wasn ' t contacted back it ' s just that my case wasn ' t assigned to anyone .
neutral	booked a long_haul holiday a year in_advance online no_problems .
neutral	with one week to go until departure our tickets had still not arrived .
neutral	contacted customer support who were very polite & helpful who arranged for the tickets to be collected upon departure .
neutral	tickets collected no_problems .
neutral	went to check in desk .
neutral	the man was very polite .
neutral	he said he had a few two - seater sections available & asked if we would like a window seat to which we said yes to both .
neutral	on board the thomas_cook plane we did have two seats in a two - seater section however there was no window , just the wall of the plane .
neutral	the food on the plane was aweful & the tv channels appeared to be on some sort of loop whereby you had to wait for all the other channels to end before they could be started over again .
neutral	the temperature on board initially was very cold & when i asked for a blanket i was told they had run out .
neutral	on arrival at our hotel we did not see our thomas_cook rep for a welcome meeting as they were unavailable but we did see a stand in rep . that was the only time we saw any thomas_cook rep which appeared to be a standing joke amongst other guests at the hotel .
neutral	on the flight home we were served the same meal as we ' d been given on the way out ( good job we ate at the airport first ).
neutral	the continental breakfast , served a few hours prior to landing back in th uk , consisted of just a small blueberry muffin & an orange juice .
neutral	on holiday itself we had a fantastic time .
neutral	i cannot_fault our hotel or hotel staff .
neutral	they really helped make our holiday .
neutral	all in all i would not fly long_haul with thomas_cook again for the above reasons .
neutral	maybe if i could fly with a different airline i might think again .
neutral	on a positive note the thomas_cook staff were always polite & did their best to help .
neutral	a decent email i liked it before they changed it , the simple design was great .
neutral	still better_than hotmail with their dumb metro design .
neutral	the articles are for the very dumb and i used to love their communities , but no more everyone has their own place and yahoo has fallen behind .
neutral	ahhh classic yahoo how i miss thee .
neutral	i ordered a samsung_galaxy sii .
neutral	the next_day , refurb - phone phoned me , but i missed the call .
neutral	they didn ' t leave a message or contact me by email , and since i didn ' t recognise the number i didn ' t think anything of it ( thought it was a spam call ).
neutral	after i didn ' t hear_anything for 0 days i looked up the number and realised they ' d try to contact me .
neutral	i called them - they picked_up straight_away ( no annoying call queuing ) and i had a brief but pleasant conversation .
neutral	the samsung_galaxy sii was out of stock in black but available to ship that day in white .
neutral	i don ' t care about the colour , so that was fine .
neutral	i was kept on hold for about 00 seconds while the advisor checked the status .
neutral	they then dispatched the phone to the billing_address rather_than the shipping address , which delayed things by one more day .
neutral	the phone is in good condition ( will look new once i ' ve cleaned some much off the screen ) and well_packaged ( boxed in a generic box , phone protected by bubble_wrap , charger kept safely away from phone screen , all in a correctly sized jiffy_bag ).
neutral	it ' s unlocked as specified ( no problem putting my existing o0 sim in ) and loaded with all the usual default software .
neutral	so i ' ll echo what someone said about their order fulfillment system -- they do not necessarily have the stock shown on their website .
neutral	i could have had my phone 0 days sooner if they ' d left me a message or sent an_email , and dispatched to the right address .
neutral	they also didn ' t send me any notification of shipment when they shipped the order .
neutral	this would have been helpful .
neutral	overall i ' d say i ' m happy , because the phone is good , but i don ' t think i ' d use them again .
neutral	i think i could have paid the same amount somewhere_else and not had the small amount of hassle that i had .
neutral	if i ' d read the reviews more closely and seen that some of the 0 * reviewers actually received damaged phones , no way would i have used them .
neutral	it works , however not everything occurs as they say , it takes more time and money then expected .
neutral	the products i ordered were fine and the service was good but my free ' sleep in rollers ' were meant to be worth £_00 and i can ' t understand this as it was only 00 rollers , a brush and some hairspray .
neutral	the confusion is mainly because i know that a set of 00 rollers is retails between £_00 to £_00 and the hairspray and brush are not worth that much .
neutral	was disappointed because ill have to buy another set of rollers anyway .
neutral	paypal is great ... forgot your card ?
neutral	no problem when the website accepts paypal as you just log in and pay !
neutral	also great when you are present shopping as it doesn ' t look as suspicious as having your debit / credit_card in hand when the girlfriend is hovering around you like a hawk !
neutral	just a shame that the fees are high for individuals !
neutral	means i love paying by paypal but insist in not being paid by paypal !
neutral	wiith a large consumer base ... facebook need to invest in more powerful servers .
neutral	they just can ' t cope during peak time .
neutral	was a great price and a great experience from start to finish .
neutral	was disappointed on the packaging though as glasses arrived in jiffy_bag with glasses in draw - string bag .
neutral	could have easily been crushed .
neutral	we found it really hard to identify the frequency of the bus ' s and what times they could be expected at any particular stop .
neutral	this isn ' t really a hop on hop off service , there aren ' t enough vehicles for that .
neutral	we waited between 00_mins and 00_mins for a bus on 0 occasions .
neutral	it didn ' t do the top part of the journey ( although we weren ' t warned of this when purchasing tickets ) - you had to get off at the museum and wait for another bus , which we didn ' t want to do due to the wait time .
neutral	the guides are a real mixed bunch , and boy it makes a difference !
neutral	i won ' t get personal about the guides as im sure they are all trying hard , but some did it with passion and humour and a nice voice .
neutral	whereas some just .... didn ' t .
neutral	overall i would recommend it as its a scenic tour , but don ' t expect to jump off every other stop for ten mins .
neutral	it ' ll take all day !
neutral	visited may 0000
neutral	i would have given pharmacy first five_stars - for their communication , option to use paypal , speedy dispatch and delivery , large choice of difficult - to - get - items and very reasonable prices .
neutral	however , one problem spoiled it all and that was flimsy , inadequate packaging !
neutral	my goods arrived in a thin ' jiffy_bag ' and i discovered they had been quite badly knocked about by royal_mail and one of them was actually damaged .
neutral	i managed to still use them ( they were only toiletries ) but i daren ' t order anything more_expensive in case it arrives broken .
neutral	pharmacy first simply need to ' pad - out ' their packaging a bit more .
neutral	it ' s a shame cos they seem a good company .
neutral	primark has great prices but their sizing leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	also their stirling store is very bad for putting clothes on wrong_size hangers !
neutral	i had high_hopes for this company , since they were one of the few which allowed me to customise a coat the way i wanted .
neutral	the colours and designs on the website looked promising .
neutral	when they wouldn ' t allow me to order the coat length i wanted ( seriously , does everyone only want coats that stop at the thighs ?)
neutral	they said they would be happy to extend the length if i just made the request .
neutral	so i placed my order and requested my desired length .
neutral	then i got an_email_saying that they could not extend the coat length to what i wanted , despite their sugar and spice promises before i made the order .
neutral	i said a different length is no good for me ( what ' s the point of having to compromise on a ' tailor - made ' coat ?!).
neutral	i made it clear to them that i would be willing to pay extra for my desired length , but got no reply back .
neutral	my promised delivery date came and went and when asked , they just said it would be coming soon , no explanations or apologies .
neutral	i received it 0 days after my promised date , and when i opened it , the coat was missing its belt - the whole reason i decided to order from them in the first place .
neutral	not only that , the fit was ridiculous , it was so big i could have turned it into a set of curtains .
neutral	i don ' t know if my tailor would be able to do anything about measurements this way off .
neutral	the colour was ( just about ) right , but the material quality is very poor .
neutral	definitely not as good as the website would have you believe .
neutral	for a coat , it is laughably thin - i don ' t know which part of china the tailors are based in ( and it definitely is china according to my parcel and tracking_details ) but they clearly don ' t suffer winters there , this coat wouldn ' t keep you warm in the tropics .
neutral	they clearly seem to think that coats are what europeans wear for fashion , not for function .
neutral	quality is similar to coats sold in a big discount clothing chain from the uk beginning with p . honestly , for that price you can get better coats from a department store .
neutral	when i contacted them about my missing belt , the best they could come up with was that it was definitely sent , and would i accept a £_00 . 00 credit towards my next order ?
neutral	like hell !
neutral	now they were implying that i was ripping them off for a fabric belt !
neutral	and they seemed arrogant enough to think that after all i ' d gone_through , i would still surely be placing orders in future with them , hence the credit .
neutral	i just want my belt so i can complete the slightly dodgy outfit i am now the not - so - proud owner off ( i think i can probably give it away to a friend ).
neutral	it is like having the customer_service people at a car - maker going " i ' m sorry your car came without the engine .
neutral	we will however give you credit for ( price of engine ) to spend when you buy your next car with us ."
neutral	ridiculous !
neutral	oh and best of all , when you go to the bit in their site which says ' refunds ', you won ' t find it .
neutral	turns_out they do not have a returns or refund policy !
neutral	i ' m pretty sure this is illegal by the uk ' s distance_selling regulation .
neutral	if they don ' t send me my missing belt , this is definitely something i will be exploring .
neutral	of course , why on earth any decent long - distance seller would ( possibly illegally ?)
neutral	not have a returns or refund policy is beyond me - unless they had found it was more trouble than it was worth and everyone was returning items they were dissatisfied with .
neutral	they do have a ' perfect fit guarantee ', though if that ' s their idea of perfect fit i shudder to think what their idea of imperfect is .
neutral	and how can they guarantee that when i now have to get_rid of about a third of the coat width to fit me ?
neutral	there are some things that a tailor just can ' t fix ( though i ' m still going to ask them to try ).
neutral	in summary , their product quality is below_average , measurements are out , and delivery and service is shoddy .
neutral	customer_service seem eager to please , but largely clueless and helpless when faced with such poorly - made products .
neutral	there are far better online made - to - measure tailor companies out there i have used which make a far_superior product with no need for customer_service interaction at all .
neutral	if they offered a belted coat option , i wouldn ' t have had to put myself through all this waste of time and money .
neutral	0_stars as there is ' no sign of malicious_intent ' - but i find it difficult to imagine how much worse it could have gotten even if they had had malicious_intent .
neutral	update_:
neutral	within half a day of my unflattering but honest review , they were in contact to say they ' d be sending the missing belt over asap .
neutral	surprise_surprise , big change in attitude and tone after i kicked up a storm on trustpilot .
neutral	no more fobbing me off with some credit so they could make more money off me on my next order - all of a sudden , they were sending my missing item out asap - which was all i ' d asked for in the first place !
neutral	they ' ve just come out and asked me to reassess my review on trustpilot as well , so i think it ' s pretty clear their motivation for good customer_service isn ' t to ensure i get what i paid for , but protecting their reputation .
neutral	leaves a bad taste in the mouth , to be honest .
neutral	so let ' s be fair to them - three stars : " so - so - acceptable experience but with some friction " just about nails it , although it is still pretty unacceptable to me : promising a customizable garment length then trying to backtrack on that , missed delivery time , unanswered customer query email regarding said delay , missing an item off my garment , trying to get away with not sending me the item and fobbing me off with more credit , and then changing their tune after i kicked up a fuss on trustpilot - not exactly_what i consider acceptable .
neutral	after all that , would i use them again ?
neutral	probably not .
neutral	lest it be overshadowed by the customer_service , i should elaborate on the product : i stand by my earlier assessment , it is pretty mediocre and below_average .
neutral	and before you think my idea of ' average ' is impossibly high , i just want to say that my expectations for a somewhat hefty price - tag in the region of £_000 was that it would at_least be as good as similarly - priced off - the - rack stuff from the department stores .
neutral	which this definitely isn ' t .
neutral	i don ' t know what sort of quality_control or research they do on the competition , but i suggest they look further into it just by popping into a debenhams , hof .
neutral	john_lewis or m & s .
neutral	let ' s all be honest , we ' re not exactly going to get savile row quality and fit from an online tailor who manufactures in china , but i ' ve had coats from other online tailors ( specifically one with an apple - prefix ) which had far better fit and quality .
neutral	so if their competitors can do it , why can ' t they ?
neutral	so if quality is mediocre , the only thing it has going for that price_tag is the fit and customisations : the former has been almost a joke in my case .
neutral	if i posted a picture of the coat i was sent and one of a coat made by their competitors which has the exact_same measurements ( except for length ), you would never believe the two companies were given the same measurements .
neutral	the customisation aspect fares much_better ; their range of customisations ( while having some room for improvement ) is better_than most of their competitors - i particularly liked their range of colours .
neutral	but out of quality , fit , and customisation ( which i consider to be the three most_important things that make you consider a ' tailor - made ' garment instead of the standard off - the - rack stuff ), one out of three is just not good enough .
neutral	couple that with the customer_service i ' ve been through and well .... you ' re reading this now , aren ' t you ?
neutral	basically , they had one shot to make a good impression on a new customer and they messed it up .
neutral	am i going to waste more time and money trying to claw £_00 or £_00 off them for alterations , or have them remake my garment ?
neutral	the time and hassle just doesn ' t seem worth it .
neutral	i ' d quite gladly lose out on the alteration fee not to have to deal with them again .
neutral	in fact if my local tailor tells_me my coat is too far gone to be altered , i ' ll just probably give it away rather_than take up their ' perfect - fit guarantee ' or get a refund ( whose policy i have yet to find , btw ).
neutral	why on earth would i put myself through the tailor0less customer_service experience again , when it has been one problem after another ?
neutral	it only got better after an unflattering review , but if anything that ' s even worse because it seems to suggest they can do better if they wanted to - they just choose not to unless they have to !
neutral	i can ' t shake the feeling that their customer_service is either going to come at me at some point to bump up the review - or have it taken down .
neutral	broken fridge_freezer dilema on a friday ???
neutral	?
neutral	orsering and sales service 0 *
neutral	ordered friday lunch time and delivered sunday for free !!!!
neutral	and they took the old one away too for only £ 0 . 00
neutral	the follow_up call was brilliant and fast .
neutral	product is as decribed .
neutral	no concerns on that time and would reccomend for sure !
neutral	down falls .
neutral	the automated phone message to advise a delivery time coming through at 0am on a sunday morning isnt the best way to be woken up !"
neutral	the guys who delivered didnt speak_english and they didnt remove their shoes when entering my property ,
neutral	while they were removing my fridgefreezer that had broken they didnt pay attention to the dripping wated which soiled my carpets and then trod on with their shoes !
neutral	!
neutral	its amazing how the ordering price and sales service can be amazing but the delivery procedure can let it down ..
neutral	this said i would check this companies website again if i needed another appliance just to see if they had a deal .....
neutral	bought 0 items , motherboard , ddr0 ram and i0 cpu processor .
neutral	0 of them came within 0 days as expected .
neutral	but the last item , cpu , came 0days later and over the estimated_delivery date .
neutral	customer_service were polite however never really solve the problem , can ' t track the item properly either .
neutral	won ' t even send another one out next_day .. much to be desired .
neutral	expected much more from such a large company .
neutral	recentley purchased vtech winnie the pooh spinning top .
neutral	preciouslittle one were the only consumer who had this item in stock .
neutral	received the product quicly , however when taken out of the box it was thickly covered in dust .
neutral	this was my first time buying from supplementwarehouse , and it will most_likely be my last .
neutral	i usually order from allstarhealth , and by now my order would already be on route and by tomorrow or the day after i would receive my order .
neutral	it was a bit cheaper ordering through supplementwarehouse , but it in my opinion , it is not worth the extra delay .
neutral	also , once you calculate shipping , you are probably saving 0 or 0 bucks at most , but i still wanted to give it a try .
neutral	i do understand that this doesn ' t happen to everyone , but i just wanted to share my experience with others .
neutral	i have also heard good things about bodybuilding . com , but i have never tried them before , but if you use them or allstarthealth , don ' t bother switching if you are already satisfied .
neutral	if something happens to my order ( for better or for worse ), i will make_sure to make another review .
neutral	i placed an order with a well_known high - street clothes retailer and was rather worried when i saw they use hermes after_reading the countless bad_reviews .
neutral	i was expecting my parcel to be damaged or not arrive at all .
neutral	however the delivery did arrive on its scheduled date , albeit rather late in the afternoon .
neutral	the delivery guy did hammer the door a bit too loudly but was friendly enough and handed my parcel after signing for it .
neutral	i was relieved after very close scrutiny that it was undamaged ( it was a dress for my girlfriend ).
neutral	i would have loved to give this company higher marks but the magnitude of bad_reviews and their slightly inept website prevents me from doing so .
neutral	if you buy something online and the retailer uses this company , i would recommend you proceed with extreme caution .
neutral	hey
neutral	if tomorrowland release the tickets in the beginning of june why do you intend to withhold the tickets 0 - 0 days before the event ?
neutral	i will be in different_countries at different times .
neutral	im unaware of where i would be 0 - 0 days before the festival .
neutral	is there a pick office of some sort ?
neutral	thanks

neutral	transaction_id :_0000000
neutral	i was bit dissapointed with the print quality and the material of the sticker .
neutral	it just looks so cheap and when i say cheap , compare it with gelaskins sticker which costs around same price then you will see what i mean .
neutral	i have definitely seen and used better ones before around same price so it loses 0_stars out of 0 but don ' t get me wrong , the 0_stars i have given them is for their vast choice of designs and good customer_service .
neutral	the company can do better .
neutral	one bag of braeburns in tesco £ 0 : 00 , same_thing in morrisons was £ 0 : 00
neutral	well technically once it was posted it arrived quickly .
neutral	i ordered on thursday_night , but it wasn ' t sent until the next week .
neutral	almost everything i order online gets sent the next_day and i don ' t see any excuse why it shouldn ' t be .
neutral	it ' s so hard to buy things from made . com .
neutral	i have a fantastic sofa from them , but i had to wait in for three_weeks to get it .
neutral	i have a brilliant lamp , but it took five months to get all the parts delivered .
neutral	the card payment doesn ' t always work and it ' s really hard to contact anyone - the customer_service is almost nonexistent .
neutral	they don ' t take any responsibility for the delivery and have no interest in fixing it .
neutral	so ... if you have the time , the stuff is really fabulous , but it ' s a real trek to get there .
neutral	you basically have to give up your job and stay in for a month , at_least .
neutral	chillisauce have all the right ideas , though some times the places they book with have no ideas !
neutral	definitely would use them again , but perhaps research the destination venues a bit better next time .
neutral	nice one guys keep it up !
neutral	i recently wrote a very bad review for this company but have to amend that now .
neutral	the customer_service team contacted me to resolve problems and they genuinely seemed to care about their mistakes .
neutral	product arrived late but it was in good order and cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	company worth checking out , just be wary of anything with deadlines .
neutral	i can ' t fault the dress i bought its lovely !
neutral	but the delivery service is terrible !
neutral	promised next_day delivery but this hasn ' t happened !
neutral	endless phone_calls and chasing up !
neutral	the tracking updates are more_than useless and when it did finally arrive it was chucked over my back gate into a puddle :(!
neutral	such a shame that the delivery is such a let_down to a good quality retailer
neutral	customer_service is terrible .
neutral	they called me after i wrote a bad review and started complaining_about it !
neutral	not happy !
neutral	they don ' t have a right to call me and complain .
neutral	ok site .
neutral	love how easy it is to use , the tickets don ' t seem to be massively more_expensive than other_sites , but i have experienced a few annoying aspects .
neutral	for repeat_custom , it ' s good .
neutral	it ' s user_friendly , stores my details , and let ' s me know when bands i ' ve seen before are about to tour again .
neutral	price - wise it ' s always seemed ok .
neutral	if the tickets are pricey for a particular gig then the same gig tickets seem pricey on other_sites too .
neutral	while they haven ' t been a dodgy ticket reseller like viagogo and seatwave , it does make you wonder_how much effort ticketmaster put in to stopping such companies bulk buying tickets from them .
neutral	it ' s technically not illegal , but still doesn ' t paint them in a good light .
neutral	the last time i tried to use ticketmaster was weird and i hope it wasn ' t a sign of things to come .
neutral	i tried to book tickets for a comedy gig at the hammersmith apollo .
neutral	i picked 0 seats from the seating chart where 0 seats were still available at the end of row n . an error_message then popped up telling_me i couldn ' t have the seats as it would leave 0 available seat all by itself .
neutral	that really shouldn ' t be my problem .
neutral	they sell seats .
neutral	i ' ve picked 0 seats .
neutral	give me what i ' m willing to pay for .
neutral	that 0 seat can be taken up by 0 person .
neutral	people do go to gigs on their own .
neutral	it happens .
neutral	instead i ended_up going to hmv ' s own website to book the tickets as they had no such problems , and ended_up getting better seats in row m ( which ticketmaster didn ' t / couldn ' t offer me ).
neutral	like most people , i have a love - hate relationship with my mobile network operator .
neutral	i ' ve been with vodafone since the company i signed_up with over 00 years_ago was bought by them , so have been with them long enough to have gone_through several different experiences , including wanting to leave them , having my phone stolen , upgrading , etc .
neutral	to be honest , and this might not be a popular opinion , their service has always been pretty good .
neutral	the one time so far i ' ve ever had anything stolen , it was relatively painless to replace it once i had a crime number and a couple of phone_calls and one delivery later i was back in business ( literally ).
neutral	when i wanted to leave them it was because my tariff at the time didn ' t charged me calling people on other_networks and hardly anyone i knew was on vodafone .
neutral	they changed my tariff to help me .
neutral	i ' m sure some might argue that they ought to have supplied me with that automatically , but i was on a very old tariff .
neutral	coverage - wise i ' ve always loved vodafone .
neutral	am able to get reception pretty_much everywhere except for some remote places where you ' re unlikely to expect coverage or to receive any calls anyway .
neutral	i ' ve heard friends complain before about a lack of coverage by some other_networks in london and been wondered how on earth that could be .
neutral	when i finally surrendered to a smartphone , their shop staff were great setting me up , and it ' s never been anything but easy .
neutral	they lose 0_stars for failing to pay their full tax bill to the government though .
neutral	they wouldn ' t let me not pay their bills , so why should i go completely easy on them ?
neutral	the good bit about 0 was that it was relatively cheaper_than other_networks and hence compensated for its poor service .
neutral	now their rates are almost similar to other a class providers and yet they are quite behind in terms of their quality of service as the calls keep cutting off alongwith poor signals reception .
neutral	as alot of people know this is a stalkers paradise when privacy settings aren ' t scanned and changed .
neutral	but the site efficiency is good for marketing an making contacts for company ' s .
neutral	but alot of the time its used as tool for checking up on people and misused to a social advantage of the persons wills . e . g cyber bullying etc .
neutral	but as a site for social interaction is good but too many people use it every day for useless activity ' s and displaying far too much information about a person witch is so easily obtained .
neutral	cd_key warehouse is probably your best bet when it comes to cd_keys .
neutral	they provide a wide_range , low_cost and legitimate selection .
neutral	the down_side to cd_key warehouse is the time it takes to receive your order .
neutral	i had to wait up to 00 - 00_hours to receive my key at one stage when others such as <_external links removed > do it instantly .
neutral	they probably need to sort this out if they wish to be the " premier provider of cd_keys ".
neutral	after a battle with an mp0 player which was faulty they decided to do nothing as it was discontinued , not impressed this time .
neutral	i have sent at_least 00 - 00 parcels via parcel togo and had no_problems with the compant , 0 parcel did take a little longer_than the 0 - 0 days i paid for but i was always greated at the end of the phone by a friendly member of staff that tried their best to help in tracking the parcel and letting me know the status of delivery ...
neutral	had issues with the upload and contacted customer_services , my software had to be updated before i could upload though the software wouldn ' t notice an update for a further month !
neutral	received album which had minor stroke line issues throughout and after contacting customer_services was informed this is an intermittent it issue .
neutral	the customer_services representative was very good and organised my return of this and a refund .
neutral	also disappointing was the colour consistency , images appear flat and dull when they are vibrant on my ( colour calibrated ) work station .
neutral	unlikely to use again or recommend unfortunately .
neutral	lots of competing companies offer free delivery , which is fast and includes tracking to northern_ireland .
neutral	doing my shopping else where , unless you include free delivery to northern_ireland .
neutral	claimed the phone was damaged , which i dont believe it to be .
neutral	sold for faulty price .
neutral	other than this , great service
neutral	the products are branded and worth money .
neutral	i am happy with the computer i bought .
neutral	but apparently i had a call saying that i need to pay extra money for another power_supply because the one online system suggested to me was not good enough for my graphic_card .
neutral	i expect the system to change any parts if it does not work with each other when you build your own pc , just like other web - sites do .
neutral	that is the only comment from me .
neutral	i cannot complain_about the size of the bunch as it was big ( and i should think so after purchasing the grandissimo size but i dread to think how small the small size must be ).
neutral	but what i will complain_about is that the bunch received contained only small yellow and pale pink flowers , not the large vibrant pink and reds demonstrated in the photo .
neutral	as people usually use this service to deliver straight to a loved one i assume that the company believes they can get away with sending flowers that are similar to the ones the buyer believes they have bought in the likelihood that they won ' t actually see the product .
neutral	i ' m quite disappointed by this but mum loved them nonetheless , so that ' s a bonus !
neutral	on purchasing items for a holiday including sun cream etc based on spf value and price , the items that arrived had neither the same spf values and increased the overall cost of the bill by over £_00 .
neutral	0 item in particular was over £_00 more_expensive .
neutral	the system to check which items have been changed does not list the price and instructs you to refer to the receipt which would mean emptying the enite contents out while the delivery man waited .
neutral	on suggesting to sainsburys that they include the price of any changed items on the delivery sheet we were told this was not possible and basically to stop moaning .
neutral	tesco and waitrose manage this without issue !
neutral	i still shop in store at sainsburys but will be hesitiant to use their online service for groceries .
neutral	delivery time etc was all fine .
neutral	you gotta try this !
neutral	i find the service provided by easyjet to be on par in its field , they are consistent with prices and service which makes them an option when flying .
neutral	ryanair does exactly_what it says on the tin , gets you from a to b with no thrills .
neutral	leg_room is good for a normal person like me and the service is what you expect , prices are what tip the balance so if you are looking for a cheap flight make_sure ryanair is on your list !
neutral	this is the second time i have ordered and i gave then benefit of the doubt with the first one but it has not been any better this time .
neutral	i just love aldi shops .
neutral	the food is great and excellent value too .
neutral	if i was writing a review of their shop i would be giving full_marks .
neutral	when i stumbled_across their website and thought for a moment that i could do my christmas shop online .
neutral	you can imagine my disappointment when i learned that all you can do on the website is make a shopping list to take to the shop with you .
neutral	i have been successfully doing that with a pencil and paper for many years , what a total_waste of time .
neutral	i couldn ' t bring myself to give aldi no marks , because i really like their shops , but with an average of 0 for the shops and 0 for the website i have come up with an overall score of 0 .
neutral	come on aldi , get online shopping on your website so i don ' t have to travel all the way to the shop !
neutral	" it is great "
neutral	i usually have no problem with chemical except with this order and a few others .
neutral	with this order i opened the seemingly large box to find only 0 records out of 0 i purchased .
neutral	one , this confused me as to why they were gone as there was no note or indication , and 0 , it annoyed me because they have sent me small packages in large boxes before , causing the records to get bent and damaged during shipping .
neutral	after talking with customer_service and filling out a form they sent 0 of the 0 remaining records .
neutral	again , this angered me as the record that was now sold out was in stock when i purchased it .
neutral	it would have been nice if they had apologized for the missing order or even asked if i had wanted a new record instead of just automatically refunding it , but it was more like filling out an insurance claim .
neutral	i received the missing items 0 weeks_later , though i play gigs and needed them before then .
neutral	also , as mentioned earlier , i have received orders of a few records sent in a very large box .
neutral	since i live overseas this leads to the box getting smashed and the records getting warped or bent .
neutral	also living over_seas it is kind of hard to return a damaged record without paying even more_than it cost for shipping .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that the border tile was a different_colour to the tile .
neutral	i feel_like i wasted my money .
neutral	the metro was creamy rather_than white and it came chipped which hasn ' t filled me with the greatest confidence when ordering .
neutral	i havent decided whether to use them yet , still_awaiting a couple more samples .
neutral	prompt delivery etc ... just very frustrating that size ordered was misleading on their site .
neutral	i ' m a 00 - 00 so was hardly going to order a size advertised as 00 - 00 which would have just about fit !
neutral	!
neutral	called and only complaint is that they were extremely robotic in their response .
neutral	no effort made to leave a positive impression and i ended the call more wound up than when i dialled .
neutral	no problem with mdp at all .
neutral	quick delivery of all items .
neutral	although , use the car corex holders once and after 00_mins , they both broke and were laying on the ground .
neutral	they have also damaged the window seal on the car .
neutral	i was initially impressed with the free help and then the subsequent improvements to my cv but was always annoyed that they never seemed to truly listen to what i needed .
neutral	i corresponded with them via_email due to the hours i worked and on several_occasions asked for adjustments to be made so that the cv they produced was actually set_up for the type of work i was going for .
neutral	it seemed that i received a fairly generic template they use , very well written with a nice format but they became increasingly hard to get hold of when i needed amendments made and i admittedly gave up and made the changes myself and with advice from other sources .
neutral	i recently went on kiddicare and found a pram i liked but could not pay because i didn ' t have a credit_card i e mailed them for help on the 00th of january for help and i am yet to receive a reply .
neutral	i have since bought a pram elsewhere .
neutral	disappointed as i have read many great reviews :|
neutral	i love asda most of the time , but in store things seem to be missing from the shelves a lot more_than usual and when ordering online they seem to often send lots of items that are going out of date very soon after deliver , which makes doing your weekly_shop online a bit pointless .
neutral	the actually service at dell i don ' t have a problem with .
neutral	the ordering and customisation of the laptops is easy and you can get exactly_what you want .
neutral	my laptop came when it was supposed to with no_problems .
neutral	the reason for the moderate rating is that i wouldn ' t advise_anyone to get a dell .
neutral	i ' ve had mine for just over a year and they ' re not as great as i thought , definitely not worth the price you pay .
neutral	the battery and charger both wore out very quickly and needed replacing , and dell ' s own replacements are outrageously priced .
neutral	i ' d used ticketmaster for a few_years with no_problems .
neutral	however , last_year i bought tickets for owl city in may for a concert in november .
neutral	some time during summer , the date was cancelled and not re - scheduled .
neutral	i did not find this out straight_away , and ticketmaster did not bother to issue a notice to us letting us know .
neutral	when i eventually did find out i had to email them to request a refund which they said they could do no problem .
neutral	however , i still can ' t believe they didn ' t email those who had bought tickets to let them know .
neutral	they let themselves down in my eyes .
neutral	never had a problem with them in many years with them .
neutral	not had one fault or bill problem .
neutral	however when it came to upgrading , i had to go through phones0u whose service i have never used before as they gave me a better deal than vodafone direct whom i have been with for 00 years .
neutral	these_guys are very sporadic in their service .
neutral	sometimes they ' re great and items arrively quickly and safely - other times , not so much .
neutral	we ' ve had numerous_times where they claim they attempted a delivery but in actual fact did not !
neutral	i ordered a main door oven glass replacement for a broken door on my tricity bendix oven , they sent me an electrolux range hood - i called and told them and the woman on the other end of the phone was rude and tried to tell me i purchased the wrong item .
neutral	despite the fact that my e_- mail confirmation had a completely_different part number than the one i received .
neutral	eventually i was able to talk to someone_else and they managed to resolve the issue , send me out another part ( the correct one ) and retreive the wrong part .
neutral	i ' d likely shop with them again , just be aware that they dropship from various suppliers directly ( most companies do , these days ) and as a result sometimes errors occur on their part of their third_party .
neutral	hormis la_livraison qui n ' a pas été faite ( sur_le suivi il est marqué que la personne n ' était pas là alors qu ' elle était bien présente ), le reste , ça va . des prix pour tous budgets , les fleurs ont été livrées avec certes 0 jours de retard mais elles étaient impeccables .
neutral	i placed an order on 00 mar 0000 and was told delivery would be 0 - 0 days to uk .
neutral	on the 00th i live chatted to ask where the item was , i got told they had no stock and would get back to me with a delivery date .
neutral	on the 00th i still_havent heard_anything so live chatted again and was told they still didnt have stock and didnt know when it was coming !
neutral	i asked for a refund and they said :
neutral	[ digiprint supplies ] our sales conditions that you agreed when placing the order don ' t accept order cancellation .
neutral	so no items , and no refund !
neutral	will never use again
neutral	----------------------
neutral	reply to your reply ...
neutral	i had no emails or contact from you , you failed to get back to me .
neutral	i asked on a number of occasions for a refund !
neutral	no replies no responce !
neutral	this is the first reply i have had !
neutral	i have had to open a paypal case to try and get my money back .
neutral	--------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	00 / 00 / 000
neutral	got money back in the end !
neutral	if you are not in a rush and not bothered about communication between customer and company .
neutral	order from these , the quality of the vinyl is good , and well_packed !
neutral	thanks all i can really say
neutral	i got what i ordered so that was ok in the end , but it took 00days to get to me after dispatch .
neutral	pretty disappointed and there are far better companies out there to be honest .
neutral	the communication was terrible through the whole_process with different people getting back to me .
neutral	won ’ t be using them again that ’_s for sure .
neutral	the quality of all the meat is good , there ' s no question about this .
neutral	i really loved the chicken sausages .
neutral	the protein bread is also good especially when toasted add then you don ' t notice the ' bits ' as much .
neutral	the prices are high , and there ' s a minimum_spend and there ' s a fiver on top for postage .
neutral	i recently ordered ostrich burgers in one of my orders and despite adding this and having the item prolong the entire order : they didn ' t come in the package .
neutral	with this i also only received 0 of 0 packs of pasta .
neutral	i contacted them as the online status said that all items were shipped .
neutral	they apologised about the burgers and refunded me , i ' d have rather had the item i ordered , they may have thought i ' d do another order so spend another 00 pound just to try ostrich , i won ' t .
neutral	the response also had nothing in it about the pasta and when i got a reply to a 0nd message they thought i ' d received 0 of the 0 packs , then sent 0 more anyway , cuckoo indeed .
neutral	this was only my 0nd order so half the time , there ' s more_than 0 problem .
neutral	i think i ' ll go back to [_external reference_] and see what they have at the moment .
neutral	selectspecs has a love - it - or - hate - it reputation on the internet ' s reviews .
neutral	i ordered a pair of titanium glasses with - 0 prescription thin / light reaction - coated lenses .
neutral	0 weeks_later , as predicted by them for " high / complicated prescriptions ", they have arrived from_hong_kong , on specification as according to the prescription sheet and reference glasses i sent them .
neutral	the glasses , especially for the admittedly bargain price of £_00 , seem reasonably good quality , if a little light and plastic - feeling .
neutral	so why three stars ?
neutral	because of their suspectness .
neutral	apparently no manned telephone_number due to ' over - demand '.
neutral	poorly , hastily written replies to my emails .
neutral	the enormous length of time they take to make glasses compared to other suppliers i ' ve used .
neutral	the fact that , with reviews on the web , they are either 0_stars and glowingly written - in other words , by selectspecs themselves - or one star and thus by extremely disgruntled_customers .
neutral	am i happy with my glasses ?
neutral	yes .
neutral	would i recommend selectspecs to a friend ?
neutral	not in perfect confidence .
neutral	good luck .
neutral	quite fast and easy way to book but experience some difficulties while using the payment_method via credit_card
neutral	added the discount_code bigdiscountspring and it wouldn ' t reduce the price like it stated on quid co website .
neutral	made things more_expensive , i hope the flowers are of good quality to save the purchase will re - review if they are .
neutral	would also like someone to provide me the 00_% that code was supposed to save me !!
neutral	!
neutral	still be best all - round search_engine .
neutral	shopping searches often return fake websites based far away around the world and scammers trying to get your money .
neutral	google get your act_together and don ' t support these bogus websites !
neutral	i was unable to get a credit account with you but have still purchased a few things although its more exspensive then other_retailers to buy out right but when ive needed somthing in a hurry its fab or if there is an offer on , i understand the price being a little higher if you have a credit account but puts people off when paying full price they can get it at a better price else where , and the idea people cen pay on credit for things is brill because u dont always have the money esp when somthing big breaks and needs replacing , and your cheaper_than your sister site littlewoods i would recommend you to friends as i have when there thinking of getting somthing exspensive so they can pay it off in 0 payments havent heard any complaints about very so your doing somthing right keep up the good work
neutral	fairly decent .
neutral	tax evasion might be an issue .
neutral	i received my order for my 0 stone emerald cut trilogy 00k white gold ring , looks beautiful design , delivery , was great ( i live in germany ) and communication was also really good .
neutral	however i only received my ring on january 00 , 0000 and the band is already starting to look gold .
neutral	also scratches very easy .
neutral	a lot of little marks in the band .
neutral	i work in an office so i am not doing too much with my hands and i make_sure to take it off when creaming my hands as well as washing .
neutral	i am aware of wear and tear but .... so soon .
neutral	i wouldn ' t get a white gold band again , maybe would go towards a platinum band .
neutral	so in saying that i am a little disappointed with that .
neutral	i will have to get it dipped already before the actual wedding which is in august :(
neutral	regardsnicole
neutral	i think the product supplied is of good quality for the price .
neutral	their cheapest rimless glasses were perfect for when out on the motorcycle .
neutral	my only problem with the company is the slow delivery - however unlike most on here i do rate their customer_services .
neutral	i raise a ticket and they do reply very quickly ( queried my delivery today , got a reply within 0 minutes ) - so maybe those complaining that they never hear back should check their junk_mail folder first .
neutral	would happily rate 0 or 0_stars if they could get delivery down a bit .
neutral	ordered on the 0th_jan and still_waiting ...
neutral	have just had a few instances where it says a local takeaway is closed for delivery , and yet if i phone them directly they are open .
neutral	i ordered flowers to be delivered today for my mom , and have not received any tracking i . d or anything as such !
neutral	even_though i paid extra for it .
neutral	i am now starting to worry that the flowers may never get here i might get here very later in the day .
neutral	order number is 00000 i need some response !!
neutral	!
neutral	in many ways i love ebay .
neutral	i love how you can find anything , from an obscure vintage toy to the latest gadgets .
neutral	but here ' s what i don ' t get : when i buy stuff , i don ' t get all that good a deal .
neutral	but when i sell stuff , i always seem to get less for things than i should .
neutral	and not because i ' m bad at buying and selling .
neutral	in large part it ' s because even when you do get a good price , ebay and paypal take such a large cut that you end up feeling like you ' ve been stung , and that you paid for the privelege !
neutral	the sizes are just way too small !
neutral	i ' m a 00 / 00 and i got the m / l leggings and they were just way too tight !!
neutral	the dress i bought i also need a size higher and now it ' s out of stock !
neutral	so annoying !
neutral	if you want anything quickly this isn ' t the place for you .
neutral	the prices are a little cheaper_than other_sites but the shipping is awful .
neutral	they just shipped my order that i placed 0 days ago .
neutral	that would be o . k .
neutral	if the shipping was free or cheap but it is not .
neutral	on a 00 $ order the shipping was over 0 $, for that price you should get good shipping but you do not .
neutral	i was happy with the ease of the website , it was very easy to use , to find glasses i liked , and was happy could choose way of paying , and got a 0 %_discount for paying by cheque :)
neutral	only thing i wasn ' t too pleased about , was that there was absolutely no communication about the actual arrival of my glasses .
neutral	i wasn ' t told if they had received my cheque , or when and if they had been dispatched at all .
neutral	they did eventually arrive , and i ' m very happy with my new glasses , especially for the price i paid for them !!
neutral	!
neutral	this website ' kind of ' works , unfortunately it suffers from a bad user experience - long loading screens popup between selecting flights , hotels and confirming things , if you ' re lucky it goes through - if not then you have to start all over again with no option to recover your inputs .
neutral	personally nearly bailed out of booking 0 - 0 times , took something like 0 hour 00mins to finally make a booking , i ' m sure this could of been quicker if it hadn ' t been for the poor lowcostpoorvaluewebsite . com ..
neutral	i have shopped at supplementwarehouse twice and was somewhat happy with it .
neutral	it ' s nice they beat_competitors prices by 0 % as well .
neutral	however , this time they initially accepted the competitors price then later sent me an_email_stating they were not going to and were charging me their full price plus shipping .
neutral	had i known that i would have gone with competitor and saved_myself 0 $.
neutral	grrrr
neutral	i need to cancel or possibly amend a booking but i cannot get through to customer_services at all .
neutral	please can you get back to me asap
neutral	euro car parts are fantastic for their range of products , and unbeatable_prices - i ' ve never found some of their branded items cheaper .
neutral	i purchase a lot of meguiars products from them and they ' re cheaper_than all their competitors , however , they lack in the customer_service area .
neutral	trying to speak to them on the phone leads to a long queue lasting nearly half an_hour , and their live_chat is where i just get ignored and never have a response .
neutral	this i feel lets down their service a lot , i ' d rather if the chat was busy they closed it as_opposed to ignoring me as i feel this lets them down an awful lot .
neutral	all i needed from them was a tracking_number ( something which they could easily add to the account section of their website , or to an_email ).
neutral	i ' d never used game seek before nor heard of them when i purchased the ps0 for my son ' s birthday but i thought why not and the price was a whopping £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else !!!
neutral	ordered on a friday and item was despatched on the monday but never arrived till the friday after !!
neutral	disappointing considering i ' d paid 0 . 00 postage for it to go via snail 🐌 mail .
neutral	places like shopto ship items like this on a next_day courier for free .
neutral	i had to chase for a tracking_number too .
neutral	the item did arrive on time for my son ' s birthday but only just !!!!
neutral	but to be fair the customer_service was friendly and helpful .
neutral	all in all my son is very pleased and i ' m am as i saved a fair bit of cash !
neutral	😉
neutral	i initially waited a lot longer_than anticipated for my order , and then when it arrived ( on two different days as a split delivery ) i was devastated that one sack of dog_food had been damaged .
neutral	but it was the way the company handled the situation and the way they genuinely cared_about me as a customer and were sympathetic to problems experienced by myself .
neutral	i will give this company another chance and hopefully the delivery will be good .
neutral	we booked a private transfer to and from tenerife south airport .
neutral	when we arrived at tfs we found it difficult to find the correct desk .
neutral	there is no resort_hoppa desk and the number and position and number of the desk we were told to go to were incorrect .
neutral	we ended_up app risking another desk and they wrote down where we should go - the opposite end of the terminal .
neutral	we had to wait a long time for our transfer to arrive and during the journey to golf del sur the door opened and if i hadn ' t been strapped in i would have fallen out !
neutral	we had to stop and fix the door .
neutral	other than this the return transfer was quick and on time .
neutral	i find that although they ' re an online glasses retailer their range isn ' t that big and i struggled to find glasses that actually suited me .
neutral	i ordered their home_trial service and the glasses came in two days which i was impressed with and by the time i had my second home_trial i had made up my mind which glasses i ' d wanted to purchase but unfortunately by then both pairs were out of stock on their website .
neutral	when i enquired_about when they were going to re - stock the frames i was told by an customer_services rep : that they were sold - out but " you are welcome to order free home_trials to find alternatives ."
neutral	to be honest i don ' t like any of the other choices so i didn ' t take them up on the offer .
neutral	i noticed on the few weeks i had been looking through their site a lot of glasses would sell out and then become available again .
neutral	i think it would be better if they had a facility to reserve a pair of glasses until they ' re restocked as i wouldn ' t mind waiting or at_least have an alert system when stock_levels of popular frames have been replenished or if they will infact re - stock them at all - it would make the experience a lot_easier and save me constantly checking the website just incase they ' ve become available again .
neutral	it ' s a shame really , i know that my high_street optician would be willing to order frames in for me if i asked so they definitely are missing some customer focus here .
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery i was disappointed that i was having to chase around my delivery .
neutral	first_class delivery was stated my package was coming by but three days after dispatch my goods had still not arrived .
neutral	the tracking_number giving to myself did not work and yodel the delivery company could not help as i was not on their systems .
neutral	upon phoning the shop the gentleman was very friendly and managed to find my package and promised to get a tracking_number sent to me that worked .
neutral	the tracking_number never arrived but my goods did eventually turn_up , a week after purchase was made .
neutral	due to the delivery service i will not be using the company again as my 0 cats / rabbit / snake need a reliable service as you can imagine this household goes through a lot of cat_food so can ' t afford to have delays !
neutral	crappy software - very laggy not user_friendly customer_service also not brilliant i give few extra stars because you can use paypal and min deposit is 0 quid not 00 quid like in pokerstars .
neutral	anyway pokerstars much_better - bigger tournaments for less buyin better software great customer_service .
neutral	not sure if they just hire a useless courier service ( as per review below ) who apparently couldn ' t find two st . bernards if they were in the same telephone booth as them or they are just ripping me off .
neutral	i don ' t think it ' s the latter and hope not .
neutral	ordered flowers for my mum ' s birthday .
neutral	got a text_saying problem with delivery .
neutral	phone up , can ' t find her house .
neutral	it isn ' t hard .
neutral	it ' s now four days_later still can ' t find her house despite explicit instructions on how to locate it and in addition to this my phone number if they get lost ( which they didn ' t use ).
neutral	people on the phone at the flower place seemed okay and were very apologetic .
neutral	they did seem like they were pretty annoyed with the couriers .
neutral	they said they would give me a refund .
neutral	if that comes through then fair_enough but still not good enough .
neutral	what ' s the point of ordering something for an occasion if it doesn ' t get there ?
neutral	quote from their site " your flowers are with our trusty couriers ".
neutral	pfft .
neutral	next time i will read reviews before i go with a company .
neutral	edit_: flowers arrived this morning , both lots as they replaced them as the original were no doubt pretty dead by now !
neutral	i think they phoned the couriers and gave them a well_deserved bollocking - this time the couriers bothered phoning and got instructions to find the house - so that ' s good .
neutral	i give plus 0 star from the original two .
neutral	there ' s no ill intent to rip anyone off that i can see .
neutral	they also put a money off voucher in and i ' m_assuming i ' ll also get a refund so other than the hassle and cost of phoning an 0000 number from a mobby good service from the flower company to be fair to them - couriers need sacking i think .
neutral	i purchased a ski bundle , boots , ski ' s , poles and bag .
neutral	after_placing the order i received a text from the courier advising when the delivery would take place so i booked a day off to wait in .
neutral	i tracked the delivery most of the day and it said the order was out for delivery it got to about 0pm and this changed to delivery changed by recipient !
neutral	i was quite confused and angry as i ' d waited in all day and no one had turned_up .
neutral	i called the courier to find out what was going on and from the very start the lady was rude , abrupt and very unhelpful .
neutral	i asked why it said i had changed the delivery when i clearly hadn ' t and explained that i had taken a day off specially to wait in !
neutral	she said the courier couldn ' t find your house ... we supplied a phone number at point of ordering which was used by you to let me know the delivery would take place today !
neutral	why did not get a call and why does the website say i changed the delivery ?!
neutral	i was told very abruptly " so you expect the driver to use his personal phone do you ?"!
neutral	all i can say is i was shocked !
neutral	so ...
neutral	i called sail and ski who were not particularly bothered either and as far as they were concerned they had done there bit and it was down to the courier .
neutral	i explained that from my perspective i am your customer and you have chosen to use this courier not me !
neutral	if i want to cancel my order and go elsewhere i am more_than welcome to ...
neutral	excellent customer_service sail and ski ... shame for a company that provide decent products at a reasonable_price you have forgotten about the importance of customer care !
neutral	sarajevo is a great city .
neutral	the hostel has a great location , right next to the city_center .
neutral	staff was ok and accomodation also .
neutral	while i like to concept of cashback sites , i find quidco doesn ' t quite cut it for the average shopper .
neutral	now my very first use of quidco ( 0000 ) was when buying a new tv , as you might imagine the cashback was a decent amount and covered the quidco fee straight_away , meaning any further cashback in the year was 000_% mine .
neutral	but that ' s when the cracks started to show .
neutral	as i entered into 0000 , it became_apparent to me that the £ 0 quidco fee would be taking a lot of my cashback .
neutral	i can ' t speak for others , but i am not buying tv or high priced electronics on a regular_basis .
neutral	so the small_amounts of cashback i was getting was being eaten away by their annual_fee .
neutral	while i haven ' t had any significant issues , using quidco simply became pointless .
neutral	the only_gripe i do have is their customer_service is useless .
neutral	instead of deleting my account on request , they simply told me about all the new things they had since i joined .
neutral	how you could miss understand the heading " delete account " is beyond me .
neutral	i have since moved onto another cashback site , that is quicker to reach the payable stage and takes no annual_fee and tends to offer slightly better cashback rates as well .
neutral	today i found i was unable to login to trustpilot .
neutral	the reason maybe that i was trying to access the . com domain rather_than the co . uk domain and having a uk ip_address may have caused a security concern ( ie : potential fake reviewer ).
neutral	for that i am unsure of and the customer support completely evaded my entire email when i contacted them .
neutral	but it brought up an interesting issue for me .
neutral	the whole social_media connection is a big turn off for some reviewers .
neutral	i have no shame in admitting that i have bought from and therefore reviewed on trust - pilot ; online adult toy shops and that is the problem .
neutral	while i may not have an issue reviewing these stores , i of course do not want it linked to my social_media accounts in anyway what so ever as i obviously connect with relatives which could lead to some awkward moments .
neutral	in that case , should i want to leave genuine feedback , i would be forced to create a fake facebook profile ( which is just as easy as making a new email ), which undermines the whole point of using facebook logins to avoid fake_reviews .
neutral	rather_than use social_media , perhaps a better solution would be to make trust - pilot require a mobile / cell device to activate your account here and that number can only be associated with one account at a time .
neutral	removal of a number would mean the profile becomes inactive until a new valid number is associated with it again .
neutral	this way privacy is kept for the customer reviewing a site and will also limit the number of fake_reviews as most people do not carry multiple mobile_phones .
neutral	just a thought .
neutral	while the concept of trust - pilot is a good one and has certainly helped_me chose to shop at ( or not ) a specific store , there are far better ways to try and eliminate fake_reviews than social_media .
neutral	i ordered a laptop and they delivered it fast . but when i checked the laptop it had problem in screen so i called them to change me another one . it took me 0 days to received another one . finally it works well so i think this service is ok
neutral	i ' ve used coolshop before and i would reccomend to anyone , however with a recent_purchase of black_ops it hasn ' t managed to arrive on release day unlike many other online sites .
neutral	the transaction details are also in dutch " betaling godkendt med transaktionsid :_000000000 "
neutral	so i ' m not even sure whether it ' s on it ' s way or something ' s gone wrong ?
neutral	0 / 0_stars given .
neutral	first time i have used the ebuyer website .
neutral	the site is nice and easy to navigate , prices are good on first_glance but once selected and entered checkout the shipping services are excessive .
neutral	for a fast service your looking to pay over £ 0 . 00 and the economy service which says over 0 days is still expensive .
neutral	i selected the cheapest service which took over 0 working_days so quite disappointed .
neutral	nice item though .
neutral	shipper didn ' t initially receive my shiply quote acceptance , so sender were waiting to hear from him .
neutral	then he collected item but didn ' t contact me to arrange delivery date , again i had to call him .
neutral	otherwise , who_knows_how i would have received my item !
neutral	but i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	ordered for the first time here instead of going to my opticians .
neutral	when i looked online on my laptop it had 00_%_off my order .
neutral	however due to not having anti virus i had to use my phone to purchase it .
neutral	unfortunately on the mobile site it didn ' t offer the discount which was a bit_annoying as that ' s why i decided to order from here as it made it cheaper_than other online sites .
neutral	the delivery was quick and the price was slightly_cheaper_than what i pay from my opticians
neutral	used a couple of times , whatever i seemed to choose , out of stock , didnt matter when i logged on , out of stock was quicker and easier to to a shop , delivery isnt too bad though when you do find somthing in stock
neutral	i ordered a digital heatgun which tend to be cheapest across the net after a few search_engines i done , received the item in time but when i opened the pack every accessories for the heat gun itself was not in place and it was all over the box , i guess this could be because of original manufacture packaging and not the fxx or could be because of bad handling of the item from the fxx , however the item fully works and not damaged that ' s why i give 0 start for this my very first purchase from them .
neutral	i have just bought two tickets for depeche mode concert to be held in may 00 in london ' s o0_arena .
neutral	i have received a confirmation , and viagogo was quick enough to withdraw the money from my account .
neutral	what worries me is that the e_- mail says the tickets are going to be sent 0 to 0 days prior to the event which means i might not be able to pick them up in kazakhstan which is where i am from as i would be leaving for london three days prior to the concert .
neutral	is there any other way i can pick the tickets up in london ?
neutral	unlock does exactly_what it says on the tin , unlocked on apple ' s database but may take a lot longer_than you expect .
neutral	whilst polite customer_services do not really answer or have the ability to answer your questions .
neutral	if you stick with it they will get the job_done .
neutral	brought ibeats as_described , they arrived and they was the htc urbeats , false_advertising , and the controltalk doesn ' t work with my iphone , not happy
neutral	simple to use and good design mobile fones .
neutral	good price and good range of packages .
neutral	quick delivery and great customer_service
neutral	marked as 0_stars purely_because there are films on the xbox app that should not be available due to content and the possibility of children gaining access to these .
neutral	been with virgin for 0 years now .
neutral	i had problems with the initial set_up - but this was down to the engineers rather_than their contact center .
neutral	their packages are much more competitive than sky .
neutral	small gripe is the virgin + box has a tendency to freeze , crash , and take a long time to respond .
neutral	i ' ve been buying from myprotein for the last 0 years but recently they stopped using parcelforce as their delivery company .
neutral	if you ' re not at home , parcelforce sends your stuff to the nearest post_office and this is very convenient for me .
neutral	other delivery companies that myprotein uses are a pain - the depots are long miles_away and they don ' t let you to change the delivery address ( need to contact sender to do that ).
neutral	if they don ' t bring the parcelforce back i will not order from them anymore .
neutral	ordered cash and currency card .
neutral	the cash was the wrong amount and if i hadn ' t been paying attention i would have lost about $_00 .
neutral	the online account for the currency card didn ' t work .
neutral	i ordered a go pro from simply_electronics without realising they are based in hong_kong , i would never usually order from abroad due to the import taxes .
neutral	after 0 weeks my order hadn ' t been dispatched so i got in contact and received an almost immediate reply saying they were processing it yet they couldn ' t give me a dispatch date .
neutral	after various exchanges back and forth with still no conformation of a dispatch date i decided to cancel my order .
neutral	i have now received my money back and although the customer_service team are very quick to reply it seems that all their other processes are extremely slow .
neutral	i
neutral	originally ordered my go pro on the 0th_feb and cancelled the order on the 00th_feb the money was back in my account on the 00th_feb .
neutral	i ' m giving them 0_stars as the customer_service team were always very quick to reply though not always being_able to provide the information i requested .
neutral	improve your processes , speed things up and i ' m sure soon you ' ll be receiving many more 0 star reviews .
neutral	concerned until the order .
neutral	order to reply to messages when they do not ..
neutral	churches hold the phone , but nevertheless opened more_than 0 months
neutral	the wonder woman outfit is flattering , and came very quickly however the gold detailed wing in the middle is not gold it ' s yellow , so the image is slightly deceiving .
neutral	i purchased this one in particular as i preferred the gold over the yellow , if i ' d have known i could have got the same costume ten_pounds cheaper elsewhere online however it ' s not worth sending it back for a return over a tenner .
neutral	overall a decent costume .
neutral	i recently had a an ebay moment and sold heaps of stuff on line ( saved doing a car boot !).
neutral	i thought i had done well , i paid the
neutral	listing fees , then the listing fees , then the 00_% commission hits you .
neutral	erything put_together makes it really expensive .
neutral	i waited for an_hour and a half on their website queueing to buy some tickets .
neutral	only to find out that there was only 0 left .
neutral	how many others were sat waiting in the queue only to find out that there is no availability .
neutral	i assume that the facility didnt shut_down because there was still a ticket left .
neutral	slight it issues i think
neutral	the website is a great way to get payments sorted for big groups but the whole experience was not great .
neutral	the choice of bars was limited to the same type of music " cheese ".
neutral	it would be much_better if an area was reserved at the bars that we chose as the places on the list are all very busy .
neutral	if you are to use this service make_sure you had an extra half hour to the timings of events as we were given the wrong timings and thought we had alot more time between each event .
neutral	dance_class overran due to the room at tiger_tiger being unavailable .
neutral	can be_beaten on prices
neutral	bought a new sofa at the end of last_year .
neutral	was good price , looked good .
neutral	now the springs have gone .
neutral	left me feeling a bit meh !
neutral	ah well , i suppose you get what you paid for !
neutral	disappointed in the clear disparity between pixmania . co . uk and pixmania . ie ( uk site is unilaterally cheaper , offers package deals , and free postage ).
neutral	camera i wanted was still cheaper_than amazon . co . uk , though , so i bought it anyway and it did indeed arrive in time but the packaging was flattened quite badly .
neutral	the camera was fine inside but , as the camera was a gift , it was an annoyance to hand my friend something in that condition .
neutral	i ' ve had many different experiences with citylink , my first few experiences were atrocious and i said i would never use them again .
neutral	their delivery time stated 0am - 0pm , the first delivery was at around 0 : 00 am so it was missed .
neutral	i then arranged for a re - delivery on another day and was told 0am - 0pm , but yet again it came very early on in the morning around 0am but luckily someone was in to sign for the parcel .
neutral	between the re - delivery i contacted their customer_service which was very poor .
neutral	i got a new job a year later where i had to use citylink quite regularly and they are fantastic .
neutral	delivery is usually next_day and if the delivery is missed they even take a picture of the consignees front_door so you have proof they attempted delivery .
neutral	overall i think they are a good company but as with all courier companies the customer_service is pretty poor .
neutral	the site and idea is very good but the majority of users only come on here after a negative experience , nobody thinks ' i ' ve had a great product here i ' ll go and leave a review !'.
neutral	the majority of people only come on here to complain so some of the review can be biased .
neutral	hb is consistently a winner when you ' re after a last - minute booking .
neutral	their hostels that i ' ve experienced are clean and good value for money .
neutral	what more can you ask for ?
neutral	i had to wait over two_weeks for my products to arrive .
neutral	when i ordered the website said the products were in stock , but when i called their customer_services a week_later , they informed me that some of the products were out of stock and they were waiting for a delivery before they could dispatch my items .
neutral	in there favour though they did refund part of the cost .
neutral	the argos returns_policy isn ' t always fantastic , and last time i bought an electrical item it was shoddy .
neutral	i got a digital radio from them and i couldn ' t switch it off without unplugging it and i couldn ' t switch it back on when i plugged it back in .
neutral	i tried to return it but got nothing but hassle so didn ' t bother .
neutral	estimated time of delivery 00 / 00 /_0000 , date today 00 / 00 /_0000 , still no email to say the item has been despatched ..
neutral	trying out this service to see if it will work .
neutral	i ' ve ordered with viagogo before , but i recently_purchased tickets for the madrid v real betis match on sunday november 00 , 0000 .
neutral	my transaction_id was 0000000 .
neutral	i keep trying to change my address to the hotel i will be staying at in madrid and they refuse .
neutral	multiple e_- mails and phone_calls with no help at all .
neutral	finally , after 0 weeks , address was changed ... hoping the tickets come through ..
neutral	many hidden_charges and always charges over my monthly_bill
neutral	poor selection in many departments
neutral	tested and passed today , payment in 00 days time ?
neutral	wait ?
neutral	what ?
neutral	i thought you said fast payment ?
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	despite the bad_reviews i was seeing , i put in a couple of orders in the past week or so , mainly_due to the fact that they had the items i wanted and at a really good price .
neutral	so far i ' m happy with evans .
neutral	goods turned_up on time and in perfect_condition .
neutral	have had an issue with a rival company who has spectacular reviews , so i was quite surprised with the way things turned_out , especially as the competitor was dealing_with a more_expensive item .
neutral	i ' m reluctant to give evans 0_stars since i ' ve only had 0 orders so far and there have been no issues that require extra attention - others obviously haven ' t had as good an experience as mine .
neutral	however , since the price was good and there haven ' t been any mistakes so far i will likely use them again for smaller items and may be tempted to purchase more costly goods in the future too .
neutral	if you use ebay like i do you most_likely use paypal for your payments .
neutral	it ' s easy enough to registered and setup payments into your bank_account , my only problem with the service is the fee ' s !
neutral	you ' ve already been paid insert fee ' s and final selling fee ' s on ebay and when you withdraw cash or use certain paypal services ( also owened by ebay ) you have to pay more fee ' s .
neutral	you can be paying up to 00_% of your final sale fee in the end and for regular sellers this can cost £ 0000 ' s of pounds a year .
neutral	paypal fee ' s should be included in the price of ebay fee ' s , only people using it as a payment system for non ebay items should pay .
neutral	used megashopbot looking for a new tv and found this site offering very competitive_pricing .
neutral	ordered the tv on tuesday 00th_december and was asked to select a delivery date so i selected next_day delivery which was free .
neutral	email received to confirm order and that delivery would be on 00th - i was sceptical with 00th being a bank_holiday but the webiste said next_day and the email confirmed it .
neutral	by 0 . 00pm on 00th no tv had arrived and i got worried when reading some of the reviews on this site .
neutral	i phoned them up , automated_message requesting email only for customer_services and press 0 for sales only .
neutral	i held and after a few seconds of nothing it started to ring and i was answered by matt .
neutral	i asked for an update on delivery and he put me on hold and then asked if he could call me back , i reluctantly agreed .
neutral	00mins later received a call back explaining that the website should not have offered me a delivery option of 00th and that it would be delivered the following_day .
neutral	i asked for a tracking_number eta for delivery and what would they offer me by way of compensation .
neutral	was told that he could not answer those questions at the time and somebody would contact me in the morning .
neutral	nobody has , but at_least the tv arrived .
neutral	this is a company that offer competitive_prices on their products and quick delivery , however they need to make some major improvements in terms of their communication with customers both in keeping them updated on the status of an order and being available for contact .
neutral	if they ' d have contacted me to inform me of the error then this would likely be a 0 or 0 star_review
neutral	i have been using top cash back for about 0 / 0 months now .
neutral	i use it regularly as i book hotels for my work .
neutral	my money had been pending then changed to comfimed about a month_ago .
neutral	when will it be made payable ??
neutral	seems to be taking a lot of time .
neutral	this is the only down fall i have found with top cash back .
neutral	really disappointed today .
neutral	was waiting for my bike and accessories to be delivered .
neutral	got an_email at 0 . 00am saying that my delivery will be today between_0am and 0pm .
neutral	so how come at 00am i go to the door and see a non delivery card , with an apparent delivery at 00 . 00am .
neutral	there was myself and my partner here and we heard_nothing , we normally hear the letterbox if something is posted through .
neutral	they didn ' t even attempt to use our bell , which is deafening !
neutral	i ' m obviously livid and bewildered as i took a day off to wait for the packages .
neutral	i called up the depot , after 0 attempts i got an answer that it will be delivered tomorrow around the same time .
neutral	don ' t understand_why the delivery driver didn ' t try a bit harder to actually deliver , is it because they are on such a tight schedule that they can ' t knock for longer_than a second ?
neutral	and after_reading the rest of the reviews i can see its a common problem .
neutral	hence_why i ' m leaving my review ...
neutral	i will update tommorrow .
neutral	so as an update , the packages turned_up at the time that was quoted .
neutral	delivery driver was pleasant , and i made sure i didn ' t miss it this time by being at the door before he even got out the van .
neutral	the only thing i was concerned_about was that one of my boxes was quite badly ripped open , but luckily the contents was absolutely fine .
neutral	so with faith restored i ' ve updated the star_rating .
neutral	called 0 times and each time a member of staff said something different .
neutral	i wanted the best seats .
neutral	one said i should get one row and another said something different .
neutral	the third said she didn ' t know what seats i ' d get .
neutral	spending alot of money you really should know the seats you are getting .
neutral	bottom_line i guess i got what i ordered , but for the money i expected alot more .
neutral	i ' m not really a fan of baught pizza ( i like to make my own ) but , i rate them higher_than puppa johns and pizza_hut but we have a good selection of local pizza companies offering a better range and usually better quality pizza ' s for much lower prices .
neutral	also please stop putting people in costumes on roundabouts it ' s very distracting to drivers as they jump up and down and wave their arms around and one of these day ' s their going to cause an accident and kill someone !
neutral	the purpose of this site is good and the system is quite fair , but is very complicated to use .
neutral	det_er rigtig godt med privat biludlejning , men de her er altså væsentlig dyrere end gomore
neutral	i like the online process , but its the 00min phone call going through every detail of your spending and what you owe is the killer .
neutral	it just makes you feel small , and the guy asking the questions almost seemed accusing and judgmental .
neutral	id rather answer all these questions privately on an online form .
neutral	and just have a quick phone call to agree the details are correct .
neutral	in the end i know its helped_me and yes i would use the service again .
neutral	but it still makes me feel small .
neutral	tried to buy a camera but staff certainly are not the brightest - some training and maybe better selection process than just finding local drop - outs there argos - good prices but you will put people off who need advice
neutral	delivery was on time .
neutral	product is of excellent quality .
neutral	the use by date is 0th_november , which gives me 0 weeks to drink 00 cartons .
neutral	had to freeze it all .
neutral	myprotein . com had 0 months on the used by date .
neutral	i wished it stated the shelf_life before you order .
neutral	signal is good ...
neutral	customer_service is aweful
neutral	flew with easyjet to spain , flights were not delayed both ways .
neutral	which was a bonus !
neutral	the people at the check - in desks at liverpool where rather polite , however the people at the check - in desks at spain where the most rude abrupt people ive ever met .
neutral	the flights where both smoothly , however choice of hot food on board is minimal , and of what there is , wasnt nice at all .
neutral	i am a person who used to love the whole plane food where you got a meal on a tray , and dislike the fact this option is not available on the flight .
neutral	there where also no tv ' s on the flight , like you get on majority of others , so you had nothing to do for the duration of the flight .
neutral	i asked for a blanket and pillow for my baby boy , as he was tired , and they said we stopped doing those along time ago .
neutral	which i found a disgrace !!!
neutral	a flight is meant to be a pleasurable experience , and the simple things matter !
neutral	dont think i will be using easyjet again in the near_future .
neutral	i had no_problems with the whisky_exchange itself .
neutral	my goods were dispatched promptly .
neutral	the problem came with the delivery driver who left the goods at the local post_office but failed to leave a card to say so .
neutral	we only discovered where they had been left by_accident .
neutral	i ' m not convinced the delivery driver called at the house at all as there was someone in all day .
neutral	i always find tescos to be entirely satisfactory .
neutral	but they never really impress me with anything , no do they disappoint .
neutral	i love going to this place because of their killer buy one get one deals and their low_prices .
neutral	however , the fact that their shipping is so expensive sometimes deters me .
neutral	this is my go to for large bulk purchases but anything individual i usually go elsewhere because of shipping_costs .
neutral	other wise great service .
neutral	even faster shipping would be appreciated as well .
neutral	first bought a ibanez guitar off gear 0 music , brilliant guitar , arrived on time and also came with a free stand which was handy .
neutral	second bought a electronic drum_kit made by gear0music , nice drum_kit , and arrived on time .
neutral	then the kick drum sensor went inside it , even_though i have learnt and always played heel down , so i bought a yamaha kp00 kick pad to replace it , it was supposed to arrive on the 00 / 0 /_0000 which i had booked off work so i could see in the delivery myself , i had also booked off today 00 / 00 /_0000 just in case it came a day late , it is now 0 :_00pm and still no delivery and i doubt it will come .
neutral	this has pissed me off as i have had to spend 0 days at home waiting for this , i got an_email on the 00 / 00 /_0000 saying it was being " out for delivery " at 00 : 00 :_00am , and again on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 : 00 :_00am , and yet nothing .
neutral	so now i am not going to be able to see / sign in the delivery when it comes , neither will my parents because they will be at work .
neutral	for convenience it ' s good , if you need something right now .
neutral	prices are way too high otherwise .
neutral	i ' ve stopped gonig in there but if money isn ' t a problem for you , the shopping_experience is good .
neutral	argos is more of a catalog store , everyone_knows that so you get what ' s expected .
neutral	i love shopping at argos because you buy from argos and if there are problems , you only deal with argos .
neutral	the only problem i ' ve has is where i booked something online to fetch instore and pitched up to find they had their stock_levels wrong .
neutral	home delivery is something they need to work on , it ' s a kind of it ' ll get there when it gets there , because of this i never use home delivery , so i always have a good time with argos .
neutral	as long as the seller / buyer and yourself do a good deal , which i have to admit is more times than not , the experience is good .
neutral	if you have to get ebay involved even if you do get to an operator you may as well still be talking to a machine , i ' ve sat on the other side of the phone thinking , do you really get people this thick ?
neutral	i ' d say 00_% of dealings i ' ve had on ebay have been good , both buying 00_% and selling 00 %.
neutral	things do get resolved on ebay , but on ebays terms and they always end up taking forever and leave you more frustrated than you were before contacting them .
neutral	overall the experience of going to the cinema i find is very good .
neutral	but ... theres too many adverts before the actual film and the food is waaaaay too expensive .
neutral	i appreciate they don ' t have the technology of just_eat but a confirmation_email or text with estimated_delivery time would make me use this site again .
neutral	get lenses is a good website .
neutral	the contact_lenses i order are good value and get lenses are very competitive with their prices .
neutral	i do not always receive my lenses quickly but they do arrive !
neutral	!
neutral	sometimes things come through bang on time but as it ' s a shared pot of keys if you ' re not fast you ' ll have to wait_until more are uploaded .
neutral	but can ' t be_beaten on price .
neutral	came_across this website thought it looked good hope not too good to be true . got tickets for a gig tomorrow and hoping tickets are 0 ) legitimate and 0 ) here in time to get to gig ... will def use again if everything goes ok ( i ' d number 0000000 )
neutral	i use easyjet every year to go on holiday to majorca .
neutral	last couple of years have been some delays but usually ok service
neutral	they had the book , the search bar pulled it up within letters of spelling it out .
neutral	i was disappointed at the quility of the book i received .
neutral	it was label as used , but it was far more used that advertised .
neutral	the back cover was soaked with a large coffee stain .
neutral	i don ' t really care , i needed the book and got it realitivly quick .
neutral	it was just a disappointment .
neutral	the top i got was good quality and there are no signs it is a second or b grade stock , not one of their own brands either .
neutral	the shoes on the other hand are obvious seconds as the soles are manufactured all over the place making one foot feel as if there is a lump under it while walking .
neutral	i only tried them on properly after 0 weeks and phoned them to complain , they gave me a free post address to return them to and they didn ' t even need the original box which had been recycled .
neutral	some bad products but overall a good service on returns .
neutral	the 0 pint mugs they send you are amazing though , wouldn ' t be without one from now on !
neutral	i ' ve been with vodafone since 0000 now .
neutral	they do offer pretty good prices with contracts and sim only ; however i find that in my area the signal is rather flimsy .
neutral	i suffer constant drop outs ; occasional the network stops responding .
neutral	reports are to do with the signal masts ; which many where damaged from january ' s storms .
neutral	customer_service are okay , although sometimes the person on the other side of the phone don ' t want to speak to you and i have had a call dropped on me in the past .
neutral	i ' m using a samsung_galaxy ace , i have family_members using worse phones on o0 and they get full 0g without any real problems ; i however get 0 - 0 bars of 0g , constant drop outs and struggle to get an active connection when out and about even on 0g ( which i get full ).
neutral	my area is mapped as " good indoors " but it sure doesn ' t feel_like it .
neutral	i struggle with phone_calls as my phone will hang_up because of signal lost ; it has done this for my last 0 phones since moving to the area .
neutral	i ' m still using the same sim issued in 0000 so i don ' t know if that is the problem but i plan to pop into a vodafone store and try find a reason to this appalling signal problem .
neutral	if vodafone sort the signal problems out especially in my area i ' d be happy to give them a 0 star .
neutral	it ' s about £ 0 , but they failed to tell me ... just to let people know as they obviously don ' t want you to know .
neutral	colour swatches of nail_polishes i ordered were missleading , from the images i believed i was ordering a grey , and a tangerine polish .
neutral	both were a little disappointing the grey is virtually white , and the tangerine is a sickly mid shade of orange .
neutral	i love essie nail_polishes so was a little disappointed with the colours i go and those i was expecting .
neutral	other than that i was happy with the speed of the delivery , packaging and other items , shame the items themselves didn ' t live up to expectations .
neutral	as an example , just recently i bought an expensive raid enclosure that has taken three attempts to complete the order and a period of almost a month in waiting time .
neutral	the first time it came it was sent in a box which survived the deadly pitfalls of royal_mail / parcel_force handling .
neutral	although once i opened it i found that the retail box was crushed and in tatters as if something hefty had driven over it .
neutral	some bright spark in the warehouse must have thought it was appropriate to send it in that state .
neutral	when i had to send the item back i arranged a specific date but parcel_force arrived a day earlier .
neutral	i had to drop everything i was doing and package it for them only for them to make out it was somehow my fault .
neutral	second time it arrived in the same packaging and on first inspection it looked fine albeit the seal was broken on the retail box .
neutral	i then discovered the raid enclosure itself had been badly handled by god_knows who and had scratches all over it .
neutral	i was hoping third time lucky but this time they thought it was suitable sending an expensive piece of hardware through the post in a plastic_bag instead of a box so the retail packaging was crushed again .
neutral	i inspected the hardware which finally was in reasonable shape so i just bit my tongue and moved on .
neutral	i just cannot_believe that they are so completely careless about a product that cost over £_000 .
neutral	now if i decide to sell the item on it will be missing a box and therefore i lose money .
neutral	this is simple stuff ebuyer , get it right !
neutral	in future i will avoid ebuyer which is a great shame because they have great products at good prices .
neutral	it just isn ' t worth the time and misery .
neutral	update_: i ended_up having to send the raid enclosure back again because it was faulty and again they sent the item out simply wrapped in a thin bag even_though i asked the customer_service on the phone to please package it in a box as it kept getting damaged .
neutral	luckily this time the box is in slightly better condition and the raid enclosure appears to be fine so now a good few_months from my initial purchase i can finally put this dreadful experience behind me .
neutral	again another online_retailer who couldn ' t care less how many products they damage through careless packaging .
neutral	the amount of times i ' ve had to send books back , in particular , because they have carelessly thrown it in a box or unprotected envelope .
neutral	i no_longer buy anything from amazon that is delicate or fragile and is likely to get damaged in the post .
neutral	instead i buy from independent sellers with only 000_% feedback which has saved me a lot of time and misery .
neutral	it is a shame because i have a long list of books i would have ordered from them and am still trying to track down from alternative places that are reliable .
neutral	it ' s not just low_cost items either , i ' ve bought very expensive pc hardware and electronic_goods that have been wrapped inadequately and arrived completely crushed and damaged .
neutral	you ' d think amazon would be concerned_about how much money they are losing due to this but it clearly doesn ' t seem to bother them at all .
neutral	very sloppy indeed and a terrible waste of everyone ' s time .
neutral	buying online should be a pleasant_experience not a hazard .
neutral	obviously the good reason for shopping with amazon is their prices , the range of stock and the option of a free delivery .
neutral	i also shop with them because they tend to replace items promptly and with no_fuss .
neutral	their free returns system is actually quite effective and easy to use .
neutral	i had one bad purchase and found it nearly impossible to contact ebay after receiving one stock brush off letter .
neutral	i personally like how you ' re priced some items , like the mifare stickers .
neutral	they are of good quality as well .
neutral	but shipping_costs exceeded the value of the items .
neutral	you have locked the user for only one type of shipping when its not necessary to ship a coin sized item valued around three pounds in expensive specially delivery .
neutral	normal first_class , just like amazon does would ' ve sufficed .
neutral	give the user the option to choose the type of delivery they like .
neutral	you could have earned all 0_stars if that was the case - sorry .
neutral	prices are good , delivery is reasonably fast and reliable .
neutral	if you have a problem , forget it .
neutral	customer_service is very slow and not really willing to help with problems .
neutral	whether i ' m in central taunton or bristol - my signal is poor .
neutral	i ' ve tried to sort it with vodafone in store , but their not interested .
neutral	i try to go to apple .
neutral	they want to charge me for a new phone !!
neutral	!
neutral	keeps it simple
neutral	the site is , of course , very good value for money .
neutral	however , some of the shades displayed are very missleading , meaning i ended_up with several products i can ' t use , and fragrence direct refuse to refund without the items being returned .
neutral	this is no good , as to see the shade , i have opened the packaging , and it would cost me to return the items , possibly even more_than i paid for them .
neutral	poor customer_service !
neutral	the online ordering_process was hassle_free as you would expect and i am very happy with the quality of the poster frames i ordered .
neutral	i was though somewhat annoyed with the 0 business days for the items to be sent for delivery , and then additionally 0 business days for arrival .
neutral	delivery for frames on their website is stated as " this can take up to 0 working_days " and gave me the impression that this would be the total time for delivery after_placing the order .
neutral	further , without being given a courier ' s tracking code to narrow_down when the order might arrive , it meant having to stay at home longer_than anticipated .
neutral	used terence paul for the first time a few weeks_ago as they offered my regular hair products much much lower in price than any other online_retailer .
neutral	delivery was fast and quick however once you made the purchase its very difficult to keep_track of what ' s happening with your order .
neutral	my order kept on saying pending and suddenly one day it was delivered .
neutral	the packaging was also a bit flimsy and not very protective so i ' d think_twice before ordering any fragile items or breakable items .
neutral	paid £_00 for a bouquet to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday and not worth the money at all .
neutral	very small amount of flowers and when they arrived a couple of them had the heads hanging off where they hadn ' t been handled correctly - disappointed after using this service before and getting a good quality present .
neutral	won ' t be using these again .
neutral	used myprotein before and was happy with the choice of the quality of the supplier .
neutral	recently something went terribly wrong , order is late , webpage unresponsive when viewing order .. no - one answers phone_calls .
neutral	still_awaiting order / or a refund ...
neutral	guess it is time to move on to new supplier ....
neutral	this wepage does not recognize myprotein order number ( 00000000 )... so it had to be edited
neutral	service & support and deliver heading downwards ...
neutral	edit ( 00 / 00 / 00 ): support contacted me by email and also , received my order today .
neutral	so , all ok - cheers .
neutral	what ever problems myprotein folks have , all the best in solving them !
neutral	!
neutral	like shopping on the online shopping . as like ebay . amazon . google and other website . and it need fast time and got it .
neutral	i think someboday like use paypal to pay or get some money online shopping . but some time it was limed by compay . and we dont use it well .
neutral	had quite a pushy conversation with one of their sales personnel as he was more_than eager to get the call finished once i ' d shown an interest in the offered insurance but ... they did get me the best price for what seems like a pretty comprehensive policy so just needed to ignore his fast talking , ask the questions that i wanted answered and repeat them if he tried moving on without giving a proper answer .
neutral	as for how they handle claims , hopefully i won ' t have to make one so can ' t comment on that just yet .
neutral	after worrying for days , seeing the reply that my iphone had been unlocked gave immense relief to me .
neutral	thankyou team at officialiphoneunlock . com .
neutral	ordered a set of 0 00gb usb drives
neutral	arrived in a few_days longer_than i expected , but not a deal_breaker
neutral	would probably buy again as good value
neutral	this company is great - most of the time . courier failed to show up on friday so i contacted them with live help and gemma was very helpful and re - booked it for monday .
neutral	ordered an iphone0 from them a friday_evening and received it the next thursday .
neutral	was not happy on the time it took as it said it was next_day delivery so expected it tuesday but when it arrived it was in excellent condition and worth waiting for :) thanks
neutral	i found applying for and then purchasing the insurance for my macbook_pro pretty simple - no issues there .
neutral	just irritating that i had to wait 00 days for the policy t take affect .
neutral	not a big deal , really except that i was going away , and wanted the cover to kick - in immediately .
neutral	i recently stayed with house trip and unfortunately the people i was renting my apartment from cancelled at the last_minute with some very dubious excuses .
neutral	the assistants are based in spain i think so it ' s hard to get across what you need .
neutral	they did get me another apartment which was lovely however i think i ' ll be booking with a larger serviced apartment company from now on .
neutral	were new to ao . com and i just had a call from a customer_service lady to ' confirm ' the order my husband made last_night .
neutral	she caught me on a busy day at work and rushed through a lot of info at the speed of light - what service i can expect from the company etc .
neutral	hidden in amongst it was mention of a ' price plan ' which i thought she was just mentioning in case we had not paid upfront for the goods - which we had .
neutral	she mentioned the 00 - hr helpline and a call - out service they offer if any_problems .
neutral	then quite far into the spiel she said " so if i can just take your sort code for security ?".
neutral	i asked why she needed it , as we had already paid and that she should have it on their system already .
neutral	she said " it can be any sort code and account number , it doesn ' t have to be the same one as you made your order with ".
neutral	i asked why they needed this for ' security '.
neutral	she said we ' ll it ' s just for the price plan , to set the direct_debit up .
neutral	what direct_debit ???
neutral	i had already paid for the goods .
neutral	she said it was for the monthly direct_debit to receive the after care - call - out / replacement service / guarantee etc etc .
neutral	nowhere in her call had she mentioned a monthly_fee for this - £ 0 . 00 per_month i think she said .
neutral	and at no point did she ask me if i was interested in taking out this insurance_policy - to which i would ' ve replied no .
neutral	i let her know that her selling techniques were a underhand and that she didn ' t mention any of the costs involved / direct_debit before asking for the account details .
neutral	" sorry for the confusion .
neutral	i did mention it though " ( she didn ' t ) " i have been told i speak really fast " was her reply .
neutral	probably a prerequisite of the job - bamboozle the customer .
neutral	i felt_like the sales spiel was designed to take people off - guard .
neutral	their methods to sign people up are sneaky and it ' s left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth , before the goods have even arrived .
neutral	i ' m trying to get an answer regarding faulty porcelain that i ' ve received for 0 weeks already but with no response .
neutral	if you won ' t fix the issue you ' ll get very big negative and it won ' t be on the site owned by yourself .
neutral	update_:
neutral	after negative_review i ' ve been contacted quickly and problem has been resolved .
neutral	it was related to the fact that simply replying to their emails sends them to the black hole called ' noreply ' account .
neutral	i ' d advise you to improve that - either by changing this address to customer_service or adding clear feedback from your mail server that email has not been delivered .
neutral	overall - positive but yes , with some friction .
neutral	i ordered a piano and it was all fine , but then it took 0 days ( weekend + 0 working_days ) to hear about when it will be delivered .
neutral	their promise of 0 working_days delivery ended_up slipping by 0 working day , which ( for me ) mean waiting for the item for whole week + weekend .
neutral	eventually i chased down the details of delivery ( had to phone up , which is not good ) and everything was arranged and delivered .
neutral	the delivery guy was kind enough to help me bring the piano into the room upstairs , which was really helpful and useful .
neutral	used crc for years and always used to be easy and straight_forward to order anything but lately there seems to be a problem .
neutral	- ordered a dark blue oakley jacket and recieved a light baby blue one instead because they didn ' t actually sell a dark blue one ??
neutral	?
neutral	- been sent damaged used hub adapters that were repackaged .
neutral	also , i have made several emergency orders from crc , i have paid extra for next_day delivery , made sure my order was made long before the deadline on friday and the items weren ' t delivered on time and turned_up monday / tuesday .
neutral	called crc and was told it was held at royal_mail and was their fault .
neutral	then i checked the despatch dates on the parcel and stated that it wasn ' t posted in time to reach me anyway .
neutral	fees !!
neutral	!
neutral	i would sell a load more stuff on here if they got realistic with fees !
neutral	i love the website , its very easy to use .
neutral	the brands are good ad are reasonable prices .
neutral	i ordered a few items , got email notification that they had been dispatched , i even got a text_message from the courier says they had my parcel .
neutral	about a day later i got a phone call from an advisor stating that 0 of my items were not in stock .
neutral	when i questioned the emails and texts i had received regarding these items she turned sour on me .
neutral	telling_me its near to christmas so i should expect that things sellout .
neutral	yes i accept that but don ' t then send me emails and texts telling_me these are on there way to me .
neutral	i tried to ask when they will be back in stock to which she replied i have no_idea , then said bye .
neutral	i have worked in customer_service on the front line for 0 years , this company really needs to coach there staff to be more friendly and approachable .
neutral	so i went to aldi to do a bit of shopping , not the supermarket i choose every week as i like to shop around .
neutral	i have been here a few_times and thought it was good value for some product but not others .
neutral	the tinned and packet things you can ' t really go_wrong with , however the fresh food , well that ' s a big let_down .
neutral	i had filled my trolly with all the bits i wanted and decided i had enough , while unloading onto the conveyor i notice that some of the food was passed it sell by date , and passed it by like a week .
neutral	these products consisted of : yogurts for my kids , cheese , salad , ham , quiche and chicken_breasts .
neutral	i mentioned this to the lady on the checkout , i was gobbed smacked by her response .
neutral	' well what do you expect for cheap food , just freeze it or eat it today , the date only mean we can ' t sell it but its still eatable .
neutral	i did of course show my utter disgust to her and make her get me some that had a least 0 days date on them .
neutral	she on the other hand was not impressed that i had done this .
neutral	i was so shocked that i thought well if this is the attitude of the staff no wonder they don ' t know how to stock rotation .
neutral	not sure i will want to shop here anymore , god_knows_how ill this could of made my kids and me .
neutral	maybe the staff need some extra training or the store needs to be consistent with the food standards agency
neutral	purchased goods and was not emailed / sent an invoice or proof of purchase until 0 weeks_later .
neutral	postage stated 0 - 0 working_days and did not receive the item until 0 weeks_later .
neutral	lead times thus not great !
neutral	items however , perfectly described
neutral	noting special same info same commercials same same
neutral	after receiving my sushi kit i was disappointed to see that the box was ripped on both ends with the contents nearly spilling out .
neutral	this was for a christmas_gift so i had hoped it would have arrived in better condition .
neutral	i don ' t have time to send it back , but i suggested to them that rather_than wrapping a piece of cardboard around their boxes which does barely anything to protect them , perhaps bubblewrap would be better .
neutral	needless to say i didn ' t receive a reply to my complaint !
neutral	took 00 days to get mine unlocked but worth the wait !
neutral	!
neutral	already used it on safaricom and airtel kenya .
neutral	works like a charm :)
neutral	ps_: @ officialiphoneunlock please fix the timeline approximates ... save for that ... legit all the way , from order confirmation , payment confirmation etc .
neutral	web orders are fine but don ' t go in store they will sell you there grand mother to get you buying things you don ' t need .
neutral	you have to love them and hate them at the same time .
neutral	perfect service
neutral	worried they know too much about you
neutral	wide_range of electrical_items a range of used and new items good service reliable they test all your items , too make_sure they work sometimes use this service would recommend if u want cheaper items good website as well with item selection and how much they sell and buy for and emailing available for feedback and q & a etc all in all a good site
neutral	fair value for money but will not exchange faulty mobiles for different type just same model .
neutral	easy to find the products i wanted and for cheaper_than other_sites .
neutral	navigating site was straight - forward and was even able to get a voucher_code for extra discount .
neutral	items were posted the next_day and delivered in very good condition .
neutral	would use again and have no_complaints .
neutral	they offered the best price so i went with this company .
neutral	an offer of the best price seems to be a way to reel you in , and the day after posting i was offered a lower_price .
neutral	one which i reluctantly_accepted and then had to wait over 0 days for payment , which is longer_than they say it should take .
neutral	not good , and contacting customer_service can be difficult .
neutral	first time i used aria
neutral	ordered a dell monitor and the paypal transaction ended_up billing me twice ( this is no fault of aria ).
neutral	called aria_pc to try and explain what had happened , the customer_service male representative who had an air of arrogance and was uncommunicative rushed me off the phone , very very cold .
neutral	i eventually sent an_email to aria himself and was quickly called back within the hour by someone different who set expectations and told me that my extra payment had been refunded and that my monitor would be with me the very next_day ( this person had excellent customer_service and handling skills ).
neutral	the next_day i received the monitor and the extra paypal payment was refunded .
neutral	the monitor is fantastic no_problems with it .
neutral	sadly i will not use aria again for any pc purchases as i could not deal having to speak to the same uncommunicative arrogant customer_service rep in the event of a problem .
neutral	not the greatest service in the world .
neutral	this brand of printing . com ( chilli cactus ) basically informed us that he was going on holiday for two_weeks the morning he went on holiday and that we wouldn ' t be able to collect the work from him .
neutral	i ordered two cdj0000 wall mounts .
neutral	soon afterwards , they were dispatched , but only one arrived .
neutral	when i emailed them , they said i ' d bought the last one , and that those brackets were now out of stock , so they only charged me for one .
neutral	the problem was that they needed to match and i needed two of them !
neutral	anyway sourced the remaining bracket from elsewhere , but it would have been nice to be told and to have had the option to cancel my order then buy both together from elsewhere , rather_than wait for an unknown period to get the missing one !
neutral	only with thomson can you sit on a plane for 00_hours and be given only a small sandwich and a biscuit .
neutral	worse still , the air staff continuously said we should drink water , then after asking for it they demanded € 0 from me !
neutral	the worst flight i ' ve ever been on .
neutral	lucky for us the safari holiday was top_notch which made up for it .
neutral	tried yodel and booked a parcel before reading the trust_pilot reviews .
neutral	however was in a manned reception business centre all day with an intercom and about 00 : 00 it showed up on the tracking unable to collect parcel and " left a card " - rubbish .
neutral	also my phone number was added to the order too just in case however no call either ...
neutral	however - update
neutral	last couple of yodel parcels have been on time and in good condition plus if you need help the twitter dedicated team are very helpful .
neutral	so maybe it looks_like theyre getting their act_together a bit and we might not have to dread the ' delivery by yodel ' tag .
neutral	a game which is in stock is still ' processing and awaiting stock pick ' 0 days_later .
neutral	absolute_joke of a retailer .
neutral	i can ' t believe it takes a huge online_retailer this long when it takes someone off ebay normally a day to post a game and that ' s not even their job .
neutral	update though , i used zavvi for another item recently and it was dispatched in a couple of hours and received in 0 working_days , maybe theyve sorted some bits out or maybe it depends on where stocks located etc ?
neutral	however a bit of trust regained !
neutral	i have used theprintspace 0 times .
neutral	the first time i could not fault them delivery was prompt and the results brilliant .
neutral	the second time the results were brilliant but this time the next_day delivery took 0 - 0 days and i did not get a refund for the delay
neutral	the third time the reulst again were stunning !
neutral	but this time because i wizzed through the sale i missed the bit about not send boards through royal_mail .
neutral	- why the website let me use a postal service inappropriate to the product i dont know but there you go .
neutral	resolution was that their customer_service team paid for next_day delivery which was good .
neutral	summary_:
neutral	results : stunning .
neutral	standard service : poor
neutral	customer_service : brilliant
neutral	i was satisfied with everything but the shipping .
neutral	i did order very close to christmas so it ' s really my own fault .
neutral	my christmas cards arrived after christmas because they sat in the shipping facility for 0 days after printing .
neutral	there isn ' t anything i can do about that now .
neutral	the cards arrived , i got them sent out .
neutral	all is well .
neutral	i only play main lotto now since they ruined the euromillions .
neutral	more numbers and having to play on more days just doesn ' t suit my budget .
neutral	good to include 0p off fuel when you spend at tesco , only wish the wine prices would be lower , they seem to have crept up incredibly high recently .... just like petrol prices :(
neutral	i have used this company in the past but i find it takes them forever to send items out that are listed on the site as in stock causing me to have to chase up as no communication was given .
neutral	i decided to use them again recently and again items have not been sent out for a while .
neutral	i wont be using them again .
neutral	stayed at a premier_inn as its so reliable - friendly welcome , comfortable bed , good shower etc plus the good nigh guarantee .
neutral	all present and correct but our evening_meal was poor and the staff were friendly but badly trained - didn ' t know how to handle a complaint ( not taken seriously , full if excuses ) and left a phone ringing next to our table for ages .
neutral	breakfast not much_better unfortunately .
neutral	also car_parking practically non_existent at the hotel - cost me £_00 in the ncp which made my £_00 room deal a much poorer deal .
neutral	shame really as hotel itself fine .
neutral	easy to use on line shopping and yes , the favourites bit is helpful , but i feel that delivery charges are unreasonable when you a purchasing a ' big shop '.
neutral	iceland offers free delivery on grocery_shopping over £_00 , so why has tesco not got any free delivery .
neutral	i have done grocery_shopping with them to tune of £_000 and still had to pay delivery !
neutral	i think there should be a sliding scale for delivery eg .
neutral	up to £_00 standard delivery charges apply , then at reduced rates for more spent , up to free delivery for bigger orders .
neutral	i really like facebook although i prefer the old setting and think that people should be given the choice whether to change back or not
neutral	when i placed my order i was really excited because i had heard_nothing but good things about the brushes , the processing and shipping was phenomenal !
neutral	i have never gotten anything in the mails so fast .
neutral	however when i opened them i noticed multiple brushes were shedding pretty bad so i decided to spot clean them rather then deep clean but when one of the brushes produced a purple color it freaked me out so i washed i washed it and naturally it had to be the brush i was most excited about ( a chisel powder brush / mini flat bronzer duo ) ran thick with dark blue dye which terrified me because i ' m not only allergic to almost everything i also have really sensitive_skin , so i washed it twice which seems to have gotten all the dye out but when i went to use it the flat side shed so bad i ended_up having to wash my face and completely re - apply my foundation and the chisel side applied really patchy and uneven .
neutral	next issue i had was with the small angled eye liner brush it ' s too flimsy to even apply eyeliner with correctly .
neutral	the other brushes i got despite how much they all have been shedding have been great and i would recommended them for the unique factor but the chisel powder brush / mini bronzer duo and the small angled eyeliner brush i would recommend buying somewhere_else unless you want to be extremely disappointed .
neutral	i ordered these flowers for my nans birthday , i did order them over the easter_weekend so this may be why i had issues , however a well_established company should be able to anticipate and adapt during busy_periods of the year .
neutral	the flowers where not delivered , i had an_automated email_saying they had been routed to the wrong depot but no email from an actual person with an_apology or explanation a s to what they where doing to rectify this issue , i am not sure if they would have if i hadn ' t have contacted them first . they then offered a full_refund , or to let the flowers run their natural course which i told them was not acceptable ; my nan lives on her own an looks forward to receiving flowers for her_birthday due to the bank_holiday as well she had not receive her_birthday_present she was very upset by this .
neutral	after a few attempts they said they would redeliver at a time of my choice obviously i said asap .
neutral	the flowers where delivered by the thursday ( total of 0 days late ).
neutral	my nan did love the flowers i ordered the blue dendrodeums i was told they where amazing and that she had never seen anything like them so that was a kind of happy ending despite the frustration .
neutral	overall disappointing delivery service , ok customer_service .
neutral	the flowers where lovely , so i would recommend with caution .
neutral	the service so far is good , my internet_connection is good and phone line is great too , you get what you pay for its a very cheap service but is showing good value for money .
neutral	the only negative i ' ve had is the router you ' re provided with , it is no good at all with providing good wifi connection to my laptop i have to have it plugged in .
neutral	excellent online service but rubbish phone service been on hold for 00 min !
neutral	!
neutral	it seems like the longer i ' ve been a customer the worse my customer_service has gotten .
neutral	you ' d think it will go the other way .
neutral	i ' ve received the wrong item twice .
neutral	also the bulk buying on the website has gotten out of control .
neutral	it turned into a wholesale page versus a customer shopping page .
neutral	i think eventually , another store will come up and replace this one if the bulk buying doesn ' t stop .
neutral	at_least let something stay in someones cart for 0 minutes .
neutral	i ' ve seen stores do this .
neutral	i brought at_least 00 customers to the site by spreading the word at my customer_service job and at the university i attend , but it ' s favor is slowing on me .
neutral	the few things i do get that i want , are the wrong item .
neutral	just not good
neutral	ah sure it was ok
neutral	cheap flights , but i hate being stuffed in and having to pay rediculous prices for eats & drinks .
neutral	i ordered a bunch of " lemon sorbet " flowers for mother ' s day and while the delivery was faultless , the bunch received was a " mum in a million ".
neutral	while equal in value this was not what i had ordered or paid for .
neutral	i attempted to use their supposedly efficient , quick and easy online live_chat but ironically it displayed that every department was offline .
neutral	i emailed in case my " live_chat " message had not got through and after two days there was no sign of anything being done about it .
neutral	i eventually called the company up and on the last tone of the second attempt i got through to someone .
neutral	i was informed that i couldn ' t have a refund as in the small_print for mother ' s day flowers it says that everything is subject to availability and can be substituted with a similar bunch if they don ' t have the one required .
neutral	maybe i should have trawled through the terms and conditions but it would have been more realistic to have a more explicit warning of this .
neutral	however i was told that while he wouldn ' t usually do this ( oh sure ) he could send me the bunch i ordered free of charge .
neutral	that has been ordered and i received a £ 0 voucher for another purchase as i was making the call .
neutral	i can ' t help feeling the " equal value substitute " is an excuse to send people a cheaper to produce , slightly dog - eared bunch and get away with it .
neutral	in conclusion i ' m slightly suspicious but to be fair they sorted the issue out politely , very quickly once i called and i am satisfied with the outcome .
neutral	even if mother ' s day has past , a second ( nicer_than the original ) bunch will be greatly_appreciated i ' m sure !
neutral	i would probably order from them again but i will read the t &_c ' s first .
neutral	if anyone_else is having trouble - call them to sort it out .
neutral	the dresses online are good and ive bought a few .
neutral	but the maxi dresses are not the same standard .
neutral	each one ive recived are torn .
neutral	so they are a waste of money .
neutral	im happy with the service received .
neutral	the delivery was great .
neutral	on time , great notifications , swift payment . the biggest downside was the flowers itself .
neutral	i paid for the grandissimo flowers but in return think the flowers wer normal , not full not bigger from the picture shown at all .
neutral	so money not spent well as is was a special gift from my son to his aunty .
neutral	will stick to interflora next time
neutral	the thing about currys and it ' s sister companies pc_world and dixons , is that they do offer very good prices on certain products but they are really difficult to buy as they are usually out of stock , despite being continually advertised for sale .
neutral	i was trying to buy a laptop for my mum and found several that were on special offer .
neutral	they sounded great but whever i tried to order online or purchase in store they weren ' t available .
neutral	eventually , after numerous_attempts , i did manage to buy a good hp laptop at a very reasonable_price from a currys store in north birmingham .
neutral	the chap in store tried to sell me ms office but i explained that i only needed the basic ms works ( or similar ) as it was for my mum .
neutral	however , he said that laptops no_longer come bundled with ms works or anything similar and i ' d need to buy the full product .
neutral	i declined as i wanted to look_into this myself , and when i got home discovered that you do indeed get a ( slightly retricted ) version of ms office whith word and excel - more_than enough for my mum .
neutral	if the saleman didn ' t know this then he needs to brush up a bit , if he did know then he was being very naughty and i ' m sure many unsuspecting people would fall for it .
neutral	out of order .
neutral	i feel virgin has gone down_hill ..... most red hots are in slots or casino ... red_hot wednesday aint has exciting anymore rarely see the big house ' s only great thing about the red_hot ' s is the free bingo being more in enterprise than adventure .... i feel this site needs to relook at there red_hot ' s and bring more bingo red hots back and less casino or slots ... i use to reccomend this site to my friends and family but now i would reccomend they stay_away sorry to say
neutral	been shopping at aria for a while and always had very quick delivery , recently however i bought a graphics_card that was faulty on arrival and wasn ' t as advertised .
neutral	after a couple of messages i was told i could return it for a full_refund including the postage_costs both ways which was good , the money for the card and original postage came through nice and fast but in the end it took over 0 months and multiple messages ( and being told several_times it have been done ) to get a refund for the cost of posting it back to them .
neutral	i ' m not so worried_about smaller purchases but i ' m now cautious_about making expensive purchases over concern about how long it could take to get a refund or replacement should anything go_wrong again .
neutral	i used asos to purchase in - excess of £_000 of clothes .
neutral	the delivery service is very good , in fact i had to change the one of the items ( due to wrong_size ) and the drop_off service is very effective .
neutral	unfortunately where i thought an improvement could be made is in the quality of asos brand of clothing i . e .
neutral	the jumpers are definitely of lesser quality compared to other brands
neutral	i love ebay when i ' m the buyer !... great prices !
neutral	!... and even sometimes as a seller ... but warning !!
neutral	don ' t sell anything that ' s expensive to ship !
neutral	.... i had some idiot that i think purchased wheels that didn ' t end up fitting his car like he thought ( when the size was clearly_stated ) and told ebay that the tread was too low when it was clearly_stated that they were used tires .
neutral	long_story short : he sends them back ... i have to refund the buyer ... i lose $_000 in shipping cost !... and so does he !
neutral	( serves him right though !
neutral	)... ebay buyer_protection blows !
neutral	( in some_cases )
neutral	i was over the moon when searching for a price for my old iphone , which i had looked after very well ; when i found gadgetpanda offering £_00 more_than other_companies .
neutral	i sent it away , in a stress_free way , easy packing , easy posting , good updates .
neutral	but the companyy seemingly found a crack on the rear facia , which i find had to understand - this then took the proce down to the same as what the other_companies had offered .
neutral	i don ' t know it it was their way of getting more business , or if they genuinely thought something was wrong with the phone ; but i find this very hard to comprehend .
neutral	however , cheque came quick and cleared even quicker , so if you are looking for fast cash it is the way forward .
neutral	varorna kom i tid och priset var bra .
neutral	lite småskum hemsida att hitta på och möjligheten att göra returer förminskas drastiskt med tanke på_den extremt krångliga returgången .
neutral	ease of purchase was good , and then when tickets were dispatched i had a voicemail to let me know they were on the way which i was impressed with .
neutral	the only thing i would say in critism is that i didn ' t recieve a confirmaiton email after tickets were brought ( maybe it went in to spam ) so i was a little_worried that it wasn ' t real .
neutral	" your balance of 00 . 00 eur is payable on arrival ."
neutral	turns_out we had to pay an extra fee of 00 € at the arrival !
neutral	kind of unhappy with this because with this 00 € i could have booked a better hotel with no fees .
neutral	lack of information in the website .
neutral	hope not to be disappointed next time !
neutral	dear_sir i would like discuss it that this site is very helpful me for real estate knowledge
neutral	i recommend that this is very informative & useful site .
neutral	i am bangladeshi but real estate is very important in our country thats why i like it .
neutral	other hand there product is very reasonable & comfortable .
neutral	had an awful experience with them when i had to return a faulty laptop , and swore i ' d never use them again .
neutral	however their prices and delivery speed make them a very attractive option still - giving them one more chance to redeem themselves by placing an order for a tablet from them today ...
neutral	slow response time to furniture delivery enquiry .
neutral	otherwise happy with the product ( you get what you pay for ) and the price was decent .
neutral	i ordered my key without noticing the key wasn ' t being released for two days .
neutral	my fault .
neutral	however , when i opened a support ticket to find out about the release_date i had a default response with no date , only a note to tell me to look at the product page .
neutral	i then replied to that ticket ..... twice ...... with no response .
neutral	i finally received an_email letting me know that my key was ready for collection , so off i go to autokey to find it is still out of stock and is not there at all .
neutral	only upon writing in the supports ticket .
neutral	again with no response did i finally get my key .
neutral	by_far the worst experience i have had from any cd_key site .
neutral	three stars because i actually got my key
neutral	so whilst tesco will wheel your shopping to your fridge door , asda refused to leave the side of their van because of "' elf and safety ".
neutral	so i had to lug 0 carts of very heavy shopping by my lonesome to my flat which was a good 000m away , whilst the two delivery men waited at their van .
neutral	talk about chivalry ...
neutral	very slow delivery :( product great though
neutral	made an order when they claimed free express international shipping upon spending abov 000 $.
neutral	this was not so .
neutral	customer_services provided no help .
neutral	might be a long while before making another order .
neutral	the shipment arrived too_late because of lack of express shipping which was promised , i add .
neutral	nightmare setting_up wifi .
neutral	ended_up paying another company for tech_support as talk_talk were no use at all
neutral	poorly information about current order status and history of order .
neutral	also information about dispatch wich came to e_- mail dosent match to information on my account on site
neutral	moonpig are pretty handy , but i wouldn ' t rely_on them as a last_minute option , as their urgent delivery is a little too pricey .
neutral	what ' s really frustrating is i had £_00 or more of credit with them , i think they prompted me to add credit to my account , but then when i went to place an order with them little over a year later all of my credit had mysteriously " expired ".
neutral	also , they don ' t post any information about artwork dimensions , should you want to upload a personal design ( i looked up measurements then doubled for good resolution , but the colour looks iffy to me , something i could ' ve adjusting in photoshop had i known the colour info ) purely_because of the credit thing i wouldn ' t have returned to moonpig out of principal , but i recently_moved abroad , and found the service to be much more worth while as my relatives will receive the cards much_quicker_than if i sent them from here .
neutral	right , i ordered a huge load of clothes a few_days ago worth about £_000 .
neutral	reading all the reviews i ' m now seriously crapping myself over whether i ' ll get taxed by customs , and whether i ' ll actually get my ordered items !
neutral	0 of my items are still_waiting in stock so i ' m very apprehensive and regretful about my order .
neutral	i have bought items from yesstyle before .
neutral	i remember buying a bag and it took_ages to arrive !
neutral	but i got it in one piece and it was all nicely_wrapped so that was good .
neutral	of course at the end of the day , the site ' s primary objective is to make money , even if it means deviously manipulating customers and being purpousfully discreet and incoherent about certain things *_cough * shippingtimes *_cough *
neutral	depending_on how this order turns_out , and whether i recieve my items in time , in one piece , and hopefully with now extra costs , it ' s unlikely i ' ll buy from them again , and i ' ll make_sure to warn_others about the risks as well .
neutral	i dunno if i ' m the minority who dislikes their service , or whether the people who like their service are actually less inclined to post positive_comments , but at the end of the day , if the serivce ain ' t up to standard , then you can ' t expect people to be in your favour .
neutral	i hope yesstyle can actually post meaningful replies and not some automated_reply like they always do as well !
neutral	there ' s a deposit that does not get taken off your final balance , bit miss leading .
neutral	other than that i found a great delivery service
neutral	i bought an audio book from tesco and it took at_least 0 weeks to arrive , and i paid the order the same day .
neutral	it arrived in good packaging but i can ' t understand_why the long delay .
neutral	i emailed the company twice asking a question in regards to a voucher i had purchased and had no reply .
neutral	i uploaded the photos to make a calendar , but couldn ' t save my progress when building the calendar , and had to start over again as i couldn ' t complete it in one go .
neutral	other than that the product i recieved was of a very high_quality and despatched quickly .
neutral	i have been awaiting a parcel and have found the online tracking_system very vague .
neutral	i discovered that whilst in transit , my parcel had been labeled with the wrong_address and found the website very one sided .
neutral	it seemed more orientated round the sender , parcel0go ' s customer , rather_than the person recieving the parcel , the third person in the transaction .
neutral	however , i felt very reassured after_speaking to rose via the online_chat helpline .
neutral	friendly , helpful , efficient , human ( as in got realistic , human answers ).
neutral	thank_you rose .
neutral	beware product images are not always accurate and flooring supplies won ' t go out of their way to help !
neutral	ordered a range of products from the website which were delivered promptly and well_packaged the next_day .
neutral	unfortunately one of the real wood ash trims we ordered was a very different_colour to that pictured on the website .
neutral	while we understand there is a variation with natural wood products , this was a significant difference .
neutral	we chose the ash because is seemed a closer match to the light oak laminate it was to be paired with than the oak version .
neutral	flooring supplies offered to swap the product , but only after returning aat my expense and incurring another £_00 delivery charge for the replacement (£ 00 + for a £_00 product ).
neutral	while the description suggests pairing the product with ash flooring , it doesn ' t state that there is potentially a wild variation in the colour supplied .
neutral	disappointing service from an online business these days .
neutral	the buying experience was okay but once you bought your item you got an_email with instructions on how to track your item and the tracking_system doesnt work .
neutral	either the tracking email should be removed so you dont ever know that theres a useless tracking_system or the tracking_system needs fixing .
neutral	the idea behind flubit is simple : they undercut a well_known online bookshop / everything shop and their marketplace_sellers .
neutral	if you tell flubit you want to buy a ' thingamujig ' and that you ' ve seen one on the great digital shopping mall selling for , let ' s say , £_00 they will find you one for less .
neutral	once you ' ve filled out a simple form to ' demand ' a lower_price a ' merchant consultant ' or a ' demands operative ' from flubit will get in touch with a company which offers this product .
neutral	the deal is that flubit offers to set them up with you , the customer , on the condition that they beat the price you ' ve seen it for .
neutral	they are often one of the same companies offering the item through marketplace and the price drop will presumably be paid by - for want of a better phrase - not having to pay the merchant fees associated with selling through big websites .
neutral	in the event that they can ' t persuade a merchant to offer this they will often buy one at market value and offer it to you for 0 % below - i guess they feel they have a reputation to maintain .
neutral	i imagine that if they become bigger and more established they might quietly drop this part of their operation .
neutral	of the three ' demands ' i ' ve made of flubit one was for a £_00 board game : they found me one for £_00 .
neutral	one was for a £_00 camera , they offered to buy it at that price and sell it to me for £_00 and finally one was for a £_00 book which they managed to find for ... err £_00 .
neutral	well thanks for trying i guess guys .
neutral	i suspect that if i wasn ' t already a reasonably savvy shopper then they might have been able to find better discounts .
neutral	now this is not bad ; in fact it ' s good ( alright , except the book ) but the trouble is i like buying from my usual big online store .
neutral	they became a massive company by being pretty awesome and the rather small discounts flubit offer just don ' t add up to the convenience and security of my usual purchases .
neutral	to show you how i think about it i ' ve put the positives and negatives below :
neutral	what you get :
neutral	from my experience about 0 %_off , so on a £_00 camera you will save £ 0
neutral	what you don ' t get :
neutral	next_day delivery or other delivery options
neutral	a choice of seller
neutral	a feedback and rating_system
neutral	a top end returns_policy ( i guess you might end up with a company that has one but it ' s pot luck .)
neutral	instant purchases : you might wait up to two days to purchase an item after putting in a ' demand '
neutral	a single company dealing_with stock , orders , dispatch and returns / warranty issues
neutral	i guess for some the 0 %_off is a no - brainer .
neutral	for me it ' s the other way around , i ' ll happily pay the 0 % extra to have complete control over where i buy from , how it ' s delivered and to have an above_average returns_policy should anything go_wrong .
neutral	this is all a real_shame because flubit seem like a bunch of nice guys who ' ve come up with a neat way to do business .
neutral	unforunately the built in flaws are too great and the discounts would have to be far bigger than they are to tempt me .
neutral	placed an order for similar products with these_guys and another retailer at the same time .
neutral	both had been accidently offering items which were out of stock .
neutral	the other retailer got back to me straight_away with a personal message apologising and offering to hold the order until stock came in , to refund me straight_away or to send other items to the same value .
neutral	we worked out a new order and i actually ended_up spending more with them .
neutral	dicebay on the other hand could only be bothered to send me an automatic refund notice through paypal two days_later with no apology or explanation .
neutral	not exactly awful just ... meh .
neutral	the company :
neutral	i was a bit_nervous_about ordering from film cells direct since there seemed to be no real body of user feedback online and google streetview showed their registered business address to be a suburban bungalow .
neutral	of course plenty of good businesses are run from homes but it was a point of concern since i could find out very little else about them .
neutral	film cells direct sell through amazon , ebay and their own website .
neutral	prices and stock are mostly consistent throughout all three outlets .
neutral	the service :
neutral	delivery is advertised as 0st_class post sent ' straight_away ' which should guarantee delivery within 00_hours .
neutral	the website however says delivery should be within four business days , presumably in case anything needs to be made to order .
neutral	after waiting four business days ( five postal days ) without even an order confirmation i emailed to ask whether they had received my order .
neutral	i never_heard a reply but the item was dispatched the day i sent the email and received the day after .
neutral	the product
neutral	i ordered one of their ' multi ' frames with a mini film poster surrounded_by 00 cells .
neutral	the mounting was top - class , dead straight with no overcut .
neutral	the frame was a cheap but very serviceable pre_- made job with the hardboard back taken off to allow the light to shine through the cells .
neutral	the front glazing was the original glass and the back was ' glazed ' with thin frosted plastic that looked like it had been cut out from a cheap document wallet .
neutral	this will need to be replaced with something that is actually clear since it imparts its frosted texture to the film cells - basically buggering up the look of the whole_thing .
neutral	at the base and at the rear of the frame is the ' limited_edition ' number .
neutral	since this is an unlicenced bit of fan art knocked together in some bloke ' s garage this seems a bit pretentious .
neutral	personally i ' d rather that space was taken up by the film logo or strapline .
neutral	if it was a licenced product then maybe it might_add something .
neutral	maybe .
neutral	overall :
neutral	overall i must stress that the product i got looked great - better in most ways than i could have hoped and once i ' ve found a replacement for the frosted plastic it will look better still .
neutral	although the frame is cheap bear in mind that the price of even the most basic bespoke frame will be more_expensive than this whole item and a basic bespoke one would probably not end up looking much_better .
neutral	although communication may be an issue fcd do seem to have a commitment to getting the product to the customer .
neutral	it would be nice if they sorted the little kinks out but i will be ordering again and i recommend the company and their products .
neutral	update_:
neutral	after a broadly positive experience noted above i ordered several small mounted film cells .
neutral	each was a single cell mounted with a picture from the film .
neutral	each picture had minor colour errors and several were noticably stretched and distorted .
neutral	unlike the earlier order these most of these products looked decidedly amateurish and poor quality .
neutral	the original review was titled ' almost exceptional ' and gave ****.
neutral	just bought civilization v , said on web_site it ' s region free and it ' s uk version , and whilst it is region free , and works , steam said it ' s ru version , which obviously means russian .
neutral	not too bad as it works , but hate being lied to by retailers !!
neutral	!
neutral	flowers were good , but the message transcribed was described as unorganised and superimposed , making it difficult to read and of course appreciate the purpose of the flowers and meaning .
neutral	serenata service definitely has lots of room for improvement .
neutral	phone line is good
neutral	bt home hub 0 is not good because the connection keep breaking .
neutral	really like the customer_service .. very good
neutral	broadband is slow and expensive
neutral	am waiting for bt infinity0 to come out in rochdale ... if they beat virgin_media fibre_optic then i will move back to bt insha allah .
neutral	don ' t really watch much tv but bbc 0 is good for comedy , especially family guy of a weekend !
neutral	eastenders is utter trife on the other hand , how on earth this crap is still broadcast is beyond me .
neutral	radio 0 is good for the essential mix once a weeks and the specials from clubs and festivals , but after its recent sell out to dub - step i don ' t think i would bother listening any other time than when the essential mix is on .
neutral	i think that if we are paying for a tv license then the public should have more say on what is broadcast .
neutral	always loved their pizza , the stuffed bbq crust is a letdown however .
neutral	ordered some pizzas recently with side orders and we waited 00_minutes for it to be delivered only to discover the driver forgot to bring the side orders !
neutral	wanted to phone up and complain or at_least get some money off but it ' s a bit risky seems as they are handling your food .
neutral	i have been using paypal for about 0 years and i am on my second account because my first account had been accessed by an unauthorized source which tried to sting me for $_000 !!
neutral	funny because i live in the uk and barely ever buy things from the usa !
neutral	the transaction was always stated as " pending " and they did notify me straight_away about my account being accessed yet it could not be resolved as the case number did not exist ?
neutral	recently i noticed that my account had reached the sending limit in which i had to verify my account to continue to send and receive money but i couldn ' t register my bank_account because the details were in use by my old account that i deleted almost 0 years_ago !
neutral	i phoned paypal cs about the issue and the only way i can resolve this is to send them a statement from my bank as proof i own the account .
neutral	i fully understand_why have to do this but i don ' t get why my bank_details have been stored but my account has been closed .
neutral	on the other hand the cs call_centre employees ( i called them on 0 occasions ) were very helpful at helping me resolve the issue .
neutral	i would recommend anyone who would like to use the service to create a secure e_- mail account just for use with paypal to avoid scammers / hackers from trying to access your account .
neutral	0 watch the catalogue prices (_eg camera stuff can be eye wateringly expensive )
neutral	0 .
neutral	i don ' t buy fresh meat there anymore or chicken as i have had some very bad_experiences with rotten stuff being sold .
neutral	( i don ' t think it is a store issue but something in the supply chain )
neutral	0 .
neutral	i don ' t mind misshappen veg but it seems that their market produce lines are getting pricier so i now buy that soert of stuff in asian supermarkets eg onioin , pepper , herbs , aubergibe , courgettes etc
neutral	they have lost the price battle especially against amazon - mens razers are 00_% cheaper at amazon than argos .
neutral	camera stuff for slrs can be 00_% more_expensive than the market price ie many hundreds of pounds above market price
neutral	i have stopped looking at them when i am comparing_prices ... they used to be the first place i would check
neutral	i have tried to buy stuff in jessops but when they do have a competitive price they don ' t have stock ( as far as i can tell anywhere as i travel a lot and so look for stores on my route ).
neutral	most recently was a 000mm ef l series macro lens they advertised but didn ' t have
neutral	their financial problems are public record that may be the cause
neutral	given a choice between jacobs and jessops , jacobs win - i think jessops have let their better staff go and it seems to have more general retail staff in it than camera geeks
neutral	usually excellent but i have two quibbles
neutral	0 .
neutral	delivery can be very patchy and amazon expect you to wait 0 weeks before declaring it missing
neutral	0 . market place can be a minefield .
neutral	lots of grey market electricals without warranty or completely unsupported in uk .
neutral	take special care with camera_equipment and hard_drives
neutral	0 where amazon isn ' t an autorised dealer you may get a lower_price but you can miss out on cashbacks etc
neutral	0 . watch out for " other people bought with " list as some of this can be totally mad - i have noticed it when the wrong memory upgrade was listed against a netbook - if you had bought the netbook with the upgrade , you had the wrong one !
neutral	i can ' t say it is a very bad_experience but as the booking with literally hours from the intended travel time i had some inconvenience with being issued a booking reference initially which when checked on checkmytrip . com said that booking cancelled .. was in a bit of a hassle till 0 hours_later i received the e_- ticket with different reference_number .
neutral	recently had problems with my broadband and went to talk_talk who are just useless , then went to bt who are just con merchants . went back to sky .
neutral	got offered deals on movies and sports for my return and over the moon with it .
neutral	fibre_optic is available in my area soon with sky so happy to stay .
neutral	my broadband issues this time were sorted very quickly .
neutral	maybe luck of the draw with the operator but he was very good and understood and listened to what i had to say .
neutral	first bought a pc from pcspecialist in 0000 which is still working 0 years later .
neutral	great if you want a pc without an os and useless bundled software .
neutral	website clearly shows options for customisatuion .
neutral	faulty parts were exchanged quickly ( without too much hassle ).
neutral	my only reason for not giving more stars is their after - sales support .
neutral	an example of why : when they replaced faulty ram ( under lifetime guarantee ) for me they sent no instructions to return faulty parts and no courier return bag .
neutral	several months later they emailed me demanding the faulty ram back .
neutral	i explained they had never requested a return but this was ignored by support .
neutral	luckily i had kept the old ram and returned it but if i hadn ' t i would have paid for their mistake !
neutral	i would still recommend for anyone_looking for a custom_built_pc but with a warning not to expect much helpful after - sales customer support .
neutral	i really like the design of sky_vegas , its funky and modern with some really cool games available .
neutral	registering takes a bit of time but its not too bad compared to other_sites i have played at .
neutral	i got my free £_00 , ( well £_00 bonus cash !)
neutral	and got stuck into the slots .
neutral	i had a problem depositing a couple of weeks_ago so contacted support , they couldn ' t tell me if my deposit went through or not which was a bit worrying and it took a while for them to get back to me .
neutral	other than that it was fine playing at sky_vegas , there are much worse operators to play at .
neutral	would have given 0_stars if it wasn ' t for the slow support .
neutral	i love firebox , and would probably spend all my money there if i didn ' t need to eat , or pay a mortgage .
neutral	however , they use citylink as their courier , and as a result there is always a very real risk that anything i order will turn_up late , broken or not at all .
neutral	if they changed this one aspect of their business , it would be 0_stars all the way !
neutral	i originally left a 0 star_review for just_eat after the complete pig ' s ear they made of my first order , but i decided to give them another chance after they sent me a promo voucher and ordering from my local takeaway worked out cheaper because of the discount .
neutral	the meal turned_up on time and there we no_hassles .
neutral	maybe i was just unlucky first time round , and maybe they ' ve sorted some of their technical problems .
neutral	i hope so , because it ' s a really good idea for a site if it works like it ' s supposed to !
neutral	they did not send complimentary gifts what they boast about while charging for shipping .
neutral	i found other_sites with exact_same price and free shipping , but i liked the complimentary gifts they were boasting about , so went with them , and my product was very light .
neutral	shipping rate was rip_off for me !
neutral	i have recently_purchased a 00 month web_design course which was £_00 . 00 from which i received a £ 0 credit onto my account from my email , i went through my purchase and my £ 0 credit was not honoured .
neutral	emailed the company a week_ago and still no reply ?
neutral	all i got was an_automated_response .
neutral	nothing since .
neutral	voucher_code : q0000e - 0pfhhq
neutral	disappointing start to the purchase .
neutral	fast acceptance and guidance on creating the logos and where there was an issue swiftly resolved .
neutral	delivered on time however forgot the logo on the arm so had to return to be completed
neutral	good customer_service but low quality items ..
neutral	the shop has very good prices for the games and products but the shopping process is a little_bit weird .
neutral	i tried to use my work address for the delivery and it was impossible .
neutral	i could not change my card address from paypal after i payed .
neutral	unfortunately i think this is basic , the possibility of change my address ( for billing or delivery ) and i will not buy at this shop until they change it .
neutral	on the other side they were extremely fast and i had my videogame in less_than one day .
neutral	the quality of your products are very high and there are no negatives with this aspect .
neutral	however i feel that the sizes need to be more covered or specific as i bought a small ( 0 - 00 ) i found that it was more suited for a size 00 woman rather_than me a size 0 , perhaps adding more costumes with availability sizes of 0 - 0 would encourage me to shop here more and be fully_satisfied with your service .
neutral	:)
neutral	i used to be a huge ocado fan - compared to previous experiences with grocers their items were on stock and they delivered on time in one hour windows .
neutral	fine , their produce is inferior generally to many others and they can be pricier , their customer_service is excellent .
neutral	the last month , however , my weekly delivery has ranged from 0 - 0 hours late and no one seems ultimately accountable despite many apologies .
neutral	they are not reliable anymore and i am back to looking to others .
neutral	their supply chain seems a mess and needs sorting asap .
neutral	can you please explain the logistics of how your deliveries are organised .
neutral	we have received a parcel this morning consignment 0000000000 on a before 0pm service , the other 0 consignments are on the same delivery van but on a next_day service and unable to be delivered at the same time as the before 0pm parcel .
neutral	can you please explain how this is economically justifiable on cost , enviroment pollution , time etc in my opinion this put tremedous pressure on all your delivery drivers for no fault of theirs and escualtes the cost of using your service to your customers , resulting in a very unhappy customer .
neutral	i await your explanation in reply .
neutral	i have ordered from annsummers a number of times .
neutral	the delivery has always been on time , i have never had missing products and i haven ' t had a problem with the quality .
neutral	however they are virtually impossible to contact if you have a problem .
neutral	the phones are always busy , and they never reply to emails .
neutral	i needed to return an item , but didn ' t have my delivery note as i had already returned an item from that order .
neutral	they say to email if this is the case , but they never replied and i didn ' t want to risk sending back the item without the note .
neutral	even returns when you have the delivery note are very slow , and they don ' t actually tell you when they have refunded you .
neutral	probably closer to 0 . 0_stars but i cant give this !
neutral	my experience certainly hasnt been as bad as most on here but it wasnt great .
neutral	no text as promised the day before to inform me of time_slot so had to log on internet to get given this after 0pm the night before .
neutral	it did arrive well within the time_slot , but the delivery men dumped the fridge_freezer i the kitchen then left , i then registered they had left the appliance fully packaged when the website clearly_states every delivery will be unpacked and the packaging taken away .
neutral	so instead of two men taking 0 mins to do it , i then had to stuggle on my own with a large fridge_freezer to try to remove all the packging including underneath which was not fun and am now left with a pile of plastic and polystyrene in my car as our local tip only opens for 0 days .
neutral	not terrible but not the service described and a big inconvenience to me .
neutral	have emailed to complain but not holding out on reply judging_by the reviews below .
neutral	i love the bargain essie and opi nail_polishes i ordered ....
neutral	some were for gifts but i wanted to keep them all myself !!
neutral	although , for the price , i might order more !
neutral	my only issue with fragrance_direct is the poor packaging !
neutral	0 nails polishes were just thrown in a box together with a bit of padding .
neutral	i was lucky none of the smashed .
neutral	glass_bottles not individually wrapped in bubble_wrap ?!
neutral	risky !!
neutral	oh , and no ' hazardous ' sticker on the package which is now compulsory when posting nail_polish meaning the package was as risk of being destroyed !
neutral	and , 0 polishes in 0 package when the limit is now 0 per package !
neutral	amazing bargains fd , but please sort out your packaging !
neutral	bought 0 calculators for a great price , however , was told delivery would be 0 days , after about 0 days i contacted them and was told that my items were back ordered and they didn ' t know when they would arrive .
neutral	i tried to call customer_service , but was put through to voicemail and the voicemail was full .
neutral	eventually i received my calculators , about 0 - 0 weeks_later .
neutral	i was offered a very small compensation for the delay , however wasn ' t really enough to compensate for the huge inconvenience as i needed the calculators for when class started .
neutral	colin
neutral	i am on my 0rd tescos delivery , 0st - perfect , 0nd - ok , 0rd - awful !
neutral	they forgot my frozen items then wanted me to go through each item to have them deleted and refunded (£_000 food order !!)
neutral	eventually they gave me a £_00 voucher and refunded my delivery ......
neutral	cheery delivery men though so that ' s nice !
neutral	i booked my mot online and it was really quick and easy .
neutral	the coffee is nice , however i think the coffee is colder than a nespresso coffee as the pod is plastic it does not conduct heat .
neutral	also by the time i paid for delivery my order was about £ 0 cheaper for 00 coffees from fine coffee club , than if i had gone to the nespresso shop - not a great saving .
neutral	excellent tasting coffee though .
neutral	since my last review ( see below ) i have contacted the one . com support_team ( specifically a lady_called stéphanie ) who was extremely_helpful in understanding the situation and offering a extremely reasonable mid - ground by cutting the additional_charges that added onto my bill and charging me the correct amount for an additional years subscription ( what i wont be using as have cancelled my account but i understand that i was a fault for not checking my account had successfully been cancelled , so was happy to pay for ).
neutral	so overall i have re - evaluated my overall experience to 0 / 0 starts , however i would like to point out that the customer_service i received from the social_media and customer care coordinators where second to none and would give then 0 / 0 if based only dealing_with them .
neutral	it is a shame that this quality of staff doesn ' t seem to run throughout one . com other communication channels .
neutral	yet again my thanks to stéphanie for being so professional & efficient in her response .
neutral	this was my previous review :
neutral	i didn ' t actually use my account at all , got a email requesting to cancel or my account would renew .
neutral	following this i proceeded to send them a letter ( oldschool i know ) as couldn ' t get to a operator through their phone line and i am not one to wait for a hour ( as per their instructions - i had just moved_house and had no internet to do it online sadly ).
neutral	assumed it had sort itself out as had no further contact from them until around 0 and half months later where they had passed on my ' debt ' and charged me over 000_% of the original value .
neutral	when i contacted them to explain the situation this is as much of a answer they would give me ' the account has been forwarded to intrum there is nothing we can do anymore .'.
neutral	not really my idea of customer_service if i may say so myself .
neutral	i normally use hostelworld but the hostel i was accessing the internet at redirected to hostelbookers .
neutral	it was my first experience with hostelbookers and it was nice not to have to pay a booking_fee ( on top of the 00_% reservation fee that both sites take ).
neutral	that said , i felt the search features on hostelbookers were lacking compared to the competition .
neutral	for example , after searching for availability ( which includes the number of people ), prices show up in the rankings based on the cheapest private_room regardless of the number of people per room .
neutral	there ' s apparently no way to sort by the price of , say , a private double room across all hostels that provide it .
neutral	also , while booking i was required to provide a phone number -- i rarely have a phone available while travelling .
neutral	additionally , there is no place to add a note or check - in time to the booking , which guest houses generally appreciate knowing .
neutral	overall , the experience is geared towards individuals or large groups staying in dorms , but loses to the competition when it comes to guest houses and b_& bs .
neutral	i ' d love to have a ( fee - free !)
neutral	alternative to hostelworld , and i hope hostelbookers can achieve that soon .
neutral	products are well_priced and are often good in quality .
neutral	however customer_service i have received is not very high , especially in store .
neutral	catering for the low end customer , own branded goods are low quality .
neutral	they do not reqard loyalty .
neutral	fuel at their filling stations is always good value .
neutral	wide_range of products , fair prices .
neutral	they may not always be the cheapest though their offers are fantastic alongside range and availablility .
neutral	they have a good return_policy and the business_model was the 0st of it ' s kind .
neutral	saw driver waiting outside my house for 00_minutes or so sitting in the car asleep , when he got out of the van , walked around a little , then drove off ?
neutral	this was strange to me , so i tracked my parcel via their website and it said no one was in to sign for package ?
neutral	i waited in all day for this .
neutral	i still_haven ' t received it .
neutral	so when i discovered this site i thought it was great , which normally it is .
neutral	great value for some nice items .
neutral	however recently i wanted two handbags and i put them in my basket whilst i looked for a pair of shoes ( makes_sense to order everything at once ).
neutral	went back to my basket about 0 / 0mins later and my bags had been sold to someone_else it seems !
neutral	there should be a time limit to how long you can keep items in your basket yes , but they don ' t have once they just disappear .
neutral	there needs to be a warning that either a ) you cannot keep items in your basket for any amount of time and there is no guarantee that they won ' t be sold to someone_else or b ) you have 0mins to pick other items before they put your item back up for sale .
neutral	this hiccup leaves many people disappointed as the facebook_page will show you .
neutral	so in conclusion yes i have bought some great things with everything0pounds . com but they ' re basket policy ( or lack of ) isn ' t impressive at all .
neutral	i have never had problems with buying from topshop . com before but i was slightly disappointed with my last purchase .
neutral	i had bought a shirt along with a £_00 camisole to go underneath .
neutral	the main_reason i made this purchase was because it was free delivery when spending over £_00 .
neutral	a few_days_later i received an_email_saying the cami was out of stock so they had refunded me for it .
neutral	this was a little annoying as i bought it to wear under the shirt .
neutral	i would have preferred it if they had contacted me about , offering an_alternative or offered to cancel my order ( like the company i work for do ) this now means i would have to make another order to get a cami , but i aren ' t going to do this as i would not get free delivery .
neutral	a little disappointing from topshop ....
neutral	overall it was a good experience the hotel provided was ok was very clean but is in need of some moderinsation .
neutral	activities booked were great especailly the spa and the caterman , the vip bar experience wasnt worth it as it was in linkears ... not very vip if you ask me !
neutral	got more information and advice out of a book and people than i did out of chilisauce .
neutral	go compare is a fantastic tool to find quotes from dozens of different insurers .
neutral	but , when viewing prices after entering your details a prominent message is displayed stating that your quote will not be cheaper by going directly to the insurer .... got my suspicions raised straight_away , so i went direct to admiral and guess_what , almost £_00 cheaper !
neutral	use it as a comparison engine only , buy directly from the insurer !
neutral	the whole reason i joined topcashback rather_than [_external reference_] was their promise to pay cashback quickly .
neutral	i spent quite a bit of money via tcb over the christmas_period , and guess_what ... my cashback is only just being paid to me now 0 months later , with some of it still outstanding .
neutral	it ' s a great idea and it ' s nice to get money back on my transactions etc .
neutral	so i can ' t complain too much - but why make a statement that you have no_intention of sticking to ?
neutral	postage etc was fine but i was disappointed with the poor quality of clothing .
neutral	i guess i should have known though with the price i paid ( very cheap ).
neutral	your products and prices are top_notch but your shipping is very unreliable .
neutral	i ' ve ordered from you numerous_times and everytime the amount of time it takes to get to my house is different .
neutral	sometimes i ' l get it next_day other times i ' m waiting a full week to get my product .
neutral	which makes no sense as i ' m 00_minutes away from both of your warehouses .
neutral	everything is average including customer_service
neutral	i could not work out how to change number of nights using ipad app of booking . com , however using the full site was straightforward .
neutral	decent site , well_laid_out but can be pricey compared to other online etailers .
neutral	delivery times are poor .
neutral	good service but the charges are very high .
neutral	started great but recently getting a little to " business " ads popping up everywhere , asking for more data and forcing changes instead of giving options .
neutral	time to abandon ship ?
neutral	lots of expensive fees if your a seller
neutral	otherwise alright to buy through
neutral	i ordered from bedzrus . co . uk as their price was significantly_lower_than anywhere_else online .
neutral	even one online store with a price_match guarantee wouldn ' t match the bedzrus price as they said it was below their wholesale price !
neutral	they were easily contactable by phone , and polite when i phoned a couple of times with enquiries .
neutral	unfortunately i was let_down by a poor delivery service .
neutral	i ordered the bed a week in_advance , and received an_email the day before delivery to confirm dispatch .
neutral	the next_day i received a call from the manufacturer ( not bedzrus ) to say my item wouldn ' t be dispatched and i ' d have to arrange a re - delivery for the next morning .
neutral	the bed didn ' t arrive that next morning , so i phoned the manufacturer who gave me the item tracking_number to follow_up with the courier myself .
neutral	the courier couldn ' t tell me when it would be delivered , but said it would be that day .
neutral	the bed arrived late in the afternoon .
neutral	be aware that they ask you to sign for thse goods as " damaged " if you can ' t fully check them upon delivery .
neutral	the courier wouldn ' t allow me to do this , and instead told me to sign as " unchecked ", which bedzrus advise not to do as it will make returns difficult .
neutral	i might use bedzrus again if their price is good , but i would prefer to use a more reliable retailer , especially with their unreliable delivery and signing as " damaged " policy which could be a potential problem if you just signed for the goods without thinking .
neutral	shows like the apprentice are great , but paying chris moyles 000k + a year is a joke , he ' s on radio for one , i ' d rather listen to greg james , so keep hold of him !
neutral	after price comparing i ' d use comet .
neutral	alot cheaper
neutral	my only problem that in my area there is a very small choice .
neutral	customer_service is good , flight prices good its all the extrs that make it pricey .
neutral	re : iiyama prolite xb0000qs - 00 " monitor
neutral	unfortunately i may have had a one off experience with pcbuyit ltd , but it did leave me a little frustrated although i cannot_fault the monitor i bought .
neutral	i was in communication with [_name ] from pcbuyit .
neutral	the facts are :
neutral	0 .
neutral	due to an admin error between the company and fedex service , my address was logged incorrectly in the system .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i had to call to ascertain the location of the product and therefore , flag up the mistake in address .
neutral	0 .
neutral	due to the mistake i was offered a refund on the delivery charge .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was guaranteed delivery on the second day .
neutral	the monitor did not arrive on the second day .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was guaranteed delivery in the am of day three .
neutral	the monitor arrived in the evening of day three .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i was encouraged to call fedex which_amounted to time and energy wasted as i could not do anything to progress the order / delivery as i was not the account holder .
neutral	i understand mistakes do happen .
neutral	unfortunately for me , it did mean i had to spend three entire days at home waiting for a product .
neutral	this equated to a further two days off work .
neutral	if you are looking to get your iphone inlocked immediately then it might be betwter to go into a local shop but to get the full unlock in 00 days isnt bad i dont think
neutral	update 00 / 00 /_0000 :
neutral	pre_- pay credit & apology received from parcel0go , i have updated my rating to reflect this .
neutral	original review :
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	courier failed to turn_up for a collection two days in a row .
neutral	both_times no reason given by the online_chat representative when i queried it .
neutral	when i rebooked collection for the second attempt , i asked for the courier to be given my mobile number in case of any_problems .
neutral	i received no contact or an_apology when i queried this second failure .
neutral	the online_chat service is slow and they are very abrupt when dealing_with you .
neutral	i asked for a simple explanation why the courier had not shown up and they could not provide one , they just kept asking me to rebook my collection - pretty pointless .
neutral	won ' t be using again .
neutral	i have a good package with bt but my problem with them is there non eenglish helpers who didn ' t understand a word of me trying to explain my internet was not working . also my internet download_speed is so up and down its never consistant only the upload is lol
neutral	love ebay , good choice but a shame the insertion charges are now so high especially when an item does not sell lol .
neutral	i ' ve been with o0 since i was a child , i ' m now 00 .
neutral	i had never had any_problems with o0 until i recently tried to upgrade my phone .
neutral	without going into too much detail , they basically fudged up the upgrade and made me return the handset and said i had to go through the whole upgrade process again .
neutral	all because of their own misleading sales_team .
neutral	i was left without a phone for almost 0 weeks as things were delayed etc .
neutral	made a complaint and they did actually resolve it well and to my satisfaction .
neutral	will_continue to use o0 ... for now anyway ...!
neutral	:)
neutral	definitely a cheaper alternative to waving the excess with the car_rental company , but it does come with it ' s own problems .
neutral	firstly the cover is with an underwriter , who in my case didn ' t respond to communications until questor contacted them on my behalf .
neutral	the documentation i had to provide was then a major hassle , 0 different documents & photocopies were required .
neutral	it has then taken over a month ( with no communication in between ) to resolve what is a very simple claim , not great really .
neutral	to top it off they are sending a cheque , resulting in a trip to the bank .
neutral	everything was perfect , but i was given an plug adapter that was actually for shavers .
neutral	this adapter was extremely dangerous , i could literally hear it buzz and could see electricity running up and down it , in future , digital_rev really need to look at into their plug adaptors ( chinese to british ).
neutral	someones going to get hurt .
neutral	i ordered a few items online and there was a good selection of products .
neutral	i received delivery the next_day which was great !
neutral	the bow_tie , cuff & stud set , cummerbund were all of good quality .
neutral	i liked the dress - shirt the most and the prices were quite affordable .
neutral	the only problem i had was with the braces which had one clip ( at the back ) which was not working .
neutral	i called customer_service and they were really helpful and offered to replace it straight_away , however i asked for refund which they promised will be dealt_with soon .
neutral	although the online ordering was convenient , i never got the product delivered for over a week !
neutral	the delivery option said it would be delivered in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	a bit disappointed with that , but the product itself was good and resolved my problem .
neutral	the company has one of the best reviews so far but still need to work on areas like delivery and changing prices .
neutral	i ordered the new sony_xperia ray and was expecting a worldwide launch sometime in september .
neutral	i was told the item was in stock so i expected a fairly quick delivery but it took the maximum 0 days to get to me .
neutral	the price of the phone was cheap already ( out of all the sites i checked ) but i was disappointed when they dropped the price by a further £_00 - not cool .
neutral	all in all i will consider ordering again from them in the future but they need to work on the areas i have mentioned
neutral	i haven ' t research about this company until i ordered the fuji finepix s000exr camera .
neutral	i ordered on 00th of december , understandable holiday and busy_period , but nowadays if company want to trade in real_life the holiday is not excuses !!
neutral	waited until 00th of december ( i want to point that the holiday period is over ) and started to email them , had reply within 0 days without any dates of delivery , tried to contact via phone - the queue system is rubbish waited over 00_minutes impossible to get through !
neutral	after that i found on the internet vanessa carroll email address and only through her managed to get the item delivered as i wanted to cancel order and at the same time filed the non - receipt complain to paypal , finally today 0 / 00 /_0000 i had my item delivered .
neutral	short story and my reviews is :
neutral	if you already purchased from them , don ' t contact normal way as they reply very slow and without any useful_information , better to contact vanessa carroll to get your item delivered .
neutral	customer_service - 0_stars service
neutral	vanessa carroll help - 0_stars service
neutral	prices - 0_stars
neutral	delivery service - 0_stars service
neutral	useful contact information for everyone :
neutral	vanessa carroll ( customer_service manager ) - vanessa @ simplyelectronics . net

neutral	the service offered is reliable and prompt .
neutral	i booked a lot flight to amsterdam , but after the confirmation of bank_transfer , no booking confirmation was received .
neutral	generally , the website works well but the bookings do not go flawless in all cases .
neutral	well i ordered a few bits last saturday in hope of having them by the following weekend .
neutral	it took until wednesday for a representative to get back to me regarding one of the items being out of stock , and that if i was willing to go for the alternative option i could have it within_00hours which was absolutely fine by me as that would be friday .
neutral	so after emailing back the same day , friday came around with no mention from the representative and no change of status in my orders on their site .
neutral	i decided to give them a call on friday to discover my email was sadly ignored as it was in their spam_folder , so no order a week on .
neutral	they were perfectly nice on the phone , and i was dealt_with in a professional_manner , but my experience wasn ' t the best or speediest .
neutral	i ' m not writing them off as a company , but if i can get what i ' m after down screwfix or one of my other favoured online_retailers then i will .
neutral	only a decent price will bring me back , and only if i ' m in no hurry to receive it .
neutral	right off to screwfix i go to get the item i was after !
neutral	used for a car i am looking to buy , found the website a litte confusing but most_importantly found that the insurance was more_expensive than what i have been offered by my current insurer .
neutral	then went to another provider and saved £_00 .
neutral	i used to use ebay all the time and order everything from there but nowadays i can ' t trust the sellers .
neutral	i have been scammed a few_times when both trying to buy and sell on ebay , it ' s just too much hassle for what it ' s worth now .
neutral	although i do still search through ebay now and then , i won ' t be using it half as much as i used to .
neutral	i much prefer amazon .
neutral	can i just add i have how the reviewing system is on ebay , all the sellers wait untill they receive feedback from you so they can decide wether or not to give you positive or negative_feedback depending_on the feedback you have left them .
neutral	which is wrong , if you are buying from a seller then they are meant to leave_feedback for you first and then once your item has came then you leave_feedback for them .
neutral	it just dooesn ' t work like that on there , it ' s not professional at all .
neutral	use with caution
neutral	expensive , but good service
neutral	apart_from that all of the rest is good , but if you have been waiting quite long queuing to leave them your big luggage , and everything else , you do need a little meal
neutral	it is not very cheap , but the quality is pretty good , sometimes , they need more options to offer to the customer
neutral	about 0 month_ago me and my boyfriend went in to maplin , we were buying things to use on games consoles we had managed to rally up around £_00 worth of items in about 00_minutes we only had 0 items .
neutral	one of which was a game console opening kit which normally retailed at £_00 . 00 but was on offer for £_00 , which we thought was a bit much when there were similar products on the market a lot cheaper .
neutral	as we went to pay for the item .
neutral	i spotted a smaller kit for £ 0 . 00 , £_00 cheaper .
neutral	but according to the customer sales_advisor " it doesn ' t have the correct sizes that you need " but sure enough after we had purchased the items .
neutral	and had a closer look at the incredibly cheaper kit , it had the correct sizes .
neutral	very bad customer_service he just wanted the bigger sale .
neutral	items in the store are good but there sales is very bad .
neutral	this is a good company and fast service , but compared to [_external reference_] i don ' t think the layout is as good .
neutral	the website is a great idea keep intouch with friends and family but the website is too well_known for its drama , bulling and jeremy kyle .
neutral	snow and rock stores have a good range of products at reasonable prices , but i recommend getting product advice and fitting elsewhere .
neutral	the staff i ' ve dealt_with seem quite elitist and patronising - making you feel pretty darn stupid if you ' re anything but an expert at your sport .
neutral	i was told by a boot fitter at the birmingham branch that i didn ' t know what i was on about ( when i said so far i ' ve strugged to find an adult ski boot that ' s comfortable ) so that whatever boot i bought wouldn ' t be up to me .
neutral	he outright said that i ' m not allowed to buy whatever i want and i ' ll have to buy what he says , and it ' s gonna be at_least £_000 ( the expensive end of their range ) before i ' d even tried anything on .
neutral	so yeah bad_experiences when wanting advice .. so go elsewhere for that and fitting , and just buy at snow and rock if the price is good .
neutral	not quite what i expected , but it ' s high_quality .
neutral	when i ' ve bought ' acrylic ' photos before , the photo is actually in the acrylic - so the image is transparent ish .
neutral	this was not that , so i felt a little disappointed .
neutral	however the item is high_quality and the picture still looks great .
neutral	i ' ve made many orders with ebuyer , they offer good prices on office furniture and okay shipping times .
neutral	but when something_goes_wrong , they are awful , slow , uncommunicative and disorganised .
neutral	i bought 0 cabinets which arrived on the 00nd april , one was damaged .
neutral	i ring up ( 00p a minute !)
neutral	and am asked to send photos .
neutral	i send photos on the morning of the 00rd , but they say they ' ve got no notes of me contacting them until the 00th !
neutral	ebuyer still_haven ' t " investigated " and still won ' t arrange a collection of the damaged cabinet and deliver a replacement .
neutral	i spent 00_minutes on hold today , and similar times daily ringing up trying to get this sorted .
neutral	what is there to investigate ?
neutral	why are the notes on this wrong , or am i just being fobbed_off ?
neutral	please can someone get this sorted and send out a replacement , it ' s been nearly a week now .
neutral	i use tesco to shop online and they are ok .
neutral	they occasionally mess things up but the call_centre guys always sort it out .
neutral	i ahve tried the others but none really stand out so i stick with tesco
neutral	they are joke !.... ordered £_000 lense two_weeks_ago and still_waiting , no update or nothing !.
neutral	cant even get hold of them on the phone ..... lines always busy .
neutral	update_: sent the an_email with complaint , reply was pretty quick , i was re - assured that item is about to be despatched , next_day i received an_email_saying that it has been despatched and to my surprise it was delivered same day .
neutral	well_packed and sealed , so im pleased with it .
neutral	will i buy from them again and wait another 0 weeks for delivery ?.... i doubt it .
neutral	up to date with fashion for men / women wear always : 0 )
neutral	site is easy to navigate and the selection of cloths is really good !
neutral	price range can vary a lot but everything ive gotten from here has been really nice !
neutral	i ' ve ordered from topshop no end of times and can_honestly say that i ' ve never been impressed .
neutral	the clothing is fairly expensive for something that is usually of average design and / or quality .
neutral	the website is easy to use but a little_bit too minimalist .
neutral	the delivery charge is pretty ridiculous for such a large company / brand .
neutral	delivery itself is average , bordering on slow .
neutral	returns aren ' t simple ( as you have to log in and request a return number ) and refunds take a while to clear .
neutral	i ' ve often taken returns back to store for a refund or even an exchange but it has always been a hassle .
neutral	tried 0 different stores and the staff in all 0 have usually been unhelpful .
neutral	overall i much prefer to shop elsewhere and only buy items from topshop occasionally .
neutral	i ' ve ordered from look fantastic twice now , both_times i ' ve been a bit suspicious .
neutral	my first order arrived fairly quickly and was the most impressive of the two .
neutral	but the second ( from last_week ) was terrible .
neutral	firstly the two items i ordered were wrapped in one thin sheet of paper , with no invoice / dispatch note / pick note ( same as the first ) and held together by one thin piece of clear tape which was actually open at one end !
neutral	the items themselves were also very dirty .
neutral	the finishing spray i ordered had a thick ring of muck around the lid and when sprayed felt as though it had already been tried .
neutral	another thing that strikes me questionable is on the back of the paul mitchell products it reads : " guaranteed only when sold by professional hairdresser , otherwise it may be counterfeit , black market , old or tampered with ."
neutral	not sure what to make of that .
neutral	the item i ordered came in reasonable time and was in suitable condition .
neutral	however , my mistake was in not realising how expensive the delivery was , adding more_than 00_% to the item price .
neutral	seemed a bit_steep to add more_than £ 0 to deliver a set of strings .
neutral	i live in a glasgow postcode so there wasn ' t a great distance for the item to travel from the glasgow store .
neutral	i ' ve bought small items like this online from a store in rep . of ireland and postage was only £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i ordrered the strings from guitarguitar for convenience but reckon i ' ll just buy in - store , in future or use different suppliers online .
neutral	jambo pallets used to be good from here .
neutral	ive no_idea what theyre like now ,
neutral	so i ordered about 00 days ago and received a couple of my items to day , already from 0 different delivery people and with products still to come .
neutral	i wouldnt mind but its common curtosy if delivery is more_than 0 working_days to email and explain_why delivery will take longer .
neutral	i ordered bed wedges so had to be home for their delivery so with no_idea of delivery spent pointless days home waiting for delivery .
neutral	i emailed and got a reply saying they would check dispatch date and email back but they never did .
neutral	but atleast i suppose was reasonable value
neutral	my order was progressing very well as the site was easy to use and i got a lot of email feedback about my orders progress .
neutral	however , after waiting ten_days and not receiving my package i checked with the courier who said it had been delivered to a letterbox .
neutral	we do not have a letterbox and the package would have been far too big for any letterbox i have ever_seen .
neutral	i rang chemist_direct and after some back and forth they decided it would be easier to send my order again .
neutral	this time the courier routed the package incorrectly and it took a further ten_days to arrive .
neutral	good company , really poor choice of courier .
neutral	mse could be potentially the best advice site in the uk although sometimes it is let_down by the freshness of the information they provide .
neutral	the forums are a great back up to the sometimes awesome advice but a little_bit more freshness would go a long way .
neutral	contacted swift when i woke to one of the tyres on my range rover had suffered a puncture .
neutral	didn ' t want to wait around for three days for kwikfit to pull their finger out so checked out some 00 hour small companies that specialise in coming along and fitting a tire quickly .
neutral	was told my particular tires were hard to come by quickly ( by all companies ) but that swift would return my call in the morning .
neutral	they didn ' t and i had to chase it up .
neutral	i got an_email from ross jackson , the operations manager explaining he could call the supplier in half an_hour and check and that he would get back to me .
neutral	i gave him my housemate ' s number to organise as i would be at work .
neutral	my housemate didn ' t get a call and had to chase up again .
neutral	eventually swift said they had found a tire and would be there before 00 .
neutral	they didn ' t show .
neutral	then it was " before 0 ."
neutral	no show .
neutral	then it was " oh we meant after 0 .."
neutral	a full 0 hours after they said they ' d first turn_up , they did .
neutral	they did a reasonable job and the price was fairly competitive .
neutral	( one company quoted £_000 , which i told them to shove up their ..)
neutral	if you can get kwikfit out ' kwik ,' do so .
neutral	otherwise , prepare to be messed about .
neutral	( to their credit , they were priced better_than some of the other 00 hour companies - and over half of those failed to return any calls at all .)
neutral	after visiting the store in romford have to admit the staff werent very helpful
neutral	ordered some makeup which came okay , not the quickest but that ' s fine for the price .
neutral	i do however hate that they try their best to get you to sign_up for a credit_card , i almost did by_accident .
neutral	it seems very pushy , they really try to take your money .
neutral	i have made complaints to tesco about various isues they used to be good but think they just bin them .
neutral	i will still shop with them as they offer some grest deals just dont like being ignored .
neutral	as a shop , pretty good in general - staff on the shop floor are friendly and helpful .
neutral	a little overpriced but craft stuff often is .
neutral	rubbish and overpriced for knitting stuff despite having a large_selection .
neutral	opinion of company not so strong after they decided to use my friend lauren o ' farrell ' s copyrighted images without permission .
neutral	it makes me wonder about their business principles given that big companies rarely rip_off small artists only once .
neutral	we had a brilliant hen_weekend for my sister .
neutral	i found all of the suppliers that hen_heaven deals with to be great .
neutral	we travelled to bournemouth on 0th sept .
neutral	i found that hen_heaven themselves are a little cagey about what is and isn ' t included with certain activities .
neutral	for example they did not make it clear that we would have to pay for entry to lola lo ' s bar ( we got a discount on the entry fee ).
neutral	there were 00 of us and i would have thought that entry would have been included and if it wasn ' t , we would have been told .
neutral	we were also advised that we could chose the music to do our girl band experience to , but this was not the case so we dressed the hen as a spice girl and we all had matching masks , but found out later that we had to use the music that they provided .
neutral	( not a big problem , but if we had known from day one we would have dressed the hen according to the music provided ).
neutral	finally , it was not made clear that our pary bus would be shared experience .
neutral	again , it turned_out not to be a problem as the other hen & stag parties on the bus with us were great fun .
neutral	as i said we all had an amazing weekend and this in no way ruined it but i feel that hen_heaven should be much more transparent then they are .
neutral	again the rating is based on hen_heaven and not the suppliers they use - they were all fantastic .
neutral	my jeff banks glasses are great .
neutral	unfortunately , the element glasses aren ' t quite as good ( i ' m putting this down to the materials they use ).
neutral	it ' s not that bad that i ' m sending them back - it would just have been nice if they ' d both been spot on .
neutral	i will use the site again , i ' ll just order jeff banks frames .
neutral	i did have to chase delivery as well so i ' ve knocked another star off for that .
neutral	i pre_- ordered diablo iii over the weekend and never received the product i paid for on the 00th as promised by a member of their staff making announcements on facebook .
neutral	my order has been marked as ' partially shipped ' for a few_days now .
neutral	on tuesday_evening cjs announced on facebook at 00 : 00 , a promise to send out diablo iii product keys to all customers experiencing ' partially shipped ' at 00pm , within the next two hours .
neutral	i did not receive the key during that two hour period , another let_down .
neutral	they instead sent me a guest pass key .
neutral	i am not interested in a guest pass that would have come with the game anyway - if bought elsewhere .
neutral	but after a few_days and frequent posting on facebook for the slightest acknowledgement of my order they eventually managed to outsource enough copies to cover my order at_least , which was made last weekend .
neutral	order_# 00000 - fulfilled .
neutral	the experience to be learned for this is to buy from a reputable retail outlet or from the publisher / developer of a product on launches .
neutral	i have ordered from ocado several_times and over time the prices seem to have been going up .
neutral	delivery charges are now between £ 0 and £ 0 and this seems like far too much to spend on having my shopping delivered .
neutral	i have recently_moved to tesco online delivery and find that they offer the same quality of product , cheaper delivery charges and overall the quantity of food i can get for the same money is double that which i would get from ocado .
neutral	ordered lord of the rings extended trilogy on blu - ray .
neutral	good price and fast service , but had the item delivered to my parents as it was a gift , and they informed me that the package was just left on the doorstep for anyone to steal !
neutral	luckily , they live in a quiet village , but if that had happened at my house , i am certain that it would have been stolen !
neutral	so overall , good fast service , poor courier
neutral	it ' s taking ages for processing and paymen my ref no is 0000000 but free service is great
neutral	det ar megabra .
neutral	i received very average service when i ordered from kandco .
neutral	the item took a long time to arrive which wasn ' t a problem but the delivery drivers were useless .
neutral	the item was large and difficult to maneuver yet they left it in the hall and made no offer to help me get it into the room i wanted .
neutral	in fact they didn ' t really speak to me at all .
neutral	i have ordered from missguided quite a few_times and only noticed all these negative_reviews when i had my first bad_experience of the site the other day .
neutral	i thought i would give another side to all the rants as the reviews expressed are probably a bit one sided - people tend to comment only when they have a problem , not when everything goes_smoothly .
neutral	so anyway i thought i would set out some of the pros and cons of my experiences below ...
neutral	next_day delivery
neutral	so generally missguided is super cheap and has a massive_range of clothes .
neutral	they also regularly offer free delivery and have deals going on .
neutral	i think you have to take the ' next_day delivery ' offers with a pinch of salt ...
neutral	they do not always deliver to it , which i agree they should .
neutral	it would be seriously annoying if you needed a dress or something for the next_day and it just didn ' t arrive .
neutral	however i never rely_on this because i dont think next_day delivery can ever be guaranteed .
neutral	i have experienced problems with so many websites that promise next_day delivery .
neutral	the fact of the matter is that as soon as they offer the deal they get thousands of orders and they just don ' t have the capacity to cope ( obviously they shouldn ' t be offering next_day delivery if they can ' t comply but who_knows_how many issues they will come_across - maybe 00_% of people who order do get it the next_day ).
neutral	website
neutral	the website is terrible i have to say .
neutral	it crashes and i have had so many problems with things saying they are in stock and then they won ' t go into your basket .
neutral	i think the focus of this company is quantity of purchases - it doesn ' t seem like they have invested much in their website .
neutral	payment
neutral	my first real issue with missguided was last_week when i went to buy 0 blouses and it said the transaction had timed out .
neutral	i therefore went through the process again and of course ended_up being double_charged .
neutral	i was really annoyed about this , especially so close to christmas but i just bombarded them with messages ( theres no customer care number ) - its worth_noting i didn ' t just use their customer care help box , i emailed them directly at ' customerhelp @ missguided . co . uk ' they are only open monday - fridays , normal working hours so don ' t expect a reply very quickly but i did get a reply within a couple of days and the money was instantly refunded .
neutral	i checked my account and it went in the day they had emailed .
neutral	conclusion
neutral	i think missguided can be a handy website to use but you have to approach it cautiously / sensibly - do not order from it if you have to have the item delivered within a certain time - frame and if you have a problem make_sure you are proactive and follow it up and they will respond .
neutral	( btw threatening to contact trading_standards always helps ).
neutral	it seems like a lot of people have had terrible experiences but for me the majority of my orders have come super - quickly and the products have been great .
neutral	i was never made aware that it could be delivered between 0 am and 0pm .
neutral	i did it all on the mobile n it wasn ' t till i had to use the full site as they were not delivered yet .
neutral	shout be more clear on all ways you can order them .
neutral	amazon is a good place to buy new items , but if your looking for bargains , they dont beat [_external link_removed_], their selling process for sellers is much harder and worse than [_external link_removed ].
neutral	but for books i recommend amazon .
neutral	if you have all the time in the world , i ' d definitely_recommend this .
neutral	but you could also do without it during busy_periods as the queues for a lot of the places are ridiculous and so you ' re only limited to a certain number of places to see .
neutral	we bought a 00 ' x 0 ' sheriff overlap garden shed from elbec garden buildings .
neutral	it was on offer and therefore a good price when compared to other_sites .
neutral	elbec called me and we arranged a delivery date .
neutral	as there were no " set " delivery times , it could arrive anytime , i specifically asked for a call prior to delivery to ensure someone was in .
neutral	the shed arrived early in the day but i had no call , so it was lucky my wife was in .
neutral	the driver unloaded the shed , only to find that one of the elbec ' s fork - lifts had pierced one of the shed flooring panels .
neutral	it was unusable .
neutral	i called elbec customer_services and spoke to a very unconcerned member of their customer_service team .
neutral	he was so blasé with his attitude , he was approaching rude .
neutral	he really was not interested in my problem .
neutral	in addition , he said that there were 0 floor panels to our product , my wife was saying there was only 0 .
neutral	he re - checked , then said yes there are only 0 , so his product knowledge was poor .
neutral	i eventually arranged for delivery of the replacement floor panel , which is due in 0 working_days .
neutral	i have had to delay the builder as we need the shed constructed before my garage conversion works commence .
neutral	in summary , im happy with the shed and ' offer price ' from elbec , but they really need to employ customer_service staff with better customer_service skills and take extra care when loading products to be delivered .
neutral	whilst purchasing my laptop online and picking it up in - store , everything was nice and smooth , with the exception of automatically adding anti_- virus software to your checkout basket ( very sneaky , some people might not even notice ), thankfully though it can be removed .
neutral	the laptop itself that i purchased was the following : lenovo z000 , intel ® core ™ i0 - 0000m dual core processor , 00 . 0 " hd screen , microsoft windows 0 00 - bit , 0gb ddr0 ram , 0000gb hdd , dvd rewriter , dedicated gt 000m 0gb graphics , m00k0uk
neutral	now , i paid just over £_000 for it , and i ' m not entirely convinced i ' ve got my moneys_worth .
neutral	one of the keys has fallen_off already and i ' ve had it no_longer_than a month .
neutral	the laptops actual performance however is good , except for the flimsy keys and a not - so - responsive touchpad ...
neutral	i ' d like to know if box offers a service to replace missing keys or rather to apply them back on to the laptop , i still have the key , but i can ' t get it back on myself .
neutral	i have ordered from allfancydress in the past and been really pleased with my order .
neutral	however this time i ordered an army soldiers uniform for a world war 0 day we were having at school .
neutral	the velcro fastening at the front of the jacket was really poor and the partial shirt didn ' t stay in place either due the the useless velcro .
neutral	i spent the day with my coat on and won ' t be wearing this outfit again !!
neutral	!
neutral	booked a place for 0 nights in birmingham and everything went through .
neutral	easy site to use and sign_up with .
neutral	however the place i booked , called me a couple nights later saying they were not able to keep our reservation as its their policy not to accept birmingham post codes .
neutral	so they have to cancel my booking !!
neutral	
neutral	i then had to book somewhere_else to stay .
neutral	booking . com contacted me on the day of the first night stay and asked why i had cancelled my reservation , i advised i hadn ’ t and the apartments didn ’ t accept my reservation because i am from a birmingham post code .
neutral	they then were quite helpful and said the apartments would have to honour our stay as nothing was mentioned on the booking . com website advising of this special policy .
neutral	however it was too_late by now as we had already made reservations elsewhere and the day i had been contacted on was the day i would have been checking in if all went_smoothly .
neutral	so a little late to offer help , however i was still happy that they were bothered and tried to resolve this matter for me .
neutral	the customer_service agent was very helpful .
neutral	pleased with the service even_though we didn ’ t get to stay at our first choice of apartments .
neutral	would use again .
neutral	
neutral	i was working at maplin ' s and they have great customer_services but if you are wanting products cheap avoid them ;)
neutral	i have ordered my products on wednesday and it supossed to have 0 - 0 days delivery it ' s now been 0 and still no sign of anything .
neutral	update_:
neutral	after about 00 days the product got here and so far so good but since it took so long and took some time to get a reply from them i am not sure if i would use again unless they would have had some really really good deals .
neutral	even_though i haven ' t got my product yet i think the company does well with keeping my updated but processing took about a week !
neutral	now it has been finally send and expecting next_day delivery ( finally !)
neutral	i have ordered am item worth over £_000 and it said it will be delivered the next_day .
neutral	well this was not the case it took about two_weeks to get delivered .
neutral	i would say that the company is great apart_from long delivery time .
neutral	they had the item in stock when ordered so it couldn ' t be that they were dependent on delivery to them and then would send it off to me but i have contacted them and not in 00_hours as they say they will reply but after about 00_hours i had e_- mail from them saying that the product has been dispatched today ( it might have been just after my email )...
neutral	the site was easy and straightforward to use and order from , although reviews did alert me that ' morphsuits . co . uk ' would be stamped across the morphsuit back ( which they didn ' t mention on the site ).
neutral	however the unusual my drop box delivery method was confusing and took time and effort to retrieve .
neutral	i wouldn ' t recommend it unless you know where your drop box is and have the small 00_hours in which to collect it ( upon_receipt of an_email while i was at work ).
neutral	further to this i ' m not a large man but a medium size really hurt around my neck and face so couldn ' t wear it ... hoping to order a large in the future .
neutral	i bought a suit during the half price sale and also got my 00_% student_discount on top which was great .
neutral	the package arrived within three days , however , the suit was a little creased from sliding around in the box .
neutral	also , had trouble_finding a suit set that fits as when the jacket fitted the trousers didn ' t .
neutral	had to return a set and turn_up the leg of the set i kept .
neutral	all in all a good website and range of products .
neutral	i decided to spoil myself and my partner with 0 day holiday in oxfordshire .
neutral	i couldn ' t like any hotel that will suit as price and rank .
neutral	so i decided to go with the top_secret hotel which they advertise as :
neutral	check out our top_secret hotels .
neutral	these rates are so low our hotel partners don ' t want to put their names to them ...
neutral	!?!
neutral	?
neutral	you can not see the name of the hotel or where it is till you pay and agree to the ridicules no refund cancellation_policy .
neutral	after i saw the hotel i did my research .
neutral	something rang bells !!
neutral	!
neutral	fine the hotel looked nice but i found out that the same room with breakfast for the same room with 00h cancellation_policy and not only that but £_00 pounds cheaper price .
neutral	and lastminute have the guts to claim that they offer prices so low that the hotel don ' t want to be named .
neutral	they promise a price_match if you find the hotel cheaper .
neutral	i wrote them 0 email .
neutral	responded to one claiming that they can ' t see the print screens of the websites that i had to put in my email .
neutral	not only that but they reminded me that the screen shots needs to be taken at not later than 00h of the making of the booking .
neutral	i got my respond 0 days_later .
neutral	first email was from a very rude and without any manner or are of customer_service rimi bhattacharya .
neutral	she not only said that the screenshot that i send them wasn ' t from the website she wanted to see .
neutral	i did not bloody get it .
neutral	they can just go to the websites and check it .
neutral	after all i think i was so angry that somehow they forwarded my email to the vip team .
neutral	the lovely sue fossett reached the hotel and inquired about the price ...
neutral	they reduced the price and upgraded our room .
neutral	sue was extremely kind and helpful .
neutral	for with i am very happy but they need to sort out their indian team .
neutral	my partner has always joked about my sensitive hearing but it came in handy today .
neutral	the woman delivering knocked on the door so quietly that even our dog who was sitting next to the door didn ' t hear it !
neutral	even_though we have a working door_bell .
neutral	then as i got to the door less_than 00 seconds after she knocked she was walking away .
neutral	i have heard reports of yodel staff stealing deliveries but never thought that it was going to happen to us !
neutral	i find it odd that the person delivering was an elderly woman in normal clothes who was in a normal car and had lost the stylus pen in her car somewhere .
neutral	very unprofessional company
neutral	i was impressed first time .
neutral	i got my order the next_day .
neutral	this time though it is taking 0 days for my order to come ?!?!?
neutral	i am not sure why the difference in time .
neutral	yeah the free_samples are ok but really i am not sure i get enough free_stuff to amount to what shipping_costs .
neutral	i have mixed feelings about this place now .
neutral	this is the second time i have used these_guys , first was great , ordered monday and it came thursday , great but when i order a couple months down the line , it was a different_story .
neutral	i ordered it on 0nd of feb , left it a week , forgot i even ordered it for a week and then emailed them to ask where it was and i got a email_saying it was posted that day .
neutral	so kind of disappointed at the moment but the bands them are great and a nice price .
neutral	i am glad that despite the shocking reviews , my mothers 00th_birthday flowers came just in the nick of time .
neutral	i think they need to dedicate a person or a team of people to deal with customer_relations because whats the point of the extra instructions if you cannot specify a time ?
neutral	why can i not choose a time for delivery ?
neutral	there should be sufficient customer_services , a means of calling the company to query or people dedicated to handling customer queries .
neutral	the flowers were delivered 00_mins before my mum left for work and i would have been infuriated if they had not arrrived on time .
neutral	they didnt look much like the picture so was disappointed .
neutral	what a sorry excuse for deluxe flowers which looked so sparse .
neutral	and the fact that they were delivered in a rubbish brown box , completely takes the shine off of it .
neutral	additionally , i was a bit perturbed when i placed my order but didnt receive any confirmation or notification of my order until 0 days_later .
neutral	i dont know what the point is of that really .
neutral	thankfully , i dont order flowers too much but i wont be using serenata again .
neutral	i found it all a bit haphazard and regular .
neutral	i was with swiftcover for my first few_years of driving as they provided a much lower_price than their competitors .
neutral	luckily i never had to contact them in regards to details changes or accident claims .
neutral	i have heard that actually having to deal with this company in such an event is very difficult .
neutral	not sure if they still advertise that they have no call_centres to save the customer money - but i ' m sure the amount they blow on their terrible ad campaigns more_than makes up for it .
neutral	used to be good and would buy a fair amount from river_island .
neutral	then recently either my tastes dramatically changed or their designers had their eyes removed .
neutral	never had any issue with quality though .
neutral	the product i ordered should have been delivered within a week but was not .
neutral	when i enquired , they notified me and told me the product had not yet been despatched .
neutral	two_weeks_later , i am yet to receive product .
neutral	we don ' t use it that often now , because some info came out to be untrue so we ended_up disappointed on our holiday .
neutral	i had all of the below problems with bravofly ; however i did receive an e_- mail from sofia @ bravofly . com apologising for the way i was treated by the company .
neutral	she also confirmed that they will be refunding all of my money back in to my account that i paid with .
neutral	i was also given a 00 euro voucher as a gesture of goodwill .
neutral	i am just happy i finally got my money back ; the only problem is that flight tickets have increased now due to the delay caused by them .
neutral	if u have a problem , e_- mail sofia , she will help u promptly .
neutral	i booked two flight tickets with bravofly and i got a confirmation e_- mail of different flight details .
neutral	i managed to get a refund for the tickets , in the form of credit ( which would be less_than what i paid ) or in the form of a voucher for the full_amount .
neutral	they sent me the wrong amount by voucher , and then a later voucher making up the amount .
neutral	however the flight i re - booked with them was void .
neutral	when i went to book another flight with them that night , i was restricted to using only one of the vouchers they gave me ; and they tried to charge me 00 pounds for administration fees as_opposed to the 00 pounds i originally paid .
neutral	if they had sent me the correct voucher amount in the first place , i would have managed to get this booking at no extra_cost .
neutral	i have been calling and e_- mailing their offices all day asking for them to combine my two vouchers , so that i wont have to pay an extra 00 £ in total for something that was not my mistake .
neutral	i e_- mailed sofia , and although she responded that the vouchers would be amended , they still have not been .
neutral	while i am sitting here waiting , the prices are constantly going up .
neutral	i don ' t know what else to do , because they keep saying they will call me back and they refuse to pass me on to a manager .
neutral	now i have asked for a complete refund , and i am just being ignored .
neutral	i am waiting for sofia to message me tomorrow , if she doesn ' t i want to form a complaint against the company .
neutral	unfortunately it only has 0 takeaways in my area when just_eat has something like 00 and more .
neutral	i have been interested in trying hungaryhouse but until it gets more takeaways at hu00 , i will be forced to use just_eat .
neutral	i ordered a great pair of persol glasses 0 weeks_ago .
neutral	the customer_services team quickly responded to my request to change the shipping address , however actually letting me know where my order is has been a step too far for them .
neutral	are they in financial trouble !
neutral	?
neutral	i am starting to get worried .
neutral	updated :
neutral	since making my issues vocal smartbuyglasses have reacted .
neutral	i think they should be more open with customers as to how they operate and explain their process .
neutral	the only pain i had was not feeling informed .
neutral	if i had been shown an example of what is involved in getting my glasses i would have felt sooo much_better .
neutral	a simple video explaining what is involved when you order from this company would go a long way ... for example :
neutral	0 .
neutral	we order your frame from the supplier directly .
neutral	we only buy from the official manufacturer and do not hold stock to keep the prices we offer you low .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we are based on hong_kong .
neutral	this means it may take 0 - 0 days for us to get your frames .
neutral	0 .
neutral	once we receive the frames it takes 0 - 0 working_days to do your lenses
neutral	0 .
neutral	shipping is rapid .
neutral	dhl from_hong_kong to watford in 00_hours .
neutral	luckily they look good and i ' m satisfied .
neutral	thanks
neutral	oliver
neutral	i recently_purchased the 0 day only package deal that i have now found put has been 0 day only forever and still is .
neutral	first of all the good points my items did arrive quickly , the projector screen was on decent quality and thats where the good points end now its time for the bad ...
neutral	they sent the wrong projector and it was terrible then they sent out the one i asked for , so i thought until i opened the box and had received another rubbish product and they told me it was exactly the same , no it wasnt it was rubbish .
neutral	here is what i ordered and the quality :
neutral	projector : recieved 0 wrong ones .
neutral	projector screen : decent quality .
neutral	surround_sound : absolutly terrible , there was glue all over it where it looks_like some toddler had stuck it all together .
neutral	spare bulb : sent wrong one and told me it would still work .
neutral	bracket : didnt even look at it .
neutral	i asked them to send a couriour out to pick_up the items and refund my money they rufused stating they do not pay to pick_up items due to them sending out the correct items .
neutral	it cost me £_00 to send the items back but i have now recieved a refund after constantly ringing them , i think they save your number because they do not pick_up the phone , i had to go round our office using different phones for them to answer .
neutral	please do not use this company there products are awful .
neutral	not a bad website better in store though i thought the internet was meant to make life_easier lol
neutral	found everything i needed ( eventually ) so was ok
neutral	they have some awesome products and great prices but the delivery is so unpredictable you can never use it for birthdays or christmas !
neutral	ebay seem to represent buyers pretty well but when i won a pioneer tv cheap and the guy refused to let me buy it ebay couldn ' t do anything about it ....... makes a mockery of the site if you ask me because they didn ' t even ban the guy , but meh !
neutral	then when i sent a cheap item out and the buyer claimed not to have received it i was forced to refund ... but maybe he was genuine i dont know
neutral	we drove from suffolk to be in nottingham for my best friend ' s stag_weekend .
neutral	we surprised him by arranging a dirt - buggy experience , as well as a night in premier_inn in nottingham .
neutral	the first experience we had was incredibly disappointing .
neutral	we had one 00 minute ride on the dirt - buggies , which also happened to be slow and considerably more dull than we expected .
neutral	the woman that lead us around the track was going really slowly , we weren ' t allowed to overtake to add any fun to the trip , and she seemed incredibly bored , disinterested and fairly miserable .
neutral	despite this upset however , we continued with the weekend , and the rest of the trip was great .
neutral	we went to the orange tree , a bar i arrranged a table & cheap ish drinks at , for a few hours where we ate and celebrated .
neutral	the service was great , they were friendly , and it was on the way to oceana , the club we were headed for ...
neutral	... which was also really good fun .
neutral	we ' re not really " clubbing - people " - but there was a karakoe bar downstairs , which we didn ' t expect , and we spent a good few hours here enjoying the comfy chairs & the music ( and the singing ... to a degree !).
neutral	the only down - side to this part of the event , was the price of the drinks (£ 0 for a budweiser !!!)
neutral	- however , it turned_out to be a decent sober end to the party .
neutral	nottingham itself is lively - which makes a change from our home town , and the atmosphere was awesome .
neutral	nottingham ' s a really great place for a stag_weekend , as there are loads of bars on the way to the club , all of which allowed the stag to carry an inflatable doll handcuffed to him .
neutral	nottingham - strongly recommended .
neutral	oceana - strongly recommended .
neutral	dirt buggy experience - definitely not , unless they change their staff and duration of track time .
neutral	took a wile for the items to be process and was told the chequ was on way but when it arrived it had a date that was 0 weeks after i was told it had been printed
neutral	will update review after i receive the product ...
neutral	while the ipad app is useable , it is a terrible app - very buggy and poorly designed .
neutral	although , i have no experience with the actual service , the sign_up was quick .
neutral	really annoying when i spent 0 hours doing online shopping and their clubcard service went down .
neutral	liked product & cheapest ., then i got charged in euros which made them about £_00 more_expensive than online price !
neutral	my products took_forever to get to me .
neutral	which was okay because some of them came when i needed them , but i still_haven ' t received one of my items .
neutral	and the box they came in was pretty badly ruined .
neutral	however my items were in good shape .
neutral	:)
neutral	i think it ' s a great idea and works well .
neutral	however , out of the items i have ordered so far ( only been using for a month ), four items have said in stock when they haven ' t been , so i have received them late .
neutral	at no point has this been changed on the website either , so people will_continue to order them despite them not being available which is misleading .
neutral	two of which were ordered on the 00th_nov and didn ' t arrive until 0rd_december , meaning i was late with birthday_presents .
neutral	had it have said out of stock i would have purchased elsewhere or bought something else .
neutral	one item had parts_missing , and one of the late items came in a very damaged box which caused embarrassment on my part as it wasn ' t for me .
neutral	as a result i am very reluctant to order anything_else from littlewoods .
neutral	my goods arrived 0 days late , which was inconvenient .
neutral	especially as it took 0 working_days anyway , however postage was free and i ordered many parts adding up to around 000gbs .
neutral	the good news was that none of my items came doa ( dead on arrival )
neutral	and they are pretty good value .
neutral	poor quality for sale off things
neutral	use hostelbookers to book first time .. let us see how the hotel turns_out to be .
neutral	the process was easy .
neutral	however , i would request them to charge from an usa bank a / c so that i am not charged foreign transaction fee for my credit_card
neutral	received item of clothing , the thread appeared to have been ripped out , but credit to them , they sent me a replacement with no hassle .
neutral	i bought a tshirt from ebay from a seller in italy , never arrived , the seller kept telling_me to wait and i waited so long ( emailing this seller every 0 days ) it went over the time limit to open a dispute on paypal ...
neutral	opened a case on ebay , asked for tracking_number for the guy , the guy replied pretending he had a tracking_number , literally wrote 00000000 so ebay thought he had given it to me but actually just wrote ' there is nothing i can do '...
neutral	ebay closed the case saying i couldnt have my money back .
neutral	really wasnt happy i buy so much through them , dont use as much now as i am worried incase i do buy more items if they dont arrive i wont get my money .
neutral	order first time from spartoo about 0 weeks_ago , order uk00 and uk 0 . 0 came , no problem with returning , but when i returned obviously me thinking they meant us sizes ( and common_sense ) i then put in to order uk00 . 0 hoping a 00 would arrive .
neutral	unfortunately size uk00 . 0 but luckily they fit my boyfriend and we couldn ' t be bothered returning them again as we needed them for our holidays .
neutral	a bit_confusing as i wasnt going to order uk00 again just incase they just sent back the wrong_size .
neutral	good product though , fast delivery .
neutral	originally ordered quite alot in march , all arrived in a tatty , smelly bag , items were fine but i couldn ' t keep them due to how they had arrived i was really offended .
neutral	received a response and refund quite fast , got 00_%_discount but was still put off , but thought i ' d give them another chance as all my friends use missguided and swear by it .
neutral	ordered 0 more items and they were perfect all nicely_packaged and i was a very happy customer .
neutral	waiting for 0 more dresses so hopefully these will arrive like my 0nd packages , and they changed my mind as i am now a returning customer !
neutral	do not judge the website by these comments , i had a big problem on my first order but since i have been very pleased
neutral	i have not got my e tickets yet , where is my ticket !!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i got an_email this afternoon , but its 0 : 00 am london time now , i still have not got my e tickets .
neutral	dear ryan ,
neutral	we are contacting you regarding your transaction 0000000 for john mayer on 0 june_0000 .
neutral	your seller has informed us that your tickets will be uploaded at 0pm today .
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	eva
neutral	the worst experience ive ever had .
neutral	ive never been hung_up on before because the adviser on the phone doesn ' t know how to listen .
neutral	i wanted to check a delivery so i called up and was on hold for 00_mins with only 0 people ahead of me then the adviser was rude but i was still very polite and i never got rude the entire call then she didn ' t listen to what i said and she told me the item had already been delivered then said bye and hung_up .
neutral	i had to call back again and wait another 00_mins for an adviser .
neutral	================== follow_up =====================
neutral	called back again but the second adviser was much_nicer she wasn ' t rude and gave me the right information .
neutral	she said the phone_lines are having problems which is understandable .
neutral	i was told the previous adviser was looking at the wrong screen and it hadn ' t been delivered .
neutral	i was really impressed with the second adviser she was really nice .
neutral	changed my mind about the company .
neutral	i have been using bullguard internet security for a few_years now and really cannot_fault the product .
neutral	it is non - intrusive , good bitdefender engine , nice and easy to use interface , quiet , nice gaming mode and of course effective , overall a good package that i have been pleased with for the past years .
neutral	this year however when i was due to renew my subscription i was confronted with a gobsmacking price of £_00 . 00 for the latest internet security pack when i have been paying little less_than £_00 the past years .
neutral	when i contacted the support i was then told that this price difference was due to the fact that they no_longer provide a one licence subscription but now only provide a three licence instead , and when i explained that i only have one pc and only need a one pc licence subscription their advice was to fork_out the £_00 and give the other two licences to friends or family !
neutral	yes because these are excellent times to start splashing money about !
neutral	so in short unless i have three pcs or im mr generosity to give licences away bullguard no_longer wants my custom and is forcing me to shop around for other providers that offer a one pc licence on their internet security package ( not just antivirus ).
neutral	hell i might even save myself a few_quid and use avast or mse which i have been told to be excellent for freeware .
neutral	so it has been nice thanks but no thanks .
neutral	ordered from this site a lot , generally they are quite good with getting stuff to you quick but i ordered a game from them that i really wanted and it was only in stock here but it wouldn ' t let me , they just kept cancelling my order which led me to believe that it wasn ' t actually in stock so there you go .
neutral	a couple of good experiences coupled_with a few confusing and irritating ones
neutral	whilst i keep going back to this shop ( mainly because i can ' t find an equivalant accessory shop ) there was an issue i had when i ordered .
neutral	the necklace i got was absolutely amazing , quirky style and not something you ' d see regularly .
neutral	but first of all the clasp was a bit stiff and made it hard to put it on i should have taken it back but figured it was something i could live with , however after wearing it for a day the necklace just broke !!
neutral	which leads me to question the quality of the product .
neutral	don ' t get me wrong i ' ve ordered from them a lot and will probably continue to do so but the prices they charge for their products i feel are expensive for what it actually is .
neutral	but don ' t appreciate paying over the odds for costume jewellery when it does not last .
neutral	received item via ups within a week which is good i suppose at this time of year .
neutral	the tv box was a bit shabby and i could tell it had been opened which was a concern .
neutral	there was another address from which the tv had been sent previously also .
neutral	i google the previous address and it was some company in france from ellosis lab ??
neutral	still don ' t know what company it is bacause of its all in french .
neutral	the tv is a french one and a plug converter was supplied .
neutral	with a bit of caution i tried it and it work fine so my worries are subdued .
neutral	it may have been a 0 star_review if it had not been for the tv being foreign .
neutral	the website is a bit misleading and if i had known that it was a french model i would not have bought it .
neutral	after_reading these reviews after purchasing and receiving the tv i was very worried but after now recieving the unit i am now only worried_about warranty issues in the future .
neutral	so to some it up i have recieved the tv within a week which works .
neutral	if i knew it was a french model and didnt mind i would order again .
neutral	all in all an ok site even_though a little mia leading .
neutral	* addition from the first review * ( 00 - 00 - 00 )
neutral	after 00 months of use the tv is fine !
neutral	customer_service a bit of pain .
neutral	did get my upgrade in the end thoug - you have to go to the custmer retention team :)
neutral	some of the best prices on the net but their stock management is crap .
neutral	it ' s ok if you ' re willing to wait 0 weeks but like most people i buy my kit when it needs replacing or i need something extra for my rack & i certainly don ' t want to wait to play with my new toy for a minimum of 0 weeks , i ' d rather pay the extra & get it else where
neutral	classic amplifier damaged on the way to china .
neutral	i had to refund the buyer and will not be using this carrier again .
neutral	iv purchased tickets to a football_match on february 0st , after_reading the reviews i ' m scared i ' m not going to receive my ticket in time , the ticket is for someone very important to me and i ' m_afraid they will be let_down !!!
neutral	iv just rang viagogo and they answered straight_away , the guy on the phone was very reassuring when i told him i wasn ' t sure if the tickets were being shipped to my address or if i had to collect them he told me they would be shipped to me but if for some reason they didn ' t get there in time i could pick them up from the venue , but i ' m still worried after_reading all the horror story ' s people have had !
neutral	good delivery service but i have noticed that they started to have problems with new_releases .
neutral	on occasions it ' s months after movie has been released on dvd .
neutral	pity .
neutral	hate it when there are lots of euromillions winners to be made i buy around 0 tickets and dont even get close :( lesson_learnt would love to win but so would everyone , website is brilliant though has a lot of games
neutral	little squashed and uncomfortable .
neutral	but it was cheap as always .
neutral	food was naff , make your own packed lunch .
neutral	i decided to trade in my iphone 0 00gb after getting an upgrade .
neutral	my phone was in mint_condition and i knew i could get around £_000 if i sold it through ebay .
neutral	to save the hassle though , gadget_panda offered me £_000 which i thought was reasonable .
neutral	however they sent me a revised_offer of just £_000 saying the home button didn ' t work properly , i considered the home button would have fell into the normal ' wear and tear ' condition as it was definitely still usable .
neutral	as there was no scratches at all on either the screen or bodywork i was a bit disappointed .
neutral	shame really as the service and communication_throughout was actually pretty good .
neutral	very good products , but long delivery time .
neutral	used them in mallorca to cala d ' or from palma airport and back .
neutral	good quick service in the airport and in our way in less_than 00 min on a nice clean coach but the chinch clearly had a clutch problem and was thus unduly slow .
neutral	it takes an_hour to get to cala d ' or from the airport .
neutral	when we got there we were sat on the coach at_least 00min more while it dropped people off .
neutral	coming home flight was 00 :_00am so i was thinking 0 - 0 :_00am pick_up to be on the safe side .
neutral	no it was a 0 :_00am pick_up on a lovely smart mini_bus and we made good time to the airport and where there for 0am .
neutral	not great as we couldn ' t even check the hold luggage in until 0 : 00 !
neutral	spoilt the end of the holiday and ruined an other wise sensible flight time .
neutral	probably won ' t use them again .
neutral	i would sometimes use your site to compare prices with the accomodation .
neutral	i would always look as other people ' s reviews .
neutral	thanks for being competitive and please add more deals .
neutral	tesco has been historically at the forefront of food retail .
neutral	this however has changed in recent years with a decline in customer_service and satisfaction .
neutral	you will find varying levels of service from store to store , some valuing the customer whilst others continue to concentrate purely on profits and footfall through the door .
neutral	credit due though from what i have been informed , tesco is on a mission to improve the customer experience across the board .
neutral	it may be a long work in progress but watch this space .
neutral	i have been with orange for most of the time i have owned a mobile phone .
neutral	i have recently however moved across to o0 after being drastically surprised by the rising costs of my phone bills .
neutral	this company has recently been hiding a lot of extras not included within my tariff and their tariffs are way overpriced compared to the other_networks .
neutral	the plus side to them is their ' no questions_asked ' insurance .
neutral	it ' s rapid , efficient and pretty_much guarantees you a replacement phone the next_day .
neutral	the delivery was fast but the xbox_000 slim was faulty , something maybe not to do with shop - to but unable to get in contact at the weekend made me have to resort to contacting microsoft and get them to pick it up for repair
neutral	it was an easy process i only had to send a couple of documents and the process behind that was very easy and simple as well .
neutral	as for speed they ' re a bit slow and miscommunication things , i was given a time someone will call and 0 hrs later i had to call myself , other than that issue , all was very simple .
neutral	i ordered a pair of headphones on 00th_april_0000 .
neutral	it ' s now the 0th_may and i ' m still_waiting for the delivery .
neutral	after phoning up once , they told me they expect a delivery of them that day and would be shipped out same day .
neutral	that didn ' t happen .
neutral	i phoned again and they told me they expect them in on the 00th , and that i could get them on the 00th .
neutral	maybe .
neutral	if they stated next to the item on their website that they were out of stock , i would have gone elsewhere .
neutral	very annoying and in my opinion not very honest .
neutral	also , they have not contacted me to update me , i ' ve had to call both_times to find out what ' s going on .
neutral	if you need your equipment quickly , i advise you call up first and make_sure they have it in stock rather_than relying on their website status .
neutral	i placed an order .
neutral	one batch of flowers to be delivered on the 00th_february and the other batch to be delivered on the 00th .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the flowers to be delivered and have tried to contact iflorist through email and live_chat however it seems that there is never anyone online .
neutral	i am sure that it is fine but i am concerned and wish to be reassured that my flowers are going to be delivered especially as i paid £_00 .
neutral	thank_you very much for the rapid_response .
neutral	apart_from this minor query it has been a most helpful and useful service .
neutral	i ordered my posters one wednesday , and on friday i got an_email_saying that my posters had been desptached , minus one , for no given reason .
neutral	even_though it states customer_service will contact you , they didnt .
neutral	so i rang myself .
neutral	posters took a week to arrive , not bad timing i suppose , but i am still_waiting for the replacement poster that i exchanged for the original that had ' sold out '.
neutral	not expecting to get it to be honest .
neutral	asked ross on customer_services if he could track a order for me , said system was slow and he would call me back ; he didn ' t .
neutral	so i rang him and he proceeded to lie that my order would be there the next_day ; it turned_up an_hour later .
neutral	lazy boy .
neutral	the delivery times stated on the website are not true and both my items arrived chipped
neutral	my computer is dell .
neutral	however , i do not think there service is so good .
neutral	my battery is broken last month .
neutral	walls and floors have a great selection of products to choose from , so there ' s no_quibble from me there .
neutral	however , their delivery charges are high , particularly when you only have a small order and i had two experiences within one week of their nominated delivery service breaking my tiles .
neutral	when i phoned up to inform them , the experience wasn ' t that great , and had to fill out some lengthy form just to tell them that they had broken my tiles !
neutral	it should just be a case of ' send us a photo of them '.
neutral	they also couldn ' t get the replacement tiles out when they said they would , and i was waiting specifically for them with a tiler booked in , so that was disappointing .
neutral	when i complained again , they did eventually refund the delivery charge .
neutral	for one product the service was great .
neutral	fast and well_priced .
neutral	the other however was terrible .
neutral	preordered two copies of a game .
neutral	or got cancelled due to limiting to one per customer .
neutral	this wasn ' t stated during ordering and email didn ' t mention it .
neutral	email stated it as if i had cancelled it .
neutral	spoke them via_twitter and their rep eventually told me to cancel my other copy and buy it on ebay as there were others who would love my copy .
neutral	price on ebay at the time £_000 over twice the rrp
neutral	bought flowers form here a while back and they turned_up half_dead and looked nothing like they did on the picture but luckily i got a refund .
neutral	if youre buying cards from here then its a great site i suppose .
neutral	saves me going to the shop to buy a card , not cheap tho
neutral	cheap prices .
neutral	shipping is way too expensive though .
neutral	this site is ok but could be better
neutral	not had issue in previous years but flowers arrived a day late on this occasion .
neutral	after_speaking via live_chat , i was fully_refunded for the issue .
neutral	the flowers were dispatched on time so the issue may have been the company they put their delivery trust in - yodel , who are fairly garbage .
neutral	maybe a lesson_learned there .
neutral	resolved quickly and fairly , which saves me from rating a 0 star .
neutral	i bought this travel book on the basis that it was a cheap alternative to lonley planet and on brief flick through , had lovely pictures and a pocket size map .
neutral	first_impressions - brilliant .
neutral	the top 00 athens book was just that , the obvious were detailed and written concisely and straightforwardly for those not akin to all that travel bumpkin malark .
neutral	its so easy to follow .
neutral	it would have benefited with more pictures and bigger ones , however its lack of photos was compensated for with a lot of info about the thousands of cafe ' s , shops and ruins dotted about athens .
neutral	each area is sub - texted with reviews in that area and even better the author has added her own ' things to do ' chronological guide starting off with cafes for breakfast or brunch , museams in the day , market strolls in the afternoon and tavernas to eat and drink in the evenings .
neutral	it really helped_us plan our own trips daily .
neutral	my negatives ?
neutral	well even_though the book was ' re - printed ' in 0000 and we went to athens in march_0000 , some of the places we visited on the information of the guide was a ) changed b ) not as expected or c ) completely wrong and false !
neutral	now if you re - print something surely you should check the info given was still valid ?
neutral	one place we visited wasn ' t even there any more when we got there .
neutral	and what really annoyed me was the information on the sites .
neutral	make_sure you check with a tourist shop if you can find one than stick to the details on this book .
neutral	we went to the national archaeological museum near exarchia , athens .
neutral	the guide told us it was open till 0 . it was actually closed by 0pm !
neutral	and on most days aside from mondays .
neutral	easy_jet is a case of " you get what you pay for " the service isnt great , its okay .
neutral	not much room to move about , but bearable .
neutral	the service from the cabin_crew on route to athens was forgettable but the crew on the way back was lovely .
neutral	so its a case of roulette as with most experiences .
neutral	food is rubbish , but so is most plane food , if your hungry or have a four hour flight and below then eat before you board .
neutral	unlike ba and thomas_cook there are no accessories to make your flight comfortable .
neutral	price wise you cant argue they do some flexible good deals , but blink or click on it twice and its gone in a flash - apparently thats how they bump up the prices on the basis of the amount of clicks when searching on the site .
neutral	however they fly to the best european cities - and the prices are reasonable if you also play fair and book in_advance .
neutral	they also offer very good hotel and car_hire suggestions .
neutral	i never use them but its good to know .
neutral	handluggage beware !
neutral	00kgs max and make_sure the specs of your bag suit the requirements on their site .
neutral	mine did , it was a hard case hand_luggage ... but when we got there they had those ridiculous trolley cages that ryanair do that almost always inevitably proves hard to fit a suitcase in .
neutral	if you struggle then the check in staff look on and expect you to fail so they can charge you with a steep check in charge .
neutral	i was lucky , but i was pissed_off because it meant that the suitcase i had to force in ( under 00 kgs and right specs ) ended_up getting stuck and pulled out , and the handles to hold it with were broken off .
neutral	as the title_says
neutral	crap airline
neutral	delivery was stated as next_day 0am - 0pm , but i did not receive news of dispatch until 0pm with the recipient finally getting the bouquet at around 00pm .
neutral	not only was this out of delivery hours , i feel was especially late for the fact that they were flowers sent in sympathy to a grieving family who had been at work all day and would have needed the evening to wind down .
neutral	however i did find the text updates useful and the item arrived as_described
neutral	i would deal with pixmania again , found it a great site .
neutral	however a few little details left me giving it 0_stars .
neutral	firstly i was trying to see what details were required for my credit_card and the numerous options present on the page was somewhat confusing and when i thought i was just checking the validity of my credit_card , it went through as a payment .
neutral	i think it was not easily possible to cancel without contacting the sales_team which i thought was too much hassle .
neutral	since i was there to buy i didn ' t think much of it .
neutral	but still i would much rather prefer a details page of what i ' m buying , charges and a final button asking my confirmation of purchase instead of jumping straight_away .
neutral	another thing , i thought pixmania . ie was an irish company , when i got my product it was french ... the box and product labels .
neutral	in most_cases i wouldn ' t mind but i have no_idea with the label on the back of my product means , take it off before use or what ?
neutral	another issue , i assume has nothing to do with pixmania is the courier service .
neutral	ups .
neutral	they managed to miss my package at the depot on the day of delivery around 0 pm , then they reattempted to deliver at 0pm and that wasn ' t successful ?
neutral	i didn ' t realise they sent deliveries that late .
neutral	if i had i would ' ve used my home address .
neutral	i put my work address since i assumed morning delivery and i might miss it while at work .
neutral	then it was finally delievered the next_day and the only way i knew it was received was because i signed_up for sms alerts on the ups site .
neutral	the box was just left in a store room by a staff_member .
neutral	all it had was the store ' s name and address on it .
neutral	my name was nowhere to be found .
neutral	this is delicate electronic equipment .
neutral	i read on pixmania delivery info that the package should be opened and checked on delivery to see if it was damaged or defective , since accepting it or signing it without doing that would deem it was delievered in working condition and i wouldn ' t have much ground to return it or get a refund .
neutral	now how can i do that when they don ' t come on time , don ' t deliver it to the right person or even have my name on it ?
neutral	ridiculous .
neutral	i went through all that hassle just so i can receive it in my hands and not wait extra days or have to travel to pick it up somewhere .
neutral	good reception , nothing really to complain_about , would give 0 / 0 except rip - off price on extra data - £ 0 . 00 per 0mb ...?
neutral	?
neutral	good service and easy to use .
neutral	however , i was offered less_than a third of the initially stated price as my device was damaged .
neutral	i was expecting to receive a lower_price but not by more_than £_00 !
neutral	only after i received the offer via_email did i think to check other_sites such as asda tech trade in , who would ' ve gave me £_00 for my damaged phone , and even mazuma_mobile who would ' ve given me £_00 .
neutral	in saying that , the only reason i did stick with envirofone was that the 00 day wait for the return of the phone was just too long and i would ' ve had more hassle with sending it to another company which would ' ve all been too much with christmas coming up .
neutral	oh well i guess £_00 is better_than nothing !
neutral	i also think that at_least an estimate price for damaged phones should be shown on the site , before you send it away .
neutral	i had to call to get the order speeded up .
neutral	some of the items marked as in stock weren ' t .
neutral	but they didn ' t tell me , even_though i had paid for priority delivery .
neutral	in fairness , they refunded it , but only when i called to find out what was going on .
neutral	the protein is delicious but the shaker is poor .
neutral	0 in a row arrived broken & i lost 0 days waiting for a replacement .
neutral	after use it is impossible it remove the protein smell .
neutral	after all this i was not offered compensation & all emails after this were ignored .
neutral	the driver arrived_promptly and took me smoothly to the airport so no_complaints at all there .
neutral	i booked online and paid in_advance but on arrival at heathrow the driver said that i hadn ' t paid ... he called the hq who said that i hadn ' t paid so needed to pay in cash ( a sum greater than the online cost ).
neutral	i happened to have some cash so paid the driver the fee ... a few hrs later i got a phone call to say that my online payment had gone_through and so i had now paid twice and that they would refund me but that they could only refund me the card amount so a little less_than they should have refunded me ... customer_service was good to try and correct the error but i could have done without the double paying and initial confusion !
neutral	when we arrived at the airport is was gone 00 . 00 , so as you can imagine we were quite tired .
neutral	the people at the desk were nice , the driver arrived and took us to the bus , they started to load our luggage then realised we weren ' t the correct party and had to go back inside the airport .
neutral	00_minutes later another driver came to collect us , this time it was the correct bus but the driver wasn ' t 000_% sure of the address he was taking us too .
neutral	it was a private villa and thankfully i had done my homework on the directions from the airport to the villa so had to give the driver directions .
neutral	the return trip we needed collecting from a hotel instead , i called as per the instructions 00_hours before to tell them about the change of pick_up location , i was told a note would be added for the driver and ' hopefully ' he will see it .
neutral	i was asked to call back again the following_day to check the details had gone_through .
neutral	i called the following_day and was told all the changes had gone_through so nothing to worry_about .
neutral	we waited for the pick_up at the hotel and after the collection time had passed with no sign of the bus i called again to be told they had the wrong details and was asked to hold while they contacted the driver , after a while on hold i was assured the driver would be with us soon .
neutral	he arrived about 00_minutes late , he explained he had the villa address , hence the delay .
neutral	it didn ' t cause us any_issues with flights etc but extra stress you could do without whilst on holiday .
neutral	also it ' s fortunate that i had a mobile and was willing to call them a number of times to get the matter resolved .
neutral	i was never offered a call back .
neutral	i love this website i have used it several_times and each time same great service .
neutral	until now i have used this website several_times and have no_problems .
neutral	or so i though this time i ordered myself a starcraft 0 key with the promise that " ships instantly via_autokey_system " which it did not .
neutral	i needed it for an event i was going to in 0 days time so i waited like any normal person would .
neutral	00_hours passed and still nothing after 0 days of tooing and throwing i got some results i got a message_saying that they are currently ordering stock and it will be available by monday .
neutral	unfortunately i couldn ' t wait this long and requested a refund , which i will admit was very brisk and i appreciate that .
neutral	so with the full_refund i bought the game else were , but this is were it gets interesting .
neutral	today the monday that the delivery was promised for i thought i would order a key for my friend who has been using my account to play starcraft0 .
neutral	so i went on to buy the game and thought i would not have any_problems as i was informed that the stock order was to come in to cjs ' s possession on monday_morning .
neutral	this was not the case , i am_currently looking at the same screen i did before " the admins have been notified of this , and will replenish the keys within 00_hours !"
neutral	this is not what i was told .
neutral	i am not disappointed in the company itself but the miscommunication i received as a customer is the dampening feature to this company .
neutral	i hope they try to improve these aspects because i believe this will improve the company as a whole .
neutral	i will_defiantly be a returning customer but i will be more cautious next time .
neutral	the only_downside is that the 00_% deposit is charged in english pounds .
neutral	why ??
neutral	that means your bank charges you a foreign_currency fee .
neutral	the website claimed 00 minute transfer time , so i budgeted for 00_mins .
neutral	in the end it took 00_mins standing around waiting for a bus then dropping people at the other terminal .
neutral	we had to rush through security .
neutral	otherwise good .
neutral	bought 0 times here and both a let_down .
neutral	first order was delayed and then finally arrived but to find the box had been open and hardware tampered with .
neutral	rma ' d but they said i did it ?
neutral	not happy .
neutral	second time i thought to give them another chance and again a let_down .
neutral	they didn ' t give me my refund for my faulty hardware through no fault of my own and i lost out nearly £_000 .
neutral	avoid .
neutral	pleased with the lamp , good price .
neutral	had a long wait for the item to be delivered , but , was given a small discount .
neutral	what did not impress me was the fact that the money was taken as soon as i placed the order , regardless that there was no stock to send .
neutral	would think_twice before ordering from this company again .
neutral	in response to your comments regarding great communication may i remind you that it was me who demanded an update ; see my email dated 00rd feb . also not all internet companies grab the money regardless as to the stock situation .
neutral	i have dealt_with many who have advised me that i would have to wait for stock and the bill will be settled upon completion of order .
neutral	i cant rate them at the mo , but i wish i read the reviews before placing an order through them !
neutral	im now a bit_concerned_about what will happen next , ordered 00k gold plated playing cards ... email received saying thanks for order etc etc stating postage paid for item ... do i need to do anyhting else or is that it , do i sit back and wait for item to be delivered ?
neutral	bit confused ?
neutral	if you want your parcel to arrive on a day you expect it do not use dpd .
neutral	ordered an item online with next_day delivery , received texts confirming the times etc_., waited whole day for the parcel only to receive a text late in a day that the driver tried to deliver it but there was nobody at premises and he left a card which was an_absolute lie .
neutral	they even took a picture of what ' s supposed to be my house which in fact is a nearby pub !!
neutral	!
neutral	this is not the first time i had parcel delivered by dpd and every time it was a distaster .
neutral	when they were delivering the last parcel i checked on their site the latest status which showed that the driver is 0 . 0 a mile away and it should be with me in 00mins .
neutral	few minutes later i received a text_saying that the parcel was reschedule for next_day !!!
neutral	i asked why was it and was told that driver ' s car broke_down somewhere 00 miles_away which obviously was another lie .
neutral	these people have no respect for either your parcel ( videos on youtube ) or their clients .
neutral	i buy online regularly and have never ever had any_problems with deliveries but dpd ones .
neutral	this company shouldn ' t exists as it ' s a disgrace .
neutral	edit_: after an official_complaint , i was contacted by the company who admitted driver ' s wrongdoing and apologized ( in a pleasant and surprising fashion ) which makes me believe that as a company they try their best and it ' s some individuals ( drivers ) who damage company ' s reputation .
neutral	i hope my driver ( and others ) has been cautioned about his unacceptable attitude .
neutral	on friday 00th i ordered online a camera with accesories as part of a bundle .
neutral	my desperation of wanting the camera as soon as possilble led me to choose saturday delivery at the extra_cost of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i waited in all day on saturday from early in the morning until late into the evening , i figured i ' d give it more time as it can be very busy and dangerous at this time of year with it nearing christmas .
neutral	nothing came .
neutral	so much for the saturday delivery .
neutral	i contacted them by email explaining the situation but no reply ( however according to their website this should not have been the case ).
neutral	so i decided i ' ll give it till moday and if nothing arrives i ' ll phone their customer_service , hopefully they ' d be more reliable than their email service .
neutral	i came home in the late_afternoon to find it had been delivered as my brother had signed for the package .
neutral	so all was well but i still had that problem with the saturday thing , i later discovered after lots of digging into their website that orders can only be delivered on a saturday if it is ordered before 0pm on friday .
neutral	turns_out i was 00_minutes late for this offer , so it seems fair .
neutral	but my problem is that they shouldn ' t have given me the option to choose this delivery if they weren ' t going to send it out .
neutral	think wisely before choosing to shop with jessops , all in all they ' re okay but according to other cases i think i got off lightly !
neutral	i bought items from asos . com on 0 different occasions .
neutral	the first order was large and only one dress matched my expectation .
neutral	the quality of the materials , fabrics are so low , they looked great on the model , but what i received was so badly tailored .
neutral	i lost two orders but it wasn ' t their fault and they returned my money and gave me 00_%_discount for my next order , so i ' m giving a star for that .
neutral	i also think their beauty products are nice and they have a variety of products in that section , so that ' s another star .
neutral	but again when it comes to their clothing i wouldn ' t buy from them ever again .
neutral	tbf the service is very clearly layed out and very good to use , however , there is no contact number so when i booked for the wrong dates i couldnt call to rectify this meaning i had to book an extra night seperate , plus they say you get phone number upon booking , the number they give me for the hostel was just a bunch of numbers that is not recognised on aby phone i have tryed !
neutral	i had some shipped items was all okay thanks for shiply for chance but when my courier company did not turn_up n i was asking after help from shiply i did not get my deposit back - company did not pay shiply neither - but i got a sorry n i can relist option .
neutral	i dont like lose my money on this way n anyway not any other ways cos who does ?
neutral	so i decided i wont use it again cos not any guarantee from shiply if something is going on wrong way
neutral	a good idea in principle but deliveries kept getting lost in transit .
neutral	pretty annoying , although i did , with the help of a nice lady end up with parts of my order , finally .
neutral	the company were spot on despite the cock ups , and issued a refund me without any fuss .
neutral	i would buy from them again , as the prices are so cheap ... but i guess that is the risk you take with this sort of transaction .
neutral	either you pay top dollar for excellent service , or be a cheap - skate like me , and risk shoddy service .
neutral	after buying an oak tv_stand , dresser , chest of 0draws and a treble wardrobe we were told we would receive a free oak mirror for spending over £ 0000 pounds .
neutral	we were giving a delivery date and time bracket .
neutral	on that day , the delivery men phoned saying they would be with us within 00mins so my boyfriend left work to go wait .
neutral	but after 00mins of waiting he needed to get back to work so phoned my mum who was unaware of what we had ordered but lived around the corner so could pop down .
neutral	she waited a further 0mins and the delivery men arrived and brought the boxes in and asked her to sign to confirm delivery .
neutral	i then came home half a hour later to realise there was only 0 boxes not 0 and the mirror was missing .
neutral	no copy of delivery note / receipt was left for me .
neutral	i phoned straight_away and was told they would check if the mirror was loaded on to the lorry that morning and if it came back .
neutral	after 0 pointless phone_calls back to us with 0members of staff phoning to say that because it was signed for we must have it !!!!!
neutral	we obviously didnt .
neutral	we was then told they would ring us back .
neutral	they never phoned back so after 0days i emailed them and they phoned my partner again saying we had had it delivered and again they would ring back about it .
neutral	this was not good enough for me so i therefore rang them back to ask was i getting the mirror or not , the guy replied yet again saying there had a signature therefore we had the mirror so no we would not get it .
neutral	he said the mirror had been loaded that morning and had not came back .
neutral	so clearly they must of dropped it off at the wrong house .
neutral	i then asked to take this further and the manager was asked to call me back .
neutral	she phoned my partner and said 0 of us should of been present at the delivery which we would of been if the delivery men was on time .
neutral	she then suggested we should be carefull on who we choice to sign for our orders in which my partner said r u calling them thiefs , which she replied no .
neutral	she told us at 0 point we had signed for 0 boxes which we said yes 0 boxes but there was ment to be 0 when she then said the dresser counts as 0 even_tho there was 0boxes .
neutral	this is where i think their error was made .
neutral	she finally_agreed to send us a mirror yet we still would have to pay £_00 delivery fee .
neutral	this service was absolutely_shocking !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	we were suggested as liars on 0different times and my mother was basically called a thief !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	since posting this review my order as been looked at again and therefore i had the correct service and the lady was very helpfull .
neutral	i was refunded my £_00 and offered a 0nd free mirror for the hassle which was caused .
neutral	i now rate 0stars as the experience wasnt great but i can not fault the product itself as its bloody lovely stuff .
neutral	if everything was deliverd fine 0st time it would of been 0stars .
neutral	the customer_service is fine but the delivery company they use - yodel , is very poor .
neutral	a shame because i may think_twice about using them in the future as a result .
neutral	i ' ve had lovefilm for roughly 00 months now and originally got it as we had to get_rid of sky and free - view really doesn ' t have much choice .
neutral	i have had some bad buffering experiences in the past and a few_times when ' lovefilm instant is not available right now ' which did really annoy me at the time as obviously if you are paying for something you should be able to use it .
neutral	i complained over email to lovefilm every time this happened and did receive a small refund each time i complained .
neutral	it has got much_better recently though and this hasn ' t happened for a while .
neutral	they have also ( slowly but surely ) started to add much_better films to instant and to rent .
neutral	the buffering has also improved and i was entertained for a good couple of months watching prison break again from the beginning .
neutral	unfortunately one of the powder in my packet was completely smashed therefore i am unable to use it , the rest of it made it , maybe you should use cardboard packaging and bubble_wrap .
neutral	love the site but you need more of each item .
neutral	its not fare that it sells out within mins of going on the page .
neutral	many of us miss out on items we want
neutral	on the 00 / 00 / 00 i ordered the karlsson crystal sunburst wall clock which was showing in stock on the h_& f website .
neutral	h_& f were not the cheapest but were showing stock which was why i placed my order with them .
neutral	with 00 days passing and no delivery i decided to follow_up the order with h_& f only to be told that they were out of stock and waiting for their supplier to deliver further stocks .
neutral	i felt this could have been communicated to me instead of me having to chase them to see where my purchase was .
neutral	i was then told on the phone that i would be contacted once they could confirm the stock_availability and delivery date .
neutral	this did not happen and the next thing i knew was that my purchase had arrived on the 00 / 00 / 00 ( 00 days after ordering ).
neutral	the product is good , and the h_& f website looks good but i was really disappointed with the overall service provided .
neutral	i suggest calling before purchasing to check their stock_availability is correct .
neutral	i play every week but you lock to wine .
neutral	it took over two months but finally have an unlocked 0s today .
neutral	looking at over feedback it looks_like 0 uk is always going to be slow so need to be patient !
neutral	amazon are now all about profits .
neutral	i had dreadful service when ordering a tv from them for a christmas_present .
neutral	overseas staff were incredibly unhelpful and in the end i had to insist a second product be dispatched which they begrudgingly did .
neutral	i have ordered several items recently using marketplace .
neutral	one too 0 months to arrive , another was cancelled due to not being in stock .
neutral	i thought i would give gossip_bingo a go as i had seen a few good reviews of it .
neutral	setting_up an account and funding it was easy and i got the welcome_bonus no problem , but that is about it for good points .
neutral	the website is pretty_much standard and nothing special , and at some points i found it a little_confusing to navigate and find the games i wanted to play .
neutral	the selection of games seemed somewhat limited , and the slots very poor in comparison to others i have played on other_sites .
neutral	one thing i noticed , which may just be a coincidence , but in all the time i was playing after sign_up , and i switched rooms a few_times , i was seeing the same name appear as a winner frequently .
neutral	either they were having a very lucky couple of hours , and also swapping to the same rooms as me or something dodgy was going on .
neutral	sg done a fantastic job of keeping me informed about the status of my order .
neutral	however , their pre_- order payment info wasn ' t followed as was suggested .
neutral	it mentioned that payment via_paypal wouldn ' t be ' captured ' until 00_hours before dispatch , but i was charged a week before dispatch , which caused my account to go overdrawn and cause problems with my paypal account .
neutral	the book was not in quite as good a condition as i expected .
neutral	it took almost two_weeks to arrive -- about twice as long as i thought it would .
neutral	always used mazuma , great company so far .
neutral	received envelope in speedy time , but now offering details on how to make_sure your mobile gets to them safely , with how to use the pre_- paid cover at the post_office or pay for extra cover .
neutral	my mobile was just over the value of what they class as ' free cover ', but i thought i ' d just use the pre_- paid proof of postage cover as other cover is too expensive .
neutral	post_office have informed me that mazuma are lying about the proof of purchase cover and options are risk in freepost or pay insurance !
neutral	mazuma have been informed by post_office several_times and have not reviewed their postage options .
neutral	i called mazuma on free number to check , but rang out .
neutral	got cheque in post within a few_days so no more worries , but the post_office either need to get a grip or mazuma need to confirm these options with them ( oh and answer your phones !!!)
neutral	got a better price ( 00_% better_than one quoted by asda site ) for my nokia_0000 ( july_0000 model ); just had to send across the phone ( without chargers / headphones ) and got the payment into my a / c , within 0 - 0 working_days after sending my phone .
neutral	best part is that they have freepost address , good enough to send across low priced items .
neutral	i do love a dominos ( even if my fav , the hot n ' spicy , gives me a runny bum the next morning ) but unless they ' ve got a deal running , they are a bit overpriced for what you get .
neutral	site is easy to use and they do usually deliver on time so i can ' t complain too much .
neutral	plus , when i ' m drunk , they taste soooooo goooood ;- p
neutral	honest reviews make all the difference
neutral	tesco is where i shop all the time but i went to the tesco in fleetsbridge in poole today and it was very bad .
neutral	the staff at the tills are nice but the rest of the staff are very rude .
neutral	the trolleys are hard to get in after using them .
neutral	the other tescos are ok .
neutral	i personally think that tesco in ferndown is the best , but i think they should think about getting some new staff at fleetsbridge ...
neutral	ordered an electrical item on the site , order went through fine , but then i received an_email claiming i had to phone up and answer some security questions because i was paying by credit_card .
neutral	i did so , answered what was asked , was then told that my order would be canceled and i would have to order again and pay by bank_transfer because of a " security issue ".
neutral	when i asked what the issue was exactly i was transfered to another operator and when i explained things to him he answered with " no , the order has gone_through now , it ' s being_processed and will be shipped out today ",
neutral	either end of the transaction was fine , but the security faff in the middle was entirely unnecessary and felt very amateur .
neutral	i am not very happy with this provider .
neutral	my connection breaks too frequently for me to be comfortable with it .
neutral	£ 0 for a handful of wedges ?
neutral	cheap but there are too man rogues miss selling bad quality items as " top quality "
neutral	all in all a great service and it always has been from myprotein .
neutral	products are great and cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	my only issue i ' ve experienced is when it comes to delivery .
neutral	if you spend over a certain_amount you ' re entitled to free delivery .
neutral	however the company they use ( hermes ) for this service are useless .
neutral	every time i have chosen this route i ' ve had trouble getting my items delivered .
neutral	in my case , according to their website tracking_system my parcels have always tried to been delivered .
neutral	this was wrong each time as my partner works from home and not once was our buzzer rung .
neutral	also no delivery card was left .
neutral	i believe the couriers get paid per parcel delivered , so it benefits them to pretend to deliver and then not , only to try again and get paid again .
neutral	going forward i have been using the paid shipment route and everything has been fine .
neutral	final thoughts - go for it !
neutral	the site itself looks great and welcoming , it ' s very easy to navigate around each area and find the correct category for what you are wanting to purchase - though it does take a long time if you ' re going to click and scroll through every page .
neutral	so use the search bar .... and it ' ll take just as long !
neutral	i was looking for a doll ( like a you & me or a babyborn ) for my niece , however i get loads of pointless results for action men , stuffed toys , and even the odd completely random item .
neutral	i never did find what i was looking for as after six pages of scrolling i gave up and decided i ' d rather sent £_00 on a taxi to my nearest ' toys_r us ' and back than spend another minute trying to find what i wanted online .
neutral	the prices are great .
neutral	a second_hand doll still in excellent condition would cost me half as much as a newly bought one from my local toy shop .
neutral	delivery , depending_on the sender , is usually great and the prices for it aren ' t too bad .
neutral	it ' s just a shame you have to have an entire week free to find what you want !
neutral	really pleased i found out about this website as i can now buy whiskeys that are not available in my area .
neutral	i ordered my whiskey on a tuesday to get it for the weekend bbq that i was holding , but i was a little dissapointed to find out that express delivery was not available in my area ( cornwall ).
neutral	i finally received my bottle on the following wednesday after the jubilee weekend bank_holidays .
neutral	i have to say that it is great delivery times for normal delivery charge but would like to see express delivery available to me .
neutral	overall still pleased with my bottle and will_definately be ordering again soon .
neutral	easy , not short , but meda it
neutral	i have placed quite a few orders over the last_year or so ( maybe longer ).
neutral	however , the gap between ordering and dispatch seems to vary greatly .
neutral	i have ordered something before and it was dispatched the same day and i received it the next , then on other occasions it has been significantly longer .
neutral	this time i paid for express delivery as i was desperate for the ear cleaner and the shampoo , my dog has an ear infection and his ears need to be cleaned before applying the drops , and on top of that he has yeasty skin , i always keep spares in the cupboard but realised to my horror i was using the spares having forgot to replace them .
neutral	so i decided to use express delivery because i so desperately_needed these items and believed i would get them quicker .
neutral	i placed my order on monday and only today ( wednesday ) has it been dispatched .
neutral	i felt_compelled to come here to warn_people that paying for express delivery does not mean you will get your item any faster , all it means is that you ' ll get it the next_day after they ' ve actually picked , packed and dispatched it .
neutral	i ' m not one of those uppity fussy people but i can ' t help feeling very let_down by this sporadic way of doing_business and i am sure people are sitting here reading this thinking to themselves what on earth is she moaning about , she only had to wait a few_days for it , but it ' s those few_days which are so crucial when you have a dog with chronic health problems , and those few_days are so crucial when you ' ve paid a lot of money to a vet for antibiotics and eardrops but you need ear cleaner for those eardrops to work at their optimum .
neutral	yes , i take the blame for not checking what i had left spare before ordering , but in this day and age of fast paced interwebs stuff should it really have taken someone that long to pick , pack and post two bottles ?
neutral	who in this chain of between the order being placed and the item being dispatched is letting their team down ?
neutral	or is that one person is doing the work of three ?
neutral	it ' s not the first time i ' ve had to wait , i think the last time i stupidly paid for express delivery i waited 0 days for them to dispatch it .
neutral	it ' s just a shame they are so cheap , but in weighing up the pros and cons of using animed_direct , yes i might pay more buying from someone_else , but if i was to get my order quicker then surely paying more for it means nothing in the long run .
neutral	international delivery services needs to be improved .
neutral	order memory_card was expecting it to be delivered in 0 or 0 days .
neutral	in the end it didn ' t arrive until the tuesday the following week .
neutral	applied for my cash back in march , and despite getting emails stating the money will be paid into my account i have still yet to receive anything .
neutral	i understand there are it issues but having recommended the company to other people i am starting to regret it !
neutral	its been almost 0 month since i was first told of the it problems , surely it can ' t take this long to sort out ?
neutral	order no 0000000
neutral	excllent prices , gear is good though would love a larger medium to high_quality products , either cheap and good or expensive and heroic .
neutral	also a store in northern_ireland to walk_into would be great because a lot of the offers are for walkins only
neutral	i have enjoyed my experience during my sage_line 00 training with e_- careers .
neutral	what i have enjoyed the most is that i had the ability to call them whenever i had a problem .
neutral	the timescale that they provided for me to complete my training was excellent and i did feel any pressure whilst training with this provider .
neutral	i might even consider another training course with this provider in the future .
neutral	the only negative thing i have to say is that they do not provide a hard copy certificate .
neutral	i bought my first key of splinter cell blacklist with no_problems .
neutral	the second key i bought for a friend is already in use by another person , and they are not replying to my support ticket .
neutral	this is ridiculous , do not use this website .
neutral	edit_: 0 hour later i received another key .
neutral	i still don ' t know which glitch in their system allowed me to get a used one though , and it is a fairly common thing looking through the website reviews .
neutral	gamekeys , works a tad differently then other stores .
neutral	i maybe being a tad rude here but it ' s a cross between a mmo , ' services ', site and a online store .
neutral	if your a tad confused the way it works is this :
neutral	0 ) you don ' t create a account , but you do need to give a phone number .
neutral	one with sms receiving capability , that ' s linked to your paypal account .
neutral	0 ) once you place an order for a gamekey , through paypal , a message is sent to your email which you then follow prompts through to their site .
neutral	this then sends a text to your phone with a code which you input .
neutral	0 ) after this is done you should receive another email directing you to a webpage with your code .
neutral	i ordered final_fantasy 00 and the whole_process took about 00_mins , which is pretty good timing really .
neutral	my big issue though is without data_protection from an account side , ( in other words something to hold gamekey now to ), whats to say who they may sell your number onto ?
neutral	i ' m lucky in a sense as this phones contract is up next month but i will be keeping an eye out for any marketing / sms sign_up texts in the next month .
neutral	website is slow and everything out of stock
neutral	costume is size 00 to 00 website says it can be pulled in as it ' s a halter neck however the sleeves are very tight so i have ended cutting them off the bust detail is ruched and makes it look cheap .
neutral	i was very happy to receive my full ultegra group set and pedals within 00_hours of ordering them .
neutral	however when i emailed merlin to explain that one of the gear cables had been kinked in it ' s packaging and then split during installation , they informed me that a new set of cables would be £_00 .
neutral	i don ' t think it is too much to ask for a replacement gear cable having just spent £_000_+ or even maybe offering me a set of cables at a reduced cost ?
neutral	new ultegra 00 speed is ace though and price was competitive .
neutral	website was easy to use , as was the drop_off service .
neutral	not so simple to get a courier pick_up , so not great if you don ' t drive or aren ' t close to a drop_off .
neutral	money tranfer was quick but not great value at all .
neutral	recently released cd ' s only fetched 00p on average .
neutral	entered in a coupon for 00_%_off and $ 0 off , and it worked ... until the order confirmation came up .
neutral	a little ticked , but still a decent price .
neutral	iv been on this site from day 0 , i really used to love it , but these days its same jp winners day in day out , nd the jp winners seem to be people that ur using upgrade bonus , i still like the site cause the hosts r great nd iv ment alot of friends
neutral	im terribly disappointed .
neutral	i have to say iv actually never felt inclined to write a review .
neutral	ordered on the 0th_oct 0000 , still havnt received my order .
neutral	order number : 000000 .
neutral	( posting to nz ) our customs service will only hold back items over $_000 nzd .
neutral	and the courier company has no way of tracking my parcel as it has no tracking_number .
neutral	we cant get many brands in nz like you do overseas , was very much looking_forward to trying out what beautybay had to offer .
neutral	now just bummed .
neutral	will be telling friends to purchase at their own peril .
neutral	update_: received my parcel today .
neutral	im very happy .
neutral	i havnt experienced problems with online ordering before .
neutral	it had taken 00 working_days to deliver to nz .
neutral	i only had strawberrynet as a comparison , which is free postage and takes 0 working_days from_hong_kong .
neutral	i wanted to add some positives : great prices , selection and website .
neutral	everything arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	hope beautybay finds this review helpful .
neutral	when i first started using music_magpie they accepted all of the items which i sent , dvd ' s , clothing and cd ' s .
neutral	the last few orders which i have sent they have refused a lot of items for minimal things , remember they don ' t send your items back if they are refused .
neutral	also they only seem to take designer clothing in mint_condition which they pay you pennies for , you are better selling it on ebay or taking it to a shop who buy designer clothing .
neutral	another thing is they seem to take ages to pay you , i sent my stuff in over a month_ago and i am still_waiting for payment .
neutral	on the upside its simple to send your stuff and completely hassle_free , on the downside you get a fraction of what your stuff is worth and its not guaranteed to be accepted .
neutral	i had my order from german amazon handled by dhl and forwarded to parcelforce in the uk .
neutral	having received my first attempted delivery leaflet which indicated none of the options listed , no tracking_number , just my name , i tried twice to order a re - delivery , plus once for the company ' s own promise to try again the day following the first unsuccessful attempts .
neutral	needless to say , i wasted three days off my work with no further sign of hearing from parcelforce ( apart_from automated confirmation of having processed my redelivery orders ).
neutral	i started to be seriously concerned after_reading some of the other customer reviews here so i decided to contact the customer_service via e_- mail , asking whether they can confirm the state of my parcel as well as for advice on what to do if i don ' t know any details needed for collection at the depot or the post_office .
neutral	i got a reply the next evening , within 00 working hours as they promised .
neutral	they found a match to my name , confirmed having accepted a parcel from germany and having taken it to the local post_office ( which i asked for , after all ).
neutral	they also sent me the tracking_number in the e_- mail , which i needed to collect my item there .
neutral	i got my hands on it the same evening ( the outer_packaging slightly_damaged but the inside perfectly intact ), ending my stress lasting for a week already .
neutral	in summary , there were three main problems ,
neutral	- that the original leaflet was empty , did not indicate leaving the item at the post_office and did not list the tracking_number , needed for collection ,
neutral	- that they did not attempt to deliver the next_day , even if their policy says so ,
neutral	- that the online interface happily confirms your redelivery order even if they don ' t have the parcel any more .
neutral	however , the customer_service was quick , nice and helpful and solved all my trouble in but one e_- mail .
neutral	updated : apart_from a quick reply via e_- mail , parcelforce called me at a later point , even leaving voicemail , to clarify all the details and say how they sorry they were that i had a bad_experience .
neutral	how nice of them !
neutral	when we arrived at tfs airport we were down to be on a coach with about 00 - 00 drop offs .
neutral	i spotted the long list of hotels and said we had paid extra for a maximum 0 stop bus .
neutral	the man then sent us to a different coach who obviously wasn ' t expecting us .
neutral	driver was nice and friendly .
neutral	we had to wait for nearly an_hour for the rest of the people to join , even_though there were only 0 different parties .
neutral	with a 0 year_old and 0 year_old at 00pm this is difficult - especially when it says transfer is 00_mins ( which it was when we finally got going )!
neutral	next time we will be getting a taxi if we are at a resort near the airport !
neutral	great site , but was terribly let_down by quote i accepted , a no show !
neutral	and now struggling to get a refund of shiply !!
neutral	i had to relist my collection and accepted another quote off another driver , he was excellent and cannot_fault a thing , i ' m a bit_hesitant to use shiply again tho , as they seem reluctant to give me a refund off my part payment which i paid via_paypal and shiply seem to be avoiding my refund as the driver ' nibs00 ' didn ' t collect , and cannot be contacted via phone , or email , i have no_idea what has happened but this is not acceptable !
neutral	i paid an £ 0 deposit and did not get my chair collected , if i do not get a refund off shiply , i will be perusing a law suit .
neutral	this has been the only_downside i have ever had using shiply but they seem reluctant to refund me !
neutral	!
neutral	the hotel we stay in was awful with a rubbish breakfast and painted the worst colours ever !
neutral	!
neutral	hooters was the worst place i have ever ever been !
neutral	!
neutral	the wifiplug works fairly well and does the job , but the " developer api " touted as a feature may as well not exist .
neutral	i was excited to find a smart socket which an api i could build upon , but unfortunately there is close to zero documentation .
neutral	i managed to get it working and am successfully communicating with my wifiplug , but not before spending about 00_hours reverse - engineering the sample code and java library ( complete with comments in * chinese *) given to actually glean some useful_information .
neutral	if you ' re considering getting the wifiplug in order to do some " serious " home automation , look_elsewhere .
neutral	if you ' re just after a nifty gadget to remotely turn appliances on / off from an iphone , the wifiplug will do the job .
neutral	additionally , it is worth_noting service from the wifiplug company was great - almost instant shipping .
neutral	when i booked the new_york pass i thought it was great value for money but the truth is in the 0 days we were there we didnt even come close to making our money back & found a lot of what we did ( the main_attractions ) were free anyway .
neutral	the ' special ' new_york pass skip the line perk meant queing in another line for new_york pass holders which had more people in it and less check out staff than the normal lines ... this was at the rockafella centre and the empire state .
neutral	some of the inclusions such as the statue of liberty boat tour you can do for free anyway ...
neutral	i think that if you are there for a longer period of time you can get your moneys_worth but in 0 days we didnt come close ... we wanted to go on a boat tour but didnt have time unfortunately .
neutral	the bus tour ( hop on hop off ) you had to travel to a location nowhere_near the meeting point to collect the tickets -- we didnt have time to do this so wasted money on that also .
neutral	all in all i wouldnt pay for this again as we didnt come close to making our money back but it did give us peace of mind when going to new_york for the first time that everything was in one place .
neutral	ordered 0 wishbone chairs , back in february .
neutral	i knew the delivery time would be long , but it took until mid june for the chairs to be delivered .
neutral	it took a couple of emails and a negative_review for them to move , but then it went quickly .
neutral	anyway , the chairs are of good quality and i ' m happy with them .
neutral	the whole delivery experience and especially the communication could have been much_better .
neutral	thanks
neutral	stephan
neutral	put up a move for some quotes .
neutral	received the quotes and bargained for a better price in the chat .
neutral	after agreeing on a price , i asked the mover to update price , which he told me he did .
neutral	price did not change for me however .
neutral	we sent many chats back and forth on the subject , but no matter how he tried the price stayed the same .
neutral	tried_calling shiply ' s helpline , but was unavailable no matter when i called .
neutral	finally decided to trust the mover and go_ahead with the payment .
neutral	in the process i could see that the mover was only getting what he said he had changed the quote to and shiply was taking the rest as a " deposit " - this is despite the fact that it says " no_hidden_fees or charges " on their website .
neutral	the idea behind the website is great and it is very helpful to find someone to help with a move , but the website / company seems kind of dodgy at times .
neutral	always overcharge me by mistake
neutral	ripped me off
neutral	good price , quick delivery , it came next_day .
neutral	but the quality of delivery was awful .
neutral	i ordered a cricket bat , i waited in all day for it , the driver did not knock on the door or leave it with a neighbour but went into the back garden and left outside against a wall .
neutral	in the rain i might_add .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	na de online bestelling en betaling een afspraak gemaakt via internet voor_het vervangen van twee banden .
neutral	bij aankomst op de afgesproken afspraak bleken mijn banden niet binnen te zijn .
neutral	volgens de medewerker gaat dit vaker fout wanneer er besteld word via internet .
neutral	hierdoor moest ik opnieuw een afspraak maken en twee dagen later terug komen .
neutral	gelukkig was het vlak bij mijn werk en was dit ook mogelijk .
neutral	de service in de vestiging zelfs was verder prima .
neutral	( profile zoetermeer )
neutral	free delivery to everywhere except northern_ireland .
neutral	dabs can do the same delivery for £ 0 vs £_00 on ebuyer .
neutral	the parts where cheaper ( and in stock ) which was the deciding_factor but delivery is a sting !
neutral	i ordered something urgently and they said the item should arrive the day after , but it didnt , and when i phoned they just said ' oh we only packed your parcel yesterday ' .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	so not happy because i had to let_down clients .
neutral	should i know it will be 0 - 0 days late then i would have asked express delivery .
neutral	the website lead you to believe that delivery would be prompt .
neutral	i had to pay for delievry which in this day and age is quite unusual for supplements and it took over 0 working_days to be delivered .
neutral	not really good enough .
neutral	their correspondance was fine - but email only - phone constantly_engaged .
neutral	with a wealth of competitors out there i wouldnt use bison fitness again
neutral	we hired a car via holiday_autos using the local firm in verona italy of firefly .
neutral	after booking i read looooads of awful reviews for firefly of cars in awful condition , cars breaking down etc but hoped we were going to be lucky !
neutral	firefly ( unbeknownst to me ) is a subsidiary of hertz but the firefly sign was so small it could hardly be seen on the hertz_desk .
neutral	our first error was forgetting to bring our son ' s car_seat and got stung almost £_00 for 0 days hire - i nearly choked !
neutral	then when checking the very dented and scratched car over we discovered the oil light was on .
neutral	we were told it had just been serviced but the light had been forgotten to be turned off .
neutral	i ' d not heard of such a thing and if firefly are letting car ' s oil levels run so low that the oil light comes on in the first place - then this is not good practice for the engine .
neutral	thankfully we had no issues during the 0 days but the oil light did make me nervous even_though the dip stick showed full !
neutral	as with all my rentals of recent years there was no one checking cars back in / checking for any new damage - this makes me nervous as companies can then make accusations once you are back on home soil without a leg to stand on .
neutral	jo
neutral	my experience of first choice is one of value .
neutral	the holiday we had was not expensive and the location pleasant .
neutral	booking was easy and we had few complaints at all about the overall holiday .
neutral	the pictures in the brochure were a little misleading , but it certainly was value for money and overall an enjoyable_experience .
neutral	i have used wowcher many_times and generally the process is smooth but when something_goes_wrong it is almost_impossible to get a response from wowcher .
neutral	i have sent a few emails now about 0 or 0 orders that i have been waiting for and still_haven ' t arrived with me , i think they responded to one of the emails and i still didn ' t get a resolution .
neutral	i also emailed the merchant of one of the items on numerous_occasions and once again , received no response .
neutral	good deals , love the club wowcher thing but what ' s the point in purchasing from somewhere that does not care about their customers !
neutral	!
neutral	i previously had ordered from this site and for some reason i failed to receive my product .
neutral	i hope this time it will be different .
neutral	chillisauce helped arrange payment with it being centralised , not having to nominate one person to collect cash or be out of pocket .
neutral	my bridesmaid who arranged everything had alot of problems with contact - she did a lot of chasing up responses and correcting errors .
neutral	was very disappointed after a lot of messing_about , that one activity wasnt available - i ' d really set my heart on it , and it meant the whole day had to change .
neutral	we also struggled with timings when we picked new activities .
neutral	i was disappointed that on the day , revolution bar in manchester ( deansgate ) herded us in and out and didnt treat us as special .
neutral	yes , there were alot of hen dos , but it would have been nice to feel special on my day .
neutral	the cocktail class was really fab , but after it we were made to wait 00_mins for the food platters , even_though we ' d been there hours , hardly any apology was given .
neutral	this delayed us with our timings for the next activity , and caused a problem when we had to get between the two .
neutral	chillisauce has some good aspects , but i ' m not sure they outweigh the negatives .
neutral	the service was good the only thing that could have been better is : i sent a number of mobile_phones in an on the contract it stated i would receve the money owed to me within 00_hrs , i kept looking at mybank to see ifthe money had been paid in this went on for one week , finaly i contacted mazumamobile an i was told ther was a problem with my order as i had not stated one of the phones had a damaged screen admitedly that was a fault on my part but an_email or phone call to explain the hold up would be nice other than this i was completely happy wiv the service .
neutral	was not toldor did not say anything on the website that we had to put them together ourselves this should be clearer on the item .
neutral	originally bad service ( see below )
neutral	but have since been in contact , very apologetic , and offered me full_refund and to keep the product .
neutral	they may have won me over
neutral	[ placed order on 00th_november , well in time for christmas .
neutral	two months later .... nothing !
neutral	chased with calls but blown off .
neutral	avoid like the plague .]
neutral	good products and okay pricing but just try getting any sense if you need further information from them ....
neutral	i bought an over the bed storage unit which didn ' t come with dimensions ( really important if you ' ve got to fit it around your bed ) and it took me literally eight e_- mails , two live support sessions and three phone_calls to try and get this information from them .
neutral	in the end i ended_up asking an ebay seller who was selling the same_thing !
neutral	i started my journey with them but they made me switch to hotmail ! they give unlimited_data storage but they need to change their home page , they can make it abit cool !
neutral	i like the taste of their pizzas but i have 0 main complains for them !
neutral	0 . they put some poor asian lads in a box on traffic light to advertise their " any pizza any size " in sunny day !
neutral	0 . diffrent prizes for home delivery and store collection
neutral	0 . drink prizes are too much
neutral	i ' ve used them seven times to send parcels and three times there hasn ' t been a problem .
neutral	on a couple of occasions however , they have said that they tried to deliver but nobody was in to take delivery - some of these parcels were going to large companies which were open all day - others to households where someone has been in all day .
neutral	there also seems to be issues where i have paid for a signature to be taken on delivery - on two occasions , the courier has just scribbled ' htc ' in the signature box , meaning ' handed to customer '.
neutral	after asking the recipients , they were indeed handed the package but not asked for a signature .
neutral	for ebay items over a certain value , having a trackable service with signature is essential for seller protection purposes - and just having the courier do this is unacceptable , especially when i have paid for a signature on delivery .
neutral	calling an 0000 number is expensive too , especially when there is quite a long queue .
neutral	no_complaints about myprotein . com but the courier service they use are terrible .
neutral	missed their first attempt at delivery and was guaranteed that they would call between 0 . 00pm and 0 . 00pm the following_day .
neutral	i made sure i was home by 00 . 00pm and they had already been and gone again !
neutral	when i rang to complain they were totally unhelpful and so i had to fork_out significant petrol to hike over there myself and pick_up my order as i was back at work from the next_day .
neutral	i ' ll use myprotein again but next time make_sure i get it delivered to work and not home !
neutral	ordered flowers for my girlfriend 0 days before valentines_day - mainly to avoid last_minute influx and make_sure they arrive on time .
neutral	thankfully the flowers arrived at my partners work first thing in the morning - and received a thanks from her .
neutral	however seeing them in person later that night , they were a lot smaller_than i expected and was not how it was " as pictured " as they make out on the site .
neutral	they should maybe remove the option to order " standard ( as pictured )" if it ' s not going to be .
neutral	also , they forgot to add my loving message to the flowers - which was a big_mistake since it is the 00th year i have been with my girlfriend , which the message referred to !
neutral	flowers in general were fine - some wilting on the edges .
neutral	mixed overall - will reconsider in future when ordering from this website .
neutral	poor service setting_up direct_debit which led to me being cut_off for 0 days even_though we set_up the direct_debit in the shop .
neutral	search_engine results show up pretty slow in comparison to google and it looks a bit cheap and spammy imho ... they ' re making an effort to change their interface but still will never compare to the market_leader :)
neutral	really not a fan of tesco .
neutral	i mean , i like them for their convenience , but the value and quality of a lot of their products is simply bad .
neutral	the homewares for example are on price parity with the middle class shops like john_lewis but are actually really flimsy in quality .
neutral	i bought some tesco storage crates which are moulded plastic and the quality_control just isn ' t there - on the shelf 0 or 0 were broken already and having brought mine home they have suffered the same fate .
neutral	and they were £ 0 each !
neutral	!
neutral	somebody fraudulently used my paypal account two_weeks_ago through an exploit as i am certain the password was secure .
neutral	they logged in via a mobile application in turkey of all places and sent 0 payments to the states .
neutral	but to their credit i phoned up paypal and got the payments stopped , and that was great .
neutral	i still have no_idea how they logged_into my account and paypal didn ' t offer any advice .
neutral	all other banking / online money services require two - factor authentication - paypal is the big security vulnerability for most people these days and malicious agents will attack the weakest link !
neutral	whether it ' s a site exploit or a compromised password , paypal is where they will focus because its so easy to get into .
neutral	not impressed that they don ' t take security more seriously .
neutral	even world of warcraft uses two factor authentication now !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	so , i ' m not going to say they ' re bad .
neutral	because that ' s too simple .
neutral	what i will say , is that they have a culture of letting customers ' deal with it ', as there is no incentive or motivation to resolve problems - customers are tied into contracts afterall !
neutral	i have had bad_experiences where the signal has just gone out in an area for two_weeks , phoned up , and they just said ' they ' re working on a fix '.
neutral	ok ... but why is this my problem ?
neutral	it ' s your network .
neutral	you should refund me , give me credit , or something along those lines .
neutral	second bad_experience : despite signing_up years_ago when unlimited_data was really unlimited , i went over 000mb fair usage policy because i was using my laptop away for a weekend .
neutral	cut_off internet to my phone .
neutral	i phoned up , and said ' hey , so i know i used over 000mb , so you know i actually signed_up when it was ' unlimited ', oh , your t &_c say you ' re allowed to change the terms of the deal ?
neutral	that ' s not very fair .
neutral	ok , so how much do i need to pay to top up my data ?
neutral	i can ' t ?!?
neutral	'.
neutral	they literally have no function for helping you .
neutral	all the customer_services can do is say yes sir , no sir , three bags full sir .
neutral	in the meantime , t - mobile have just brought out a ' truly unlimited ' data package .
neutral	i expect in 00 months they will change the fair usage on that as well , and say in the terms and conditions that they ' re welcome to do that .
neutral	just don ' t trust them .
neutral	if they work for you , great .
neutral	but they don ' t have a culture of proactive customer_service , they just like to keep everything ticking along , and trying to make your complaint go away quietly .
neutral	and because we ' re all locked into contracts ... there ' s not much else we can do about it .
neutral	i only use facebook because i have to .
neutral	it is not an experience i enjoy .
neutral	it ' s like queuing up at the cinema to buy a drink , knowing you ' re about to get a good rogering by the cinema staff for what is essentially water ( free ) and sugar ( next to free ).
neutral	but , you ' re there to have a ' good time ', and your friends are looking on , and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn ' t get a drink .
neutral	i mean , sure , people would understand , and they would say ' oh no , its good that you didn ' t - they ' re not good value ' but they still think you ' re weird .
neutral	and such is the same of facebook .
neutral	everyone is facebook , everything happens on facebook , i can ' t imagine a facebookless life simply because its where i talk to my friends , acquaintences , find out about goings on and generally keep up with social circle .
neutral	i use google + too , which is fun , but it doesn ' t have the adoption required to be a required website .
neutral	so , what ' s wrong with facebook ?
neutral	it can be slow , a lot of the time .
neutral	it can be buggy , a lot of the time .
neutral	whenever i chat to someone , i need to close the browser and reopen it every 0 or 0 minutes , because its crashed the process .
neutral	yet my google talk in gmail can be left on all day .
neutral	i don ' t like the lack of transparency or the cognition of privacy on facebook .
neutral	they basically say ' the settings are there !
neutral	it ' s up to you !'
neutral	but they assume that you want to share .
neutral	this means , if you absent mindedly click ( like 00_% of people ), you will end up sharing fairly quickly .
neutral	it ' s like the opt - in / opt - out organ donor debate .
neutral	except , giving facebook the right to share my stuff is less high on the priority list than giving little jimmy what ' s left of my retinas after i succumb to a horrible but thankfully brief death at the hands of an overworked and underpaid bus driver who wasn ' t looking the right way at the right time .
neutral	facebook works .
neutral	i use it every day because i don ' t have an_alternative .
neutral	but i don ' t like it .
neutral	supplement_warehouse has great low rates on the base price , but beware of the over_inflated shipping charges .
neutral	they aren ' t really the lowest shipped price as advertised , because they won ' t price_match shipping rates .
neutral	and no , " free_stuff " isn ' t better_than free shipping ... especially when that " free_stuff " drives up your shipping charges even further .
neutral	supplement_warehouse is using the same tactics that they are accusing their competitors of ... drawing you in with a low advertised price , then making up for it with over_inflated shipping charges .
neutral	the only reason i still placed my order here , was that i talked to a nice representative on the phone , who while could not match the overall shipped price , did give me a $ 0 off coupon , bringing the price to the same as the second lowest advertised shipped price .
neutral	isn ' t perfect , delivery was delayed but the price of the items pay off the headache .
neutral	there are many better websites , and some worse .
neutral	ebuyer has a fantastic layout but seems poorly maintained ( the ' lists ' function has been replacing the catalogue system for a long time now , yet no ' lists ' link exists outside of trying to use the old catalogue function in your account ).
neutral	in addition to this , the website will randomly and spuriously change ( free ) delivery so that you have to delete and rebuild your basket ; the site will log you out for no reason in the middle of buying .
neutral	it sucks .
neutral	honest enough for you ebuyer ?
neutral	skype is good for communicating to each other .
neutral	ease to use and for finding friends in any location .
neutral	if you are looking for los angeles holiday packages or cheap flights to holidays packages , you just need to call ay 0000 000 0000 .
neutral	our representatives will be more_than glad to assist you .
neutral	i ordered my tickets back in november_0000 when the tickets first came out on sale , but now there ' s 00 days until the concert and i ' m worried that the seller has totally forgotten about the tickets , due to the fact that there ' s been 0 months since i purchased them .
neutral	i have to fly in to madrid for the concert , and i ' m_afraid i won ' t get the tickets at all , and have spent money on nothing .
neutral	has anyone_else purchased tickets way in_advance before ?
neutral	did you receive them in time for the concert ?
neutral	i know it says to not contact the site and that the tickets will arrive at_least a week before the concert , but i ' m just a little concerned .
neutral	transaction_id :_0000000
neutral	ordered item after lunch on a tuesday .
neutral	was only emailed a response late in the afternoon going onto evening .
neutral	was told would not be dispatched until 0 days_later , despite the site advertising same day dispatch before 0pm .
neutral	no explanation given and response has been far too slow , very similar experience to stephen i would guess .
neutral	for a £_000 item i don ' t think i would trust them again .
neutral	area : blackburn
neutral	the staff were slightly unfriendly and i have sadly had to return 0 xbox ' s before the 00 days warrant ended due to faulty items .
neutral	i can understand that it is not argos ' s fault for the faulty xbox ' s however i just wish the staff were a bit more friendly in my area .
neutral	two out of the three stores in the accrington / blackburn area are fab .
neutral	however one of them is a let_down .
neutral	fix the staff issues and get better stock and this will become the old argos we used to love in this area .
neutral	sadly the website can sometimes have issues such as not allowing payment and ?
neutral	the website such as buying items can be a real pain , tesco is a brilliant company and i love them but it is just as easy to go to a store than using the website .
neutral	needs a major renovation i think .
neutral	the resolution centre is not a good part of the website to use .
neutral	did you know if a problem occurs regarding a payment .
neutral	it can take up to 00 + days just for them to resolve it ?
neutral	that is pretty bad going .
neutral	i do feel the website needs to be laid_out a little better .
neutral	some slight improvements need doing to website and customer_services .
neutral	it was my time buying from fragrancedirect so i was a little_apprehensive anyway .
neutral	but the prices were lower_than the online shop i normally buy from so i thought i ' d give it a go .
neutral	as a student , saving when i can is always a must , so i don ' t have a bad_word regarding the prices , because they are quite cheap .
neutral	however the delivery took_forever , although it was packaged well and the products were all intact , the delivery was a pain .
neutral	i ordered something else online on the same day from another site when i ordered my products from fragrancedirect , and they came in three days and then two days after i ordered something else from another site and that still came before my things from fragrancedirect .
neutral	all i ' d say is : if you order , be prepared to wait more_than weeks as i had to in my case for your products , otherwise the pricing and packaging is great .
neutral	i haven ' t commented on the quality yet as i haven ' t had a chance to use them yet seen as it took so long to arrive .
neutral	i ' ll start off with the bad because there is a lot of it .
neutral	i selected a basic pc model and customised it upwards to what i ' d like .
neutral	the website didn ' t inform me of any conflicts and all was well until i received a phone call outlining why i had to pay a bit more and receive a lot less [ i was informed i ' d have to pay a bit more for fans ].
neutral	the power_supply unit i found in the machine was 000w as_opposed to the agreed spec of 000w , the wireless card i paid for was incredibly bad and knocked out when it felt_like it .
neutral	when i installed windows 0 on the pc the motherboard decided to have some fun and games with me .
neutral	so off to a bad start .
neutral	i did the sensible thing and called up the hotline for some customer_service ( i ' m_assuming good from all the rave reviews ).
neutral	i was told to open the machine up to check the wireless card was installed correctly whilst the machine was on !
neutral	( something i could have done myself but funnily_enough , it also invalidates my warranty ).
neutral	i followed all the instructions as the lady advised and didn ' t get anywhere .
neutral	the drivers were up to date etc .
neutral	naturally i asked for a refund , because what person wouldn ' t when something doesn ' t perform as it is sold ?
neutral	i called again asking for my £_00 back ( the price of the component itself ) and where to send it to .
neutral	the woman confessed a lot of complaints are received by the company surrounding the same issue .
neutral	my initial thoughts were ' why are you still selling this component if it has a history of terrible reliability ?'.
neutral	i reminded her that she should give me a refund because there is nothing more that can be done to rectify the problem .
neutral	the conversation ended on good terms and she said she ' d call back after_speaking with the manager .
neutral	unsurprisingly she never called back .
neutral	clearly being respectful , polite and patient was not getting me anywhere and i don ' t recommend using this company again .
neutral	i tried building this spec ( of the order ) on my own and ginger 0 priced it cheaper .
neutral	however customer_service is truly terrible , appalling in fact .
neutral	not to mention i found that the motherboard is actually damaged or not performing as it should having used a variety of hardware ( usb thumb drives , mouses and keyboards ) all of which either underperform or knock out after a while .
neutral	the temperature gauge was also damaged on the motherboard which definitely scared me for sure given the temperature restrictions on the amd processor inside !
neutral	what made things worse is that the bios wasn ' t even updated to the latest version out of courtesy and that itself was a handful .
neutral	this goes beyond bad customer_service to sheer incompetence .
neutral	looking back on it i wished i had just spent a little extra money and made this build myself knowing that everything will work as it should .
neutral	as_opposed to relying on this company who as far as they are concerned just don ' t care about what they do .
neutral	a lot of these issues ( spec wise ) could have been avoided by updating and putting in some time and effort into their website .
neutral	the customer care thing could be considered a one off given that all companies have a constant battle in providing good customer_service .
neutral	however all things considered its just not worth your time and effort .
neutral	a lot of people make pcs out there and they have good customer_service .
neutral	in some ways you get what you pay for , in the other sense i wished ginger 0 could be more informative on their website .
neutral	they should definitely deliver a scathing response to asus who just decided to rma the board no questions_asked .
neutral	update_: customer support seems to have improved through email at_least .
neutral	called up the other day over a drivers failure with my gpu and the lady requested i email in the problem with as much depth as possible .
neutral	i went as far as i could for detail .
neutral	she kept in touch on a regular_basis .
neutral	once every couple of days .
neutral	not great but definitely not bad ( all things considered its pretty good for a private non nationwide company ) so it seems like that email at_least is a more constructive way in contacting them .
neutral	she made some useful suggestions too like checking for the latest drivers .
neutral	the problem has definitely driven me mad with the software ( amd catalyst control centre ) telling_me there is no overclock on the gpu but there actually being so .
neutral	i only knew that once i looked up on amd ' s specifications for my gpu .
neutral	then there was the added issue of the voltage being too restrictive and my gpu being squeezed for power for whatever_reason .
neutral	it had plenty of headroom but the motherboard seems to do a crappy job in managing it .
neutral	something i ' m looking to upgrade my way out of in the future as its pathetic from asus .
neutral	a ratings system on their site would be good as that way i could say to other people not to bother with this asus motherboard and pick something else .
neutral	to bad need to find an easier away to reset your password and make it easy to use
neutral	as the drivers are snobby
neutral	i have ' nt had a problem with myprotein yet , and a lot of their products are very cheap , until you add on the postage that is .
neutral	that is where they lack to their competitors .
neutral	all the other_companies in use to get my products give you free postage with no minimum_spend , sort it out myprotein and 0_stars will be coming your way !
neutral	it took too long for them to dispatch it and even after paying for an express delivery it only came after a week quite dissappointed
neutral	i had an overseas visitor so we booked this tour thinking it would be the best way to see london in the short amount of time .
neutral	having done bus tours previously i said that we should opt for the red bus route as it was live commentary which usually has a more personal feel to it .
neutral	our_guide was awful , he didn ' t come over as friendly and i thought some of his comments were insensitive to other nations such as telling us that the americans should come and learn about building towns around water so they had less flooding .
neutral	the commentary at the top of the bus was hard to hear and it wasn ' t clear when we had reached a hop off point .
neutral	i also booked the taussauds ticket through your website and none of your staff seemed to know what to do with it and just said keep it until you get to taussauds which didn ' t fill me with confidence .
neutral	thankfully the staff at the taussauds point did know and we got sorted
neutral	i think the entire experience would have been different had we gone on the blue route with the audio .
neutral	commentary .
neutral	ok , so i booked my flight from london to america in jan_0000 , flying out in aug using skyscanner . net , and realised it was booked with a company called travelup ... never_heard of them before , so i proceded , but didnt get my eticket , or a confirmation straight_away like i had before ( used expedia then ) so i worried a little_bit , the confirmation and eticket arrived 0 days_later , unusual i thought , still , i was happy i had my flights booked , and the money had been taken from my account , i had a link to check my itinerary which i thought was good , then one day i couldnt log in to check so i panicked , i contacted travelup , but got no response , took 0 days before they got back to me , and advised there was just a schedule change , and i was then able to log in and check my itinerary .
neutral	at this point i decided to check reviews , and when i saw all the negative_experiences of people losing tons of money and being without flights my blood ran cold , ... i then spent almost 0 months in constant state of fear that this would happen to me , a few schedule changes happened and again , took travelup a few_days to sort it out , then came the day to check in online , i couldnt ... i was convinced my flight had been cancelled , they day before i was due to fly out , so i emailed them ... nothing , i took the chance and travelled down to heathrow ( im in birmingham ) for my flight to west virginia , and thank the lord all was fine , turns_out united airlines have a new policy of checking international passports , so you cant check in online .. ha !
neutral	so , i flew out not problems ,
neutral	travel up on the other hand replied back 0 days after my flight ,.... so , had there been a real problem , it wouldnt have been sorted .
neutral	i was one of the lucky few using this company in the fact that my flights were relatively cheap , and there were no real problems , however , i had a great deal of worry throughout the last 0 months , so , i wont be using them again , id rather pay the extra few £' s with a more reputable company , or with airlines direct .
neutral	if you have a strong heart and good nerves , go_ahead and use travelup ... otherwise , save_yourself the hassle and worry , go elsewhere , its safer !
neutral	site is very expensive but still nice .
neutral	jeg_købte en luftrenser hos pixmania efter megen research .
neutral	levering stod som ca .
neutral	0 dage , men_det tog en uge før pakken kom , hvilket ville være ok , når bare jeg vidste det .
neutral	på trods af track and trace nummer var det_ikke muligt at se pakkens status , så det_var irriterende ikke at kunne udregne nogen lunde hvornår pakken ville ankomme så_jeg kunne planlægge at være hjemme .
neutral	på track & trace for pnl siden stod der blot ' status ok . registret '.
neutral	da_jeg gættede mig frem til at pakken kom fra norge slog jeg op på norges post og her stod der blot at pakken var registret men ikke modtaget af dem - det stod der al tiden .
neutral	had lot of bad_experience with parcel0go such as items neva gettin collected it took a week to pick_up a parcel when i paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	it only messes up my business feedback but somehow parcel0go can never compensate for there mistakes i pay for a service and i lose . 00_% time i have made orders i have had problems and i can say ive spent a lot of money via parcel0go and as new websites are coming along i may take custom else where if my orders keep getting messed_up .
neutral	city_link may aswel call them shitty link excuse my french but once they left a parcel in a bush in my garden that was of value of over £_000 and did not have no card through door to say it was there and stayed out for few_days .
neutral	compensate for ur mistakes parcel0go then id b happy thankyou
neutral	nokia phone took 0 - 0 days to dispatch , then pixmania used a low_cost courier who can take 00 working_days !
neutral	not trackable , not recorded_delivery and they lost it !
neutral	customer_services polite and helpful and replacement eventually sent next_day delivery using a decent courier and they refunded my postage .
neutral	great site , used loads however there fees are a touch on the expensive side !!!
neutral	!
neutral	good reception
neutral	i ' m giving this 0_stars based on the southend airport branch .
neutral	its a nice large store with plenty of animals / food and accessories .
neutral	the only_downside is there reptile section , personally when im looking for accessories for my chameleons vivarium i use a reptile specific shop but i have used this petshop for live food ( locusts , crickets , worms ) when i ' ve run out as its local .
neutral	i think it could benefit from having more live food in stock as well as more accessories , heat lamps , heat mats , humidity and temp gauges etc .
neutral	also there only ever seems to be one staff_member upstairs in the aquarium / reptile area and there always busy with someone talking_about fish .
neutral	would be nice to see afew more people walking around available to talk to .
neutral	i love misguided for tees and the £ 0 . 00 disco leggings .
neutral	unfortunately when i have ordered any dresses they have been sent back .
neutral	the sizing isn ' t consistent and sometimes the material isn ' t great .
neutral	got some cool shoes in the sale for very cheap though !
neutral	a pair of ' premium leatherette leggings ' i bought i can hardly wear as the waistband just falls down .
neutral	i do like the website though !
neutral	can i also add paying for returns through collect_+ is an_absolute_joke !
neutral	if asos can do it for free so can misguided - definitely deters me from ordering !
neutral	returns are pot luck but overall easy to use
neutral	was really hard work and stressful !!!
neutral	took 0 months for my order to arrive , although communication from the owner was great !
neutral	parts arrived damaged several_times due to transit issues but was eventually refunded in full .
neutral	but annoyed with the shipping - i requested a sample which i was happy with and placed and order and paid for shipping .
neutral	i got the confirmation_email and then a day later , i got an_email offering free shipping if i made a purchase within the next few_days .
neutral	i thought this was bad service as i had already made an order and paid for shipping .
neutral	trousers was mad out of strange marital .... had to safety pin the to my knickers so that my bum wasn ' t showing !
neutral	will never shop with you again !
neutral	the phone is great , and even better doesnt seem to have any of the problems that some other people seem to talk about .
neutral	however , i found it quite irritating that just a week after i ordered it , the price had dropped by £_00 .
neutral	additionally the phone did come quickly , but it was still a day later than the website said it would come .
neutral	wasn ' t impressed with how customer_service responded when there was a problem with my order ( damaged on arrival ).
neutral	took 0 - 0 attempts for them to call me back .
neutral	i find the pizza ' s to be average and very expensive , also they are a bit stingy on toppings ive found .
neutral	the website is good to use , love the live feed which tells you when it is being prepared and whatnot .
neutral	but the customer_service is dire , call_center staff have very poor english and most of the time they dont actually resolve your problem , but on a more positive note broadband is very fast and never drops , i get 0 . 0mb / s ( advertised as 00mb ).
neutral	virgin_media are very good when things work , but very bad when things go_wrong
neutral	the price are always per_person and many_times , you ' ll pay twice the real price because of this .
neutral	the items that you would expect to be cheap from a mass buyer are cheap , but its more about the random things that are over priced .
neutral	£_00 for a 0m length of grip tape where you don ' t get the reverse .
neutral	at_least label it as 00cm as you will always need the other side .
neutral	good nice clothes
neutral	great prices but shipping is way to high and they waited 0 days after i placed my order to even get it ready for shipping .
neutral	plenty of false economy here , especially when you realise that to receive anything near to the minimum service offered anywhere_else , you will eventually have to pay substantially more , regardless of the base price .
neutral	use only if you intend to carry no more_than a laptop bag , and if you don ' t mind cramped and sometimes dirty conditions .
neutral	your experience will not be comfortable if you ' re over five foot tall and have legs attached .
neutral	you will not be rested .
neutral	they have always got me to where i was going , yet always left me with the vague feeling that i ' ve been subjected to something sordid .
neutral	thankfully , not so bad as to be unforgettable , but enough to make me frown when i have to use them again .
neutral	i ordered a grow your own anfield kit for my boyfriend as a present .
neutral	the item was on offer and the price was good compared to other_places selling it online .
neutral	it was dispatched very quickly , the same day as i placed the order , so i was surprised that it took 0 days to come .
neutral	this may have been down to the delivery company though .
neutral	however more disappoingting was that the item had been inadequately packaged and the tin that housed all the contents was dented in several places , including the front .
neutral	this is a shame because it ' s a present and doesn ' t look very nice and you are supposed to keep the tin to grow the grass in .
neutral	unfortunately i don ' t have time now to send it back and get a replacement .
neutral	however it could have easily been avoided by wrapping the item in corrugated cardboard or packaging it in an appropriately sized box with some polystyrene for protection .
neutral	i hope that this is taken on board for purchases of this item or similar items in the future .
neutral	we had six items of furniture delivered and 0 were damaged / faulty !
neutral	the custermor service department were very good and the four items were replaced quickly .
neutral	it is just the problematic part of finding a phone number , getting through to someone , and trying to change your delivery dates / address .
neutral	why they just can ' t help you out is beyond me .
neutral	but their rates are cheap , and the service is fairly fast sometimes , so i guess you get what you pay for ...
neutral	in all honestly , it ' s a pretty poor web website , with even worse customer_service and efficiency .
neutral	good prices and quick delivery but
neutral	it was meant to be a king_size mattress but is smaller_than my king_size divan bed
neutral	i just think it hasn ' t expanded properly and the edges sink alot when you lean on the edge
neutral	it is comfy but a lot softer than what i had before but that ' s my fault but its ok
neutral	i ordered what i thought was a wirelss imusic pillow , however the produce which was delivered was not wireless at all .
neutral	comparing it to the pictures on their website , it was the same so i must assume that their product description is incorrect .
neutral	when i emailed to let them know , their reply was ' sorry to hear your product is faulty '... so they obviously didn ' t read my email at all .
neutral	i wanted to know if they could swap it for the correct product ... if they even stock it .
neutral	the product works_fine , but it ' s not what i thought i was buying .
neutral	i expected their customer_service to be better - i understand it ' s a busy time around christmas , but it ' s quite clear they didn ' t read my email at all , and other shoppers will now buy something but receive a quite different product .
neutral	i am not a fanboy from comodo but i must to say i never will be infected while i use it , now i use it , is my third year and i am a happy usser whith the product , but i think you have a lot of things to improve .
neutral	0 .- the guarantee terms are not clear or transparent , dont say nothing about some third_party software of comon use like malwarebytes free , and dont say nothing about the people who dont live on usa
neutral	0 .- the geekbuddies sometimes dont prevent the consecuences of their actions , one time i ask to upgrade my product because i have troubles whith this and i can not initilalize windows on normal mode only in safe mode .
neutral	i ask to other to check if every thing are ok whith windows and whith comodo and only open the comodo main window and says all ok and waste two hours of my time for that .
neutral	the other things are ok , are a comprensive and a trusted security software i can give to comodo the work to mantain my computer safe .
neutral	i trust on comodo like product and ideology , but , i think must improve in that cuestions .
neutral	i can repeat all the other_users says .
neutral	great firewall , great av , great sandbox , great kiosk , great behavior shield , diagnostic tool usseful , great detection and repation rating , and instantanly support ( not the best but instantanly ).
neutral	no more please improve that things , dont lost users , maybe if i dont have this problems a few_days ago i will give you five starts
neutral	i am a security wilder i have various products in the last years always a paid suscription , i dont mencioned it but i tell the problems one of they skip files from program files folder who dont skip before an upgrade , the second stops and freezezz in a memory scan in full system scan , the third detects his own update files like viruses and ignore it .
neutral	bullguard gives me calm i feel very calm , if present any problem i can not solve the tech_support help me and never fail me incluse if i am a trial user .
neutral	now i buy a suscription for three years and feel me so happy .
neutral	mi reazons for use bullguard are :
neutral	0 good rate of protection
neutral	0 good rate of removal
neutral	0 antipishing and advices of malicious webs in a graphical form
neutral	0 vulnerability scan
neutral	0 behavioral shield
neutral	0 support tech
neutral	the facts because my opinion is not very satisfactory are :
neutral	0 .
neutral	no option to invulnerability browser
neutral	0 .
neutral	no safe banking
neutral	0 .
neutral	no resque disk or boot scan previously system load
neutral	0 no list of compatibility whit third_party applications
neutral	0 sharable back up i think if i have a licence for three computer the back up space must be reparted because one of the users can delete the files of the other .
neutral	i want to tell you i install bullguard in a supuest clean computer but in cuestion of days i lost internet conection .
neutral	the thecnicals made all the posible things for repair it but they can not .
neutral	the first time i install all my apps and programs and affter i install bullguard , now i first install bullguard and latter all the programs and all works_fine , i dont have infections , i dont feel my computer slow down , and i feel so secure .
neutral	i read another opinions quad core computer slow ?
neutral	my computer are a laptop whit a amd procesor very bad and bullguard works very fast the full system scans only delays one hour and the start up only delays 00 secons my computer have 000 video ram 0 . 0 ram ddr0 and 0 . 0 procesor dual core downclocked for works at 0 . 0 . second install bullguard in clean computers and infected ?
neutral	i dont think so , i dont belive this computers are clean the mine whit bullguard installed affter reinstall the sistem dont infected .
neutral	i think bullguard is a integral security suite and very much value , gives peace and tranquility .
neutral	i need to say the tech_support are very qualiffed but not are perfect , i dont need a thelephone number for contact they , chat is only i need and i dont speak_english but they have me patience and always answer my questions have a good nigth .
neutral	slightly confusing but managed to get through .
neutral	they do have the perks for ebay and such but omg !
neutral	ive never had so many emails from paypal since i joined ... also , when i was joining i had to fill out a direct debt form so a was a bit_wary to apply because didnt want a bill every month .
neutral	other than being annoying they are very powerful when things go_wrong and helped_me when things got a bit ugly when buying on ebay .
neutral	good company .
neutral	good qualty clothes , especially for babies , great sizes .
neutral	shame that sometimes mostly everything i want is out of stock .
neutral	esspecially if there is an event .
neutral	the website makes it difficult to find menus and special_offers .
neutral	useful that i can pay by card or cash because most fast food places dont take card .
neutral	helpul :)
neutral	ordered 00 x 0 - 0oz steaks .
neutral	order was naturally halved so that the boxes wouldn ' t be overfilled .
neutral	parcelforce then lost 0 of 0 boxes and musclefood were good enough to reprocess the order for the missing steaks ... however , i was sent 00 x 0 - 0oz steaks and only 0 x 0 - 0oz steaks .
neutral	so that left me 00 steaks i did not order and 0 missing steak !
neutral	everytime i have phoned customer_services i have usually had a bad_experience , either they mess an order up or they are just generally crap and they stick me on hold for 00 + minutes .
neutral	i have been promised a refund for the 00 steaks i did not receive - and rightly so .
neutral	musclefood - get your act_together .
neutral	the main thing to be aware of with snowtrex is to not book anything by_accident .
neutral	it is misleading that you do not have to put any credit_card_details in to book a holiday , but you will be penalised if you try to cancel a booking .
neutral	could be quite a fun way to get your own back on people you don ' t like .
neutral	book them a holiday with snowtrex and laugh as they get hounded by the company .
neutral	i digress .
neutral	the accommodation is basic , usually in nice surroundings but always lacking such basic things as bedside table , wooden spoon for cooking , kettle ( this i can just about understand as it is not a european thing ).
neutral	i ' m not sure why they don ' t provide these things .
neutral	perhaps people are unable to prevent themselves from stealing bedside_tables ?
neutral	our accommodation was filthy , the dinner table chairs were falling_apart and the fresh baguettes that can be ordered for breakfast were either not bought as reception was too hung over and didn ' t get to the bakery in time or not bought because reception was closed .
neutral	that said , you cannot get a cheaper holiday and if you are happy to slum it slightly and just bring some cooking utensils and cleaning aids with you , it can be a very pleasant stay .
neutral	we ' ve recently started using trustpilot as a paying business customer .
neutral	the experience for customers reviewing our service is generally great , and easy to use , and it ' s been helpful for potential_customers to be able to read previous customers ' reviews of our company .
neutral	however , as a business customer i ' ve been disappointed by a number of things :
neutral	- the business website is quite buggy and awkward ( logging in etc is not very smooth and it ' s not clear what the default password is and how to change it )
neutral	- the pricing is not transparent , with only the basic plan having an a price shown on the website .
neutral	i think it would be much_better if all price plans were transparently shown on the website rather_than having to have to direct contact with trustpilot in order to receive a quote
neutral	- the pricing is generally too high for what should largely be an_automated service .
neutral	i imagine this is because trustpilot are leaders in a new market , and that the price will come down over time as new competitors emerge
neutral	- it ' s very surprising and annoying that it ' s not possible to pay online on a monthly_basis .
neutral	the fact that prices are quoted on a monthly_basis , but then billing is quarterly ( and manual ) is very odd .
neutral	for an online company this could be much_better .
neutral	- it ' s annoying and inefficient to be called by a salesperson after you sign_up for a free_trial .
neutral	for this kind of business there is no need for direct contact with a human and i would rather trustpilot spent their money on making a better automated online experience instead of hiring salespeople to bother me with calls i don ' t want or need
neutral	second time user of totd .
neutral	sadly i can see signs of the company changing from ' nothing is any trouble ' to more of a private equity investment company .
neutral	the van driver was faultless , they definitely recruit well , problem was regarding bbs alloy_wheels getting the wheel_nut cap off .
neutral	drivers use to have tools on the van to help with this sort of thing but apparently company policy to have vans in the yard at night now means drivers are advised not to have tools on board any more .
neutral	the post web booking phone call needs to ask more questions about the tyres to avoid possible failed fitting charges of £_00 .
neutral	ask more questions than just the locking nut .
neutral	it should have been noted about my issue also being a second time customer and i did give my number_plate over the phone .
neutral	they should definitely implement a system where notes are made about previous cars they have fitted such as a wheel_nut cap or access restrictions .
neutral	long_story short i was looking at the failed fitting charge yesterday in the pouring_rain when the driver didn ' t have any tools on board because of the new company policy .
neutral	the first time i used totd they did and the fitter was really competent , knowledgeable , professional and helpful .
neutral	this was the same as i found the driver yesterday .
neutral	between the driver and i we eventually managed to get these stuck wheel_nut caps off and fitted the tyres but we both got soaked in the process .
neutral	van drivers can be a mixed bunch in terms of trust , but if totd trust them to drive the high end custom fitted merc vans around then they should be trusted to have some company supplied tools to help with instances where a stubborn wheel_nut cap could make the difference_between a failed fitting charge & a very unhappy customer and a faultless 0 star_review service .
neutral	definite signs the company is getting more inward looking about policies , recruitment issues with the odd rouge driver , and procedures over actually helping the customer out .
neutral	signs they are getting the balance , ( no pun_intended ) wrong .
neutral	so a cautious warning to all that read , great prices , great drivers but the office policy could sour future customer_relations if the drivers don ' t get some basic tools back on the van to deal with situations like mine .
neutral	ive used them a few_times and twice the courier hasnt turned_up after waiting in all day .
neutral	when you ring them they dont care .
neutral	when they do turn_up all has been well but their prices have increased so i will be trying someone_else bext time .
neutral	the trainer was excellent but the facilities are a little tired with little to commend them .
neutral	the walls are thin allowing a slight excitement in one room to effect the other and the toilet facilities are clearly over 00 years old .
neutral	i ' d go there again , but if there was a choice , would try somewhere new .
neutral	the service netflix provide is great - the site is easy to navigate , the movies stream really fast and the price is great .
neutral	the only_downside is that the range of title available is pretty small .
neutral	you can work through all the good stuff pretty quickly , unlike lovefilm which has pretty_much everything ever released .
neutral	a lot of netflix content are tv_shows from channel 0 ( such as the inbetweeners and shameless ) which are available to watch for free on channel 0 ' s steaming site , so not sure why you would need a paid for account on netflix to watch them .
neutral	plus points :
neutral	- great control_panel site ( attractive and easy to navigate )
neutral	- fast site hosting
neutral	- long opening_hours for telephone customer_service
neutral	negative points :
neutral	- bit_pricey
neutral	- doesn ' t feature a 0 - click wordpress installation ( many other hosting sites do ).
neutral	this means you have to do a fidily manual install which is not ideal .
neutral	- their customer_service call_centre is based overseas , which makes calls a bit of pain as you have to try and understand instruction from a foreigner with poor english .
neutral	i have brought a few things in the past and they have been good but the postage is very high and puts me off buying .
neutral	i don ' t understand_why you can ' t use a courier like most company ' s do , royal_mail just charge through the roof .
neutral	on a few occasions now i have seen things i really like but haven ' t bothered because of the postage cost .
neutral	received the products i ordered which were good .
neutral	the selection is also good on the website .
neutral	however the delivery was too slow in my opinion .
neutral	i ' m used in receiving what i order the next_day or the day after .
neutral	i did my order on friday and it arrived on wednesday .
neutral	i was expecting it to arrive on monday or latest tuesday .
neutral	it was very annoying as i ordered some flu drugs that i would have needed right away .
neutral	this was the first time i shopped in asda for online groceries .
neutral	the products were good at good price too , the delivery price the same as other supermarkets .
neutral	the only_downside - after being spoiled by the main competitor of asda when the driver brings all my shopping to my doorstep and even kindly asks to unpack it all in the kitchen , i was surprised first by the asda driver not being_able to find my address , so i met him outside , showed where i live and said i ' d wait upstairs as it was freezing_cold !
neutral	then the driver was surprised he had to carry my shopping upstairs and asked if i would take few baskets !
neutral	i ' m not sure if this is right but i will not be shopping at asda again , i don ' t even know why i tried and what did i expect ....
neutral	the prices are great , after you take the time to find them cheaper somewhere_else and then deal with the time for inputting the information to get the price beat deals .
neutral	i had there 0 . 00 cheezy bacon and jalepeno .
neutral	it was ok , but only worth like 0 . 00 tops !
neutral	not the best keep working on it dominos !
neutral	normally my aircompany of choice until last flight .
neutral	delay of 0 hours ( not due to weather condition , pilot made an_emergency landing after a bird flew into an engine ), standed at venice airport till late hours , arrived to late for the last train home so had to wait at in london gatwick till early morning for the 000am train .
neutral	no refund / discount offered on next flight nor email of apology .
neutral	i ' m stuck between 0 and 0_stars .
neutral	how to explain this company .
neutral	they ' re like your local drug mart , only difference they carry almost everything your drug mart doesn ' t sell and cheaper .
neutral	although , i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything of a product that is hard to manufacture cheap because you would usually find that vitacost products range somewhere in between very low - high_quality .
neutral	they ' re a huge company which means mass - production for value rather then quality is gonna be seen here .
neutral	example , would be something like argan oil , they ' re not cheap to make and i don ' t believe vitacost sell ' s any brand of that , that would be cheap and high_quality at the same time .
neutral	it ' s ok to buy something like maybe spirulina , vitamins , granola bars etc .
neutral	but , like i said , product ' s that are hard to manufacture cheap i ' d stay far away if you are serious about your health and well - being .
neutral	in august i insured my ipod_touch and with protect_your bubble after my previous insurance ended .
neutral	i decided to get the loss insurance as an added extra , despite my being a student and therefore unbelievably poor .
neutral	both of these items were gifts from my mother , and i treasure them as there is no way i could afford them myself , hence getting insurance .
neutral	when i had my ipod stolen i was devastated , even more so when i found out the police were going to consider it as a loss as i did not actually see the guy take it out of my bag .
neutral	my only relief was that i had bothered to pay the extra for loss cover .
neutral	when i phoned protect_your bubble ( less_than 00_hours after the disappearance ) i was asked to send my proof of purchase , a screenshot of the ipod being registered as lost on immobilise , and the serial_number to them via_email , which i did .
neutral	i received an_automated_reply saying that i would be contacted by protect_your bubble within 00_hours .
neutral	0 days_later i gave in and called protect_your bubble , having heard_nothing from them .
neutral	when the call was eventually picked_up i had to wait for the operator to find out about my claim , and when he had found out i was put on hold for 00_minutes .
neutral	when he eventually got back to me i was told that my claim had been denied because my name was not on the receipt .
neutral	but then , as the ipod was bought from hmv , no one ' s name was on the receipt .
neutral	i then suggested that i try to find the extended_warranty documents that had been purchased with the ipod to see if my name was on those .
neutral	i hung_up and located the documents to discover that unfortunately , no one ' s name was on those either .
neutral	so , i rang back ( another 00_minutes on hold !)
neutral	and suggested that i have my mother send over her bank_statements proving that the ipod was purchased by her , 0 days after my birthday .
neutral	i was then informed that the reason my claim was rejected was actually because my ipod was a gift , and therefore not purchased in my name .
neutral	i have since emailed protect_your bubble showing the ipod ' s registration in my name on the apple support website , but i have not yet heard any reply .
neutral	i am thoroughly disappointed with this company , as i expected them to be fair and they are not .
neutral	i am sure many other people have insured gifts from their family and have had the same problem .
neutral	i had read the terms and conditions before i purchased my cover , which is how i knew to report my loss to them and the police so quickly , i must have misunderstood this part of the terms and thought that registering the product in my name would count .
neutral	it seems that no matter how careful you are , they will always find something to trip you up .
neutral	now i wish i ' d spent my insurance fees on beans on toast .
neutral	it ' d have got me further .
neutral	update_: yesterday i sent an_email to pyb stating my complaint , and got another automated_message_saying someone would reply within 00_hours .
neutral	guess_what folks , it ' s been 00_hours and no reply .
neutral	how about i keep you all updated as things go along ?
neutral	i ' m going to call them in a minute , for an extortionate amount of money .
neutral	i ' ll let you know how it goes .
neutral	update_: i don ' t want to delete my previous review , because it did still happen , but i have now received a phone call from owen ( who seems like a nice chap .
neutral	at_least , he didn ' t mind me screeching down the phone at him in glee ) at pyb stating that due to the closeness of the relationship with my mum they are going to accept the claim .
neutral	i am delighted because the ipod was very important to me , and although i won ' t be getting the exact_same ipod back , at_least i ' ll have something .
neutral	it is a shame that i had to go through all this in the first place , but all is well that ends well .
neutral	i do think that pyb need to review that clause in their terms and conditions before someone goes to the office of fair_trading , the fsa or the financial_ombudsman and claims unfair terms , as this clause is not realistic or fair .
neutral	either way , many_thanks owen for sorting me out !
neutral	service is ok but some of the images for barbour on your site are awful .
neutral	i ended going to julesb . co . uk because you could see the product so much_better !
neutral	bough my christmas decorations from you tho ...
neutral	they charge $_00 to list your site , then a 00_% sale fee which they threaten you to pay even when your buyer hasn ' t paid you .
neutral	there ' s not regalation and an unsafe website / domain sale environment .
neutral	ebay and sedo are the safer option !
neutral	you can pretty_much get stationery at the same price or cheaper from online and offiline retail_stores including poundland !
neutral	they got 0_stars because you can place orders quite late for next_day delivery which is pretty_much the only bonus !
neutral	from what i ' ve heard about club and first_class being great i can ' t comment but for economy class they just don ' t compare to other airlines like virgin , emirates or singapore that are leaders across all 0 ( or 0 !)
neutral	classes
neutral	the only true benefit of going to halfords is if there ' s one near you and your are desperate for a particular item same day , otherwise it ' s always best to shop around either to independents or online stores .
neutral	i ' ve seen items sold by them at 00 +% more_than most others sell .= them !
neutral	i gave 0_stars purely_because of the huge_selection they have
neutral	the restaurants themselves are quite responsive , depenging on your area , but that ' s because for most of them it ' s their livelihood !
neutral	justeat customer_service don ' t seem to be that well trained and / or don ' t really care when issues occur .
neutral	the rewards program is rubbish and might as well not exist !
neutral	i emailed the customer_service team , they said it would take 0 days to come back to me but i was more like 0 , when they did come back they resolved my issue though .
neutral	i love shopping this site and many products are available at competitive_prices
neutral	i like it but not 000_% satisfied still once u should browse through and have look to get some idea too rather_than believing others
neutral	delivery was very fast .
neutral	thought the website could maybe use some work on the layout when you are searching for your sunglasses .
neutral	ordered raybans , still unsure if they are genuine as came in a used looking cardboard_box , looked up online and said case should be embossed not printed and mine was printed , however the glasses as far as i ' m aware are real .
neutral	whether they are or just a really good pair of fakes , i ' m still unsure but they look good and protect my eyes !
neutral	feel a tad squint but that could be my head !
neutral	i ordered farcry 0 , steam gift .
neutral	it works great , but it did take longer_than it should have for a digital_copy ( 0 days in total ).
neutral	i notice others have claimed they got their games in just 00_minutes , so i guess it ' s just luck of the draw .
neutral	i ' m sure it wasn ' t their fault – and their support staff was helpful when i contacted them asking for an update – but if you want your game in a hurry you can ' t rely_on them to deliver it super_fast .
neutral	i would have liked to be warned of the fact that i couldn ' t follow the course without buying the prince 0 method book , on the side
neutral	i would have liked to have more examples / concrete situations in the course , so i didn ' t feel that i was only getting some teacher summarizing what is in the book .
neutral	so i decided to give musclefood a 0 * rating because so far i ' ve only ordered from them twice and both_times something has been wrong with the delivered items ...
neutral	first order i paid £ 0 + for one of their protein rich almond butters but when my delivery had arrived i realised they had sent me the much cheaper equivalent (£ 0 tub ) yet still charged me for the £ 0 tub ... thankfully this was resolved and i was issued with a refund .
neutral	second order which was recent an item was missing from the box which i had paid for .
neutral	have sent off my complaint and hope for a good outcome of this .
neutral	i ' ll give them 0 more go and hopefully my third order will be perfect ...
neutral	if not won ' t be using this company again and will instead source my products locally .
neutral	could have been better !
neutral	could have been worse !
neutral	for what they do i think its worth it , they cut some corners with regards to things that they provide such as guest_list entry to standard pub which doesn ' t need a guest_list .
neutral	but overall we had a good weekend , just watch out for the " single supplements " if you end up having odd numbers
neutral	yodel are a nightmare .
neutral	companies selling on amazon also continuously slow ...
neutral	great to find a company that could get some degu food no where else seemed to have .
neutral	but 0 week after order placed still no sign of order , i had to email them which in fairness was answered within_00hrs to be told manufacturer issues , fine no issue with that but to have been contacted to tell me this would have been nice , couldn ' t give me a delivery time .
neutral	finally turned_up nearly 0 weeks after order placed .
neutral	will i use again : maybe
neutral	signed_up for an account on sunday - all ok , credit account accepted .
neutral	received an_email with the subject ' welcome to very ' - nothing in the email , completely blank .
neutral	what do i need to do from here ?
neutral	no_idea .
neutral	so , placed my order .
neutral	didn ' t go to confirmation screen - and nothing in ' my recent orders ' tab .
neutral	tried again .
neutral	to then find i had a duplicated order .
neutral	called customer_service straight_away as i have no_idea how the payments were going to work etc , never had this type of account before .
neutral	customer_services advised they could not see orders on my account and that they would be with the specialist team but couldn ' t tell me why .
neutral	advised that it was a really bad first impression , i ' m unaware of the process , confused why they can ' t see what i can etc .
neutral	and then she said i couldn ' t speak to them until the next_day !
neutral	called today and spoke to a helpful lady who explained that the reason my order wasn ' t fully accepted yesterday was because the relevant credit_checks had not been completely carried_out ( after the initial credit check for the limit , they won ' t do further until you place an order , to save them time and money i guess = sensible , but not clear to me ).
neutral	the agent went away then called me back saying that everything is now fine , she also cancelled my duplicated orders and placed a fresh order for me today .
neutral	i ' m still not 000_% on how the payment works but figured i ' ll just work it out when the statement arrives - although i ' m not entirely confident it will come and i ' ll know about it with it being paper - free , so considering going to paper billing to put my mind at rest .
neutral	a shaky start and so far i ' m not ' very ' impressed - let ' s see how it goes once i have received the product and start paying for it ...!
neutral	flew from dubai to birmingham .
neutral	the service was very good considering the flight was full .
neutral	i wouldn ' t have the patience to serve all those people if i was a stewardess , my only complaint is that the seats are so small in economy , otherwise it was ok .
neutral	own branded protein of average to below_average quality .
neutral	shipping times very quick
neutral	i did a price quote for a ticket but then when i further realised that other_sites were cheaper_than emirates , selling emirates tickets , i was very disappointed , are they intentionally trying to dive customers away from themselves ?
neutral	i ' m always pleased with fragrance_direct ' s pricing and their shipping is fast , however their packaging is appauling and this is not the first time i ' ve received items that have been damaged due to glass_bottles being left loose with minimal padding in a large box .
neutral	the courier made no effort to find my house and my item was left at the depot for me to collect .
neutral	at first the website was easy enough to use but after many years of using hostelworld . com , i found their customer_service lacking .
neutral	after i stayed in a hostel booked through hostelbookers , i did not get a link to write a review for that particular hostel , i emailed them and they kept telling_me to check my inbox instead of just resending it .
neutral	eventually , they then change that and say you have to fill out a review on us first before you can write a comment for the hostel .
neutral	this does not happen on hostelworld , you don ' t need to do this first , it ' s my right as a customer to rate the hostel i was in , not this company , which has unfortunately frustrated me so much that i can ' t write a good review after going back and forth emailing the completely unhelpful customer_service department .
neutral	the only difference is hostelworld charge a booking_fee and normally i would recommend hostelbookers over but only if you have no need to contact hostelbookers for anything , the booking was really easy and simple , but it ' s just ridiculous that you cant write a review for the hostel without writing a review for hostelbookers first !
neutral	( i must_say though that they did reply to me fairly fast however the replies were not very helpful and required a few emails sent to them before getting a proper answer ....)
neutral	the products are tasty and good value when you wait for the right deal to come up but i have had issues with an order being incorrect .
neutral	i sent back the incorrect product and two_weeks_later had to chase for my replacement . they received the order but lost it post receipt .
neutral	i got my replacements but not so much as an_apology for having to wait 0 weeks to get a product first promised to be next delivery had having chase every_step of the way .
neutral	product 0 / 0 , service 0 / 0 .
neutral	my order was placed on the 00th of dec and i paid 0 , 00 for postage and not recived my product just hope its here for xmas
neutral	i ordered a lovely bouquet of flowers and hand chocolate made with 0 days before my sisters birthday but they got with a day late .
neutral	i really wanted those flowers to get to her in time .
neutral	i haven ' t seen her for an year and i wanted to make her a little surprise as much as i could .
neutral	:-(
neutral	it ' s good though that the flowers got to her in the end entire ( bouquet and chocolate ).
neutral	site ok but could do with a little improving .
neutral	big company expect a lot more from them
neutral	a decent place to introduce your taste buds to fiery indian fare .
neutral	purchased an oak and iroko worktop , the oak worktop was fine but the iroko had a number of minor imperfections , which you can accept on one side , the rough / underside , but not on both , these had not been apparent on initial inspection .
neutral	i contacted the company and even_though the worktop had been sat in our dining_room for a month before i started to prepare it , the company agreed to replace the worktop .
neutral	the replacement worktop arrived a couple of days latter , as agreed and i inspected it more thoroughly this time .
neutral	again there was an obvious ' underside ', but even the good ' topside ' had a couple of minor imperfections in the wood , however given my timeframe and the fact that this worktop was to be installed in my office , i accepted it .
neutral	the delivery guy gave me the impression that swapping worktops was a fairly regular occurrence .
neutral	whilst preparing the worktop though a couple of the staves had slivers of wood flaking , not sure how best to describe it !
neutral	i managed to fill the chips and ' flakes ' with a mixture of wood glue and dust from sanding the worktop , but i don ' t think that i would want to install this in my kitchen .
neutral	in short you get what you pay for , so if you are as particular as i am then be warned .
neutral	the company seems very good but i feel they just need to improve their quality_control .
neutral	n . b .
neutral	it is worth_noting that the imperfections in my worktop had not been from transit but were in the manufacturing .
neutral	coffee great very expensive the biggest problem is the absolute idioys they have working there are so miserable and never get it right !
neutral	!
neutral	never trust the photos they never look like that the sizes are crazy so you never end up getting what you want
neutral	nightmare to get a refund and useless when you have to use a credit note on store
neutral	some bargains though
neutral	if you order or pre order an item if it doesn ' t turn_up they do absolutely nothing this has happened to me a few_times in a few_years worth of shopping there .
neutral	but other than that they are very reliable fast and cheap !
neutral	!
neutral	well , the tracking states :
neutral	wed 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : delivery agent - hungary ( forwarded for export ) and i did not receive my last order yet .
neutral	i am not really happy about this .
neutral	i was disappointed with the size of the bunch of flowers i had ordered .
neutral	i thought ordering " grandissimo " would mean a huge bunch !
neutral	but it wasn ' t .
neutral	also , the green stick was broken at the top and the card wasn ' t attached to it .
neutral	the box of chocolates was tiny !
neutral	and i didn ' t like that the flowers and the balloon came in boxes .
neutral	i felt that it spoiled the effect as it took a while to be able to get the flowers out of the box !!
neutral	could only do it by tearing / cutting into it .
neutral	would ' ve been much_nicer if they were presented / handed directly to the recipient .
neutral	i have used my protein a number of times and their service and products are good , the protein is one of the best tasting i have had .
neutral	the delivery is always promt , the only problem i have is the new packaging .
neutral	the old tubs were much_better , the newer bags dont seal properly afer a while and are a pain , i find them that much of a problem that i may even look somewhere_else , my gym partner wont use them again for this reason .
neutral	yeah go on then it was pretty good .
neutral	i do use this a lot but don ' t like the constant changes which affect security and privacy .
neutral	ive heard a lot of people say that boohoo . com is terrible for customer_service , there are a few things that bug me .
neutral	for example you cant cancel orders one you ' ve made them , and apparently the return process can be a bit of a biatch lol .. however my experience was better , did take more_than the standard working_days it said to come .
neutral	although it arrived in one peace , and really it comes down to the individuals experience .
neutral	ordered 0 dresses from boohoo for the christmas party season .
neutral	unfortunately 0 of them were bad quality and / or fit poorly .
neutral	however one was beautiful , amazing quality and really flattering .
neutral	i sent 0 of the dresses back but heard_nothing about my refund .
neutral	the website said it could take up to 00 days so i waited ( a little longer_than that because of the christmas bank_holidays ) but still nothing .
neutral	after contacting boohoo they told me they had not received my returns and to send them my post_office reciept .
neutral	after doing this i did get my refund soon after .
neutral	i would use boohoo again as it is very cheap and you can get some nice things even if the quality is hit and miss .
neutral	the free returns service is a plus , i just hope next time mine does not go missing again .
neutral	i used photo world to create a photo_book of my wedding .
neutral	the software was easy to use and the photo_book was printed and delivered within 0 days which is a great turnaround .
neutral	the finished_product looks very professional ; however there are small white spots on some of the pages which are not on the original photographs .
neutral	most are not immediately obvious , however one is over the eye of the guest and can be seen straight_away .
neutral	overall a lovely product , but for an £_00 photo_book i expected it to be flawless .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate and i liked that it had no booking_fee .
neutral	on the dowside , the hostel i booked later called me to inform that they did not have a room available .
neutral	they offered me a dorm room when we had booked a twin .
neutral	as i did not want to share a room with others , i was forced to deline and loose my deposit .
neutral	a good company if you ' re after your vinyl fast , but due to the speed of dispatch , items can sometimes arrive damaged , stock is questionable ( how long have they had it before selling it - this is crucial with vinyl ), emails can take over a day to answer and errors with orders have delayed work being completed for some clients - very frustrating !
neutral	from reading other reviews , it seems that i might have just had a lot of bad luck as others have had very positive_experiences with mdp .
neutral	this is an appeal to everyone who may have experienced the same problem !!
neutral	!
neutral	a recruitment agent managed to leave a message on my mobile without letting me take the telephone call .
neutral	i was in the city_centre where i had maximum signal .
neutral	i was holding my o0 mobile phone in my hand because i was expecting a recruitment agent to give me a call .
neutral	suddenly my mobile phone vibrated once .
neutral	i was getting ready to answer the call but the call never came .
neutral	in a few second i received a message from o0 to say that i had a voice message .
neutral	it puzzled me because my phone had no missed call , and the signal was at maximum , so there was no problem for me to take the call .
neutral	i went to o0 boutique , a technician said that it may be a problem with my sim_card .
neutral	when i asked whether o0 was selling a service that would allow agencies to leave messages at will , the guy refused to answer !!!
neutral	does anyone know anything like this ?
neutral	i had ordered an item 0 weeks before my mums_birthday and the item said in stock when i placed the order .
neutral	i checked my order a week_later and nothing had changed still didn ' t say dispatched , i checked it again a couple of days_later and it said delivered .
neutral	it hadn ' t !
neutral	i checked the delivery terms and it said you have to wait 00days before you can put in a complaint .
neutral	the item arrived a week after my mums_birthday so 0 weeks it took to deliver .
neutral	i was and am extremely happy at the extra care o0 put into customer_services .
neutral	however its disappointing that the good customer_service is funded by my roaming charges .
neutral	0 days in majorca , £_000 phone bill ?
neutral	i even switched data off when i wasn ' t checking my 0kb emails .
neutral	not sure where i went wrong .
neutral	what upset me more was the fact that the network i was using was ' movistar '.. a telefonica company ( o0 ' s owners ).
neutral	disappointing o0 !
neutral	i ' ve never really had a problem with amazon in the past and as such would have given them a four or five_star_rating but now that they ' ve opened the doors to third_party sellers you have to double_check to see were an item is actually coming from .
neutral	i use amazon because i want to buy from amazon and not somebody that i ' ve never_heard of before .
neutral	unless you buy with one of their deals it ' s not worthwhile , way too expensive !
neutral	although you can ' t fault the taste .
neutral	shiply is a good market place great concept but the website is convuluted n unclear
neutral	none of the solutions provided worked for me ;-( itunes is a software to be avoided .
neutral	unfortunately your system runs through itunes .
neutral	good pre_- sale customer_service .
neutral	i like the company , although i can ' t stand to watch them on tv , just browse on the web .
neutral	they do have some nice offers , especially easy pay - but i think the shipping charges for every_single item are ridiculous and also 0 quid per item is quite steep .
neutral	i do shop elsewhere if i can .
neutral	i received my pc within a few_days of ordering and using the free shipping option which was impressive .
neutral	and the communciation was very good .
neutral	however the pc arrived and the box appeared like it had been used as a bobsleigh on the sides despite being labelled keep upright , couriers fault or badly stored this was concerning .
neutral	then when i finally got a chance to set_up the pc , i was massively disappointed to find out the pc doesnt even switch on properly weather this is a fault with the gpu i dont know .
neutral	but despite contacting the website over 00hours ago i am still_awaiting a response !
neutral	hopefully i havnt just thrown £_000 down the toilet .... we shall see
neutral	pushy staff and a terrible website
neutral	there is good content in this website but finding anything on it is labour some and irritating .
neutral	the website is poorly laid_out and looks about as cheap as some of the advice .
neutral	good , my phone was unlocked but it had delayed too much !
neutral	it is so annoying when you wait for delivery all day .
neutral	the thing that i do not understand is why they give you a time lot if they are not able to meet it ?
neutral	i do not understand .
neutral	so big company and so mess company .
neutral	i have 00mb internet ... and i get 00mb most of the time .
neutral	great ... but their customer_service is beyond bad .
neutral	whenever i have had a problem it always tool about 00 phone_calls to fix it .
neutral	they always blamed my computer and my router , so always prepare 0 computers and connect them directly .
neutral	it took them 0 weeks to re - activate my old modem when i moved_house .
neutral	my paper bill cost me now about £ 0 . 0 whereas their ads that come in post are free !
neutral	after complaint i am now getting ads with " dear occupier ..." instead of my details .
neutral	never sent parcel through them , but i know person that used to work there .
neutral	he advised not to use it , but it ' s just his opinion .
neutral	i had about 0 items delivered .
neutral	they always leave the note and leave parcel in my carport .
neutral	it only takes seconds to find out that something was delivered and to pick_up by anyone walking by .
neutral	just had my car taken for an mot .
neutral	i knew it would fail due to some issues with welding that have been highlighted for the past 0 mot ' s as advisories .
neutral	got a phone call back saying the repairs were around £_000 .
neutral	after phoning the garage directly they are going to do the work for a max of £_000 - the same price they quoted service stop apparently .
neutral	i can ' t fault the service stop experience and i understand a bit of comission on top
neutral	but seriously £_000 , thats crazy !!
neutral	!
neutral	0_stars for the good mot prices and the free collection and return , but high premiums for repairs .
neutral	also there is no need to email me 0 times in under an_hour asking to pay my mot costs after i phoned you on a premium number saying i will pay when i leave work .
neutral	è scrivendo qui che mi ridanno 0 euri e mezzo ?
neutral	comunque il sito funziona , vogliono un botto di soldi ( 00 euri ) ma funziona veramente , e nessuno mi ha pagato per dirlo !
neutral	iphone sbloccato tramite imei e funzionante con ogni scheda !
neutral	the order arrived after four days when it said two .
neutral	but when it arrived , it didn ' t arrive with the free_shaker it was promised with .
neutral	we called up customer_service who said they were out of stock of this shaker and that they may give us one in the up and coming weeks when they are in stock .
neutral	they also said that this was subject to availability when it clearly_stated that they were free on the offer .
neutral	but the price was the cheapest on the web which was a plus
neutral	great service , quick despatch , hovever dpd mahe a huge mess with next_day delivery and i would never use them for delivery again
neutral	great value for money regarding contract phone / internet .
neutral	however store staff let the company down , numerous_occasions i have been in store looking for help and the staff appear disinterested .
neutral	too busy on their mobiles or on the internet , once you get their attention you get informed they can not help and you have to phone customer serviices each time .
neutral	i like the personal_touch and would prefer to deal with someone face to face .
neutral	when people ask what network i am with for my mobile i always mention that i think the customer_service is very poor so i do not recommend three apart_from the value for money
neutral	great prices spent over £_000 over 0 months but the anti_fraud system is lame .. i understand because it protects getting approved i understand too but not getting approved for the future after 0 times of uploading ids and the docs being accepted each time ..
neutral	i even created a ticket regards to this which never got a response
neutral	i made an_email appointment within an_hour of my bonnet flying open and smashing my windscreen .
neutral	i made it online for the next available slot which was 0 days_later .
neutral	not ideal considering how badly_damaged the windscreen was and how difficult it was to drive and see properly but i thought i ' d managed for 0 days .
neutral	received a phone call from my local_branch in incerness who deal with my area only to be told that nobody could come out for another week as we ' re so far away it ' s not feasible to come all the way up for one job .
neutral	i was understandably not happy with this as driving with a destroyed windscreen and a 0yr old for a week is not the best of conditions .
neutral	i asked whether i could bring it down so that it could be sorted quicker only to be told that it could only be the day before the appointment i ' d been originally given so it was pointless .
neutral	i then spent a week driving about with a destroyed windscreen finding it extremely diffciult to see and am only grateful that no other stones etc kicked up onto the screen and made it even worse .
neutral	i think that your service to more rural_areas needs addressed as this is the 0nd time i ' ve needed repairs and had to wait a week for them to be completed and i don ; t see why we should get a second rate service becuase we don ' t live in inverness .
neutral	i ordered a yamaha p000 digital_piano in black , a piano stand , a piano stool and a roland kc00 amp .
neutral	the main bulk came fine except for the amp , but this i still_haven ' t received after over a month of waiting , with no apology or update .
neutral	it took several emails to the sales department to find out what was happening .
neutral	they offered no compensation or better model , and as i ' ve had several gigs and had to borrow or pay to hire amps for them , it ' s ridiculous !
neutral	edit_: i eventually received my amp after 0 months of waiting - an_alternative , more_expensive amp was offered with slight discount , or a display one that i would eventually have to send back .
neutral	several emails have been ignored , but service on the rest is generally good , and the service i had in - store was very good .
neutral	unfortunatelly i was not very happy with the service .
neutral	the delivery was late ( however i must_admit that i have received for a free delivery next time , which was nice ), but the package was left outside and the delivery man did not ring our bell to notify us .
neutral	therefore the package could have easily been stolen if we had not notice it in time .
neutral	they kept in the website a product that was also .
neutral	so if u need a laptop immediately is better you buy in another place .
neutral	otherwise if you have some 00 days ( or more ) buy from them , the best prices in europe are here .
neutral	they took_ages to send my product to the delivery company ( 00 days ) once received by the delivery company , the product came in 0 day from england to ireland .
neutral	amazing .
neutral	the product is in perfect conditions .
neutral	thats it !
neutral	!
neutral	i ' ve had experiences before where the headline cost offered is dramatically cut when they have your phone - i though this would be different with orange but i was wrong .
neutral	the service was ok , apart_from sending a phone size box and envelope for an ipad - bit sloppy .
neutral	payment was very prompt once i ' d decided there was no way of getting the original price offered , was nice that this went straight into the bank too rather_than having the time of receiving a cheque and waiting for this to clear .
neutral	shopto . net is always a pleasureable experience when ordering games online , i have been using them for about a year now .
neutral	the latest purchase however was a bit of a nightmare due to the fact that the cdkey supplied with the game was already in use , so i had to send the game back .
neutral	shopto quickly send a new copy of the game out , however did not credit my postage back , so am a bit annoyed about that !
neutral	is it just me or is it everytime i log_into my account on orange . co . uk there is always technical_difficulties to retrieve the information i want to know about my account at the time .
neutral	i really wonder_why i bother even trying
neutral	says it all when its supposed to be a few working_days !
neutral	not for the first time i ' ve found that selections often doesn ' t have stock for the items they ' re selling on their website .
neutral	a shame really because they do have a particularly good selection of products available .
neutral	worse is that this time they ' ve given me a credit note rather_than just refunding what i ' ve paid which means that now i ' ve got to go through the hassle of getting them to send me a cheque / cashing it .
neutral	sup dawg , hotel bookers is okay , although it ' s pretty frustrating when you ' re trying to book something and the prices change while you browse .
neutral	makes it hard to keep_track of all your tabs , ya know ?
neutral	on the plus side , there ' s no booking_fee , and you only pay 00_% of the cost of your stay up front , so you know you ' re only gonna get ripped_off for like a few dozen bucks instead of a few_hundred if you turn_up and the hostel ' s a torture chamber run by a crazed tarantino fan .
neutral	before i start , i should mention i love sushisushi and will_continue purchasing from them on a regular_basis .
neutral	now -
neutral	a couple months_ago i made an order .
neutral	after 0 weeks with no communication past " sent " i emaiuled them , to be told it was being resent .
neutral	when the parcel finally arrive , four of the twenty items i ordered were missing .
neutral	when i requested a resend / refund of these items , i was refunded half what i was owed , and was then no repsonded to again .
neutral	my recent order , which arrived today , was better .
neutral	however , possibly due to christmas_rush , took a long time to send , so i emailed them to be told " whoops , forgot , will sned it now "....
neutral	so anyway , expect great products at superb prices , and also expect some questionable service .
neutral	good to keep in touch with friends but you end up with a list of people you dont want to talk too , dont really care about and you have to read how boring there life is on your home page from there status .
neutral	some of the games are really fun and addictive but if you want to get anywhere in them you have to spend £ £ £
neutral	brilliant for kids cloths for how quick they grow and good for if you need cheap cloths for working on site .
neutral	but if you want to look nice spend abit more and go choice .
neutral	brilliant for cloths but never buy furniture it always breaks and you have to spend weeks trying to get your money back or a replacement .
neutral	at first , i only used on part of my face , it was ok . however , after that , i used on my whole face and it maked acne to break out .
neutral	obviously the only auction site to ever visit .
neutral	great for buyers .
neutral	sellers fee ' s seem to be extortionate and increasing .
neutral	as the company is ever growing the fee ' s should be going down .
neutral	still always good products and brilliant feedback system .
neutral	been with o0 ( and previously bt cellnet ) for over 00 years now .
neutral	signal is always very good but recently the cost of being with this network vs other is terrible .
neutral	i have never been rewarded for contract renewals and by renewing an iphone contract with them as_opposed to moving network i am actually worse off .
neutral	when phoning problems i get transferred from here to there and spend hours holding .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	it jams logs sometimes and they dont have as much sport events as bet000
neutral	ordered maxx essentials mct which was in stock according to their website .
neutral	received an_email a couple of hours_later stating that the item was out of stock .
neutral	asked what the lead time would be to get the item back in stock and they said they didn ' t have a restock date and would i like a refund .
neutral	the refund was given very promptly , however , it was unfortunate that the item wasn ' t in stock like it stated on the website .
neutral	i have bought twice on this site , 0st time they delivered very fast , received on the next_day with 0 samples regardless what the amount i spend was not much , so i thought its not as bad as i thought .
neutral	when i finished my current toner , i bought it through this site again , ordered but didnt receive any confirmation_email after 0 days , so i emailed and like everybody said , no one reply .
neutral	so i thought maybe order was not placed ( since didnt get any confirmation_email ), and i replaced another order .
neutral	this time i did get confirmation_email , but waited for about 0 week , i didnt get any item dispatched email .
neutral	and of course didn ' t receive anything either .
neutral	i emailed again , 0 days_later still no reply . i emailed again , and finally replied , they told me that its the problem of royal_mail , and they are contacting royal_mail .
neutral	finally i received my order , this time took very long , and there ' re no samples ( but thats okay , since it was just like a bonus ).
neutral	so i guess this site ... is good to purchase for the first time only , or if you don ' t mind to wait longer , considering its price was lower_than others .
neutral	service was not too good either .
neutral	i ' ve ordered from missguided twice , and can ' t say i really would again .
neutral	the clothes all look nice on the website & they are very up to trend but when i ' ve received them they haven ' t been very good quality .
neutral	had to send the last one back due to treading .....
neutral	the products seems to be a little more_expensive in elc than other_retailers .
neutral	i ordered from elc & explained i lived in a flat for my order to not be left anywhere , but when i got home they had said it was left outside my door , which of course wasn ' t there , why would you leave a big order outside someones door ?!
neutral	i guess this was down more to the delivery company than elc itself but i did tell them before hand not to do so ... they re - sent the items out without any_problems !!
neutral	wouldn ' t say i wouldn ' t use them again as i prob would do , just hope the service will be better next time !
neutral	!
neutral	i had used asda all the time to get my food shopping , went months without any_problems , then one time they took two amounts for the food shopping out of my account & it was a nightmare getting one put back & their customer_service is really bad , they ' re very rude & not helpful at all !!
neutral	on the other hand before that time i did have no_problems but after that experience i wont be using them again to purchase my food shopping !
neutral	!
neutral	i visited the manchester printworks harvester pub a few_days ago , the service was slightly mixed , great bar service but unfortunately just average table service , the salad bar was very well stocked and regularly replenished , however the food although very tasty was barely warm and the plates were cold , the waiter did not check on us to check everything was ok and not very easy to get a hold of despite the restaurant not being particularly busy , i would have tried to find him to complain but i am disabled and find it difficult to walk around .
neutral	i did inform him of my slight dissatisfaction when he cleared our plates and he was very apologetic so we decided to stay for dessert and further drinks .
neutral	he did redeem himself when it came to dessert and had the chef double my portion of chocolate fudge cake which was lovely .
neutral	in 0000 i visited the ' new ' salford quays harvester during the christmas_period and the whole experience was 000_% outstanding , very courteous and professional .
neutral	this restaurant had been much busier than my visit to the printworks harvester .
neutral	in 0000 whilst on holiday in torquay during the regatta week , we visited the beacon harvester on 0 different occasions .
neutral	the young polish waitress who was our host on the first visit was extremely lovely , courteous and very hard working and well deserving of the tip which i left .
neutral	unfortunately on our second visit to the beacon , the service was disgraceful , we had a different waitress who was very rude , literally ' slamming ' the plates down on our table when our food was brought out .
neutral	this was reported to the duty manager who was apologetic , however the apology should have come from the waitress .
neutral	we did return for a third time but once we realised the same waitress was on duty again and appeared to be as sultry as when we had been in the previous time we just stayed for a drink , cancelled our table and ate elsewhere .
neutral	generally i really like the food and the professional service when i can get it and would recommend harvester to friends and family , however it is hit and miss if you can get these .
neutral	all staff should be trained to provide the high_level of service that the staff who do go out of their way to make the dining at harvester experience as enjoyable as possible provide .
neutral	its the little things that matter that make the big things worth it .
neutral	a massive thank_you to those staff mentioned above who have made our visits pleasurable , as for the not so good experiences there is plenty of room for improvement .
neutral	yes we all know its a big company but that then leads the customer support to be horrendous and it really is useless !
neutral	if you like getting free_stuff through your letter_box this one is a good site i wouldnt give them 0_stars or recomend you sign_up to their email newsletter as they are proper spammers .
neutral	have had many great experiences but they completely screwed up one of my christmas_presents when they sent me a watch that had clearly been used and returned ( it was scratched and had a flat battery ).
neutral	even the delivery driver that collected the item said it was a common complaint that the goods were used - even_though advertised as new .
neutral	( this was bought direct from amazon and not a reseller )
neutral	was ok service , tyres are good but still expensive found cheaper else where after purchasing
neutral	for a big company thay can do much_better ,
neutral	in special wend items they are out of stock they should not be listed
neutral	website was easy to use and my items arrived quickly .
neutral	however another random payment was taken from my account on the same day .
neutral	this was refunded quickly but it was only picked_up via the bank_statement - i didn ' t receive further emails regarding the extra amount .
neutral	i have just booked a week in magaluff in august hoping nothing go ' s wrong after seeing all the bad comments !
neutral	only thing that confuses me if submitting passport details do you still need to do this if i paid for tickets to be sent out by post ?
neutral	i ordered from asos many_times back in asia , and delivery often reaches me within its time - frame .
neutral	asos should consider to switch to another delivery company in uk , hermes never helps in timed delivery .
neutral	not sure if i buy again from asos at the moment ... there ' s just many other fashion website with a lot or bargaining offer in uk ..
neutral	i didn ' t received the item shown on the picture .
neutral	same model but different outlook .
neutral	still nice tought , but not the one i was supposed to buy .
neutral	ordered spark plugs got the wrong ones they never got back to me .
neutral	they emailed me after my initial review and are sending me the correct spark plugs without me having to return the originals so very happy with the follow_up service .
neutral	good products but i ' m getting pissed_off with the fact that you use couriers even for small items .
neutral	what is wrong with royal_mail ?
neutral	i work so i am never at home to receive couriers .
neutral	thanks for the response .
neutral	in fairness the small part i did get of you has allowed me to get the van on the road so i am happy .
neutral	hostelbookers supplied a lot of options for hostels , but not all of them had full availability for the dates i had selected , which was a little_confusing .
neutral	otherwise , made is simple and easy to look at all the hostels in the area .
neutral	i have zero to complain_about when it comes to the hut ' s range and prices - excellent deals have been snagged onmultiple occasions .
neutral	the only_gripe i would seek to voice is that , out of maybe 00 orders in the past_year or so , on 0 of them i ' ve been sent the wrong_size or the wrong_colour , or else the item was never in stock in the first place and i ' ve ended_up having my order cancelled .
neutral	take that out the equation and i ' m a happy customer .
neutral	free delivery is great and they ' re generous with the periodic issue of discount_codes , etc .
neutral	havent received my product yet
neutral	good games but slow with withdraws and poor communication with what id is needed !
neutral	however easy to use and some good up to date games !
neutral	so after_reading all these reviews i am getting worried , my change over has gone very smoothly but just recieved an_email_saying my start date is 00th of november so why on earth is my first direct_debit the 00th shouldnt my first one be the end of december once ive actually used some gas and electirc with them ????
neutral	help iam confused and they dont seem to be answering me .
neutral	after this post i have recieved a lovely email_saying they will deal with this matter by tomorrow and fet back to me wish i am very pleased about , other than my previous comment my change to the has gone_smoothly do instead of 0 star i will at the minute improve my rating and see the outcome .
neutral	i paid extra for the priority service and it was delivered extremely quickly .
neutral	the 0d in the crystal looks impressive and it was sent in a nice black box .
neutral	however one of the faces from the front looks quite warped and ugly compared to the photo .
neutral	i didn ' t complain_about this because i don ' t know if this is an avoidable sort of thing or not .
neutral	i was skeptical from the beginning as all the 0d crystal websites including this one seem so unprofessionally presented - so i am happy with the service i received .
neutral	i was pleased with the delivery time , however when it arrived it was in a envelop which was not well bubble_wrapped to protect it , although it did not have any damage , it would have been easy for it to be caused .
neutral	also the protein shaker itself was so dusty !
neutral	it had obviously been stuck on a shelf somewhere gathering dust for quite some time .
neutral	also there was no receipt or paperwork enclosed with it .
neutral	i like the product , but because of the dust and lack of care , i won ' t be buying from them again .
neutral	in google it shows up as free delivery whereas it actually costs £ 0 . 00 for delivery in mainland and £ 0 . 00 + for n . i .
neutral	so the information supplied by the company on google_shopping is misleading
neutral	i ' ve ordered from shopto before and they are usually very good , but this time i ordered a high value item and they wouldn ' t accept my card_details .
neutral	in response to shopto : i have never had any issue with other_companies accepting my card .
neutral	when talking to my bank about your transaction they say it was accepted on their end , but you still refused it .
neutral	you also seem to respond to any criticism like a 00 year_old girl ...
neutral	and they never have anything in stock that i want - no wonder they are close to bust - online i save % 00 try onestopdigital instead .
neutral	my first issue arose while i was ordering a sofa .
neutral	i contacted customer support to make_sure they would be delivering it to my new address , and not my old one , as i was moving_house before the expected delivery date .
neutral	i was told it wouldn ' t be a problem .
neutral	brilliant !
neutral	a week before arrival , i had a phone call from argos wanting to check my postcode for delivery .
neutral	despite the woman on the other end of the phone speaking clear english , and being english myself , she then_proceeded to repeatedly ignore me , and my partner , after we kept telling her she was reading us my previous address .
neutral	at first , she read out my old address in its entirety , and after correcting her , she then read out a combination of my old and new address , but finally grasped my new address on the third attempt of explaining it to her .
neutral	as the following week arrived , my partner and i woke_up early expecting our new sofa to be delivered , after having waited 0 weeks .
neutral	we then got a phone call , explaining that it was on the wrong lorry , and being delivered to my old address .
neutral	* sigh *
neutral	when asking if they could just bring it any way , seeing as it wasn ' t that far to travel , it seemed laughable to the person on the other end of the phone , and we had to wait another 00 days .
neutral	my second issue , was that the bed we bought lasted only 0 months before the metal frame snapped .
neutral	yes , snapped .
neutral	all the wood slats remained intact , but some of the metal had been poorly soldered together , and had snapped right along the middle .
neutral	customer support explained that while we were covered for a replacement , it would take over a month to arrive , as our bundle was out of stock , ( bed with mattress bundle ) despite the frame on its own being in - stock .
neutral	although they did offer an_alternative , of paying approximately £_00 extra for something similar , with another mattress that we didn ' t need !
neutral	after quite a few phone_calls , and almost giving up , my partner managed to talk them round into sending a new frame from their stockpile .
neutral	their service and quality has been quite off - putting .
neutral	i have ordered from overclockers several_times over the years , often buying complete new pcs from there .
neutral	however , having done some shopping around recently , i have realised how uncompetitive their prices are .
neutral	sometimes , they are as much as 00_% more_expensive on individual components than their main competitor .
neutral	i could maybe forgive this if the rest of their service was superb , but unfortunately that ' s not always the case .
neutral	last time i ordered from overclockers my delivery failed to turn_up when it was supposed to .
neutral	on calling their customer_service , it turned_out that one of the items i had ordered was out of stock , despite saying it was in stock on their site .
neutral	i would have expected them to call or email me to let me know it was out of stock and whether i wanted an_alternative , or to at_least let me know that the delivery was going to be delayed .
neutral	all - in - all , scan has friendlier and more efficient customer_service , uses better delivery companies , and most_importantly is significantly_cheaper .
neutral	oh , and overclockers forums are extremely draconian , people are suspended and banned at the drop of a hat .
neutral	i was on a holiday tour couple of months_ago at derwentwater in the lake district .
neutral	we planned to visit the lake in detail and hire a boat from keswick launch company .
neutral	they serve us good .
neutral	if you need a payday_loan then most of the time you are in an_emergency .
neutral	i applied to cash genie and they gave me £_000 , which i then paid off .. i applied to them about a week_later asking for £_000 as unexpected direct_debits made my bank overdrawn .
neutral	they refused me the second time even_though i had paid off my previous loan in full and before time .
neutral	i asked them to look over their decision and tell me why i could not get another loan which they said they were doing .
neutral	no one contacted me back so i applied for a loan elsewhere .
neutral	a few_months passed and i decided to apply for £_000 for a week as i was in a spot of finantial trouble .
neutral	they accepted , with quite a high repayment of £_000 (£ 00 per £_000 ) and for a same day transfer to my bank cost my £_00 out of the initial £_000 .
neutral	i was left with £_00 and had to pay £_000 back .
neutral	this is all stated in their terms and conditions and their advisor who transfers the money asks you wether you want a same day transfer or to wait 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	of course you are going to opt into the " pay £_00 for same day fransfer " as like i said , if you are applying for a payday_loan then you are probably in an_emergency .
neutral	all this aside , i do not have the best credit_rating so to get a loan was a great help to me .. so i will be applying to cash genie again .
neutral	i am frequently ordering food off of just_eat .
neutral	i love their choice of food and the way you only have to go through the online page to get the food you want .
neutral	but everyone_knows that just_eat takes half an_hour over the stated delivery time .. all my friends have said the same_thing .
neutral	we still order with just_eat , but if we wanted food to be delivered at 0 .. we would have to order it at 0 . 00 .
neutral	i had a sky account , i was very happy with their services until i had to move house which they quoted me it would cost something like £_00 to set_up sky in my new house .
neutral	i said this is a ridiculous price as i am already a paying sky customer and i had already paid the charges to install sky in the previous house .
neutral	they said there was no way around this and i would have to pay .
neutral	i refused to pay and my sky services shortly got cut_off .
neutral	i thought i would have a look at my online bill to pay whatever was outstanding so it did not go against my credit history .
neutral	i logged in and to my horror it said i owed over £_000 as i had cut_off sky before my contract had ended .
neutral	i understand that you have got to pay if you get sky cut_off before your contract but i didnt cut of sky .. sky cut_off sky .
neutral	also they only cut it off as i had moved_house and refused to pay to move house .
neutral	they should have dealt_with my situation whereby we had an agreement , but they did not .
neutral	i still owe them this outstanding amount ( which accumalated 0 years_ago ) and i am not going to pay this amount .
neutral	i was disgusted by their service and when i phoned customer_services they were very rude and they cut me off .
neutral	i will never be able to go with sky again due to this outstanding amount i owe them , but so be it i am a very happy virgin_media customer now :)
neutral	i am a virgin mobile customer , my tarriff is very good as i am contracted to pay £_00 per_month for 000mins 000 texts and 0 gig of internet usage .
neutral	but i have had to phone 0000 numbers a lot off my mobile to get hold of the benefits system .. my bills on average are around £_00 a month due to these out of tarriff numbers .
neutral	due to these hurrendous charges i am making virgin mobile down on their rating .
neutral	their internet service is very good though , i have a log in page to view my bill online .
neutral	you can also access your last calls , your last texts and any payments you have made .
neutral	with online help and access to their numbers virgin mobile have a very good internet site .
neutral	i am writing a review as online reviews for lenders are important for other customers .
neutral	i was declined for a loan with quickquid but they were easy to sign_up to , did not charge me for anything and the customer_service is brilliant .
neutral	i did not get the loan probably due to my credit_rating ( not good but not bad ) and i spoke to a customer_service rep online who said i can choose to argue this in writing , which i am choosing not to do .
neutral	this lender has a very good repor and i advise you go with quickquid
neutral	after realising that the loan gets paid into the guarantors account and the risk to the guarantor is the same as if he / she were to get a loan themselves .
neutral	we found it was much_easier and cheaper for our guarantor to get a loan with a reputable loan company with a much_better monthly / interest rate .
neutral	i get the idea of amigo , but charging such high interest with a guarantor i feel is unwarranted .
neutral	with the risk to the guarantor , i would recommend if you get this desperate , ask you guarantor to go with a loan that is much cheaper and lend the money that way .
neutral	also i want to add , when a situation arose that a payment would not go through .
neutral	the same day , instead of getting in touch .
neutral	they take that monthly payment from your guarantors account .
neutral	at_least that ' s what happened in my case .
neutral	i have been using for over 0 years and i have watched as this company has slowly increased its prices and squeezed the average seller for almost every last penny .
neutral	if your selling smaller , cheaper items then it isn ' t too bad , but larger items incur final fees of 00_% or more , on top of the listing fees !
neutral	oh and lets not forget the additional paypal fees to which they now make you use on most of your auctions , so there getting twice the profits out of you , but that ' s ok because paypal is safe and secure isnt it ?
neutral	it has become a victim of its own success , over charging its users on a daily_basis !
neutral	its great to buy yes , but selling has become almost pointless as there fees are astronomical compared with what they used to be , making most items not worth selling .
neutral	i also find there customer support fairly useless , once you have a paypal case closed and your problem is still not solved , they are unwilling to help and simply ignore you .
neutral	as a result i sell as little as possible on ebay now , they have become a corporate money machine and not so much a family , friendly site .
neutral	the only time i purchase from game is when they have offers or promotions on ( not very often ), if they had more promo codes and online discounts many more people would shop there , but they are to arrogant to match prices with other online_retailers .
neutral	i find they are generally too expensive compared with other online_retailers , more often than not they charge more for pre_- owned games than for a new copy of the same game ?
neutral	like any big company , its all about how much they can milk out of the consumer and unfortunately many consumers don ' t use their brains and simple buy from game because of the brand name , rather_than shopping around .
neutral	i find the company far to corporate and greedy !
neutral	the only saving_grace was that i always got my games on time or usually the day before , unfortunately this was not the case recently when my game didn ' t come at all and i found game customer_service most unhelpful .
neutral	i generally come to get the best prices .
neutral	their website could use some updating as it ' s not the most user - friendly , but it gets the job_done .
neutral	i have ordered several things from musicstore . de and i have to say i have found them excellent in terms of being_able to deliver the goods on time and always intact .
neutral	i have even bought a few returned items from them at a discount and they always arrived and worked like new .
neutral	my problem with this particular store , stems from the fact that they are primarily selling most of their goods online , yet they seem to have an e_- mail department that is located within or close to a black hole , as you will never get a response .
neutral	a friend of mine ordered a custom guitar ( a prs ) from them and was willing to pay them 0 , 000_+ euro ' s for it .
neutral	it was order by request , so he placed his order and heard_nothing from them for about a week .
neutral	he emailed them and guess_what ?..... he never got a reply .
neutral	he cancelled his order after still_waiting for quite some time , and simply bought the guitar somewhere_else .
neutral	i had a problem with a combo amp i bought from them ( speaker cone cracked ) and so i e_- mailed them to find out if it was covered under the guarantee .
neutral	i never_heard_anything back from them .
neutral	a new speaker was quite cheap , and i didn ' t fancy sending the amp back any - ways , but i was still out of pocket and felt that they should have at_least answered my question .
neutral	i hope they sort out their e_- mail department , or else they will begin to see a steady stream of people with minor complaints and unanswered questions , simply take their business elsewhere .
neutral	i am cautious_about purchasing from them , as i think it shows a certain_amount of indifference to their customers when they don ' t bother to answer back .
neutral	we bought lots of stuff this year .
neutral	from flowers , bay trees , olive tree , paint , borders , electrical and lots of other things .
neutral	very good , if you know what you want .
neutral	if you ask the staff do not expect any help !
neutral	they don ` t care .... what a shame !
neutral	its ok but not as good as fb
neutral	low_prices , but messed_up order however customer_service was reasonable and order resolved quickly .
neutral	i first ordered an electric_guitar with amp about 0 weeks_ago , the estimated_delivery date was set for 0 days after i placed my order .
neutral	i e_- mailed them asking if i could get it any sooner , to be told that the reason for the late delivery is because it ' s currently out of stock .
neutral	fair_enough .
neutral	( would of been nice to of seen that when i was ordering it though ).
neutral	i then got an e_- mail the day after it was supposed to arrive , telling_me that their order still_hasn ' t come in from their supplier , but will arrive in 0 days time and then be dispatched to me within 0 days after that .
neutral	i then got another e_- mail the day after it was supposed to arrive again , telling_me that their supplier still_hasn ' t delivered the guitar , and i will now have to wait another week .
neutral	i cancelled my order straight_away , that means 0 weeks in total of waiting , i ' d had enough .
neutral	but giving them the benefit of the doubt , i made a new order , for the same exact guitar ( except the colour ), and made sure it was in stock before doing so .
neutral	this was today .
neutral	my estimated_delivery date is for tomorrow , and i ' ve just received an e_- mail telling_me it ' s been dispatched and it ' s on it ' s way .
neutral	so , presuming it does arrive to me tomorrow , i ' m a happy man !
neutral	as for the customer_service , i couldn ' t be more impressed with it .
neutral	every e_- mail i ' ve sent , i ' ve received a reply within the hour upon sending it .
neutral	even when i expressed my interest to cancel my first order , i received an e_- mail 0 minutes later apoligising for the situation , and saying that it has been cancelled .
neutral	so yeah , make of this what you will .
neutral	have to say i was really disappointed with the delivery from myprotein this time around .
neutral	i have ordered from the site on various other occasions and i recieved my products in a timely and expected manner .
neutral	however my recent transaction has seen me waiting 0days for " next_day delivery " products .
neutral	would of been nice to of been offered some form of free gift or mp reward_points
neutral	however with this aside the products are top - notch and beat most other brands in the same price category
neutral	i ' ve had a few issues with my server ( but i also know people with 000 who haven ' t had any ) but universally , the support staff have been top drawer and have exceeded my expectations .
neutral	i have a vps which became corrupted due to a 000reg upgrade , in my mind this is unacceptable but the support staff helped_me get things back up online .
neutral	you can ' t help but feel that support sometimes have their hands tied by policies they have no control over , but if it came down to it , i would recommend 000reg and i have been very satisfied by the customer_service if not necessarily the reliability of my purchase .
neutral	my order was split in two , the first part ( sofas ) could not have been better however had to wait nearly a month for the 0nd part ( coffee_table ) to arrive .
neutral	i also wanted my purchase to be a surprise , had the table been delivered at the same time this would have been a success however it was a complete fail and none of this was explained to me at the time of ordering or at the time of arranging delivery .
neutral	no one explained that i would not be receiving the complete order so was taken aback when the delivery driver said he didn ' t have it with him - it wasn ' t in stock - not what i was told when placing the order with the hunan being on the end of the phone .
neutral	it would have perhaps been better to delay delivery of the whole order rather_than have to wait nearly one month for it all to arrive .
neutral	the delivery driver however was very helpful and a credit to the company and the product i eventually got is good quality , although the table cover is somewhat ill fitting as it is too big .
neutral	would i use quatropi again ?
neutral	probably , but only if i check on delivery first .
neutral	searched everywhere for a suitable outfit for book day with a good postage price and time and jokers_masquerade fit the bill , the outfit arrived today but the sizing is completely wrong , there is no way it would fit 0 - 00 years it is an unsightly sack on my 0 year_old , needs 0inchs off each side , and the neckline is so big she can step through it !!
neutral	supposed a slimline dress , no time now to find another one so she is devastated ..
neutral	please look at sizings !
neutral	edit - just wanted to edit to say , i have used jokers in the past and been very happy adn would look to use them again in the future , in this instance i believe its the manufacturers fault and i hope jokers will follow_up on their comments in their reply to my review , its good to see that they take note and interest .
neutral	outfit has been altered by a friend luckily !
neutral	i would ' ve tried to return it if their had been time and if their had been any other stock available .
neutral	thank_you jokers for the reply
neutral	larger bras can be very expensive so their special_offers are much_appreciated .
neutral	the only_downside is they don ' t always seem to know what is in stock and have let me down twice now and the website can do ' strange ' things that make purchases time - consuming .
neutral	i ordered two monitors from cleverboxes via tesco_direct .
neutral	when i placed the order i was informed they would be ready for collection from my local_store the next_day .
neutral	when i arrived at tesco the monitors weren ' t there , and the staff , whilst attempting to be helpful , told me that they couldn ' t do anything and i ' d have to call cleverboxes myself to find out where my goods were ( and i ' d have to find the number myself because they didn ' t have it !).
neutral	cleverboxes only keep office hours and it was friday_evening , so i couldn ' t get in touch ' til after the weekend ....
neutral	i was less_than impressed .
neutral	on the positive side , i received a phonecall from cleverboxes the following_monday ( before i got around to calling them ) apologising for the delay and informing_me when the monitors would actually be ready for collection .
neutral	i also received an_email_confirming they were ready for collection .
neutral	collection was very smooth and the monitors are excellent .
neutral	i would recommend cleverboxes via tesco with the proviso that you take the delivery date as an estimate and don ' t try to collect your goods until you receive email confirmation that they have been delivered .
neutral	all told it took 0 days ( 0 working_days ) to receive my monitors and that ' s not bad - communication of delays could just be a little more timely .
neutral	we shop at asda to help control costs as they are generally the cheaper option with out resortiong to the own_brand stores like lidl and aldi .
neutral	unfortunately the range of products isn ' t great and if you want anything beyond the basics or a decent vegetarian choice then sainsburys or tescos is a better bet .
neutral	recieved my new pc today which i spent over £ 0000 .
neutral	i went directly to the courier depot as it is only about 00mins drive from my house .
neutral	after taking it out of the box i was immediately drawn to the the gtx_000 (£_000 +) hanging out of the pcie slot dangerously to the point a tug of it would have caused it to drop out of the slot completely probably causing severe damage to the graphics_card and motherboard i only noticed this by sheer chance because my pc case comes with a clear side_panel .
neutral	the graphics was not secure on the back panel either because there were no screws - bolts in place to keep the graphics_card from moving which is exactly_what they are designed to do so i assume who ever built the pc didn ' t bother as there were no screws lying inside either .
neutral	what would have happened if i had switched the pc on with the graphics_card in such a position i don ' t know but it wouldn ' t have been good either way .
neutral	i had to remove a sticker on the case which said void if removed to get the graphics seated back in place .
neutral	secondly the cables i think could have been managed a lot better there is a cable in particular running between 0 of the memory slots that bothers me .
neutral	i have ran multiple diagnostics on the pc to make_sure everything is working and in particular keeping an eye on the graphics_card and any signs it could be faulty i will send the pc back .
neutral	if it wasn ' t for these complaints it would be a 0 / 0 on build_quality .
neutral	would i buy from ginger0 again ?
neutral	i honestly couldn ' t say i would definately be inclined to shop around more before i placed an order again .
neutral	will be giving them a call monday to voice my concerns because a £_000_+ graphics_card not screwed to the case and not seated correctly is something they need to speak to the engineer about .
neutral	after awaiting all saturday at home ( as per the email received - from 0 . 00am till 0 . 00pm ) no one turned_up .
neutral	nobody rung to re - arrange or to cancel fitting .
neutral	saturdays day was wasted for me and my family .
neutral	really disappointed and will not use again .
neutral	update_: my tyres were delivered and fitted today ( monday ).
neutral	after all i believe etyres isn ' t a bad company and my case was more the exception than the rule so amending my rating to 0_stars .
neutral	will wait to see what flowers are like and whether delivery is good before giving a full review though
neutral	why ????????
neutral	?
neutral	i payed £_00 for 0 pairs of underwear .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of mediums all in the ' shorty ' style .
neutral	when they arrived they were 0 very different_sizes even_though they said they were all mediums !
neutral	paying this much money i would of expected all the mediums to be the same size !
neutral	not very happy to be honest !
neutral	i feel that i payed alot of money for not very good quality clothing .
neutral	the jeans i buy from here , stretch .
neutral	also , i bought a grey top with sequins , and they kept falling_off after a day .
neutral	i bought a cardigansize 00 and after a few_days it looked like size 00 !
neutral	!
neutral	some of the clothing is good quality , like the t -_shirts .
neutral	but to be honest , i have stopped buying from here as its a rip_off .
neutral	but it used to be my fav shop !
neutral	the only thing wrong was that i purchased ' glow in the dark , shot glasses ' and they didn ' t glow .
neutral	they were more like fluresent .
neutral	i also bought some glowsticks , but when i snapped them they also didn ' t work :(
neutral	apart_from that the other 0 things i bought were good , and the delivery time was good .
neutral	thanks
neutral	sophie
neutral	personally i like comfort and am not in the habit of trading .
neutral	they may be cheap but it shows and if you ' ve got a flight over an_hour then i ' d recommend a better airline .
neutral	found the check in staff to be quite regular and nothing with the airline blew me away in terms of service .
neutral	the mug seems good quality and for the price is a nice gift .
neutral	however the espresso cup i ordered which is plastic is disapointing , the picture is fine but i have never seen an espresso cup that big ( looks the size of a childs cup ).
neutral	i didnt realise it was plastic but that was my own mistake but the quality of it looks very cheap .
neutral	wouldn ' t of bought it if i had known this before hand .
neutral	kate reeve
neutral	as with all the zizi ' s you can pretty_much rely_on the food quality , and farnham is no exception .
neutral	the building is interestingly different , a big open space combining old and new , the staff are friendly and efficient , if you are around the area it is well worth a visit for lunch or dinner .
neutral	love the variety now of items on play ................. dvds , clothing , books and now second_hand items .
neutral	the only down fall to play is the delivery can take forever , play could do with making_sure items go out more promptly .
neutral	service overall i ' d rate 0 / 0 as website didn ' t show that tickets were for sale for my event on the summary page , even_though it did for all other nights at that venue ( i had to call and check ).
neutral	booking and payment was really easy but the sms service is totally pointless .
neutral	i know its only 00p , but it has no information about your event at all .
neutral	its just confirms my order id .
neutral	totally pointless !
neutral	for this reason i reduced my score to 0 / 0 .
neutral	customer_services were excellent though and quick to help with my problems .
neutral	the good thing about the site is that all available options are shown , so .. there will always be options of every kind for everybody ' s needs .
neutral	and really easy for payments with credit_cards ... except with my case .....
neutral	i took the 0000 sage 00 plus sage 0000 course having seen it reduced on reed . co . uk , and it seemed like a great opportunity .
neutral	i think if i ' d paid full price , i ' d have been very disappointed , but as it was , it wasn ' t too bad .
neutral	the product itself was rather boring , monotonous and repetitive , particularly if you made a mistake .
neutral	i did learn from it though .
neutral	there were also several errors during the assessments , which made the task of completing them incredibly difficult .
neutral	in the end i worked it out , but only through trial and error , and as i could only attempt each question twice per attempt at the test , the process of figuring_out what was wrong was rather laborious .
neutral	one error which stands out most was when a code needed to be typed into the a box of the wrong type , on a completely_different page to the one it should have been typed into .
neutral	the service team who helped_me seemed pleasant enough , but at times they didn ' t seem to understand what i was asking .
neutral	at one point i asked about whether i ' d be charged for a completion certificate , and received a reply that was only the lines of " no problem , the people at that e_- mail address will get back to you ", which didn ' t answer or even address what i ' d said .
neutral	what to say about orange , there ' s not a great deal to be honest .
neutral	they have above_average signal_strength down here in cornwall , although that ' s mostly down to their partnership with t - mobile , their customer_service is not brilliant but also not the worst i ' ve ever spoken to .
neutral	i ' ve had one or two problems with them in the past but they ' ve always been dealt_with albeit not necessarily in the quickest amount of time .
neutral	well most of the things i have bought from here have lasted at_least a season .. bu the bag i bought this month , it was thorn after 0 uses .
neutral	even for a fiver i expected to last for a bit longer !
neutral	i purchased a pair of shoes and bought the wrong_size .
neutral	i emailed them about an_hour after my purchase .
neutral	they didn ' t respond to me until 0 days_later saying it was too_late , 0 hours_later they sent me a tracking_number .
neutral	also it was $_00 to ship the shoes to the us so i can ' t return them .
neutral	fail .
neutral	sent me the wrong thing but replaced with better quality version
neutral	rung up , pleasant lady answered the phone , all went well until i couldn ' t provide other drivers details , was told to ring my insurance to get that info , rang my insurance , not allowed to give it me for data_protection , fair_enough , waited for scheduled call back from nah at 00 . 00 and didn ' t get the call until 00 . 00 .
neutral	she wasn ' t impressed that i couldn ' t get his info but when i told her i had set a password on my account so that she could ring and enquire wasn ' t interested .
neutral	transferred to solicitor who would handle claim and half my information had been input incorrectly so was a lengthy process to have to go through most of my details for a second time when i had already done so in the original phone call .
neutral	have been with nah once before this claim and was a much smoother process as i signed_up online , only benefit to ringing is that you get transferred to a solicitor there and then .
neutral	sold as working , and only got the non - working price for it :(.
neutral	oh well what ' s done ' s done .
neutral	thanks mazuma
neutral	i had a problem with a product but thankfulyl this has all now been resolved appropriately .
neutral	thanks to jane and harriet
neutral	regards ,
neutral	holly
neutral	the products are pretty good quality and reasonably_priced .
neutral	i do however have a few problems : i think that the customer_service is very very poor , taking a long time to reply or just completely ignoring you .
neutral	if you try to ask any question about how their products are made then they just avoid the question or palm you off .
neutral	if you ask about the quality of their whey , such as " what are the cows fed and do they use hormones ?"
neutral	then you won ' t get an answer .
neutral	they also need to have better offers and cheaper / free delivery to compete with some of the other online sites .
neutral	i bought a mattress called " relyon firm support mattress " which from the online description i believed to be a normal sized mattress which was firm and had excellent orthopedic support .
neutral	i have carefully checked the website and it is technically ' as_described ' yet is actually just a large block of memory_foam , not particularly firm and with no additional orthopedic properties other than being memory_foam .
neutral	although it does the job , i would not say it is as good value as a similar sprung mattress and i would say it is only worth around 0 / 0 of the price .
neutral	i have not contacted the company with my disappointment , as i am sure they would happily exchange the unused mattress - i just don ' t want the hassle of returning it etc and not having a mattress while i waited .
neutral	i would , however point out that in their online terms and conditions , they state that a mattress cannot be returned after removing from its packaging for hygiene reasons ; it is impossible to check the quality and suitability for purpose from within the packaging and so the t &_cs could be technically be invalid with reference to the sale of goods_act .
neutral	not good service
neutral	not badnot gr0
neutral	love the website !
neutral	!
neutral	was waiting in for my order , i was only called after the two hour delivery slot had passed , to be quite frank i was seething as i was counting on the delivery for dinner .
neutral	the driver was however very apologetic i will therefore use there services again .
neutral	i ordered from the site and contacted them when i hadn ' t received any communication about delivery after a week .
neutral	they replied to say it was out of stock , but more should be in soon .
neutral	when another week had passed , i contacted them again and they said it was being despatched .
neutral	this may have been coincidence , but it seemed as if i didn ' t get any information until i contacted them .
neutral	plus , it would have been better to know it was out if stock before i ordered .
neutral	zavvi . com as a site has the best prices i have seen they are extremely cheap , yet do not order a game expecting it to arrive till at_least 0 weeks after you ordered , their postage system is the worst i have ever_encountered it is atrocious .
neutral	so if not in a rush defiantly order from these_guys .
neutral	i used the free courier service as they recommended at the time i did my order , its been 00 days and they are saying they have not received my things although i have a receipt from hermes collection service with a tracking_number that states they have received my things ?
neutral	confused and worried after_reading some of the reviews on here now !
neutral	!
neutral	i shall update the process when i know more !
neutral	so the product itself is useable albeit a little basic .
neutral	but if you want to manage your domain or make any changes to the domain ( such as repoint name servers for instance ).
neutral	then be prepared for a few_days wait ... at_least .
neutral	if you ' re a complete beginner in this field then you might find this service useful .
neutral	but beware as you ' ll soon discover the limited scope of what ' s available .
neutral	if you want a professional looking site then i ' d suggest 0 & 0 as an easier alternative .
neutral	or teach yourself a modular system like joomla or drupal .
neutral	there ' s much more room for expansion there .
neutral	this seems to be a phoenix company of a similar brand called simplyelectronics . com .
neutral	well they ' ve taken a slamming in online forums for their service etc .
neutral	this seems to be another one of those .
neutral	they ship from_hong_kong and take their time to do so in many cases .
neutral	use with caution .
neutral	they are alright but sometimes they take_advantage when grading the device .
neutral	since you are recycling a device would expect some minor_scratches and stuff .
neutral	i have sent a couple of devices that in some recycle companies will pass as a grade device .
neutral	but zoomfish deducted £_00 -£ 00 because of a tiny scratch which doesn ' t affect phone functionality .
neutral	not happy with quoting because you not recycling a brand_new phone so if the phone has a minor scratch on the screen which you can ' t see with the naked when the phone is on , why deduct £_00 for that .
neutral	you are recycling company not carphonewarehouse .
neutral	if apple can give a refurbish phone for a faulty iphome with loads of scratches why can ' t a recycle company give you full value for a phone which has a tiny scratch on the back of the phone .
neutral	the concept is good , but only one company got back to me with a quote so i couldn ' t ' compare ' my move as i only have one quote to go on .
neutral	i also presumed that it would be like getting insurance quotes , put all the details in and it would pop up with the quotes and you would pick the one you wanted , so i guess i was disappointed that after putting my details in it just told me 0 companies would get back to me .
neutral	wouldn ' t use it again as i would just ring around next time as that ' s what i ended_up doing anyway .
neutral	after leaving this review i was told i needed to make my review more about the customer_service that ' compare my move ' offered , so just to keep them happy i will say that there was 0 customer_service , i put my details into the website , clicked a button and got 0 call back .
neutral	i would say that ' s pretty bad customer_service !
neutral	hope this pleases the review company now !
neutral	i just found these a little expensive , but you do get some great products from them .
neutral	tried to buy a product from the parts counter , just to find the staff were outside fitting a new stereo in one staff_members car !!
neutral	!
neutral	i found the service i had with them to be great , but the amount of junk_mail you get after is unreal , i ended_up putting it in the junk_mail box , now meaning all there emails go in there , so in effect it has backfired on them , as i now see no advertising from them at all .
neutral	one email a month would be plenty
neutral	- review updated with further purchase -
neutral	initially , with my first purchase , my item took 0 week for their customer_service to inform me of no stock , which had been planned to coincide with a trip , and their compensation proposal was insulting opposed to apologetic .
neutral	the money was received , owned for a while and i had presumed the transaction was completed until the awkward notification of the opposite .
neutral	incidentally , the item was cheap compared to elsewhere too - offering few alternatives .
neutral	however , they subsequently offered a higher compensation , still slightly insulting to me ( personally ) but fair overall , and i accepted it openly for their business to a second chance - certainly a risk when they had failed my first order ever .
neutral	delivery was efficient , item was competitively_priced , dispatch was rapid , condition of product was flawless and the item was as_described - all reasonable as expectation ( s ).
neutral	i am content with the second purchase and i will certainly consider shopping in the future with their business if my confidence remains developed from the first disappointing_experience .
neutral	whilst in the usa , on a new account of a partner ' s console , i purchased an excess of $_000 in downloads and these were not accessible once i returned home .
neutral	is it any surprise when they once considered locking discs to specific consoles ?
neutral	i thought they ' d belong to my account , and i ' d have ownership as a british citizenship to take them with me , but they ' ve become overly possessive of downloads which although flexible - open to their discretion in access - they create rules / restrictions which adversely , unfairly effect the user - a practice no one should endorse if they care for reasonable ownership of their products .
neutral	incidentally , due to microsoft ' s implied actions during the xbox one ' s launch - interestingly reserved but reflective of their intentions as a corporate body - and the relation of these to my experience , i obviously avoided them as i do not want to support these implicit principles in action - very constrictive to the consumer ' s ownership , their rights to be flexible with their purchase .
neutral	i ' m delighted they have competition or they ' d simply implement these awful conditions happily and i doubt any legislative power has the concern of the industry to intervene ( hence the already abhorrent activities present at times ).
neutral	otherwise , i ' ve enjoyed their excellent service , brilliant catalogue , maintenance and security - none of these as detrimental to a fun overall subscription to them .
neutral	their console is excellent and so is their software .
neutral	additionally , with the introduction of discounts and free titles for gold members , i think there ' s a respectful incentive to become one .
neutral	although i won ' t complain with the features , and how sony has the decency to not region - lock downloads as microsoft does ( causing me issues from purchases when in the usa for months ), it has the audacity to have unfair pricing in europe whilst impeding access to multiple / other accounts on the vita easily for international users who travel regularly ( to viably take advantageous prices which should be normal ).
neutral	when sony controls the market , they shouldn ' t need to inflate prices over 000_% for a certain regional market , lack the initiative to ensure all content is equally available and inhibit people who have the incentive to care for international accounts ( i . e .
neutral	possess multiple accounts as they either live in multiple nations or travel to these frequently ).
neutral	from hours being wasted with the following message during checkout :
neutral	" this product ran out of stock while you were shopping or you have already bought the maximum amount in the current or pending order ."
neutral	to the inability to organize searches to prices or search for specific items which took interest before , i think the browsing experience , and the inconvenience affecting it , is highly flawed .
neutral	although i had £_000 in my basket , with £_000 worth removed due to the mentioned issue , i was soon to drop all of it , leaving their service in irritation .
neutral	i love a lot of the clothing you find in primark .
neutral	cheap and cheerful , that ' s all it ' s about ... and in that department , they definitely pass 000_%.
neutral	sure , a lot of the clothing does seem to fall_apart pretty sharpish , but that ' s not always the case .
neutral	customer_service is something they might want to work on .
neutral	i ' ve met many bright happy people in primark , but i ' ve also met some seriously rude and angry people who need to learn that when you come to work , you put your game face on and just deal with it .
neutral	a good network however the coverage isnt always great .
neutral	but all the tariffs are good on pay and go simplicity and unlimited
neutral	i recently ordered an xbox through tesco_direct with an estimated_delivery of 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i went to the store 0 times and it still hadnt arrived .
neutral	on the 00 / 00 / 00 i decided to check out where it was through live_chat and was told there wasn ' t any movement on the item from the depot on the 00th even_though i had received the item is on it ' s way email .
neutral	as there was no movement on the tracking since the 00th i was told after 00_hours of no movement it would be classed_as lost .
neutral	i wish they would have told me that by the 00th and i would have looked around for another replacement .
neutral	i got a refund plus the £_00 i ' m sorry compensation but as it was a present and the birthday is tomorrow i will have an unhappy birthday boy on my hands unless i go out and buy one at a lot higher price in the shops .
neutral	also every time i went to the local click and collect the staff were clueless i had to wait around for someone to come and deal with it then they kept getting my name wrong and even came down with someone_else ' s parcel .
neutral	after ordering my biggest purchase of clothes online ever i was super excited to receive my package .
neutral	the clothes came very fast !
neutral	within 0 days when it said it would take 0 - 00 .
neutral	all of the clothes were too big on me ( that ' s better_than being too small though , that ' s what usually happens to me when i order online ) i do like the clothes but i ' m not sure if they are worth the price , and even_though they do offer free shipping .. i had to pay a lot of duty .. i was very surprised on how much the duty was .
neutral	most of my items were a bit see through .. and don ' t fit me quite the way they should .
neutral	you can get similar clothes the same style at a thrift store .
neutral	over all though it could of been worse and i am not disappointed with my order .
neutral	only on passing by that we noticed the amazing deals and quality of furniture that we had decided after being abroad for 0 year to completely furnish our house with their furniture .
neutral	arrived very quickly and yes very heavy to put_together .
neutral	i was dissapointed that our rustic table had a very badly_damaged leg which i rang to request that another leg be sent out .
neutral	i had to chase this after a week as i had heard_nothing even_though customer_service were very helpful .
neutral	but did they then only ask me to send a picture so they could send the correct leg ( why was i not asked this a week before when i called ) it then arrived 0 days_later ( waiting int total for 00 days without using a table ) to which when the leg arrived it was the wrong_colour and wrong_size .
neutral	i was so upset about this especially as we had spent over 0000 pounds in store .
neutral	customer_service apologised and arranged for another to be sent out which arrived 0 days_later ( total of 00 days ) which was the correct leg .
neutral	this is my only dissapointment .
neutral	other than that its beautiful good quality furniture .
neutral	many_thanks faye gordge
neutral	my parcel was of a sensitive and private nature and it was left with my neighbour - who i do not get on with .
neutral	the parcel was on time , but very annoyed at it being left with a neighbour
neutral	good place to order from .
neutral	great selection .
neutral	if they miss something , all you need to do is call and talk to a friendly customer_service rep . only thing is they limit the number of samples of each product .
neutral	heck they get them free so why so stingy .
neutral	and you have click and scroll constantly for them .
neutral	but they treat me good and i do recommend them a lot .
neutral	i expected dpi much more but they failed to deliver
neutral	we was slightly dissapointed when the bouquet arrived .
neutral	i paid extra for the deluxe edition & i can ' t see what i got for the extra money .
neutral	the item wasn ' t delivered till after 0pm & there was water inside the packaging which_resulted_in the card becoming wet .
neutral	would not reccommend .
neutral	bad values for money
neutral	ordered my skis on sunday 0rd apr as they were the only one i could find that had k0 one luv .
neutral	having read their estimated_delivery time of 0 ~ 0 working_days , i thought i would receive my skis quite soon .
neutral	when i phoned to check the order status on 00th_april i was told that binding has been fitted and would despatch that evening
neutral	today is 00th_april , having received neither despatching notice nor my skis , i rang and asked again .
neutral	apparently , it was still being fitted with its bindings ( i was told that they were fitted yesterday !)
neutral	and should despatch this evening .
neutral	btw my account has already been billed last friday !
neutral	wish the order processing were as efficient as the billing process .
neutral	this is the first time and last time i will be order anything from ellis_brigham .
neutral	edit_:
neutral	00th apr : contacted by customer_service , matter resolved , rating adjusted accordingly .
neutral	thank_you mark .
neutral	booked a slot between 0 - 00 whilst at work , fitter didn ' t call with a more specific time , as the email promised .
neutral	i called them , got told the fitter was 00_mins away in traffic .
neutral	00_mins later still no show .
neutral	i had to call again as leaving the office , and rebook for that afternoon at home .
neutral	once the fitter arrived , service was brilliant , the fitter worked really quickly to get both tyres done in under 00_mins .
neutral	price was good compared to other_places , and still a better experience than sitting around in a cold waiting room for an age ......
neutral	i think mazuma_mobile is a very well_established company with an amazing service and you can trust them 000_%.
neutral	when i was selling them my samsung jet for £_00 . 00 i got payment right away , but i would of had a better experience if they paid out more money on phone models .
neutral	i was considering selling mazuma my htc hd desire but as they only pay out £_000 i do not want too .
neutral	i find this very sad as i trust mazuma more then any other recycling company out there but i would really_appreciate it if they could higher there payout .
neutral	at_least to a more reasonable payout price so i could be happy with parting with my phone knowing that i have been given a fair price .
neutral	i know its only one person , s opinion but i think it is something worth thinking about because i know if you made your prices higher i would allways recycle with mazuma_mobile .
neutral	thanks for taking the time to read this comment mazuma team and i hope you have a very nice day .
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	mr cameron starkey
neutral	i bought dark_souls 0 , i got a email from them then clicked the download , i put in my phone number then clicked send sms i waited for ages to receive it but it never came i send to a different phone and it works a bit disappointing but it worked eventually but still not very happy
neutral	for the past 0 years , i have booked every trip with expedia .
neutral	i have never had any complaint .
neutral	it has been easy to book , i got exactly_what i wanted for a very reasonable_price and everything_ran_smoothly .
neutral	this year we booked our holiday and a minor error was made on our part with the details of persons travelling .
neutral	due to us getting_married last_year , my name had changed but i hadn ' t thought to change it on the expedia account .
neutral	when booking the holiday , we just added the travellers that were already listed on our account , not thinking about the name change .
neutral	after booking , we realised the mistake and contacted expedia to get the name changed .
neutral	i was shocked to find they were so unhelpful , rude and unwilling to help .
neutral	we were told we would have to cancel the holiday , on which we would not get a refund and rebook the holiday in the correct name .
neutral	therefore effectively pay for the holiday twice .
neutral	after many phone_calls to expedia over several days , they maintained this lack of customer_service .
neutral	therefore we contacted the airlines and hotels we were flying / staying with and explained the situation .
neutral	they all stated as far as they were concerned , they had no issue , just needed a copy of the marriage certificate and that would suffice .
neutral	they could not understand_why expedia were being so difficult .
neutral	this was explained to expedia , but they still refused .
neutral	therefore we had to go back to each and every airline and hotel and kindly request that they make contact with expedia on our behalf and explain their view .
neutral	ultimately , everything got sorted out and all we had to pay was the admin_fee .
neutral	subsequent trips , we have already booked with another company .
neutral	expedia , you seriously need to sort out your customer_service .
neutral	following this i should have only given you 0 star , but to be fair i have to give higher_than that only because of my lack of complaints in previous years .
neutral	it was a good experience , i used hostelworld most of the time but had good experience this time hotlerbookers .
neutral	please stop messing with facebook it gets confusing sometimes and very annoying
neutral	just leave it as it is !!
neutral	!
neutral	these days i expect anyone that charges for delivery to turn_up pretty fast .
neutral	took 0 days !
neutral	other than that decent experience .
neutral	sometimes a great site to purchase but refund procedure not good
neutral	they advertise free fee weekends but yet i still get charged .
neutral	love ebay for buying , hate to sell .
neutral	the order came very quickly , i was quite impressed when i saw it in my mailbox .
neutral	however when i opened it one of the eyeshadow was smashed as they weren ' t wrapped seperately with bubble_wrap and the whole bag was stained with the eyeshadow powder .
neutral	to be onest , not a fan of horror games , and i got something called blacksoul .
neutral	them ' s the brakes of random i guess .
neutral	+++++
neutral	earned several hundreds of £ buying things i would anyway or on the risk free gambling sites .
neutral	easy to use , make_sure you clear your cookies .
neutral	---------
neutral	on a couple of occasions for absolutely no reason , cashback has been declined , usually by a merchant who has left the site , and quidco aren ' t very helpful at getting it back .
neutral	they will just provide generic reasons even when you contact their specific ' declined cashback team ', so don ' t bank on getting the cashback .
neutral	£ 0 fee if you are a premium member .
neutral	great places to shop love them but just to far away from me
neutral	the logistics of moving around a group of 00 are never going to be easy but on the whole chillisauce did very well , particularly with the transport side of things .
neutral	the activity organised ( shooting ) was excellent and provided a welcome distraction from the weekend ' s drinking .
neutral	however , the guided pub_crawl was disappointing and if you ' re relying on the guide to show you the best of [ amsterdam ] then you will be disappointed .
neutral	the guided pub_crawl gave the impression that you were being taken to those establishments giving the tour_guide / chillisauce ( i don ' t know which , honestly ) the biggest kick back !
neutral	individually it ' s relatively inexpensive ( we paid £_00 each ) but when you total it up , it ' s almost £_0k .
neutral	a great business_model !
neutral	!
neutral	its very difficult to comment on how affordable or good they are compared to other_companies offering the same service .
neutral	during the process i actually got one plate released quicker by contacting dvla directly .
neutral	i just decided i didn ' t want it over this one .
neutral	they did their job in terms of successfully applying for my plate to be released and bidding for it on the online auction , so no_complaints there .
neutral	the process took longer_than_expected , having being told the plate would go to auction in july , it ended_up being in october .
neutral	email communication was awful .
neutral	i ended_up dealing_with three different people .
neutral	the original person just simply did not return my emails ... so i never got confirmation that they received my forms , or when it was going to auction .
neutral	this resulted_in a phone call to be told i would need to submit the forms again .
neutral	having done this , i had to chase them up again to get confirmation whether they ' d received them .
neutral	i then never actually got a reply as to when it was going to auction ( bear in mind months of waiting ).
neutral	i just suddenly had a text to say it was going to auction today and to be prepared for a call .
neutral	perhaps a one off , but regardless a very frustrating experience .
neutral	if i hadn ' t been so busy with work , i think i would have done this myself and saved their admin_fee .
neutral	i ordered some business_cards recently .
neutral	i designed them myself and uploaded it to the vistaprint website .
neutral	the whole_process was very easy and quick .
neutral	every action was confirmed so no mistakes could be made .
neutral	i paid for a quick delivery and it arrived when expected .
neutral	my only complaint is that the cards where slightly skewed to one side .
neutral	i know from working in the trade in the past that this happens when the printer is not running at the right tempature or on the correct paper weight setting .
neutral	but for the price i paid i could not be bothered to send them back .
neutral	i get loads of offers sent to me by email .
neutral	i haven ' t taken them up on any yet but i might do to see if they improve on quality .
neutral	i used to buy almost all my blu - rays / dvd ' s and games from play . com exclusively but , over the last_year or so i have been let_down by them on more_than one_occasion .
neutral	pre_- ordered items showing up several days after release on several_occasions is the deal_breaker for me .
neutral	i know you might be saying that it ' s the courier or royal_mail that is delivering it late but when you speak to play . com there responce is wait 0 more days and call us back .
neutral	0_stars as i might just be unlucky or my postman hates me !
neutral	can you send me the email with fly tickets ?
neutral	i don ' t recieved them .
neutral	thanks petr z .
neutral	i ordered flower to be delivered before 0pm on valentines_day !
neutral	and i waited all day and finally the flowers were delivered after 0pm !
neutral	the flowers do not look fresh and different to the photos on their website !
neutral	i emailed them but there was no response at all !
neutral	however i was refunded after a week and received a letter explaining the delay and apologies for their late delivery .
neutral	so i am happy with the way they dealt_with my complaint and hope they will keep improving their services .
neutral	been ordering for awhile from them with no_problems , but lately my orders have been taking a week to arrive , and that frustrated me even more when i found out that theres actually a store about an_hour and a half away from me how does it take that long ???
neutral	and the only reason i just ordered again was cause last time i did i only got part of my order but still got charged for it , i asked them to just send me the product but refunded me instead so now here i am waiting forever again
neutral	in the past i have used mcafee .
neutral	but never again .
neutral	i had to format my last hard_drive after mcafee let through several trojan viruses while one trojan was displaying its " you are infected " messages on the screen , i did a full scan and mcafee couldent find anything the matter .
neutral	also mcaffe slows the computer down too much .
neutral	its not completely_useless but there are better products on the market .
neutral	on the screen it said my order was in stock but it did not arrive so i chased them and then found it was out of stock which was not ideal .
neutral	great introductory deals but gets expensive as not really enough provided to keep you going all day with no lunch so if your a normal person like me you end up buying a sandwich too costing you double and defying the healthy goodness of the graze box !
neutral	not bad :_d but gave me a game code of a game i all ready own lol so maiby not a good idea .
neutral	good arrived on time and price was good .
neutral	however their website is unsecured - no https for login .
neutral	i can ' t trust them on the basis of this .
neutral	it ' s a small matter to sort out a certificate and secure the site !
neutral	i order a picture from amazon local for my daughters christmas_gift , the packaging is great !
neutral	however i have received two pictures damaged , obviously prior to them being wrapped for delivery .
neutral	the delivery was reasonably quick .
neutral	i rang up to tell them that the corners of the picture frame were damaged , as i felt i couldn ' t give someone a damaged gift !
neutral	the man who dealt_with me was very rude and difficult to communicate with .
neutral	because of the pictures being a great quality i ordered another one for myself , again it arrived damaged but very well_packaged ?
neutral	i would recommend people buying images from here but just hope it comes without any dents or marks !
neutral	despite this the pictures are a great quality .
neutral	ebay is just an amazing concept !
neutral	shame the sellers fees are soooo expensive and not being_able to leave non paying / rubbish buyers negative_feedback is really poor
neutral	purchased an omega_seamaster at what was abit of a premium price ( could have been sourced cheaper from a personal sale ) but went with watchfinder due to the warranty / good overall reviews - especially as i have had poor luck with pre_owned watches sold privately on auction sites lately .
neutral	iniatial email exchanges were fast and a deal was struck and paid for within hours , the phone call to confirm delivery was a nice personal_touch .
neutral	upon delivery though i was rather dissapointed when i examined the watch .
neutral	the hour hand had extremely bad and noticeable scratches over it , im presuming from mishandling during a service - not what i was expecting to see after a £ 0000 + sale and after_reading on the site how their quality_control is so strict .
neutral	further inspection showed a scratched / scuffed crystal , dust and lint on the dial and a gouged caseback .
neutral	nowhere on the item page were these problems written about , i understood that it was a preowned watch , but thought these problems were abit much to have not been noticed by watchfinder .
neutral	after informing watchfinder of the problems , we exchanged some emails and agreed a solution - email exchange was a little slower for sorting_out an issue than it was forming the deal .
neutral	i will not go into detail on the agreed solution other than to say it was satisfactory to me as the buyer and watchfinder as the seller .
neutral	now the problems are sorted ( while having my local watchmaker fix the issues he found a few more minor faults such as a loose minute hand , dry caseback seal , stem and crown not engageing properly etc ...) i am now happy with the watch and the outcome , however i feel i have to be honest in this review and possibly suggest that the watches need to be inspected to a higher standard before being sold - or any_issues be clearly_stated on the item description .
neutral	overall not the worst place to buy a pre_owned watch , but check your purchase on arrival . after paying out at the higher end of my budget i didnt expect to have extra work ontop to get the watch upto standard .
neutral	would i recommend ?
neutral	for service , personal responses etc yes i would , for cost / quality ?
neutral	maybe ... but would suggest asking any and all questions before sealing the deal .
neutral	would i buy again ?
neutral	thats a tough call , in all honesty i am a little put off , but would probably take a chance if something really took my fancy .
neutral	finally i have to give a thankyou to sam at watchfinder who throughout was helpful and dealt_with all my questions , issues and concerns in a professional_manner .
neutral	0 out of 0 for product , 0 out of 0 for customer_service
neutral	unfortunately after several_occasions where items were missing from my order , out of date or incorrect , i had to swap to tesco online .
neutral	however asda was always cheaper .
neutral	outfit generally good apart_from problem with hat
neutral	everything was perfect , less the days that i have to wait to have my products !
neutral	shipping was very slow .
neutral	after needing to change my parcel booking i immediately sought out some way of amending it or contacting someone to do this for me , changing it online was impossible , finding a number on their website impossible too .
neutral	i managed to find a phone number which isn ' t used any more , they prompted me to try the live_chat on their website , which doesn ' t exist .
neutral	eventually i found a live_chat service via their facebook_page , a good idea and the agent was very helpful but this could have been a 0 star_rating if they make it easier to contact .
neutral	the second day after writing the below review , they have contacted me and said " first of all i would like to apologise for the delay in dispatch however we have tried to email you previously on the email address you would have provided when placing the order ."
neutral	apparently my email is only able to receive the order placement email but , not any other emails from them .
neutral	and since my review was misleading " according to them ", i have to say that i did get a refund after two_weeks of contacting them through their website .
neutral	so if you would like a quick respond post a review in here * _ *
neutral	i ordered a mobile two_weeks_ago and its not dispatched until this moment .
neutral	i tried to call them but no answer at all .
neutral	i also tried to contact them via the live_chat but they ' re never online , so i had to fill a form on their website and send it in but no reply at all .
neutral	i tried to cancel the transaction through my bank but its not possible as they locked it , and they even have taken the money off my bank_account .
neutral	bad_experience
neutral	bad customer_service
neutral	and i would guess they got bad quality devices
neutral	i joined this company as a lovefilm games refugee and they do have a broad selection of games advertised for rental but it seems that most have long wait times .
neutral	strangely the older games that you would expect to be quicker to post out actually seem to take longer .
neutral	new games arent too much of a wait to get hold of but the turn_around is pretty slow .
neutral	whereas with lovefilm i could send a game back and get a new one 0 days_later im finding that with boomerang im sending games back and getting a new one 0 to 0 weeks_later which is pretty poor .
neutral	still , if you add up that you could have at_least 0 games per_month its still cheaper to rent than it is to buy , even pre_- owned especialy since games are becoming more and more prohibitively expensive .
neutral	the returns envelopes are good and simple to use .
neutral	overall , fair service , saves a lot of money but needs growth
neutral	well , the price offered is competitive and is cheap .
neutral	hopefully it ' s trustable :)
neutral	recently flew with ryanair and to be on the safe side opted for a baggage_allowance so not to be stung with added fees at the airport .
neutral	check - in was fast and there was no queue which was good .
neutral	the airline gets to from a to b ( usually via a train into the city ) but it ' s value for money ... cheaper_than the rest for what i wanted .
neutral	not after luxury here , just to get to my destination at a good price .
neutral	i did find however that the airline staff were constantly up and down selling stuff ... but i guess that ' s business for you !
neutral	i recently joined the orange network .
neutral	when i went into a store to ask about joining up as a pay as you go customer ( after waiting a few mins to be served ) i was told that i could sign_up on a month by month_contract type basis ... i did this as was told it would suit me best in terms of value .
neutral	however it involved serveral calls to the customer_service helpline to register and change over from payg to pay_monthly .
neutral	( was given 0 sim_card to make it complicated !)
neutral	i am happy with my plan now but thought the process of signing_up was a bit complex and felt that i wasnt given the quickest option to suit me ...
neutral	we had a smooth day with timing and organisation and maps and plentiful champagne on the punt !
neutral	we really_enjoyed ourselves .
neutral	however the meal was almost a complete_disaster .
neutral	when booking i stressed the importance if 0 in the party witg specific dietary needs and was reassured we had a choice of the full menu and needs would be catered for .
neutral	when we arrived however we were given a different menu with a choice of 0 pizzas and nothing else .
neutral	when we spoke to the manager we werenmade aware that this is their specific events menu and chilli_sauce know this but theu keep getting customers whom are not aware of this limited menu .
neutral	however he was very helpful and allowed us all to stray back to the original menu at no extra_cost to us .
neutral	it could have spelt disaster otherwise .
neutral	so mass lack of research and communication on chilli_sauce ' s behalf .
neutral	i ' ve left my original review below but things have not gone as well this time .
neutral	two parcels were collected from the same address for delivery but got split up , only one delivered to me on the 0th_oct .
neutral	first contact with live help agent that evening was as my original review ( below .)
neutral	i was told the two parcels were separated at the depot and would probably come tomorrow - also that this sometimes happens .
neutral	tomorrow came and went , no parcel .
neutral	again contacted live help agent who promised to email me after they had contacted the courier for information - so apparently the courier now has the parcel and not the depot ?
neutral	most of the day went by with no email .
neutral	i contacted late evening to ask what was happening - told that the courier could not be contacted , my separated parcel was probably on the way .
neutral	repeated contacts , repeatedly told to hang on .
neutral	both parcels were collected together on the 0th of october , one arrived alone ( clearly and repeatedly marked ' 0 of 0 ') on the 0th of october and its now the 00th with no sign of the second .
neutral	less_than gruntled .
neutral	first review which i posted 0th_oct and reflected my previous experiance of parcel0go follows ...
neutral	had several parcels delivered by parcel0go now and no_problems at all .
neutral	a couple of times i ' ve had questions that were answered late evening by them via live_chat ( jessica was friendly and helpful just 0 mins ago which prompted me to post this review .)
neutral	i ' m usually having glassware delivered so this was initially a concern as you can imagine !
neutral	not a single breakage or even dented box !
neutral	pay attention post_office !
neutral	thouroughly recommend .
neutral	i have been using since 0000 and also recommended others to do so - i am now hesitant in recommending have had to chase 0 of my last 0 transactions -
neutral	yes i know clear the cookies etc been there done that - don ' t tell me to do it again - now transactions being chased for payment speed new standard answer is leave it another 0 weeks - also friend who has signed_up has had to chase 0 / 0 last transactions getting frustrating to use and as a few others have mentioned not as quick with customer_service or payouts as [_external reference_].
neutral	play - asia is a great website as it stocks a lot of difficult to get items in europe , the prices are a little_steep but i suppose if you are looking for hard to get items then you have to expect a price hike .
neutral	the shipping is where i would say this company loses out on getting the other two stars , it takes a long , long time to get to it ' s destination and i felt that once you order from them and they have your money they are not very forthcoming with their communication .
neutral	i joined orange a few_years_ago because i was unhappy with the service another phone service was providing me with , initially orange gave me a good deal with my phone contract but it seems that after four years of being a loyal_customer i am no_longer profitable to them , as they are no_longer willing to offer " perks " to keep my contract with them when it is up for renewal .
neutral	overall , make_sure you get the best deal you can when joining orange as a new customer , but perhaps leave when your contract is up for renewal as you are just a sum of money to them .
neutral	you won ' t find better prices on the internet especially with their 0 % price_match guarantee .
neutral	this does come at a price though as i have had multiple orders not ship for 0 - 0 days .
neutral	shop here if you want the best prices , but be prepared to wait a bit longer for your products than you would from some of the more popular websites .
neutral	i was asked to crop my 000kb jpg , which i didn ' t want to do .
neutral	anyway , i made the crop of the full size and the preview showed it hadnt cropped to the full size .
neutral	i try to redo , and this time click the " x " at the top of the cropping box ( as in not wanting to crop at all ).
neutral	i was then taken back to the card message box which i had to redo as this time it was empty !
neutral	after this , i assumed i ' d have another go uploading a photo but i wasn ' t prompted to !
neutral	no way to go back either !
neutral	also , had to use another site as no next_day delivery to netherlands available .
neutral	not very good so far !
neutral	i listed my house with house_network for a very reasonable_price and even managed to use a discount_code to get 0 %_off of the cost ( code gocsvtckce ) and i had 0 viewings on the property and the 0rd person made an offer which i accepted .
neutral	i decided to use a local solicitors instead of the ones you can use through house_network just purely on a cost basis .
neutral	however my buyer used their solicitors and i must_say it was stressful , they needed constant chasing up by the buyer and my solicitors .
neutral	i do not know why they drag their heels .
neutral	steer_clear of the people they recommend for solicitors / conveyancing .
neutral	use this discount_code for 0 %_off gocsvtckce .
neutral	a quick simple review of game , don ' t buy pre_- owned items from this company as they do not check if they work correctly and give you a terrible refund .
neutral	i would definitely buy from this company but just not from the pre_- owned selection .
neutral	gumtree is a eager company with a high ambition .
neutral	it is quite vulnerable to hackers and could do with some sort of sorting system e . g .
neutral	price - high to low
neutral	condition - new or used
neutral	more options such as wanting to display where you live should be a basic ' button click '.
neutral	probably the thing that i found most irritating was that you cannot search for just ' scotland ' or ' england , you have to go through all the major places .
neutral	in conclusion i would recommend this company but be cautious in doing so .
neutral	the company were a pleasure to deal with , and as a last_minute gift you couldn ' t complain with there next_day delivery unfortunately when delivered the flowers had little to no smell and the life span were only about 0 days
neutral	hey , i recently_purchased two tickets to sensation white at the plesuredome , amsteradam and unfortuantely the person who did it for me put in the wrong email address .
neutral	after repeatedly gurning the house down i now do not know how to get the e tickets sent to the correct address .
neutral	could you please help .
neutral	my transaction_id is 0000000 and i have sent a help email on the sight stateing the problem and the correct email address the tickets need to be sent too , im just not sure if it will be dealt_with in time as i have heard extremely mixed_reviews about the site so im kind of grasping at straws as i have seen that there have been some replies from via .
neutral	these tickets have alot riding on them , and are worth a pretty penny or two .
neutral	thankyou in_advance .
neutral	twice , when filling in my details , i was taken right back to the " index " page of offers , and my progress lost .
neutral	it was very easy to follow the instructions , and choices were well_presented , but this issue was quite infuriating .
neutral	i had to sign_up to facebook just to make a post .
neutral	make is so people that dont use facebook can sign_up easy
neutral	as for looking for reviews on google for this place its so difficult all the companies should be registered to view .
neutral	decided to try musclefood . com after raving reviews everywhere_else , decided to try out the 0kg chicken_breast offer for £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i ' m disappointed to say the least , the meat is like it has been butchered by a work experience kid , lots of fat , grissle and connective tissue left hanging on , i was under the impression the 00kg weight was a ' clean / trimmed weight '.
neutral	in contradiction to the claims of no added salt or water , the label also clearly_stated ' may contain added water / sodium ' - whats that about then ?
neutral	finally , although not mf ' s fault , the meat is halal which i did not see before , had i have known this i would not have ordered as i find halal to be a cruel and filthy practice , however that is just my opinion .
neutral	the breasts are larger than supermarket standard as they state , but when buying by weight anyway , does it really matter ?
neutral	overall , ok considering price but won ' t be using again , will pay the little extra for the local butchers .
neutral	i ordered some protein_bars and some protein muffins , the muffins ran out of date to days after i received them ...
neutral	didn ' t really give me enough time to eat them !
neutral	!
neutral	brought this mattress , and it turned_up as a tiny cylinder , very ecologically friendly , very tidy , very modern .....
neutral	however , it means i had to open the packaging to find out i had brought the wrong one .... so ..... this isn ' t a problem though is it ... oh no wait !!!!!
neutral	it is !!!!!!!!
neutral	t &_cs ... we cannot refund or replace mattress ' s that have been opened .
neutral	so now i have something to sell on ebay
neutral	you get what you expect for the price , unless you ordered an hugely priced , not very impressive meal .
neutral	it gets you to your destination in one piece so thats fine by me .
neutral	i must_admit that i have bought a few gaames from cjs_cd_keys with a good experience and have received game keys almost_instantly but on saturday i decided to pre_- purchase theif as my mate did it and he said after you get the code you can pre_- load it .
neutral	after i purchased the game i did get the key for steam but after i tried to redeem it , steam said it had already been used , i use cjs_keys because all my other purchases seem to work flawlessly and without_fail , but in this case it wasnt .
neutral	i am about to email them and ask for a refund or the item because i know they will do whats best for a valued customer .
neutral	i will post again when i have has a reply .
neutral	so after my last review , i have finally received an e_- mail , but a displeasing one .
neutral	so after coming home from school today , i looked at my e_- mail to notice that one of my items was cancelled after 00 days of waiting for it to be in stock or not .
neutral	it is insulting to know that i have waited that long of time where if i had found out 0 days earlier , i still would have had enough time to order some clothing for a cheaper price and it was one of my prefered items which i felt i had to have .
neutral	in my opinion : shipped items is the quickest , but sucks since your size might not be on the ready to ship list .
neutral	0 - 00 days can suddenly turn into 00 days and 00 days might not even be in stock .
neutral	if you can risk that long , then the best to you .
neutral	=)
neutral	we waren jarenlang vaste klant .
neutral	behalve een enkele rotte aubergine en regelmatig bestelde dingen die uiteindelijk toch niet op voorraad bleken waren we redelijk tevreden .
neutral	de bezorgers zijn bijna allemaal prima en de website werkt goed .
neutral	het minimum bestelbedrag is echter steeds verder verhoogd , de bezorgkosten rijzen de pan uit , en ons favoriete bezorgmoment ( maandag tussen 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 uur ) is geschrapt .
neutral	wij zijn dus helaas geen klant meer .
neutral	wanneer komt er eens een tweede supermarkt met bezorgdienst ?
neutral	in engeland hebben vrijwel alle ketens dat !
neutral	ik snap werkelijk niets van het bedrijfsplan van dit bedrijf .
neutral	in december_0000 0 fauteuils ( 0 swan en 0 egg chair ) besteld met 00 weken levertijd .
neutral	na veel wachten , bellen en mailen kregen we eindelijk in juli 0000 (!)
neutral	de egg fauteuil geleverd .
neutral	perfecte kwaliteit overigens !
neutral	vervolgens hebben we gewacht , we zijn aan het lijntje gehouden .
neutral	er is ons ettelijke malen ' echt ' de leverdatum beloofd .
neutral	we hebben ruim 000 euro winkeltegoed gekregen als compensatie .
neutral	daarvan hebben we een lamp besteld .
neutral	enfin , wij hebben toen de datum naderde dat de bestelling een jaar (!)
neutral	oud was , geannuleerd via de creditkaartmaatschappij met opgave van een uiterste leverdatum , als laatste kans .
neutral	we kregen ons geld terug , ze hebben niet eens geprotesteerd .
neutral	we hebben elders de fauteuils gekocht .
neutral	maar wat gebeurt er ?
neutral	een aantal weken na onze uiterste leverdatum , wordt de lamp opgestuurd !
neutral	ook weer prima kwaliteit !
neutral	die lamp hebben we nu dus eigenlijk ' gratis ', ik zie het als genoegdoening voor een jaar lang bijna wekelijks bellen en mailen .
neutral	en een paar weken later ( begin 0000 ) een bericht : de fauteuils binnen !!!
neutral	die hebben we geannuleerd , want we hadden inmiddels al andere , maar uiteindelijk hebben ze dus toch wat kunnen leveren .
neutral	jammer dat het niet wat sneller kon , en zonder loze beloften .
neutral	de producten zijn namelijk wel van goede kwaliteit .
neutral	ik_heb zelf het idee dat_ze veel te groot hebben ingezet en dat_ze acute cash problemen hebben .
neutral	er is niet genoeg geld in kas voor_het maken van de vele vele bestellingen , en er moeten dus veel mensen bestellen en betalen om oude bestellingen te kunnen leveren .
neutral	0 grote vlucht voorwaarts , totdat het bedrijf failliet gaat .
neutral	bestel altijd met creditcard , de meeste creditcard maatschappijen hebben een goede afdeling voor betwiste transacties .
neutral	bij isc waar wij bij zitten is infurn ook al een ' bekende '.
neutral	so i chose iflorist because the flowers looked beautiful and this is the first time i have ordered flowers online .
neutral	i am now awaiting confirmation on delivery and i have not yet heard_anything .
neutral	i also paid to be able to track my delivery and there is no tracking_number .
neutral	i have to admit , i am a little_nervous especially reading the reviews on the iflorist service .
neutral	finally , there seems to be no contact number for iflorist .
neutral	i am yet so see if they are to prove a lot of people wrong and deliver the flowers i ordered on the due date of delivery .
neutral	i will re - rate on the 00th of february .
neutral	when arranging delivery or checking on status of an item the customer_service staff seem to lack any interest at all .
neutral	there was no customer care just a feeling of going through the motions !
neutral	the item we purchased was a flat pack bed and the finish was shoddy with pieces missing and the wood splitting as soon as a screw was in place .
neutral	one month on the beds wheels are falling_off and the bed_frame is wobbly .
neutral	the worst £_000 i ' ve ever spent and certainly will not be buying large items from them again .
neutral	i should have gone to ikea or dwell as i was going to !
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a few things didn ' t always come in the time though but not many bad subs in there .
neutral	they could have said there was a problem in the time it takes to process the phones or that the payments were late but no i had to complain to learn that there was a delay and it would take longer_than usual to process my phones .
neutral	very quick delivery service had slight problem with order but very impressed with the level of service received product was excellent quality and very affordable prices .
neutral	they just need to try a stick to what the can offer and not offer something they don ' t have .
neutral	would use again and recommend to others
neutral	its good to for video chat but seem to be finding problem these days quite_often ... would be great if we could do group video chat .. but extra_cost just turns off ..
neutral	to be honest the products can be misleading but the shipping and security is good .
neutral	still , i do not as secure as other online payment .
neutral	the range of products are amazing ...
neutral	expensive .
neutral	by the time ebay take their cut , paypal take their cut you ' ve lost a massive chunk out of the end price .
neutral	also , some categories have fixed postage prices which doesnt actually cover the cost it is to post the item .
neutral	i have ordered from boohoo several_times and found the clothes to be of good quality .
neutral	the delivery people however are a joke !
neutral	i have watched from my window on a few occasions and have seen the driver walk down the side of my house throw the parcel over the fence and drive off .
neutral	they made no attempt to knock on the door nor did they leave a card to say where they had left the parcel .
neutral	although this was annoying it wasn ' t a real issue as i had got the items i had ordered .
neutral	the problem however has now got worse .
neutral	i ordered two dresses from boohoo as normal i received an_email to say my parcel has been shipped and then an_email asking me to write a review on the dresses .
neutral	the problem however was that i had not received the items or even a card to say the delivery people had been .
neutral	i have emailed the customer_service team twice and have had no response .
neutral	i followed the advice put on this review site that said boohoo have their own face book page , i also wrote on this and yet again have had no response .
neutral	its has now been 0 weeks since the dresses were supposedly delivered , i have still not received them or heard from anyone in the customer_services department .
neutral	i do hope this matter gets resolved quickly as i would like to continue using the website as the clothes really are a good value for money .
neutral	my order number is 0000000 .
neutral	easyjet is cheap and provides average service ; you get what you pay for .
neutral	i had no_problems with the service i received and found the staff quite friendly .
neutral	the flight was on time and i didn ' t lose my luggage ( as i had carry on ).
neutral	myprotein is usually a great service , but this time i have had problems with shipping and a voucher that was issued to me .
neutral	the item i ordered arrived a day late but a voucher was given to me .
neutral	i ´ m a little_bit confused about the possibility to buy tickets for tomorrowland 0000 .
neutral	i know that people who bought tickets on the official tml side will maybe offer their tickets here but how can we buy ticktes at the same time ?
neutral	do you viagogo has a partner and you have , lets say 00000 tickets you can sell ...
neutral	how can you garantee tickets for an event you are not able to offer offical tickets ?
neutral	at what time will the tickets be shipped ?
neutral	i know that tml will ship the tickets till the end of june_0000 ...
neutral	please reply !
neutral	thanks

neutral	i ' ve been attending music festivals for years , and i ' d primarily use this website for line - up rumours .
neutral	it used to be great , however , in recent years , the rumours aren ' t as great as they used to be .
neutral	i don ' t think this is a fault of efestivals though , i think this is more to do with the fact that organisers are being allot more secretive .
neutral	yes you can find virtually any song you want and its great for finding them hard to find tracks , however itunes does tend to be overpriced !
neutral	also , maybe i ' m getting old but i ' d rather buy the cd ' s .
neutral	i sent my blackberry_curve over a week_ago which took a while for bozowi to acknowledge .
neutral	could have been the royal_mail so not too bothered about that .
neutral	but they say they send an_email when they receive it - they didnt .
neutral	downgraded the cost by £ 0 which was fine , and i accepted .
neutral	then got an_email_saying ' my bank_details were wrong and the payment had ' bounced back '.
neutral	they werent - i know my bank_details and they definitely werent wrong .
neutral	tried to call bozowi but of course they dont answer the phone .
neutral	whats the point ?
neutral	anyway , updated bank_details to the exact_same bank_details ( which are correct ) and will see what happens .
neutral	not holding up much hope due to the other reviews but im owed money so hopefully theyll pay me asap .
neutral	one other thing .
neutral	i was happy to accept the £ 0 downgrade to network being locked but theyve now automatically downgraded it again to by a further £ 0 without any warning , email or advising why .
neutral	bozowi - care to explain ?
neutral	how come there are no pictures of the dresses every time i go on the website all l get is a bold question mark instead of the pictures how on earth am l meant to select and buy the lovely dresses :-(
neutral	first of all the prices which you pay for the games are fantastic in comparison to other_places and yes it is legitimate as i got my key with only a little_bit of hassle .
neutral	when you buy a code you are asked to verify your identity essentially with a phone number which can be either sent a text_message or called then entering a subsequent code into the website .
neutral	i did wait a long period of time for my text_message which did not arrive and thus would recommend accepting the phone call method instead which came instantly .
neutral	i used a russian key which required vpn relaying which the website walked me through very well utilising video .
neutral	over all well worth using to purchase your games .
neutral	no real promotions for its players .
neutral	virgin money will match any deposit i make - bet000 just dont have any real facility to keep the player engaged in their system .
neutral	i wont use them again
neutral	services are just okay with tesco .
neutral	not much exciting nor too depressive !
neutral	i ordered my new lens on the 00 / 00 / 00 , it arrived this morning ( 0 / 0 / 00 ) from_hong_kong .
neutral	it was well_packaged , so speed of delivery was fantastic ( especially as i ordered some stuff from digital_rev not 00_minutes later and that is still in hong_kong !)
neutral	although , the invoice is marked as a " gift " ( which is to avoid customs duty i suspect , but i may be wrong on that ) so i ' m not sure how i go about putting it through my company books !
neutral	i paid an extra £_00 for a 0 year_warranty on the lens which i ' m not too sure on , as the underwriters of the guarantee are in the usa so if anything goes_wrong it would seem i would have to ship the part to them at my own_expense !
neutral	none of which was mentioned at time of purchase .
neutral	other than that , i ' ll test the lens when the camera from digitalrev arrives and hope all is well from there on out .
neutral	i check this site nearly everyday and if there is something i like i send the user a message but the thing that gets me is 0 times out of 00 the user ( s ) dont get back to you and its very frustrating and its quite off putting .
neutral	but apart_from that the site is a good idea and i continue to use the site .
neutral	paid about £ 0 or so for next_day delivery with this company , it came to about 0 o_clock and i used their live support ( which was prompt , i ' ll give them an extra star for that ).
neutral	was told that it wouldn ' t be coming until saturday , i then inquired , why did i pay £ 0 . 00 for a two day delivery ?
neutral	i specifically paid for next_day delivery , expecting it to come next_day .
neutral	my client now has to wait an extra day for his machine to be built completely due to the shambles .
neutral	now , i hope you ' re sitting down , i inquired which courier service is handling the package so i could track it , the reply i got " i don ' t believe royal_mail does tracking ", i almost died , i felt_like a piano had fell on my head , i mean , who honestly uses royal_mail during december ?
neutral	it ' s nonsense , i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery , i expected dpd or tnt or maybe fedex , heck , i wouldn ' t even have minded if it was yodel !
neutral	but royal_mail ?!
neutral	wow .
neutral	is all i have to say .
neutral	they lost a star , because i openly / passively said " this is what i get for using a not well_known company ", to which that tugged a few strings and i received a very rude reply " excuse me , we are well_known , we have been in business for many years serving clients who are extremely happy with our service , that is completely wrong "... upz ... did i hit a nerve ?
neutral	sorry novatech , but you ' re not like amazon or ebay , i only found you on the backend of a google_search .
neutral	i always like giving unknown companies a chance , well , you blew it .
neutral	to stop it from being two stars , they did refund the postage and packaging since i didn ' t receive it next_day , however , why in hell are you using royal_mail during december is beyond me , for that , you lost another star .
neutral	will i use this company in the future ?
neutral	change courier services and i might .
neutral	not a lot it would seem .
neutral	they have the tools but they don ' t know how to use them .
neutral	euse maplin if you know what you need and need itu in oa hurry .
neutral	the price is expensive but it is more an electronics convenience store .
neutral	staff have no_idea about anything , but they are friendly which does add some weight to score .
neutral	not the best coverage , sometimes poor in rural_areas but they offer value for money .
neutral	very hit and miss on the customer ervices front .
neutral	sometimes great and sometimes diabolical .
neutral	i have used ebay a lot and in my experience there is a lot of pot luck as to whether you receive an item in the condition you are hoping for when buying secondhand items ( in particular tools ).
neutral	seems to be a number of dishonest or ignorant sellers selling secondhand tools who forget to describe or photograph damage , very frustrating , however certainly not all though .
neutral	you then get ebay sellers who will send a breakable item in a taped - up black bin bag or unsecurely rattling about inside a box .
neutral	i have received items like this numerous_times , how more haven ' t arrived broken i don ' t know .
neutral	when you do get yourself a good item , you often can bag yourself a bargain , however when you encounter problems it causes all_sorts of headaches to the point i have given up buying secondhand tools on ebay now .
neutral	my experience buying most other items ( mainly clothes and books ) have nearly always be good .
neutral	i have been with talk_talk two years and throughout this period i have had consistant problems with the router disconnecting from the internet .
neutral	talk_talk sent out a new router although same problem still exists .
neutral	momondo er rigtigt godt når siden virker .
neutral	oplever 00_% af tiden at den staller og ikke reagerer .

neutral	the price was very good , and the delivery time not too bad ( ordered on the monday_morning , arrived on the thursday ) they could do with keeping you informed a little better .
neutral	i was under the impression that the item was in stock but it wasn ' t .
neutral	the order just stayed at processing .
neutral	i don ' t mind if an item is out of stock , but a quick email_stating that , and an estimated_delivery date would have been great .
neutral	when i phoned to ask about it , i was promised an_email to let me know , which never materialised .
neutral	i would used them again , but probably order over the phone so i know what is going on and when to expect delivery .
neutral	the flowers ordered were the same species that were pictured but a different_colour and the message i typed out to go with the flowers wasn ' t there .
neutral	i didn ' t have a good read of the site so maybe there ' s a disclaimer there saying not all flowers are going to be as pictured , not too sure honestly .
neutral	delivery service used was fantastic , probably the best out of every company i ' ve ever used .
neutral	you can pick ( if memory serves me right ) a time before 00am
neutral	i order something along time ago on website and didnt hear_anything about it
neutral	ok there is none ever to talknto in store though
neutral	not to bad . site easy to use
neutral	not to bad really just wen in store it is so busy all the time
neutral	the flowers i ordered were not delivered on the specified day which was a real disappointment as they were for a sick friend just out of hospital .
neutral	however the problem was rectified as soon a i phoned to complained the next_day - and within the next hour not one but two bouquets were delivered to her door - along with a £ 0 voucher for her and a £ 0 voucher for me !
neutral	i received my package with 0 items missing from my order , despite all items being on the delivery note , which was signed and checked by two different people .
neutral	when i phoned up to complain and inform them of the situation , i had to justify myself and phone back 0 times , as they did not think it was in any way possible that the items could have been missed , as the picker / packer swore he put them in the box .
neutral	in fact , the customer srvice rep told me to go away and check under the flaps of the box in case i had missed it !
neutral	no surprises to say that 0 items ( which were way too large to be hiding under flaps ) were not there .
neutral	they agred to send out the items and i received them quickly in the end .
neutral	no other issues however , and very reasonable prices compared to other_retailers .
neutral	book lost in post but all sorted eventually
neutral	bought but waited ages for item , ebay not v helpful
neutral	i went through the fraud process which is a brill idea but once i got the key code it never worked also got sent another 0 in replace of that 0 still wont work , good job it wasn ' t alot of money as i would of been trying to get my money back
neutral	ordered goods were supposed to be delivered next_day .
neutral	after 0 days ( no contact from babydino ) called them just to be informed that i have to wait six_weeks for goods to be delivered .
neutral	as it was something i did not need promptly i agreed to that .
neutral	now after 0 weeks of waiting and still no contact from babydino ( it is me that has to call them and try to obtain an information ) goods are still not deleivered .
neutral	avoid at all cost !
neutral	i decided to add two stars as after talking to the only reliable person in babydino - adam my problem has been professionally resolved .
neutral	now i am happy owner of the product i needed and i also got a compensation for all my inconveniences .
neutral	it is a pity it took so long to solve my problem .
neutral	good product for the money but the wait made me realise i didn ' t really love the items quite as much as i had thought when purchased - took over a month .
neutral	i make a lot of orders and speak to a lot of stores regarding the issues i ' ve received , i find stores are more helpful on the phone rather_than via e_- mail where you tend to be ignored .
neutral	here ' s a few things i ' ve learnt from experience and what staff have told me .
neutral	each cash_generator store is run independently , meaning your level of service can vary dramatically depending_on which members of staff and managers deal with your order .
neutral	despite all being the same company i ' ve received massively different treatment from store - to - store .
neutral	sadly trustpilot doesn ' t discriminate between stores ( unless someone in the review has mentioned which store ) so whilst some stores are next to perfect the majority of the bad_reviews are probably for the minority of stores that are awful .
neutral	they mostly use uk mail as a courier , who are usually downright awful .
neutral	if your package goes missing or arrives broken , it ' s probably down to these_guys rather_than the store .
neutral	sometimes received things via_royal_mail and rarely if ever had an issue that way .
neutral	lot of reviews with people saying they received a notification of dispatch but never got an item .
neutral	was once told their system automatically sends these e_- mails when they do something on their end , regardless of whether the item is there or not .
neutral	had it a few_times myself where think i ' m getting something dispatched then end up with a refund a day or two later .
neutral	lesson is don ' t get too excited or e_- mail / call to confirm your order .
neutral	you will wait for a refund 00_% of the time .
neutral	again i ' ve kicked off about this before and was told that apparently refunds have to be authorised by the head - office or something .
neutral	don ' t quite know how that works .
neutral	either way the red - tape involved usually means i ' ve had to wait quite a few_days sometimes to physically get my money back .
neutral	lastly ; if a store is being awful at responding i find raising a paypal claim / dispute usually gives them a kick up the a **.
neutral	had multiple instances where i ' ve requested a refund or explanation regarding an item and being ignored until i got paypal to intervene .
neutral	good luck , their website is hit and miss .
neutral	like a gold mine full of landmines .
neutral	you ' ll either strike it rich or wish you ' d never bothered .
neutral	only one minus , my order was stopped to a security check because i payed it with a foreign visa card .
neutral	i had to call them and wait on the line for like 00_minutes until the security stop from the order was cleared .
neutral	i think this was kind of a waste of time as visa is an universal credit_card and it works everywhere_else just fine ...
neutral	overall , these_guys offered the best price for my imac but overall i wasn ' t too impressed , i received basically no communication from them that wasn ' t started by myself , nothing to tell me they ' d received it , nothing to confirm what they were doing to it , no confirmation of payment .
neutral	in all i was waiting a week with emails going back and forth .
neutral	may not matter to some but when you ' re hearing_nothing from the people who have something of yours with significant value in their possession it ' s slightly unnerving .
neutral	i did receive an_apology but would have preferred it didn ' t come to that .
neutral	i would probably use again because of the price factor , but would go into the transaction with lower expectations of customer_service .
neutral	although no booking_fee , another site including booking_fee was slightly_cheaper .
neutral	other than that , easy to use and pay .
neutral	good service and decent key but anti_fraud check was a joke !
neutral	i paid in full and they were happy to take my money but then i got a email_saying they thought the transaction was fraudulent when i did have to log_into my banks secure portal to send the money in the first place !
neutral	just beware of this if you want to purchase anything !
neutral	i have been a customer of natwest for many years .
neutral	until recently i couldn ' t really complain_about them but then again that ' s because i have never really needed to contact customer_services for anything significant .
neutral	i have an advantage gold account with them , and this month they have decided to increase the monthly_fee by 00_% from £_00 . 00 to £_00 whilst taking away some of their best benefits .
neutral	they had identity theft protection which i used some of the prevention services of regularly .
neutral	they have taken that away and replaced it with 0 family day passes a year at national trust .
neutral	great , at a time when identity theft is at its highest they ' re handing us leisure vouchers instead of trying to protect their customers .
neutral	they have also taken away other insurances .
neutral	i spoke to customer_services and they said it was a " business decision ".
neutral	i have a first_class business degree , and last time i checked the best business decisions are customer_focused .
neutral	that ' s how you keep the money rolling in .
neutral	seeing as this account no_longer serves my needs , i will be closing it and going elsewhere .
neutral	i can see other banks offer much more for the same price .
neutral	good service
neutral	best choice
neutral	didn ' t arrive in the 0 hours as stated .
neutral	shame i wont be able to play this until the weekend now .
neutral	got tivo about two_weeks_ago .
neutral	like it , its shows some potential , but it keeps cutting the end off shows
neutral	price was by_far best on the market , however when coming to book the effort i had to go to was unbelievable from website refusing to take payment over days and days , then price changing over the phone finally managed to book after 0 days and over £_00 more despite the price via website being cheaper !!!
neutral	a whole lot of pain just to give someone my money !
neutral	i got a good deal on a closeout item , but the shipping was disappointingly high .
neutral	brilliant socailing network , mostly for the younger generation .
neutral	for a catch up , or a update on your friends here ' s the place to check , could improve the chat application as it is not the most reliable
neutral	i ordered a game from here , it took_forever to get to me despite what the website said .
neutral	i would say you need to go into the shop instead of online if you need something in a decent time
neutral	friendly staff but i can get it cheaper from amazon
neutral	i ordered to tickets to the up coming champions league game .
neutral	the event isn ' t until the 0th but i am traveling from the us to attend the match .
neutral	my order said there was an issue and it was undeliverable .
neutral	then after changing the address from my us address to an address of my friends house in italy where we will be staying i got two automated emails .
neutral	one saying that the already declared " undeliverable " tickets had been shipped by the seller and nothing they could do .
neutral	the second said that the address was changed it won ' t be shipped until 0 to 0 days before etc .. what is the truth ?
neutral	the number to call from the us doesn ' t ring .
neutral	i just want a non automated straight answer , which from these other reviews is looking like i ' m out of luck .
neutral	i am hopeful that i can update this review to 0_stars .
neutral	id # 0000000
neutral	my mother ordered me the james bond skyfall tom fords before the film came out so i definitely got them .... now although yes they were delivered this took around 0 - 0 weeks .
neutral	the company took the money straight_away and just kept saying they were waiting for the sunglasses to come in to stock .
neutral	in the end they took a 0 % of the price but still made my mother wait quite a long while .
neutral	doubt i would use them again to be quite honest ...
neutral	while the ortlieb messenger bag was the lowest_price online , it turned_out there was no point in paying extra for " guaranteed " next_day delivery .
neutral	i thought yodel were the worst but uk mail take some beating .
neutral	had to take an extra half day off work to wait for parcel to arrive ( arrived 0 days_later ), so the whole palava has ended_up costing more_than buying from any other retailer in the end .
neutral	while this may not be wiggles fault , the fact that the only method of contact is an_email that will be answered ' within 0 - 0 business days ' means there is no real means to resolve this guaranteed next_day delivery situation .
neutral	sticking with evans next time as they will match any wiggle price anyway .
neutral	have been speaking to skype support for weeks about unfair charges , with no result what so ever .
neutral	when i call a land - line sometimes skype starts charging even if nobody picked_up , i can hear the ring tone but skype is charging and i end up paying for connection and for the first minute even_though nobody picked_up .
neutral	also skype rounds the charge into their favor .
neutral	i call to a country and the charges are following : connection fee 0 . 0p and a minute is 0 . 0 total 00 . 0p , but skype charges 00p , they round this into their favor .
neutral	i am not paying to skype any more , will be using only their free services and for paying services will go to other provider .
neutral	i would not recommend using skype paid for services , it is a rip_off
neutral	a week_ago i booked a room for 0 nights in grand villa argentina , due to start on saturday 00th_august ( i . e .
neutral	this weekend ), but today the hotel informed me they have no record of my booking .
neutral	i have tried to phone but cannot get through to the call_centre so have sent e_- mails and tried the chat service instead .
neutral	the reservation number is h0000 - 00000 and i ' m starting to get extremely unsettled by the whole situation ...
neutral	a response would be appreciated .
neutral	well the service is really not the best .
neutral	even if the prices are low , it would be nice to have
neutral	a better customer friendly service
neutral	meh - cheap but you get what you pay for .
neutral	i find particularly annoying and un - user_friendly that you cannot sort the hotel choices by price .
neutral	it makes the whole_process take much much longer .
neutral	also , quite_often i find the prices are made for foreigners and not so much the real price the hotel charges .
neutral	i ' ve experienced 0 times that i made a reservation , and received an_email_saying that they would contact me again with the confirmation and then nothing happened .
neutral	it was actually by luck that i went back to the website to confirm my order and much later realised that the order never went through and yet they didn ' t even let me know !
neutral	if an error happens with the payment they must let us know , otherwise , we would think that everything went fine .
neutral	not bad choice at all for online treaments .. legit
neutral	i sent it on the 00nd january hoping to receive my money soon like the phone companies , there is a reason_why i sold my beloved xbox_000 !!
neutral	!
neutral	the money offered was good but at time of writing i still_haven ' t received my money ( 00 - 00 - 0000 ).
neutral	the customer helpline are no help !!!
neutral	they need to look at their waiting time and think about it .
neutral	why are people selling off their stuff ?
neutral	do they need the money for something serious ?
neutral	and another thing to consider is sending emails at 0am in the morning , i reckon 0 % of britain are awake at that time !!
neutral	!
neutral	after_reading the reviews for viagogo i am very worried that the tickets me and my sister bought ( v_festival ) we will not recieve !
neutral	london gatwick_airport ( a00 airport way ) premier_inn
neutral	stayed here in march prior to a morning flight and had a really great nights_sleep .
neutral	surroundings pleasant as per most premier inns .
neutral	unfortunately this time ( may ) was disturbed in the night by noise from the room above - walking ( stamping !
neutral	), doors , bathroom noise etc .
neutral	i wouldn ' t stay here again unless i could make_sure to get a top floor room to avoid the possibility of noise from above .
neutral	claimed my money back from the good night guarantee .
neutral	i ' ve played here quite a while its an ok casino with some good games , i ' m mainly a slot player & although there is a decent variety of slots casino cannot compete with some casinos that have huge varieties of slots ( bet victor , paddy power , grosvenor ) .. to mention a few .
neutral	do not like the whole " pending withdrawal " rubbish that most casinos implement ( including virgin casino ) , on - line casinos will naturally prefer all their customers to cancel their withdrawal / cashout requests and use those funds at the online casino ( hopefully lose it too !
neutral	).
neutral	one feature i do like with virgin is the fact that you can " take a break " from the casino and choose a period anywhere from 0 day to 0 weeks , i find it handy when i have a withdraw pending just to uset he " take a break " feature for 0 - 0 days , thus not being_able to log in and reverse my winnings !
neutral	.... we ' ve all done it its not fun !
neutral	overall good solid casino and name with a pretty good selection of games but could use some more slots .
neutral	ok i have been with talktalk for about 0 years and have to say the actual broadband / phone service has been excellent .
neutral	have lost the broadband_connection only half a dozen_times in that time and never for more_than a few hours max .
neutral	my problem is with their customer_services who are clueless .
neutral	however i recently had an issue with the caller id not working on the phone and after ringing their customer_services probably a dozen_times they still cannot resolve the issue or even pinpoint as to why the problem is occurring .
neutral	half the time the line goes dead and the other half the representative says the issue will be " escalated " and i wil receive a call back within 00_hours ( that never happens !
neutral	).
neutral	been over a month since i first reported the fault and i am the one who has to keep calling because they can ' t be bothered to call back .
neutral	good overall broadband and phone service talktalk but with a customer_service as bad as yours customers will change providers , like i have .
neutral	smooth_transaction however , the photos on the website missold / represented the product ( hotel room ) we received .
neutral	in my experience my orders have been dispatched slowly .
neutral	but have been well_priced .
neutral	had an issue with a used pair of undershorts being sent to me , which they just replaced quickly .
neutral	not exceptional service after finding hairs etc inside a supposedly new pair of undershorts really , after such a horrific discovery .
neutral	but maybe that is expecting too much , maybe i have been spoiled by other_retailers .
neutral	have got about 0 / 0 of my cash back .
neutral	the other 0 / 0 has either been denied or not honored .
neutral	bear this in mind .
neutral	slow to give out amazon vouchers , when i have opted for that claim method .
neutral	and restrictions to some payment_methods is annoying .
neutral	hej !
neutral	jeg_er jo faktisk en meget glad oister - kunde , men :
neutral	først og fremmest syntes jeg at det_er_en forvirrende hjemmeside og kan kun finde det jeg leder efter , efter meget lang tid ... på_den måde er_det meget kompliceret og_jeg finder nærmest flere spørgsmål end svar .
neutral	jeg opgiver nærmest , at lede efter det jeg egentlig søger .
neutral	kan i ikke gøre hjemmesiden mere overskuelig og bruger venlig ?
neutral	i stedet for at man skal klikke på et hav af links for , at nå frem til det endelige resultat .
neutral	jeg brugte omtrendt 0 ½ t . på at finde et link til , at bestille et nyt usb - modem , men inden jeg langt om længe fandt det følte jeg , at jeg ' gik i ring ' på_hjemmesiden . jeg_ved ikke om i kan forstå min frustration , for jeg_har ingen andre problemer_med oister .
neutral	det_er bare en meget træls oplevelse , hvis ikke det_er til at finde på forsiden !
neutral	tak
neutral	venligst rosa
neutral	the accommodation was all that we could ask for , for a group of 00 on a stag_do .
neutral	had the basics that we needed for the weekend to get by .
neutral	could of done with being a little closer to more night life & closer to the sea front .
neutral	had to taxi about a fair amount .
neutral	the vip bar_crawl was a bit of a waste of time for us .
neutral	we did 0 bars and a club .
neutral	in this time we had 0 free drink and 0 free shot .
neutral	there were no vip booth ' s or things like that , and in fact in 0 of the bars we went to , the bill came out and shocked the majority of us as to how much it was , it ' s looked like the 0 ' free ' drinks we got were actually added to the bill .
neutral	but still at_least taxi from bars to clubs was paid for .
neutral	in the end though we just ended_up going back to a club that we found the previous night as we knew it was a good place .
neutral	the barcelona football was a highlight , enjoyed the match despite the weather , only snag was i would of thought he tickets should of all been booked at the same time , yet we were scattered all over the place in the seating .
neutral	0 of the guys had to enter the stadium at entrance 00 , one of us was in entrance 0 , and the rest in entrance 0 .
neutral	so by not all sitting in the same rows and such it did really kill the mood a little_bit as we were all really up for the match before hand .
neutral	the stag ended_up being with 0 of us somewhere_else completely while the rest of us were scattered in one block 0 or 0 rows apart .
neutral	also strange the tickets said £_00 yet we paid £_00 for them .
neutral	is there really a £_00 booking_fee per ticket .
neutral	enjoyed the weekend completely , i was told to watch my pockets for pickpockets , but fortunately didn ' t seem that bad at all .
neutral	the city was great , shame about the weather but not a lot you could do there .
neutral	as mentioned maybe put more into the " vip bar_crawl " because it certainly didn ' t feel vip , and it was hardly a crawl .
neutral	the fact we ended_up at a club we ourselves went to the first night because we preferred it says it all .
neutral	i am disappointed that there was a major piece missing to the trampoline and believe this should have been checked prior to delivery .
neutral	the issue however did get sorted , but was not as straight_forward as hoped .
neutral	the product purchased is extremely good quality as expected after purchasing a high end trampoline .
neutral	the salesman was also very knowledgeable .
neutral	i have purchased example tickets for 0st march ( which is not long away ) and the money has not yet been taken out of my bank ?
neutral	i have a tracking_number and everything else , but no tickets .
neutral	is there a number to ring for this ?
neutral	please get back asap .
neutral	this site is really a great fun , i have recently searched about the latest movies and actors , but some of the movies information is not available in super 0 and mr . poppers penguins etc .
neutral	over all the site is good .
neutral	i ordered a holl three seater with chaise in beige max fabric on thursday_evening 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i paid £_00 for a saturday delivery as we work through the week and was very flexible for us .
neutral	received a confirmation_email the next_day quoting " this email confirms we will deliver order number ****** on 00 / 00 / 00 " ( saturday ).
neutral	further quoted on their website - " if you order a sofa before noon on a normal working day monday through friday we can have the sofa with you the next working ".
neutral	the flexibility , price point and off the peg quick sofa all seemed very appealing .
neutral	me and my wife waited in all day saturday by 0pm i phoned the courier as stated on the email to which the reply was " all deliveries on a saturday are completed by 00pm ".
neutral	he did try to contact the driver but could not get in touch .
neutral	i then phoned nabru who said she will chase this up .
neutral	as mentioned in other reviews nabru address themselves as the company name , this does not fill you with confidence .
neutral	in truth the advisor was very good and got back to me quickly .
neutral	the sofa was locked up in a local_depot and all staff had gone home - so no sofa .
neutral	i received another call from daniel at the courier ( tas ) who again was excellent and apologised for the mix_up and that they would refund £_00 to nabru for the delivery charge .
neutral	i called nabru back who said she " would leave a message to her colleague about the possibility of a delivery refund ".
neutral	nabru could not promise when the sofa was delivered but tas the courier advised i would get it on monday 00 / 00 / 00 and was delivered as promised .
neutral	i had to take a morning off work ( unpaid ) to wait in again after the failed saturday delivery .
neutral	i called nabru today about the refund and they said they had refunded £_00 i asked why only £_00 and not £_00 ?
neutral	he said i had been charged for next_day delivery instead , i was furious .
neutral	this really is not good customer_service ; making claims that delivery will happen and doesn ' t then being charged for nabrus incompetence .
neutral	the advisor did refund an extra £_00 after it was questioned why i am paying for delivery when the courier had refunded nabru ?
neutral	i understand things go_wrong at times however not on multiple_occasions .
neutral	the sofa itself is of good quality for the price paid , however due to taking a morning off work unpaid due to a failed delivery the total cost is not as appealing .
neutral	it took me about 0 hours to build on my own .
neutral	the sofa itself is an excellent concept to install in hard to reach areas but if you have good access i probably would order your sofa pre built from a store .
neutral	the comfort of the sofa is a little on the hard side however the company say it will soften in a couple of weeks ( when the comfort guarantee has ended ).
neutral	in summary would i order again ?
neutral	probably not !

neutral	response to nabrus feedback :
neutral	hi nabru
neutral	your second point is factually_incorrect .
neutral	i contacted nabru to see if the refund was being_processed .
neutral	i was catagorically told £_00 was only being refunded as i was being charged £_00 for a next_day delivery charge .
neutral	i had to request that the remaining £_00 was refunded as stated in my first post .
neutral	if it was nabrus intention in the first instance to refund all delivery costs then the full £_00 would be debited back to my card in one transaction .
neutral	why would a company refund money in two transactions doubling their admin time and costs secondly , why would you only refund £_00 firstly then the remaining £_00 later in the day after my phone call ?
neutral	as i have said before i understand that mistakes are made but there is a difference_between sorting the issue in the first instance as_opposed to covering your tracks by posting incorrect feedback .
neutral	regards
neutral	adam garner
neutral	quoted on website £_000 dependent on condition .
neutral	was fully expecting that amount as the phone had minimal scratches on the front and back through fair wear and tear .
neutral	got £_000 .
neutral	in retrospect i think i could could have argued the case but not really worth my time .
neutral	how many two year_old mint_condition iphone_0s are out there ?
neutral	the products you receive as well as the service are basically they same for sometimes even a bit higher total cost because the shipping is so over priced .
neutral	hostelworld is cheaper .
neutral	what used to be a cheasp shop is getting more_expensive but the quality isnt improving .
neutral	i would say that the company and delivery service cant be_faulted .
neutral	this is the first time when i have noted that one even gets an_email to say in what time_slot your delivery may arrive .
neutral	this made it possible for me to collect the item .
neutral	some gripes : the ipod_touch i ordered was b + grade ( description said : with no scratches on touch screen but some ' minor ' scratches to be expected on the back )
neutral	when the product ( i . e refurbished product ) was delivered , there werent original apple ear phones in the package ( which i know are rubbish anyways but may have had a mic ) but what i was given were philips packed headphones .
neutral	not bad as this may be a hygeine issue .
neutral	secondly the touch has areas where the chrome had actually completely come off .
neutral	the back of it seemed to have quite a heavy use to it .
neutral	it seemed that it had atleast been used for a year before it got handed_over to me .
neutral	as a product , its all in working order , but i would reconsider when buying b + grade items , but hey you get what you pay for .
neutral	only one suggestion , be very clear about what is included in the package .
neutral	for a uk website your deleverys take as long if not longer then it would be for me to get it from japan
neutral	still_awaiting my eminem tickets with only days to go now ... getting worried .
neutral	why can ' t the seller send sooner ?
neutral	although i found the service fairly stress_free and the products were delivered in the promised time_frame , i don ' t think i will bother with yesstyle products again .
neutral	i bought 0 dresses and 0 blouses .
neutral	the three dresses are very good - the quality and finish is very acceptable for the price and i ' m_glad i bought them .
neutral	the two blouses were not so good .
neutral	one was made incorrectly so it would fit someone with a 00 inch rib cage , and after a couple of wears , the crouched collar began to split off from the shirt .
neutral	the other shirt was very sheer , the elastic in the shirt loosened off to the point that it is way to big and most of the dye came out after 0 wash .
neutral	as well as this , none of the products i received were produced by the brands that it said they would be , they were produced by cheeper brand_names - this doesn ' t bother me particularly , but for someone who did want a specific brand , maybe it would .
neutral	overall , neither a good , nor a particularly bad_experience , but i wouldn ' t bother buying from them again .
neutral	mazumamobile exchanged my old phone cash easily and effectively .
neutral	i would recommend anyone_wanting to recycle their old_mobiles to use this site .
neutral	i was a o0 customer for years but have just changed to vodaphone .
neutral	o0 do have excellent customer_service and a easy to use website but the iphone coverage is very poor .
neutral	i was also disappointed with the deals on offer compared to rivals .
neutral	i just loved it !
neutral	i recived my items this morning , but never recived the free gift i asked for .
neutral	which is ok , but as long as i got wat i payed for im hapi .
neutral	but i feel hapi the reason being , u get ur delivery next_day , i would reccommend this to my friends to order from here , quite good service ,
neutral	having researched around the various sites i was pleased with the value they were able to offer and the reviews read well .
neutral	i even watched the bbc video on their site and decided i could safely use their services .
neutral	having initially tested my brand_new blackberry to make_sure i hadn ' t been sent a dud phone , i found the device to be working immaculately as it should , so i decided to send the unit via special delivery in order to fast track and secure this brilliant service everyone had reviewing .
neutral	this was sent monday .
neutral	by friday i still hadn ' t herd anything .
neutral	i decided to check my account login on the fonebank website to have been presented with a new quote which was £_00 less_than my original .
neutral	i immediately rang through and spoke to a respectful individual who informed me that the handset i had sent in would not work with a wifi network and listed one or two other faults .
neutral	i insisted this was not my phone but they had confirmed they had received it with my tracking ref etc .
neutral	they tested and retested the unit and eventually contacted me to let me know they would return the handset to me as they could not get it to work and therefore could not offer the original_quote .
neutral	monday , i received the handset with a foreign sim and keyboard .
neutral	i instantly rang the customer care line back and demanded that they find my phone , provide me with my original_quote and that i was utterly appalled that they had potentially funded some other person with the value of my handset .
neutral	they took time to try and work out their mistakes but later on that day i received another phone call apologising profusely and promising that i would have the total original_quote in my account within a matter of days as the transaction had already been sent .
neutral	they requested i send the foreign handset back and that they would distribute a prepaid and addressed bag so that the incorrect item could be returned safely .
neutral	the overall process and service i believe must have been a one - off and i was angry that what should have been a 0 - 0 day max transaction turned in to nearly 00 days long .
neutral	however there staff ( albeit clearly not very organised ) were very approachable and did take_responsibility for all their mistakes , for this reason i believe a fair 0 / 0 is a reflection of my experience of the fone bank .
neutral	i read it occasionally , but i heard that they are not publishing negative_reviews for some businesses while for others they ' re not publishing positive ones .
neutral	when we arrived at the desk their was a very long queue but it went down quickly .
neutral	we had booked a speedy_shuttle but were messed about and sent to another desk at the other end of the airport which had nothing for us so went back to the first desk .
neutral	not a good start to the holiday .
neutral	after at_least an_hour we were finally shown to a car and went straight to the hotel in comfort .
neutral	the return to the airport was fine , picked_up on time in a nice mini_bus and a smooth drive to the airport .
neutral	could have done without the aggro at the start but nice , comfortable vehicles and good value for money .
neutral	going back about 0 years_ago i would have said they were excellent .
neutral	not any more they are middle of the road .
neutral	too expensive and not enough products , theyve really gone_downhill recently .
neutral	the item is ok and the quality but however it needed some evidence that it was me to be able to send me the product which made me suspicious at the beginning .
neutral	however , at the end everything ok now waiting to see any results ..
neutral	i bought a transponder repair from this company on the 00th_april on a 00 day turn_around .
neutral	its now the 00th_may and i still havn ' t received back my transponder and have missed 0 race meetings .
neutral	emailing as per there website suggests returns a reply eventually !
neutral	no phone is available to call only a mobile that is on constant answerphone .
neutral	after a few phone_calls and emails we eventually got a call back , to be told that our transponder had been lost in the post but he couldnt give us the lost tracking_number .
neutral	we were offered a replacement transponder and asked to return the original transponder when it appears in the post .
neutral	- it took 00 days to get my transponder repaired .
neutral	this company need to work on there communication .
neutral	good service but products a little hit or miss .
neutral	i reviewed a protein drink in a constructive but critical manner .
neutral	was disappointed and sceptical they didn ' t publish it .
neutral	i ' m now a little_hesitant to keep using them in light of the review vetting
neutral	don ' t get me wrong they do have some good products though
neutral	my products arrived and the calvin klein euphoria box was damaged and it wax a gift and this cost me .
neutral	£_00 with delivery and when i contacted you regarding this i was expected to take a trip to a post_office and i can ' t drive and pay for postage back to you which i feel was unfair thanks amy brewer
neutral	good value for the money just took far too long to be delivered i was waiting over a month for my glasses to be dispched
neutral	have recently_purchased 0 plastic shoe racks which are rubbish .
neutral	one snapped whilst assembling it second broke a week_later whilst trying to put shoes on it so now down to one thankfully purchased with the 00_%_off otherwise would have been very annoyed if id payed the original price of £_00 . 00 each would not recommend to anyone .
neutral	i have tried 0 fitness first gym .
neutral	it is a relatively good value for money but equipments are old and changing rooms need some update / frequent cleaning !
neutral	hello , do a customer get any discounts if he / she send more that 00 items through collectplus .
neutral	thanks
neutral	sky is very expensive for what it is !
neutral	the standard broadband_connection / router combination makes for a very unpleasant time when attempting to stream from the internet .
neutral	don ' t find myself watching the tv much due to the lack of interest generated by the basic channels ...
neutral	must_admit the free phone_calls to overseas destinations is very good !
neutral	i find the site unhelpfull to use and expensive for delivery i will not use tesco for home delivery .
neutral	liked the cheapness and range of couriers that were available .
neutral	interparcel seem well put_together but failed to pick_up my package on the agreed date ; not even a phone call to explain or reschedule .
neutral	not sure whether this would be down to city_link but the contract was with interparcel so held them mostly responsible .
neutral	may use again in the future but , for now , will stick with royal_mail
neutral	i like the idea of open rent and they do provide a good service for a good price , they are helpful and quick to respond to messages .
neutral	there is only 0 problem that put me of there service , some may like this way of working , after all it does work but i just find it a hassle and a bit of a put off for prospective tenants .
neutral	and this is that you can ' t put your own number or email address on the advert , openrent puts theirs on and all interest in the property must got through them , prospective tenants must leave a voice_mail with openrent then openrent send you a message with a link to listen to the voice_mail then you can listen to the message and get back to the inquirer , what is the point of this , i don ' t know ?
neutral	hopefully they will change this , but even if they don ' t overall i would recommend the service , got my property let .
neutral	unless you want to help the one man they send carry if from the van and upstairs by yourself ...
neutral	first time i flew and i was by my self i was flying from teeside on an london business trip ... i got to teesside airport and it was delayed 0 hours then on the way home it was delayed for a couple of hours .
neutral	they give me an £ 0 meal voucher to say sorry but meals cost more like £_00 so really it was just so u spend the extra £ 0 . 00 so not happy at all really .
neutral	i have used parcel0go . com on several_occasions with no issues .
neutral	however , one of my customers cancelled their order so i attempted to cancel collection of the package .
neutral	i followed their online procedure and was lead to a page saying that i would have to talk to an operator to complete the process .
neutral	unfortunately the link didn ’ t work .
neutral	there is no phone number on the site , the phone number on the invoice doesn ’ t work and the live help they promote is difficult to find .
neutral	in the end i cancelled after half an_hour searching via the live_chat and the guy came to collect the package anyway .
neutral	in my opinion they need a customer_service phone number that is in view and actually works .
neutral	it happened several_times to me to pay the regular price of a product even_though it said it ' s on discount .
neutral	trainline is good if you just want to go to one place to get your booking done quickly - but doesn ' t seem to be the cheapest - if you have time to book the different stages of your trip through different operators then this probably would work out best for you but if - like me - you only allow yourself 0 minutes to do any task then trainline is good to get it all done in one go !
neutral	you need to change your delivery service !
neutral	every problem i have had using your company has been down to them ,
neutral	change that and it will be 0_stars !
neutral	!
neutral	dont get me wrong i like amazon .
neutral	sometimes there is great deals on there and i love the one click payment option .
neutral	but there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search_function is a bit weak at points .
neutral	i do use google_search at work but i prefer ask . com .
neutral	information appears better on ask and its like google decides what it wants to show you , not what you are looking for .
neutral	but still its great from where we have come from .
neutral	wouldnt live without the search_engines
neutral	the belt was so fragile that it actually broke right after i wore it .
neutral	and the cloth of the midi skirt is too thin .
neutral	marry xmas to my warwick university fellows as well , i love warwick university , they have unconventional approaches to teaching and learning for individuals .
neutral	they love educating nation .
neutral	the price is crazy cheap , i love the style of most of the stuff in there but sizes seem way off , i thought it was just me being awkward but i have spoken to a few people of different_sizes and they agree .
neutral	easy to check in easy to spot where the check in area is and which gate you are going to thanks to the orange logo , nice staff , horrible food but what do you expect on a plane , comfy seats and although there was no assigned seating we still managed to get seats together .
neutral	brooking was easy and we got all the info in time checking in was easy too as we could skip the queues as we had reserved tickets the only issue i had was that i found the way the pricing was worded a little_confusing as it split the cost of the hotel and the flights but the pricing was reflected in a minus on the confirmation i called the helpline which they had given as part of the info and the chap on the end of the phone was really helpful so it was sorted no problem .
neutral	nice interface and layout , very simple to use .
neutral	no annoying popup email alerts and good selection of jobs .
neutral	particularly like the stats and data this site provides on salaries and where the jobs are .
neutral	their blog is well worth following !
neutral	generally great service , but information of necessity of having a printer before or during ordering_process would of save me a lot !
neutral	this left me with a feeling i might not use your service again .
neutral	hello , i am wondering about my tickets , will they arrive in june when tomorrowland . be are actually sending them away ?
neutral	or why should i wat till 0 days before the festival ?
neutral	i am flying to belgium at the 00th of july and i really want to have the tickets than !!
neutral	!
neutral	otherwise we will have big problems !!

neutral	regards lehmann
neutral	the staff was very helpful and the rooms where nice but on my stay had some noise from other guest plus i was next to a rail way so as im a light sleeper i kept getting disturbed through the night plus at 0 . 00am i was woken to someone banging apart_from the lake of sleep the room was nice with free view telly and a hair dryer and a phone the bathroom was small infact it was very small .
neutral	the bed was lovely and big and comfy apart_from the noise i enjoyed my stay .
neutral	sold a galaxy_s0 to bozowi for the sum of £_000 but then had an_email_stating they had downgraded my handset due to scratches ?
neutral	the hanset was in very good condition and had a few very minor marks to the rear from pockets etc .
neutral	and the working category states minor wear and tear ?
neutral	they only knocked £_00 off the price but if id been given a price of £_000 on the comparison site id have most_likely chosen a different company as others were also paying around the £_000 .
neutral	in the email it gave me the option to accept the new price or decline and have the handset returned to me at my expense ?
neutral	- i was sure on their site it said they would return the handset free of charge ?
neutral	- i may be wrong ?
neutral	so for the sake of £_00 i accepted the new price as they left me little choice !
neutral	it took just over a week for the money to reach my account which i wouldn t call especially fast or slow .
neutral	to sum it up i wouldnt say i wont use them again but would definately try a different company in future .
neutral	i signed_up to this company as it said they accepted paypal - yet when i got to the checkout there was no facility to pay this way .
neutral	as i have had poor experiences recently with goods not turning_up i prefer to use paypal but have had to take a risk by giving card_details - so i hope goods turn_up !
neutral	we will not be using this website again , ordered the pram , it arrived all without problem .
neutral	decided we didn ' t want it so we organised to return it which cost us £_00 .
neutral	it got collected on the 0th_feb_0000 , we didn ' t hear from babythings0u so we rang on the 00th_feb , finally received an_email on 00th and still_awaiting refund over a week_later !
neutral	no mention of long wait for refund on website .
neutral	0_stars because of delivery but be_careful if you decide to return , like to take your money but don ' t like giving it back !!

neutral	flew to haraklion from leeds on 00 / 00 / 00 - ls000
neutral	flight was on time , crew were wonderful and helpful , but there wasn ' t enough toasties which was annoying .
neutral	:( seats were fine for a 0 hour 00 min flight and arrived 00_mins early .
neutral	flew back to leeds on 00 / 00 / 00 - ls000
neutral	flight was scheduled for 0 :_00pm in the afternoon ( greece time ) but didn ' t end up flying to 00 :_00pm at night due to a operational fault .
neutral	was very tired and back was aching with standing up for so long in departure lounge & check - in area as there was no seats available .
neutral	got no announcement of having to go to departure departure lounge at 0 :_00pm when we were supposed too and asked a jet0 rep if we could .
neutral	we went to passport control and the queue was very long and was mixing in with lines in check in desks .
neutral	complete chaos and awful experience .
neutral	got the gate 00 min before we flew out and spent a few mins waiting for the bus to take us to the plane .
neutral	when we took off the cabin_crew came round for food and by the time that the crew at the back got to us ( row 00 ) there was no toasties left so had a sandwich which made me feel sick :( wasn ' t very happy at all .
neutral	was on boeing 000 .
neutral	the seats were ok for the flight and the food was reasonably_priced .
neutral	i feel it only fair that i follow_up my initial review by adding that since making my complaint i was promptly contacted by the collectplus customer care team who have been excellent in addressing my concerns .
neutral	so although there were issues with the service i received , i really cannot_fault their exceptional level of customer_service .
neutral	------
neutral	i ordered from amazon and opted to use the collectplus service ( at a cost of £ 0 . 00 ) and chose to collect from my local asda store .
neutral	the day after receiving a message that my parcel was ready for collection i headed to asda where i was met with a 00 minute wait only to be told that the person who deals with collections was not in that day and i would have to come back tomorrow .
neutral	overall service is good
neutral	i ordered a new lichfield sandwood 0 + 0 tent .
neutral	this tent arrived_promptly , and was pitched in my back garden .
neutral	upon pitching , i realised it had 0 holes in the groundsheet - i rang up the 0000 number and the women asked me to take photos and email them across .
neutral	i did this , and the women email back to say that i was to send the affected part of the tent back , and they would refund me up to £ 0 for the delivery of the item back to them .
neutral	she said this would then be sent directly to lichfield for them to either fix or replace the affected part .
neutral	i told her i couldn ' t wait as i was camping in the next few_days , and after_speaking to her manager , they finally_agreed to send me a replacement tent , and they also arranged the collection of the existing faulty tent at no cost to me .
neutral	currently , i am promised the replacement tent will be with me tomorrow , and the faulty tent will be collected tomorrow .
neutral	if this is the case , i will gladly upgrade my " average " rating to a " good " rating .
neutral	looking at all the other reviews on here , people have to accept that the cost of the items are incredibly cheap , and therefore there may be problems along the way .
neutral	the sandwood 0 + 0 tent is £_000 cheaper_than many other outdoor shops .
neutral	play . com used to be the best shop on the internet by a clear mile , they had the best prices , the best service and a great selection of products , i used them so much that i even have a play . com branded credit_card to earn points to spend there ....
neutral	so where then did it all go_wrong ?
neutral	well i can ' t answer that i ' m_afraid , all i know is that the variety of products has diminished and the prices have crept up and up over the last few_years to the point where play . com is a shadow of its former self .
neutral	i rarely use play anymore which is a shame .
neutral	i find myself using amazon for all of the things i once would have purchased here .
neutral	they seem to be more of a promoter now than a seller , most items i look at are sold by third parties , if i wanted that , i ' d be on ebay .
neutral	maybe one day they will turn things around again , who_knows ....
neutral	having used gear0music a couple of times i will not be using them again , whilst their products are fine and prices very good if they insist on using yodel as a delivery provider i will not use them again .
neutral	i paid for a specific day delivery as i needed the items urgently and yodel lost 0 of the 0 packages , delivered it 0 days_later ( 0 days after i actually needed the items ).
neutral	i have been buying from this company for some time , i like them , and i will probably buy from them again .
neutral	but they do sometimes have issues with there delivery and they do cost a fair bit , but overall i like the stuff they sell and will_continue to be a customer .
neutral	the item arrived in the uk from germany in 0 days , so can ' t fault the delivery speed .
neutral	however , the mounting bolts that came with the brackets are too short to reach the vesa screw holes on my panasonic viera tv .
neutral	i ' ve had to go to my local diy shop and find new bolts to fit ( which aren ' t cheap ).
neutral	the flowers were nice , but the vase of flowers was just that , with no protective , convenient carrier bag or box to carry them in .
neutral	i also think the delivery charges are too high , considering what the item is , i think that delivery should be included in the price , or additional for short_notice .
neutral	for a perishable product , expecting an additional delivery charge in this age of free internet delivery of non - perishables , and free delivery of convenience food , with modest delivery charges for whole weeks worth of shopping from online supermarkets is too much .
neutral	it took a week for them to even start the shipping process and then another week for delivery , if your in a rush don ' t use this site but if your not in a rush then you couldn ' t do any better prices are great and 0 %_off your first order ,
neutral	but be aware delivery is painfully_slow :(
neutral	loved to get sms texts on my phone about the tracking .
neutral	but in the end i saw it was back to the depot , so i left my house as i thought it is not going to be delivered .
neutral	came home and found it in my neigbours place .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	usually very good service however last two times i have ordered from echo i had to wait 0 days when its next_day delivery but will still use echo great prices im sure i have just been unlucky kind_regards chris green
neutral	gk
neutral	speedy_delivery and website was easy to navigate .
neutral	however , i am just
neutral	noticing now that there is a typo in the above feedback paragraph that you may wish to change to avoid looking unprofessional .
neutral	" areas where we are weak and ad to areas where we are strong ", it should obviously be add not ad .
neutral	also , there should be another ' where ' in order for the sentence to make more sense .
neutral	the only other thing is the volume of e_- mails we , as customers , recieve thrughout the duration of our order .
neutral	a simple order confirmation and an order receipt will suffice .
neutral	additionally , having to log on to your website everytime to look at the progress of your order is frustrating .
neutral	i know that by making customers log on by saying ' scary ' things like ' it is vital that you log in ' you want customers to view other products and keep you in mind etc .
neutral	but ultimately , it just makes me think that if i did place another order with you , i would end up receiving unwanted e_- mail and hassle .
neutral	i ' m sorry to go on about the bad things , but to be fair your site was easy to use and offered the best prices .
neutral	if the site itself had a better design (_eg .
neutral	more colour ) and the ordering system became smoother and simpler , then i would definitely reccommend you to others .
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	simon coleman
neutral	i made a large order with qs_supplies , and was very happy with the price .
neutral	there were a couple of delays on delivery , but i had ordered well in_advance .
neutral	i needed to return a few items for various reasons at different times .
neutral	this is where the experience fell well short .
neutral	i spoke to the manager who promised to resolve everything , but it took constant chasing to get my full_refund .
neutral	it ' s such a shame as if it wasn ' t for the dreadful support_team , i ' d be raving about qs_supplies .
neutral	i will still buy from qs_supplies again as their prices are excellent , and delivery was ( mostly ) prompt .
neutral	mazuma i think you could have gave a littel more ?
neutral	you cant be_beaten on a bargain .. but . plz stop cutting the size tags off .. ive had a few items now with the incorrect sizes .. anymore of this and i will report you to trading_standards .
neutral	you know we wont send the items back as the postage will probably cost more_than the item is worth . woo and a jumper i received the other say had a hole in it .. the stitching was out so much the neckline was practically on my shoulder . very disappointing as ive had some really good items in the past .
neutral	just because its cheap it doesnt mean it shouldnt be of merchantable quality .
neutral	we have used resorthoppa for a few_years ,, before them we always got a taxi ,,, so when we heard about resort_hoppa we were delighted my family have an apartment in spain and we are very regular users of the hoppa , and never had any complaints , but what has gone wrong this year , everyone of our friends and family have not been happy with it , the time waiting for other planes to land to fill the hoppa , i can not understand_why if you do not have enough people dont you use smaller buses / coaches , surely this would be more visable ,,, please remember when , you have travelled for hours and your hot , tired , you just want to get to your destination , and not be hanging or sitting around waiting for another plane to land to fill the coach ,,, you will loose custom , people are complaining already
neutral	0th week still unpaid ..
neutral	0days verify cards
neutral	0 - 0 days making payment
neutral	00 days testing
neutral	00 days postage travels
neutral	and bla .. bla .. bla
neutral	:) maybe this company nearly bankrupt ?
neutral	posted on same time to ziffit and to music_magpie boxes ... ziffit received after 0weeks .. and music_magpie still_waiting .
neutral	guys you need to do something with this long long cash waiting times , and do not expect better feedbacks from customers .
neutral	0_stars you got for perfect items testing .. am happy , but waiting time is 0_stars .. total 0
neutral	be aware of new prices from ziffit !!!
neutral	couple days ago i found that .. from around 0 . 00p dropped to 0 . 00 .. now i found some new prices like 0 . 00 or 0 . 00 .. lots of 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 too ..
neutral	this company not good any more :(
neutral	delivery tends to be slow meaning what should be a piping hot meal soon turns to a temperamentally warm dish .
neutral	i have found standards to occasionally slip , particularly when eating in .
neutral	however i have to admit prices are reasonable and when they get it right - there ' s nothing better_than good ' ol pizza_hut .
neutral	i tend to find homebase slightly on the expensive side .
neutral	looking for an electric scale i felt annoyed to find the same product almost 00_% cheaper on a similar site .
neutral	the flowers were absolutely_gorgeous by my only problem was that they were delivered so late - around 0pm .
neutral	not ideal given that they were a birthday_gift and for a relative who doesn ' t feel_comfortable answering the door to strangers after dark .
neutral	as a result , they went to the neighbour .
neutral	i think that delivery should take place during the day and not at night .
neutral	i ' ve had to spend a bit of money replacing strings and damages to guitar ...
neutral	the guitar sounds nice although i ' m now weary of using gear for music again ...
neutral	after receiving a phone call from a guy called michael he shipped me out some new strings the very next_day ...
neutral	i ' m pleased with this and will consider_using gear for music again
neutral	i have mixed views of 0 , the speed of delivery of a new phone is great and network_coverage is pretty good over the uk .
neutral	except at my home , but i do now have a home booster kit that they offer for free :)
neutral	this doesn ' t make up for the fact that they choose to operate their general customer support call_centre overseas .
neutral	operatives struggle to understand what you are trying to achieve .
neutral	we recently signed_up for a new 0yr £_00 / mth contract and wanted to cancel the current £_00 / month payg contract both with 0 .
neutral	trying to cancel this contract proved very annoying as the customer_service representative would not listen to what we were saying and kept trying to convince us we should upgrade .
neutral	we already had the new phone and they just would not cancel the payg account , we got pushed around 0 different people for nearly 0hr and were almost late for dinner .
neutral	on another occasion i wanted to arrange a new 0yr contract and also receive a home booster kit as network_coverage at home was very poor .
neutral	i spent 0 calls each over an_hour trying to achieve this simple objective and yet they still managed to mess it up and didn ' t deliver the booster kit on the first attempt .
neutral	they do seem to have chosen the right people when you contact home booster kit support .
neutral	they are friendly , supportive and very knowledgable .
neutral	hence my mixed feelings if i could i ' d give then a 0 . 0 .
neutral	recently used the site to buy a running gilet and they price matched a price i found on another store .
neutral	good service and delivery was quick .
neutral	only friction was that they only price_match over the phone and not through allocating a special one - use discount_code to use on their website .
neutral	i ' ve used this co for some time and everything is top_notch , except the courier left a package with the neighbours which was embarrassing as it obviously contained tablets
neutral	i have used ebay since 0000 .
neutral	i must_say i ' ve had a lot of ups and downs with ebay .
neutral	you can make plenty cash here or lose your account unfairly if a buyer complains for what ever reason .
neutral	very useful for getting rid of stuff you don ' t need or use .
neutral	the game i ordered arrived quickly but unfortunately it arrived with stickers on stating that it should not be sold separately as it was part of a bundle package .
neutral	this game was a birthday_gift and these stickers were underneath the cellophane .
neutral	i am also concerned that if the stickers do not come off will this effect a possible trade in ?
neutral	i emailed gameseek just to inform them as to what happened and i have so far been ignored , so im not really impressed .
neutral	overall disappointed because the flowers i got did not look fresh at all .
neutral	and for the price ( i upgraded to deluxe ) i expected to get a much more impressive bouquets , the size didn ' t seem to even be as big as the picture , let_alone a deluxe version .
neutral	added to this , there was no flower feed included .
neutral	delivery man rang doorbell and left flowers on the front_door - not the most pleasant of transactions .
neutral	think ill stick with my local flower shop next time .
neutral	they saved my backside just in time but their international selection is a bit poor and pricey .
neutral	i found the phone support to be fairly good , explaining everything i wanted to know about their new services .
neutral	overdraft charges are a ripoff and their local branches are very very poor .
neutral	i wanted to open a business account with them but every_single time they would cancel the meeting at the last_minute .
neutral	i was so fed_up that i opened it with a bigger and more successful rival bank .
neutral	recently i had to book a hotel in london for a short - notice business appointment , the hotel that was recommended was a bit too far from anywhere , although it was a bit ' cheaper ' for london standards the quality was very low , incredibly small rooms ( misleading pics ) and very cold .
neutral	we tried to get in touch with lastminute and pass some feedback on that particular promoted hotel but we never_heard back from them nor the hotel .
neutral	it ' s disappointing when custom support is so scarce when there are many other alternatives around .
neutral	i have been an o0 client since the first iphone was released in the uk .
neutral	the staff have always been particularly helpful ( both in stores and on the phone ) but a few things are lacking and haven ' t been improved during the time i have been a client with them :
neutral	0 .
neutral	mobile coverage is very poor in the outskirts of city centres , especially in the north .
neutral	0 .
neutral	very little offers for long - term customers , nothing exciting from keeping me on changing provider ( in fact i will do so by the end of july ).
neutral	0 .
neutral	some shops do not display real handsets !
neutral	is this a joke ?
neutral	how do i know if i like a particular phone when the only thing you see is a cheap plastic replica ?
neutral	*
neutral	* unfortunately this is a problem with other providers as well .
neutral	when trying to order something i needed to get the item delivered to a different address ( work ) than my billing_address as no - one would be there to accept it at home .
neutral	i found that their website insisted that my alternate postal_address have a different email address as well , one that had to be different than the email address used for my billing postal_address .
neutral	this makes no sense .
neutral	why would you have a different email address for a different postal location ?
neutral	most people are only likely to have one email address .
neutral	i have shopped at cw many_times .
neutral	i can ' t comment on contracts but for payg mobiles i find them the best .
neutral	that ' s not to say they are a great company just as my title_says they are the best of a bad bunch .
neutral	i don ' t trust them , i just want my phone and to walk out / click and buy and then to never have to deal with them again .
neutral	their shops are filled with smiley salesmen ( sales people ?)
neutral	but they are better_than other high - street phone relaters and to their credit i have found them to have the lowest_prices .
neutral	0 / 0 is generous .
neutral	... a bit sketchy in woodingdean , brighton though .
neutral	bought a vauxhall corsa excoflex .
neutral	car salesman advised it was £ 0 road tax and group 0 insurance .
neutral	got home and looked at all documents and discovered he was wrong in both cases .
neutral	no info on car windows except for price .
neutral	bought car through finance but within 0 minutes i ' m advised to buy extras .
neutral	was not actually clear on my monthly premium until the very end .
neutral	would recomend cars but make_sure you look at all the details in writing first .
neutral	dont trust what they say .
neutral	can find products much cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	like most people , i don ' t like being taken for a fool - so tesco , if you want to retain my business , i hope you understand that shadey techniques like smaller pack sizes on " buy 0 for xx deals " in fresh produce , " special purchase " packs which are worse value than the regular , and deliberately inflating prices around your clubcard voucher exchange time is fairly transparent .
neutral	i know you have to remain competitive , but at_least have some respect for your customers ' intelligence .
neutral	apart_from that , i enjoy shopping with you , but i get seriously cross when i ' m not respected by you .
neutral	i was very impressed with my glasses especially for the price , after my first purchase i then bought another 0 pairs !!
neutral	however i was a bit confused when it came to picking my lenses and one of the pairs i bought was not what i expected , but for the price i paid i was still happy with the product i received .
neutral	found weebles infested in a purchase i made , should of gone to the papers may have had it debt with properly !
neutral	0 for 0 offer represents great value with loyalty_scheme providing further discount for return customers .
neutral	however , each order ( i get 0 boxes of well an every 00 weeks ) comes with 0 - 0 free ' gifts ' ranging_from coasters and pens , to scissors and tape measures .
neutral	quite_frankly , i don ' t need or want any of these and most go straight in the bin or to a charity shop .
neutral	vitabotics have an environmental responsibility to allow customers to opt out receiving these freebies !
neutral	easy to order online and to pick a date for delivery .
neutral	we were told that we would receive a text_message_stating if the delivery would come am or pm .
neutral	we never received this text_message , and when we called up we were told that the system was temporarily unavailable .
neutral	as the delivery could happen anytime between_0am and 0pm , we just had to sit at home and wait all day .
neutral	delivery finally showed up at 0pm , but by now we had wasted a full morning where we could have done something different if knowing the delivery were going to be pm .
neutral	i went there last_year to get new carpet for my bedroom , nothing fancy , but i wanted it to last .
neutral	i purchased a roll marked up as " heavy duty general "
neutral	i have had the carpet for about a year and it is ruined .
neutral	poor quality .
neutral	will not be going there again .
neutral	staff were kind of helpful however and the showroom was clean and well_presented
neutral	the waterstones website is very easy to use and very informative about future releases from my favorite authors , it ' s also been a great way to find potential new reads for me as i find the stores can be very disorientating and hard to find exactly_what your looking for .
neutral	i ' ve purchased a few books from the website and have been very pleased with the service as i have had no_problems with it , but upon looking at other_websites i have come to find that i was paying a little_bit more .
neutral	i can ' t fault the service or the website itself but i do recommend that you shop around for prices as you can save a few pounds on bestsellers and maybe more on lesser known books and as we all know it soon adds up .
neutral	i started using them a few_years_ago , they are good but i have had some issues .
neutral	starting with the good : they have a great range of films and you can even watch online .
neutral	the bad you never get the films from your list you want its always the ones you pick to make up the numbers , some of the films will skip making them unwatchable , i got defiance from them and i swear i got so fed_up with the jumps i must of missed 00_mins of the film .
neutral	also the envelopes they send seem to go down after a time , you start with 0 , you send back the 0 films in 0 envelopes and they put 0 new films in the same envelope so you down to one and then they say you can send them back in a freepost_envelope you have to buy yourself !
neutral	which i must_say is a bit much for something you are paying for !!
neutral	i would recommend to mates but i would wore them first .
neutral	so i went to have my eyes tested again to see what my new prescription would be , and i thought i would grab a cheap deal on groupon as i kept seeing them come up .
neutral	i only had to wait a couple of days and it was on groupon so i quickly brought it .
neutral	i have taken time over choosing my glasses , managed to find the ones i wanted yesterday .
neutral	today i get an_email telling_me about a promotion that is currently running love00 where i will get 00_%_off and free delivery .
neutral	so i thought i would just order them now and use my groupon and my voucher that i was sent but no , once my groupon code is entered wont let me enter love00 so i miss out on the current promotion .
neutral	i have used glasses_direct a few_times but must_say i am slightly disappointed in my experience this time .
neutral	i also noticed you can get a lot of the frames cheaper off other_sites , but as i now have my groupon_voucher i guess i had to use it .
neutral	after ordering them to being delivered is quite slow i was expecting 0 days for delivery as it only said standard delivery still no invites or phone call wanted to send them out at the weekend but looks_like it won ' t happen just another stress to add to the wedding planning
neutral	still the cheapest flight company .
neutral	like to fly with them but they should invest in some bigger aircraft .
neutral	i do not know what it is that you are gold or silver customer but they think they can con and trick on that talk .
neutral	want to upgrade now and they will have to do it if they have some system issues .
neutral	apart_from that i am satisfied customer .
neutral	good signal_coverage , calls rarely dropout .
neutral	tariffs are competitive too .
neutral	like many services , all is well until you need to actually speak to someone .
neutral	the " hold " time for customer_services is generally 0 - 00_mins and the individual at the other end of the phone can be hit or miss .
neutral	i queued for 0hr 00mins last month to get through to the complaints_dept only to be greeted immediately with " were having it problems , please call back tomorrow " - not " hello ", not " sorry to the delay ".
neutral	when i asked if there was no way i could have been informed ( i . e .
neutral	recorded_message or similar ) without having to hold for almost an_hour and a half she merely repeated " were having it problems , please call back tomorrow ".
neutral	possibly the rudest anyone has ever been to me over the phone .
neutral	i am still with o0 - only because i cant be bothered to ring back to cancel my contract .
neutral	accommodation was ok except there was cum stains all over the floor n sofa .. 00 / 0 bar !
neutral	...
neutral	if we had paid for the events ourselves it would of cost us £_00 but instead chilli_sauce wanted £_000 , they didn ' t book is on a guest_list properly and we where supposed to have a booth , got there and all we had was a free entry
neutral	finding the inversion table was fine and ordering all quick and easy , delivery next_day was excellent .
neutral	however when i recieved the table there were 0 poles all in plastic and tied together which were heavily scratched which had to be packed that way .
neutral	then my next problem was the instructions which was pretty_much unreadable so pretty_much winged .
neutral	then putting the back board on the table there was a about an inch gap it took 0 of us with grips just to get one bolt .
neutral	but after all that it was all set_up ready to test which was all fine until the next_day i went on it and the strap snapped and sent me flying back luckily my partner stopped me from falling out , i did have hold of handles but no matter how tight i tighten them they are still loose , to be fair they are safe just when the wobble you think they wont hold you .
neutral	people say dont go for cheap and pay for expensive one but i just cant afford and with 0 herdinated discs and in consent pain i had to try but even at a £_000 i personally would expect something safer than this , as at the moment my partner has to hold me half way not what i expected after 0 day but hopefully it will get better .
neutral	have used scan for years as my sole supplier of it products for my customers , however , i am seriously disappointed with the total_lack of customer support on this occasion .
neutral	scan advertised an item on special offer which later turned_out to be out of stock due to a stock level discrepancy .
neutral	the first email from scan was very vague , claiming that they were so busy they hadn ' t been able to get all orders out .
neutral	i gave them a couple of days and heard_nothing , only to be told that it was not due to the warehouse being busy , but the item i had ordered was out of stock and would be for the foreseeable_future .
neutral	i was not offered a replacement product ( even_though scan had taken my money ) and was told if i wanted a replacement , i ' d have to pay the difference or have a full_refund .
neutral	this is unacceptable .
neutral	refund received and all is well .
neutral	i buy items like this online mainly so that i don ' t have to put up with the hard sell for insurance products offered by the likes of currys .
neutral	i placed my order with appliancesonline and within 00_minutes i received a phone call supposedly to check the details of my order .
neutral	this was actually a sales_pitch to try and get me to take out their insurance making 00 ... yes 00 monthly_payments of £_00 per_month .... are you kidding ??
neutral	?
neutral	when i said i would need to check with my wife first , the guy on the phone mentioned that i ' d get a 00 day free_trial .
neutral	when i said i ' d still need to talk to my wife first , he sounded really confused and said he ' d ring me back later that day ... needless to say , i ignored the following phone_calls from this company .
neutral	delivery was on time , and i liked being kept_informed ( even if the driver did ring me at 0am ), although i ' ve still not fitted the items but they look good .
neutral	so .... for the products , the website , the delivery , 0_stars absolutely .
neutral	for the hard sales_pitch that i didn ' t ask for , 0 star .
neutral	i ordered a parcel from tesco_direct to be delivered before new years but have not yet received it .
neutral	it was due for delivery on new year ' s eve and indicated online that it was with the courier .
neutral	later that evening the tracking_system was updated saying that an attempt at delivery had been made and a card left .
neutral	as it happened i was outside ( right by the front_door ) in the garden all morning and afternoon new year ' s eve chopping logs and nothing came down my drive and there was certainly no card left .
neutral	i rearranged for delivery today and again , the tracking_system has been updated just now with ' delivery attempted , card left ' - nobody has come to the house and no card has been left .
neutral	i have called the call_centre but it doesn ' t recognise my parcel reference so i can ' t even pick it up from the service centre .
neutral	i did wonder if it ' s a problem with location as i am out in the sticks but i have had deliveries from yodel on numerous_occasions and have not had problems .
neutral	yodel you ' ve been doing so well .
neutral	don ' t spoil it .
neutral	update_:
neutral	after_speaking to a member of yodel customer_service team i had my parcel delivered this morning and apology for the ' misunderstanding ' from the delivery guy .
neutral	it was the same guy who has delivered to us before , and the same one who will deliver to us again as we will_continue to use yodel .
neutral	thank_you for your assistance !
neutral	happy new year .
neutral	since joining sky_poker i have enjoyed playing as it provides good tourneys and and good payouts .
neutral	however i like to play sit and go ' s but it is very rare i can get into a game as i have to wait for lengthy periods of time which just puts me off playing .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i have recently ordered through supplement_warehouse .
neutral	the company does do well with beating prices with the on hand price_match .
neutral	though my concern with their company is the shipping this is my second order through them simply because the price is cheaper , but tomorrow , in regards to my first order , will have been a week .
neutral	this is aggrevating as it is messing up my supplementation so hopefully my friend ' s order comes sooner_than mine did .
neutral	good range of effective products , excellent delivery .
neutral	my only issue is that they are very expensive , but regularly run special_offers which i take_advantage of .
neutral	the booking was quick and simple , and i received confirmation almost_immediately .
neutral	i have booked quite far in_advance and as such i will need more time to fully review this company and will update accordingly further down the line .
neutral	so far it seems quite secure , and i got a good deal .
neutral	£_000 more_than another company which i discovered only 0 day after my initial query and they take the full_amount rather_than a deposit even_though they cannot guarantee you will get the plate .
neutral	after sales is poor , and i ended_up receiving my retention certificate 0 days before it was due to expire ( and that wasn ' t sent special delivery as i asked , or not even recorded ), i have now found out this was extended so that ' s improved things somewhat , but again i found the whole_process very difficult with numerous contact instances on my part .
neutral	claims management company not a solicitors .
neutral	very are good , you can buy lots of different things and spread the cost or pay it off there and then .
neutral	prices are very competitive too .
neutral	my only_gripe with them is that i have been trying to send earphones back for over a month now , these headphones are still under factory warranty but i also took the extended_warranty .
neutral	i have called and they have told me multiple_times that the items will be picked_up and to have them ready , i am still_waiting !
neutral	whilst i have several ipods and iphones within the household , i have always had to buy them when they were out of season or 0 generations old ... now that other_companies are catching up and even exceeding apple capabilities and style , i am tempted to cross over if apple ' s prices don ' t plateau into something affordable ...
neutral	the cut paypal gets on sold items does not justify its use , but i have no other choice while using ebay as a seller .
neutral	by the time ebay take their cut and paypal take theirs , and you pay the postage , you ' re left with a lot less_than what you sell for ...
neutral	i am a regular buyer and seller , it ' s mostly straight_forward , but as a seller it is sickening to see the % cut they take when you sell expensive items , especially if you have paypal as well .
neutral	i don ' t like the fact you can ' t give buyers bad ratings if they mess with you .
neutral	ordered an item back early november , received five weeks_later !
neutral	did email and attempt to call to chase up my item , but not response was obtained .
neutral	item was of very good quality however , just a shame i had to wait so long for it !
neutral	the hotel was very nice , clean and functional and the breakfasts were good and well needed .
neutral	the paintball was fun but got a few complaints about extra money for our own transfers as it was so far away .
neutral	tiger_tiger wanted £ 0 / head even_though we were on a " guest - list " which is a bit out of order .
neutral	purple door we had booked for 0pm but were turned away to deep_blue as there were no girls working at that time .
neutral	oceana was a pretty good do from what i remember despite it being fairly quiet .
neutral	all in all a good time was had by everyone but more off our own merits in fairness .
neutral	like so many others , this review is about the reaper of souls debacle too .
neutral	preorders were supposed to be delivered prior to launch , but weren ' t .
neutral	personally i lost less game time because of that than some , but it was still something of a failure to deliver on time and also they were somewhat lacking in communication as it was happening .
neutral	they tried to say sorry via a gift , but unfortunately two out of three options were eve online things that are pointless if you ' re already a player , leaving only one option for me .
neutral	well , at_least luckily i didn ' t have that particular game , but overall there wasn ' t much of a choice presented .
neutral	though its late but finaly got my my i phone unlocked
neutral	we got there , but even_though it had been discussed that i wanted to use frequent flyer points to upgrade , the fares that were booked didn ' t allow upgrades .
neutral	this wasn ' t explained in_advance and it wasn ' t possible to fix the problem .
neutral	also , no bassinet or meal was requested for my small son .
neutral	i was paranoid enough to phone the airline to check , but because it was by then a late request we had him on our laps for one 00 hour flight .
neutral	have nothin but problems using this app when using my mobile data .
neutral	only ever works when connected to wi_- if at home which refers the object of having the application on my phone in the first place .
neutral	i took my car for servicing , been fixed price but was told that it require speicilist oil .
neutral	was bit surprised at i have 0000 standard model and was charged extra for this .
neutral	was also got charged for extra work which on enquiring no one has a clue_what it was
neutral	boohoo has lots of lovely clothes with mixed quality .
neutral	i purchased three dresses and a skirt .
neutral	the skirt was lovely and a real bargain .
neutral	the dresses had a strange chemical smell to them and were too big .
neutral	i thought that after washing the smell would go so wanted to exchange for a smaller_size .
neutral	boohoo does not offer exchanges so i had to return them .
neutral	i was shocked to find out that they would charge £ 0 per item to restock !
neutral	you can avoid the £ 0 restocking fee by writing to inform them that you want to cancel the contract but you have a limited amount of time .
neutral	really disappointed with boohoo :(
neutral	ordered my drill on the 0rd of april , only received it today the 00th , i was never told or made aware it out of stock , told i would have drill on the 00th and got no email of any update of why i did not receive it , after further emailing eventually told it was dispatched , disappointing overall as great prices on tools here unsure if i will shop here again , service is not good enough in todays market .
neutral	chillisauce have great flexibility which means you can choose your activities which is brilliant .
neutral	our group contains performers , musicians and designers etc - so it is very tricky to find an activity which will be new and exciting for everyone .
neutral	the online management tool was really good .
neutral	it helped_me collect everyone ' s details and tracked who was coming to which part of the day .
neutral	although it could be improved if you could download the data into excel to add your own information such as menu choices .
neutral	the payment by deposit and balance works really well .
neutral	it means no one else has to pay for anyone_else , which is good .
neutral	the communication from my account_manager was poor .
neutral	i could never get hold of her on the phone and my calls were not returned .
neutral	we had a last_minute hiccup the day before the hen_do ( down to one of the bridesmaids ) and i left 0 voicemails requesting a return phone call and sent multiple email messages also requesting a phone call .
neutral	i only had email responses .
neutral	i would have preferred a phone call as requested .
neutral	i also got given the wrong menu for the comedy_club .
neutral	a menu was attached to my members area so i sent this out to all the girls .
neutral	i asked my account_manager if i needed to pre_- book food ( 00 days before the event ) and i was told i had to pre_- order 0 days in_advance .
neutral	this only gave me 0 week to ask 00 people for the menu choices .
neutral	i also got sent a completely_different and much more limited menu .
neutral	our group had 00 vegetarians - there was only one vegetarian choice on the second menu .
neutral	it would have been really helpful if the correct menu was given in the first place and the requirement to pre_- book food had been communicated !
neutral	i don ' t know what would have happened if i had not asked !
neutral	i paid for the ' grandisimo ' display and i ' d like to have seen what the standard display would have been .
neutral	0 flowers ?
neutral	saying that the flowers themselves were lovely .
neutral	i think the name was just a tad misleading .
neutral	i am trying to get 0 tickets for the newcastle vs sunderland game at st james ' park and it says 0 available for leazes stand l0sb and i only want 0 !
neutral	how do i select only 0 tickets not all the 0 ?
neutral	help before these tickets go please !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	this is my first concert ever that i am going to , i was so excited to find that all of these tickets were in the first rows , and so i was dissapointed when my tickets came and i ' m sitting in row m , but that is forgivable , and not a big issue
neutral	though the delivery took much longer_than i excpected .
neutral	the tickets arrived after 00 days of waiting , and 0 days after i recieved a message that they had been dispatched .
neutral	this means i anxiously waited for 0 weeks before i recieved my tickets .
neutral	there should be a notice as to how long they may take to be dilevered , and they should take about 0 working_days , not more .
neutral	( anxiety sure get ' s the best of us !)
neutral	and now i have 0 months of more anxious waiting , :_d
neutral	i am still so excited to go the concert , and will use double0tickets again if i enjoy my seats for this concert , as they are the cheapest dealers in sold out events !
neutral	:_d
neutral	i ordered just a mattress and the quality / price etc was really great .
neutral	however , i have one qualm about the deliveries - if you want to have a time_slot that isn ' t as vague as " any time between_0am and 0pm " then you have to pay quite a hefty fee for it .
neutral	and if you want to have it delivered on saturday you have to pay £_00 for it .
neutral	news for you guys - most people are only available on weekends , and this extra £_00 charge makes some of your mattresses less affordable than another company .
neutral	i opted to go for you guys because i could choose the day i wanted it on and luckily i already had a day booked off work so i could wait in for it , however it would have been nice if the driver could have just called on the day of delivery to give an eta - it ' s not that hard , plenty of other_companies do it , and so should you to make your company better .
neutral	whilst i ' m not down rating the quality of the product , things like the delivery really do make a difference , and i am glad that i got to pick the day i wanted it on , however in this day and age you would think that it wouldn ' t cost anything just to have the driver call and give an eta so you can actually feel free to get on with your day without expecting the delivery to come at any moment .
neutral	i have been with studio00 for about a year or something now , and i have had no problem with any clothes or shoes ordered , ( the shoes especially have been really good quality !).
neutral	unfortunately , the same cannot be said for anything which needs to be plugged in to a socket .
neutral	i have now ordered a tablet , hifi system , and now a psvita , and all 0 items had faults with them .
neutral	i wonder , has any other customer here been able to purchase an electrical item that works ?
neutral	i would be interested to hear from someone !
neutral	this company is the most bizarre one that i have ever held an account with !
neutral	( although not the worst !)
neutral	i just cant understand_why every electrical item ive ordered , doesnt work !
neutral	are studio re - sending out returned items by mistake ?
neutral	or refurbished items ?
neutral	ive never come_across a problem like this , where ive been unable to get at_least one item to work properly !
neutral	!
neutral	ok , this is a long review as have copied exact emails in .
neutral	in summary , awful customer_service , but good products .
neutral	in detail ... read on !
neutral	ordered item from the website which in itself was fine and easy to use .
neutral	i waited about 00 days and then sent an_email to the company to chase up the order .
neutral	i got a very bland reply back saying " the order has been sent royal_mail second class delivery which takes 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	if the item is lost in the post then we must wait_until 00 working_days to re - send it ."
neutral	ok that is fine , but when your a customer ordering items for a planned trip its hard for you to wait 00 days and then have another item sent out that could have the same situation .
neutral	i do appreciate that this is awkard for the company but causes the customer issue .
neutral	i replied asking when the 00 days had to be from .
neutral	simple question , and reasonable i would say !
neutral	they replied with " that is 00 days from it being sent , which will be on your order " seriously that was all they said .
neutral	lets be honest they could have looked and replied with the dates for me .
neutral	a bit of customer_service whereby you check the order and reply with the dates would be helpful !
neutral	so i replied and said " your reply was far from helpful .
neutral	i have waited and waited and checked the order .
neutral	it doesnt say what day it was sent only that the order was placed on the 0st november and is in transit .
neutral	i am leaving the country next thursday and want these for the trip .
neutral	if these have been lost i think it best you cancel the order and refund the money .
neutral	i cant risk waiting another 0 + weeks so will have to shop elsewhere ."
neutral	which i think is fair !
neutral	suddenly got this reply " if you could call tom and speak to chris he will get another pair sent out to you and claim for the goods lost , he is the returns manager and can deal with this for you !!!"
neutral	ok , maybe a minor point but was it just me that thought i had to phone a bloke called tom !
neutral	its an_email to a customer not a text_message to your mate .
neutral	good english would be appreciated .
neutral	and to be honest for a pair of sea shoes i felt i w
neutral	i have been a great customer to bulk_powders due to the quality of their products and clear nutrition info unlike some other_companies with their proprietry blends .
neutral	i have converted my friends to use them instead of mypr **** n . com because of their cheaper prices .
neutral	however when i chose to have guaranteed next_day delivery , i expect next_day delivery .
neutral	otherwise i would have chosen another courier .
neutral	i phoned up customer_services and they just said
neutral	" oh sorry about that , it will be with you tomorrow and there is nothing else we can do " i did suggest they compensate me by offering me free_samples of other products to try but this was shot down quickly from the customer_service team .
neutral	this would be ok if it never stated guaranteed next_day delivery .
neutral	but i needed my delivery today for my workout .
neutral	i will not be able to collect the delivery in person as i am away with work ...
neutral	being a loyal_customer i expect good service .
neutral	this is not unfortunately .
neutral	i may be tempted to shop elsewhere in the future .
neutral	i have used them quite a lot and i am happy with their cheap prices and nice destinations .
neutral	if you have a problem though it is a mere suicide to get it resolved .
neutral	i have been talking to their support quite a lot until they fix my problem and only because i tell them what is the real problem .
neutral	i can recommend them for cheap flights but not for some planned vacation because they rarely refund or anything_else like that .
neutral	the process of creating my invitations was very easy .
neutral	however when i received the printed invitations i was a little disappointed in the print quality .
neutral	the image looked pixelated .
neutral	if the image quality wasn ' t good enough this should have been flagged up during the design process as it is on other_sites .
positive	you can ' t avoid things going wrong sometimes , but i think you get the measure of a company by how they fix things which have gone wrong ; based on my experience with mpb i would have no reservations recommending them to others
positive	this service is really quick when you purchase a game .
positive	less_than 0 minutes and you got your code !
positive	ery reliable and trust_worthy .
positive	its my first time ordering from here but ive heard_nothing but great things and i have very high_hopes !
positive	ordered a few sets of cards from moo . com without any_issues , the prices are a little expensive but you get good quality business_cards .
positive	they also they do a variety of other card types and allow you to customise the front and back layouts with the option to use ready - made designs .
positive	the alignment on one order were a slightly off this was probably down to the size of the image i uploaded , highly_recommended !
positive	been shopping with amazon since they were formed , have brought lots of books from them and always received the products ordered on time .
positive	returns and replacements are dealt_with swiftly by their customer support_team on electronic items which have gone faulty within the warranty_period .
positive	ordered items lost in delivery are investigated and replacements are sent whilst the investigation takes place , all you have to do is send back one of the packages if both eventually arrive .
positive	as other_reviewers have stated , please be weary of the marketplace listings as they can be problem - some can be cheaper or more_expensive than buying from amazon uk .
positive	just make_sure when buying that you check the " sold by " and the prices from marketplace_sellers and products supplied directly from amazon uk .
positive	i have used just keepers on a number of occassions and have never_experienced any_issues at all with any of my orders .
positive	deliveries are always made promptly so they are really great if you need something quickly .
positive	i will_continue to use this company as will_continue to recommend them
positive	i purchased myself a garmin product from this site and found the website and service from the staff really helpful .
positive	i wasn ' t sure at first which one i wanted but the site provided me with all the information i required as well as many images of the products to help me with my decision .

positive	hostelbookers . com has very easy structure to search hostels .
positive	it was also great that they had " january sale " when i stayed in one of them , it was actually cheaper_than book directly to the hostel .

positive	i have had many deliveries from dpd and to be honest i wish every company was dpd style .

positive	i ordered some mats but when they arrived the clips didn ' t quite line up with the ones in the car .
positive	i emailed in and got a response the same day .
positive	they did some checks and admitted to making an error .
positive	new mats were sent out straight_away and they let us keep the old ones too so we could use them for our camping_trip that weekend as intended .
positive	very pleasant to deal with , the mats are great quality and i was very pleased with the price .
positive	we got the luxury version with a red trim and they set the car off really nicely .
positive	would definately use again and recommend to a friend .
positive	from the 0st call to last everything was correct and efficient .

positive	will_definitely be using again !
positive	it was easy to book with this site .
positive	i was able to compare prices and locations easily which was nice .
positive	we initially looked to book our rtw tickets through sta but got frustrated with their relentless add - on sta packages like bus tickets etc .
positive	spoke to adam slingsby at travel_nation and he was much more unbiased .
positive	not only this tn offered us a much_better price than sta inclusive of free date changes aswell .
positive	we booked our flights with adam who was very helpful as i had mistakenly mis_- spelt my name but he managed to change it without me incurring charges .
positive	throughout the trip they responded to our emails straightaway and also did change the flights as they promised .
positive	like i said rtw travel is so hard to organise and i ' d definitely_recommend tn to help you plan it all out .
positive	the free date change is a really good perk - you don ' t know until you get somewhere how long you are going to need so we used it a couple of times .
positive	thanks tn
positive	josh and nina
positive	would recommend e0p to everyone , great value clothes and shoes , never disappointed .
positive	also , customer_service excellent , recently my parcel was ' returned to sender ' and e0p reshipped to me at no additional_cost .

positive	i have used glasses_direct twice now , purchasing a total of 0 pairs of glasses , and cannot rate them highly_enough .
positive	the free home_trials are brilliant and have totally taken away the pressure of buying frames in the opticians and not beng sure if the glasses you have chosen even suit you !!
positive	with the home_trial i can ask work colleagues and friends opinions before commiting .
positive	prices are amazing , so i can now change my style of glasses depending upon what i am wearing .

positive	i would definitely be happy to recommend kikatek , they usually have competitive_prices and i ' ve used them a few_times over the years with no issues now .
positive	will almost certainly use go0arena again .
positive	would not hesitate to recommend .
positive	received email within_seconds and game activated with no_problems .

positive	!
positive	i don ' t know really where to start with this review , because i have so many good things to say about tsohost .
positive	tsohost ' s customer support are truely 00 / 0 .
positive	i ' ve sent tickets at 0am , and gotten replies back 0 minutes later .
positive	every_single ticket i ' ve sent , has been resolved extremely quickly , by someone very knowledgable and polite .
positive	even when i had some stupid questions , they still happily helped answer them .
positive	the one time i ' ve called phone support too was a good experience - my call was instantly picked_up by someone extremely polite and helpful .
positive	tsohost ' s customer_service is nothing short of amazing and is the best customer_service experience i ' ve had from any company , ever .
positive	i ' m only on their shared hosting_package , but the quality of their hosting in my experience cannot be beat .
positive	they ' re not the cheapest hosting company out there , but it ' s premium hosting for a budget price .
positive	i honestly don ' t think you can get better value for your money elsewhere .
positive	no_hidden_fees either , which makes tsohost one of the few companies in the industry that ' s honest about the cost .
positive	never had any downtime , neither has a friend who has a separate tsohost account .
positive	the amount of features i get , even just for £ 0 a month , frequently surprise me .
positive	totally love tsohost .
positive	it ' s one of the few companies out there that absolutely do everything right .
positive	i ' ve been stung a number of times from terrible hosting_companies , so it ' s great that i ' m now with one i can trust .
positive	i ' ve been a netflix customer ever since they launched in the uk .
positive	and don ' t get me wrong , netflix is fantastic in it ' s own right .
positive	but when it comes to anything released in the last 0 years though , their catalogue is very bare .
positive	they ' re also missing many cult , classic and acclaimed films and tv_shows .
positive	blinkbox , on the other hand , has tons of acclaimed films and shows .
positive	the majority of them avaliable to rent too .
positive	they even occasionally have hollywood films before they ' re on dvd .
positive	i ' ve only used blinkbox on my pc , so i can ' t speak for their smarttv or ipad versions , but the pc version has always worked great for me .
positive	great picture quality and sound , even with their standard definition stuff .
positive	i used their customer_service once too , and my experience of that was fantastic .
positive	a promotion didn ' t apply on my account .
positive	i sent them a quick tweet at 00pm , and within a few minutes , they were tweeting back and sorted out the issue in my account .
positive	i highly_recommend blinkbox to anyone .
positive	it ' s a brilliant supplement alongside your netflix subscription .
positive	been a customer of green man gaming since 0000 .
positive	they ' ve been my go - to place for games for a long while now .
positive	one of the few internet game retailers with telephone support , which i remember being fantastic when i needed it a few_years_ago .
positive	one of the most competitive companies when it comes to price too , without any compromise on customer support .
positive	nothing but good words to say about green man gaming .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i ' ve been using ebuyer for just over a year , and just bought another item , so out of curiousity , thought i ' d google them .
positive	i was surprised to see such negative_reviews for them on this site .
positive	every_single time i ' ve used them , they couldn ' t have been better .
positive	i only had to call customer_services on one order , but they were fantastic .
positive	i wanted to change the motherboard in my order , set for next_day despatch .
positive	the customer_service person was extremely polite and contacted the warehouse to amend my order .
positive	couldn ' t ask for a better customer_service experience , especially_considering that it was my fault .
positive	customer_service are uk_based too , if that ' s a factor to you .
positive	i have a few friends who have used ebuyer for a number of years too , and i ' ve only heard good things about ebuyer from them too .
positive	from my experiences , i would happily_recommend them .
positive	a nice and easy to navigate around website and easy payment process .
positive	item arrived 0 days after ordering as a ' signed for ' item with royal_mail .
positive	the chocolates were well_packaged and none of the items were broken .
positive	will be using the chocolate trading company again .
positive	shopping with the whisky_exchange has been so easy , from finding what i wanted to going through the checkout_process and with delivery .
positive	the item delivered was very well_packaged and the whole_process has been totally effortless .
positive	i would buy from the whisky_exchange again and would recommend them to everybody and anybody .
positive	i couldn ' t ask for a more easier transaction .
positive	i order medication for my parents dog after being charged over the odds at the local vets , not only as the medication cheaper , the customer_service was faultless .
positive	perfect in every way .
positive	i will_definitely be shopping here again .
positive	booked hostels several_times in different_countries using hostelbookers . com and there were absolutely no_problems with reservation / stay .
positive	perfect - will_definitely use it next time
positive	having used previous providers for hosting and registering domains , i have found that good support is hard to come by until i found cloud next .
positive	every issue or query i have had with any of my domain_names has been addressed superbly .
positive	i asked every question i could think of to understand their system ( due to the poor service of previous suppliers ) and could not find one fault with this company .
positive	the price is very competitive compared to other major players in their field but the quality of customer_service is what puts them in pole position in the market .
positive	keep up the good work and will_continue to use for many years .
positive	good customer_service and fast delivery .
positive	good quality merchandise
positive	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on the free home_trial until i found the right pair .
positive	then i got another pair free and 00_%_off .

positive	as always , awesome service & very quick delivery .
positive	i always look at ocuk first when i ' m wanting new computer parts , as i know they have great customer_service & will have the item i ' m wanting at a good price .
positive	only slight niggle , is that occasionally they ' re a couple of £ more_than competitors on some items , but once the free postage is taken into account ( i ' m an active member on the forums , so i also get free delivery ) it works out cheaper anyway , so i ' m happy enough :)
positive	i have this app on my phone and its great .
positive	it ' s easy to use , it keeps a track of your orders so its easy to go back to see what you had last time .
positive	really big range of restaurants too .
positive	this website has loads of choice , postage was resonable , and my items wre quickly despatched , great communication !

positive	the online ordering_process was very easy , but to top it off they are willing to drop their prices in order to retain your business .

positive	i spent_ages searching for a very specific bag i wanted , and tactical - kit was the only uk supplier i came_across .
positive	originally it was out of stock on the website , so i enquired when it will be back in stock .
positive	i received a reply within half an_hour , and was notified that the staff had searched the warehouse and found a single one available for purchase .
positive	i made further enquiries about the product , and each reply i got was within a few minutes of each other .
positive	very pleased with the fast and very helpful feedback ( may i mention again that they searched the warehouse for it , instead of just giving me a " sorry no out of stock " like some other suppliers would ), i placed my order , and recieved it 0 days_later ( only chose basic delivery ).
positive	great customer_service !
positive	!
positive	apart_from ordering , the site is fast , very clean looking and easy to navigate , with brown fonts overlayed on a dark background , very easy on the eyes and keeping that tactical theme without going overboard , plus no crappy flash animations to chug the site down or crash your browser .
positive	everything is categorized with detailed_descriptions to ensure you know what you are getting .
positive	they sell a wide_variety of stuff , from clothing , hiking gear , bags , lasers and optical sights , eye wear , plus many many more !
positive	overall , very pleased with the fast communication and the fact they put some effort into checking whether the product was really out of stock .
positive	would highly_recommend it as your one stop_shop for tactical goods .
positive	on an extra note , like the reviewer below posted , stay clear from nightgear : dodgy folk they are , don ' t be_fooled by their flashy discounts and offers .
positive	i was looking for a decent mechanical pencil for drawing and came_across a particular brand i liked ( staedtler 000 00 to be exact ), so off to google it was , and cult_pens was the first answer to pop up .
positive	what striked me first was the presentation as everything is clean , very fast loading and extremely easy to navigate , you will have no problem whatsoever finding exactly_what you want within a few seconds as everything is organised into subsections , instead of being bunched up together like most other_sites do .
positive	there is plenty of information about their products , and in some_cases a drop down menu to specify different colours , lead sizes , quantity , etc .
positive	fantastic !
positive	also there is a " pencyclopedia ," a section devoted to everything about pens and pencils , all the fancy technical do - das and what pen is best for what purpose .
positive	the information i found was extremely useful and helped_me not only decide on my purchase , but reassure me these people are passionate_about pens and aren ' t in it soley for the money .
positive	oh and of course there is a massive_range of pens , pencils , rulers , rubbers , leads and stuff from many different companies and perhaps even a rare item or two .
positive	plus free uk delivery on orders over £_00 , how could one refuse !
positive	i didn ' t , and i recieved my mechanical pencil next_day , plus a free gift to boot .
positive	very happy about my experience with them .
positive	it ' s very rare i ' d buy from a site without reading a review about them first , but i made an exception with cult_pens within 00_minutes of browsing and wasn ' t dissapointed .
positive	clean easy to navigate site , massive_range of drawing utensils , the pencyclopedia explaining everything about pens and pencils , and the feeling that these people are here to help and not to clean out your wallet .
positive	only thing i think could be improved is have the pencyclopedia section easier to find for newcomers , perhaps listed clearly on the home page , apart_from that everything else is perfect .
positive	i ' ve brought from shopto . net a fair few_times , it was highly_recommended by a friend and i can see why .
positive	free p_& p and decent prices compared to retail shop prices , plus fast delivery and excellent customer_service .
positive	one time the postman nicked my game , and i emailed shopto . net for a replacement , and i got a reply within the hour and it was all dealt_with the very same day i emailed , which i thought was brilliant .
positive	just thought i ' d point that out as most companies take an aeon and a half to reply emails ( if at all ) so i do really apprecieate the support staff getting back to me quickly and professionally .
positive	thanks alot :_d
positive	i ' d highly_recommend shopto . net if you ' re doing your shopping online , they also do alot of deals from time to time , and they got a loyalty system ( which i have yet to venture into ).
positive	i booked with hostelbookers four times over the last month as i have a big trip coming up and its great , so easy to see reviews in everywhere from sydney , brisbane , thailand and london , really helps take the guesswork out of booking accomodation for travel and i can do it in work without anyone noticing :) will_definitely be booking any more accomodation i need with hostelbookers :)
positive	items arrived quickly kept in contact with me so i knew what was happening with my item which i think is great .
positive	i ' ve heard this company before but never gave it a chance , until i waslooking for a specific product and i came_across it on here .
positive	this company seriously beats all other_companies , even amazon !
positive	i saw that this website had the product i wanted for $ 0 more_than on amazon but amazon had very pricy shipping ... this company actually fixed their price to lower_than $ 0 .
positive	amazing !
positive	i am for sure going to stick to this website .
positive	it ' s by_far the best !
positive	i haven ' t had much experiences of buying online .
positive	however , through the advice of my friend , i ' ve found out that yeswalker . com is such a incredibly amazing online company .
positive	in stead of numerous items for customer to choose , they also provide surprised sale campaign such as " buy 0 get 0 free " which is very new for me .
positive	therefore , i feel much happier and curious about choosing the next item , rather_than only discount normally
positive	i definitely advise yeswalker . com to every_single friend of mine .
positive	love yeswalker already !!
positive	!
positive	brilliant system , always works well and it ' s easy to use .
positive	my only complaint is about some of the takeaways themselves , who give themselves good ratings .
positive	has nick from devon really been to the same restaurant 0 times in a week , given everything 0 out of 0 but left no comments ?!
positive	and he has only visited just after the restaurant has received an honest , negative_review .
positive	what a coincidence !
positive	shame there is no way to stop this .
positive	but justeat is brilliant and we have found some really great local restaurants that we wouldn ' t have known about otherwise :-)
positive	booked a last_minute budget stag_do through chillisauce , the website was easy to browse and look at various activities , and even easier to sort out who was coming and who had paid etc .
positive	the go - karting itself was brilliant fun on the day and everything was ready for our arrival .
positive	it was enjoyed by everyone even the cuts , grazes and bruises !
positive	thanks alot
positive	this was my first hostel stay ever , and i was almost disappointed by how nice this was ( because i was looking_forward to a bit of an ' experience ').
positive	the room was nicer_than most hotel rooms i ' ve been in , with the exception that we had two nice roommates from portugal .
positive	and i couldn ' t believe_how cheap it was .
positive	i ' d highly_recommend this place for a comfortable stay in prague , and the location was great !
positive	had a really great experience using wimdu and now use it as one of my go - to sites when booking accommodation .
positive	the apartment in amsterdam we chose was really lovely .
positive	there was plenty of information up front when we were booking and the ability to talk and ask questions directly with the hosts is really good .
positive	i ' ve ordered from bbw several_times now and the delivery always comes either the very next_day or the day after ( depending what time i order ) .
positive	even at christmas the delivery was really fast
positive	their customer_service is top as well .
positive	always replying to me via_email within a few hours , if not faster , and answering me on twitter in about 00_mins .
positive	good quality products at really good prices and they really know their stuff
positive	i just needed a shaker_cup and i ended_up getting like 00 samples and some products that are about to expire for like $ 0 .
positive	the shipping was about $_00 but it was well worth it .
positive	quick , cheap , excellent tracking , well_protected , brilliant
positive	we had requested a bespoke wedding_ring , a gold flat profile 00mm ring .
positive	pretty standard .
positive	we then wanted 0 star trek symbols added to the n , e , s and w points .
positive	at every_step of the way we had email_updates as to what was happening and quick response times to our emails asking for updates .
positive	all in all it took roughly 0 weeks from ordering to receiving the ring .
positive	it was posted as received when they said it would be .
positive	they are also very reasonable priced .
positive	all in all i would recommend this company to anyone that will listen !
positive	amazing !
positive	great service - i would recommend this company to anyone .
positive	my campaigns have had excellent results !
positive	i recently ordered a kimono from lovekimono for my girlfriend ’_s birthday , and she absolutely loved it .
positive	i wasn ’ t exactly sure which design to choose , so sent the guys at lovekimono an_email to see if they could help .
positive	they were more_than happy to help me with their latest designs , and i ended_up choosing the miley kimono in grey for her .
positive	the product came in next to no time at all , and it arrived beautifully_packaged ( which was good for me as i ’ m useless when it comes to wrapping presents !).
positive	needless to say , my girlfriend now won ’ t stop wearing it !
positive	i highly_recommend every_aspect of lovekimono – great customer_service , great product and great quality !
positive	ordered from digitalrev who have amazing prices , for the canon_000d they have a £_000 difference with most other_retailers i saw , with digitalrev selling it at £_000 and john_lewis , amazon , etc at £_000 .
positive	i was worried due to the cheap price and free shipping at first .
positive	but , i ordered it on monday lunchtime , and it arrived wednesday lunchtime !
positive	amazing !
positive	so reliable , keep up the good work digitalrev .
positive	ingenting å meddele alt var bare helt suverent / konge !
positive	rask levering , billig priser 00 / 00 !
positive	this was my first time using the valet parking and i would definitely use it again .

positive	i was a bit_hesitant at first to use cj ' s cd_keys , but now i ' m unsure why .
positive	i have bought four titles off here now , 0 for steam and 0 for origin , and they have worked flawlessley every time .

positive	bought a pc and a laptop from this company , and they are amazing .
positive	the build_quality is great and so is the delivery service .

positive	due to family commitments i could not pursue my studies further .
positive	i feel that the course has helped_me in restoring my self confidence .
positive	the best thing about distance_learning is that you can plan your studies accordingly especially for those people who have a full time job .
positive	it was such a great experience studying with e_- careers .
positive	mode of study is very easy , attempt exams when you are ready instead of stressing yourself .
positive	recently_purchased 0 coby kyros tablets for our children from kenable - very quick delivery which was great , and the customer_service ( particularly the after sales service ) was fantastic .
positive	finally a company who treats the customer like they ' re kings !
positive	well_done kenable - would not hesitate to recommend you .

positive	there ' s always a good offer on this website and a lot of the time stuff is cheaper_than elsewhere .
positive	and delivery time is also very good , and that ' s even with the basic free delivery .
positive	always a top choice to order games online
positive	i have been needing a new computer for a while , for gaming , and i was recommended to use this site .
positive	when selecting components , if something wasn ' t quite right a pop up would appear and recommend a different component which would be more suitable .
positive	pc_specialist would contact me an_email at each_stage of the order , whether for it having been built , in its testing phase and when it was ready to dispatch , which was also a lot quicker then i thought it would be , meaning i could get back to gaming faster the i thought !
positive	the handbook provided was also very useful with tips on how to install and set_up my new pc .

positive	members are given several options on ways to describe themselves including ' favourite music ' and ' ideal partner description ' so you are clear about your own personality !

positive	received them on 00th .
positive	the updates on tracking through dhl was great .
positive	definitely recommended .
positive	it ' s the 0rd out of 0 orders i placed with hostelbookers .
positive	i love them b / c i can pay wt my debit_card and it ' s always super_fast and easy .
positive	plus , i do manage to find great places to stay for cheap .
positive	i ' m a budget traveler and it ' s important to find a good and cheap double room in a hostel rather_than pay triple as much in a hotel .
positive	i have been a user of go cardless for the last few_months and it is quick and easy way to manage payments from all our customers .
positive	it is not only simple to set - up new customers but also has many tools at your disposable when you are looking to take payment which enables you to be very flexible with your cost structure .

positive	easy website , sharp service and speedy_delivery .
positive	i have been living in china for over 0 years now , and i have been a user of strongvpn for around one year , and i can tell you , it is by_far the best vpn service to use in china , i have long struggled with different vpn providers , and the service was most of the time not good , not only because of the server speed , but the problem is that in china with different vpn servers and different internet provider companies your experience with vpn can be very different , but when i finally signed_up to strongvpn and now i am happy with the service , their variety of servers and also packages gives you the chance to choose the best server that will best suit your needs and on top of that their 00 / 0 support makes it very easy for you to choose the best vpn server and the most suitable package for you .
positive	with strongvpn i am finally free to surf the internet in china .
positive	never had any_problems with three .
positive	the coverage is amazing and the contracts are great value !
positive	i ' m a dutch person working in the uk .
positive	i fly back and forth quite a few_times a year and always use klm instead of the budget_airlines .
positive	the prices are fair and the stewards are exceptionally friendly .
positive	i once had to book a very last_minute flight over the phone .
positive	they called me back a few minutes later for details meaning i didn ' t have to pay premium call rates .
positive	they never moan_about my luggage being a bit heavier than allowed .
positive	and the complimentary drink and snack is always very welcome ;)
positive	thumbs_up for this amazing airline !
positive	i started shopping with this company since they supplied ready made seed mixes for degus .
positive	my girls are on a special diet which the seeds are an important part of .
positive	my degus even think it ' s the best part ;) delivery was very quick , i expected it later in the week but received it on monday !
positive	i ' m a very happy prime customer .
positive	i order quite a lot of things online , as i work a lot and never have time to go to the shops .
positive	i ' ve never had any delays and get all my order the next_day ( often in the morning ).
positive	i ordered a video_game a couple of weeks_ago which i thought got lost in the post ( not amazon ' s fault ).
positive	customer_service was great and i got a refund without hassle , it was back on my account within 0 days .
positive	i eventually received the video_game ( after two_weeks , while it was next_day delivery ) so i returned it .
positive	it was really easy , printing out labels to put on the box and left it with collect +.
positive	i ' ve been using yodel on many different_addresses now and i have yet to find a bad delivery .
positive	they are always on time and the delivery men / women are always very friendly and patient .
positive	please consider giving this same service to all the other people which must ' ve had horrible experiences with you .
positive	great selection and best pricing anywhere .
positive	i never usually_write_reviews but felt_compelled to do so .
positive	after terrible customer_service from currys which_resulted_in me wasting a full day waiting in for a product which never arrived i decided to try ao .
positive	the whole_process was quick and simple from order to delivery .
positive	i was kept_informed of the status of the order and given a 0 week window for delivery however nearer the delivery time i received more precise information .
positive	the order was received about 00_minutes outside my window but this did not concern me as i was kept up to date and knew the driver was in the area .
positive	unfortunately the fridge /_freezer i order was slightly_damaged ( small dent in the side ) on arrival but i didn ’ t notice it until the following_morning .
positive	i called and was given the option of a next_day delivery or a discount without any query and gladly accepted a £_00 refund .
positive	in days where the high_street store is diminishing it ’_s no wonder when internet companies provide such good service .
positive	it ’_s sad but the fault has to lie somewhere ….. and i will be using ao in future even if curry ’_s has a better price !
positive	tried to book our holiday on the website which was fine until i could only add x0 bags on with our monarch flight , but i only needed one .
positive	called the freephone_number , got straight through to a lovely_lady who sorted it all out for us and amended the number of bags .
positive	whole_process took minutes and i felt_confident our holiday was booked without any_issues .
positive	confirmation came through on email as soon as i put the phone down as promised .
positive	fab customer_service , i will be going straight to low_cost when booking holidays from now on !
positive	thank_you :-)
positive	i would never use any other company to sell my mobile , the webisite is easy to use , they pay for return_postage and even send you the bag to post the phone in .
positive	that arrived in a day or so and i recieved the money directly in my bank 0 days after i sent the phone to them .
positive	they email you updates during the process so you know it has arrived with them safely and when they start testing the phone , and then when you ' ve been paid !
positive	great company :-)
positive	i highly_recommend if you are looking for a safe , fast and cheap transfer of your money !
positive	i ordered my prescription sports glasses from rxsports , mainly because they had the best prices for the model i wanted and also because i found their website easy to use .
positive	order was handled professionally and delivered within a week .
positive	this website gives you lots of great options for exactly_what you select in the search bars and the reviews are very useful !
positive	amazing prices and they beat the competitions pricing ?
positive	what more could you sk for ?
positive	such a great selection and i love the closeouts deals !
positive	thanks for helping me turn into the animal i strive to become !

positive	fab pizzas
positive	very understanding , kind and instructive !
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i am looking_forward in starting the course and get the " whole pic "
positive	no_problems with buying points or xbox memberships .
positive	it ' s cheaper_than through the console and your code is emailed within 0min .
positive	paypal is added buyer security too !
positive	i use hostelbookers to book_hostels while travelling around australia because their rates are cheaper_than any other booking site and also often cheaper_than even booking with the hostel directly .
positive	when a hostel is fully booked i can always rely_on hostel_bookers to still have a room left .
positive	the booking page is clear it tells you exactly_what you need to pay when you get there and also about cancellations , which as a backpacker is key information as plans always change !!
positive	this is the only site that does not charge booking_fees which on other_sites are normally 00_% and when you are booking multiple nights this can really add up !!
positive	every little helps :)
positive	i found it easy , quick and convenient to use tempcover and i had no_problems to speak of and the price was decent so overall i would reccomend .
positive	personally i had no_problems my product arrived prompt and i didnt have to contact customer_services
positive	product i wanted was 00 £ cheaper on here than what the vet wanted , free economy delivery , got my product , no_problems .
positive	would definitely use again and recommend .
positive	i have ordered from patrolstore twice and i will again as they always get the goods to you quickly and with no hassle .
positive	plus they stock lots of good stuff at good prices .
positive	not cheap knock - offs either !
positive	hi thanks for iphone_unlock .
positive	it ' s really good !
positive	!
positive	hello friend !
positive	what can i say ?
positive	i just bought some paper
positive	from ebuyer today !
positive	it was cheap , what i need ,
positive	and free , sent next_day !
positive	why go anywhere_else
positive	when ebuyer is so great !
positive	i was caring for my mum for years , with four children , and i needed a new washing_machine but had no_idea what would be best for me or my limited space .
positive	appliance direct helped_me with how to measure up , gave great advice and shipped me out a first_class machine for a fantastic price .
positive	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else for my white goods now .
positive	you just cannot go_wrong with them .
positive	my experence with pixmania was excellent .
positive	they had exactly_what i wanted and my order was delivered earlier_than_expected .
positive	supplementwarehouse . com has the greatest sales of any online supplement website .
positive	i just bought a product from them that was on sale to $ 0 . 00 , it was $_00 . 00 !
positive	all other_sites i looked at , their sale price was actually higher_than the normal price for this product on supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	it is very easy and also cheap .
positive	every backpackers must look this site .
positive	if you love your pocket you also love hostelbookers =))
positive	i love their wide_range of supplements but even more so love their low low_prices .
positive	it ' s unlikely you ' ll find a lower_price on any product , anywhere_else , and if you do they ' ll beat it .

positive	being an internet shopper for well over ten years i ' m always a bit_dubious_about buying from sites that don ' t have a massive reputation , but so glad i did !
positive	was in dire need of some more pampers sensitive baby wipes but i like to buy the 00 pack ( anything less seems a waste of time ).
positive	i googled it and ebitsi came back as the cheapest so i purchased them before google changed its mind !
positive	at a tenner with free delivery i wasn ' t going to complain - you can ' t even buy them that cheap at local_stores anymore !
positive	( with exceptions to asda but where i live we don ' t have one ).
positive	my order was actually through ebitsi from amazon and delivery was so quick , super impressed !
positive	!
positive	easy to talk to straight to the point and no funny business , they don ' t mess you around and try to get you the best deal possible
positive	very happy with purchase , great customer_service experiance and everything arrived as expected very well_packaged !
positive	thanks .
positive	apart_from the fact the cia is probably monitoring the whole website , it works really well !
positive	it really is so easy to book through these_guys .
positive	they don ' t charge any commision ( not sure how they make their money ) but its truly simple to do , and i think it ' s only 00_% u have to pay and then u can cancel within 00_hours or something like that .
positive	don ' t know the specifics but for places like south_east asia where it ' s only $ 0 for a private_room you can ' t go_wrong .
positive	i have used this website many_times before , and have always found good places with it .
positive	i like the rating_system and the ability to order by price and rating .
positive	there doesn ' t appear to be many listings in laos , but that might have to do with the fact there are pretty_much only private_rooms and twin_rooms here .
positive	my order from ccl was fast , cheap and hassle_free .
positive	well worth ordering with ccl .
positive	ordered a north_face gillet and it came ahead of schedule on the free delivery service and was in perfect_condition .

positive	just_eat is an innovative concept that helps take_aways work better and to keep the customer satisfied , never has a take away been judge only by word of mouth , with just_eat you can look at reviews of other customers and decide yourself if its worth paying for .
positive	issues can be sorted very easily by contacting the just_eat team , by ordering takeaways online it solves the issue of repeating your order or address 0 times due to the lack of understanding from the take away , have no money handy , problem solved by using your debit_card .
positive	just_eat has changed the away the british order take_aways , no stocking up on menu ' s , there all located in one handy site , the only recommendation i could give is just_eat needs to show the takeaways food hygiene score , other than that just_eat do an amazing job , they are trust_worthy , honest and outstanding , pure brilliance and idiot_proof .
positive	mazuma is very fast dealing_with your order , it takes about 0 days for your pack to arrive then once its sent off next_day recorded , your money is in your account the same day it arrives if you use bank_transfer , no_problems and ive used them 0 times , ive used other_sites in the past and none have been this good , i would use mazuma again and again .
positive	le site rassemble les offres d ’ emplois des grands sites d ’ emploi habituels , ce qui évite de devoir visiter les différents sites les uns après les autres ( pour , en fin de compte , souvent tomber sur les mêmes offres ).
positive	très utile donc .
positive	aktuell bin ich auf arbeitssuche und habe verschiedene suchmaschinen ausprobiert , um die passende zu finden .
positive	adzuna schist etwas neuer zu sein , aber das ist in diesem fall eher positiv - die seite wirkt frischer und dynamischer , und das design ist sehr sauber ohne viel werbung gehalten , was mir sehr gut gefällt .
positive	adzuna makes it extremely easy to find just the right job offer .
positive	it works like a search_engine and collects hundreds of relevant results so there is no more need to visit multiple job boards - it ' s all in one place !

positive	about 0 days after i ordered it on a 0 day delivery option .
positive	very happy .
positive	this is one of my favourite websites to shop at , particularly for video_games , but it ' s nice to see that they have branched out recently with music / films .
positive	they are almost always one of the cheapest suppliers i come_across , and my recent pre_- order of the wiiu premium pack couldn ' t have gone smoother - they kept me updated with the process constantly , and i received it before the release_date !
positive	never mind the fact that it was the cheapest and , despite this , gave me more reward_points than was being offered by game , for example , even_though it cost more at game !!
positive	love this site , i think they are brilliant :)
positive	get paid for buying !
positive	amazing , easy to use , quick payout by most merchants esp .

positive	:-)
positive	excellent customer_service query answered by samantha in super_quick time .
positive	would def use this service again
positive	i literally spent hours looking around town for some blender bottles just so i wouldn ' t have to wait for them in the mail .
positive	that was a complete bust because i didn ' t feel_like paying $ 0 per bottle .
positive	so i went back to sw like i always do and ordered five of them for less_than $_00 .
positive	i ended_up buying a whole bunch of other stuff just because of the great deals going on .
positive	it ' s a little ridiculous how awesome sw is because i got away with so much for only $_00 and 00 cent shipping ....
positive	never_heard of ebookers before and was going to book for my holiday , me and husband could only think of lastminute . com , expedia and opodo .
positive	since i am a natwest credit_card_holder , i checked out their partners and found out ebookers is one of their partners , which means if i booked my flight with ebookers , i would have got my saving points from my bank .
positive	this is how i knew about ebookers for the first time .
positive	from browsing the holiday such as flight and hotel information on ebookers website to choosing the dates and confirming the booking , everything was very easy and smooth and i was very happy with the website .
positive	however , i made a tiny mistake when i made the booking so i had to call their customer_service up and i found out that their office is actually based in philippines .
positive	spoke to two customer_service staff and they were very friendly , helpful and professional , i am very pleased to see their high_quality of customer_service .
positive	overall , i am very happy with their service so far from booking my tickets online to their customer_service on phone .
positive	i shall be happy to book for my tickets and holiday again with ebookers in the future and would also recommend ebookers to my family , friends and colleagues who has not heard of ebookers before .

positive	couldn ' t ask for more .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	we have been online for 00 years now and we ' ve been through a few ecommerce systems over the years .
positive	i ' d say our experience should make anyone reading this take notice - we know what is important in an ecommerce platform and we know a good system when we see one .
positive	visual soft have been excellent from start to finish .
positive	during our initial consultations they gave us good advice on design and implementation of the website .
positive	they genuinely know what makes a good ecommerce business - we got the impression right from the start that they are not simply there to build websites , they are there to help businesses succeed .
positive	in terms of the system itself , we have never seen anything built so well .
positive	all of those little niggles that we had with our last platform that we wanted developing but never got round to - they are all there already in the visualsoft platform - amazon integration , ebay integration , royal_mail integration , email marketing , search_engine optmisation , social network integration - the list_goes on .
positive	overall its 00 out of 00 for visual soft .
positive	outstanding support - excellent website design - fantastic system - perfect .
positive	we delighted to have them as a partner .

positive	would recommend .
positive	another great experience .
positive	happy customer !
positive	this is the real deal .
positive	i needed to unlock my phone because i will be in italy for a few_months and officialphoneunlock fixed me up over night .

positive	but that was no problem considering i was not attempting to commit a fraud .
positive	lol

positive	i love supplementwarehouse . com and have been using them for almost a year now .
positive	they are a great company with many brands i enjoy .
positive	they do well with price_matching and are great competitors for internet supplement stores .
positive	i love the merchandise and the service and have never had a problem with them in that arena .
positive	however , i do not love the shipping charges .
positive	they seem to be overpriced especially since they recently had a deal where they had a baseline shipping fee of $ 0 . 00 .
positive	bring back the flat_rate fee and you guys would be the top supplement chain online .
positive	despite the hate for shipping fees i recommend this company to any and all of my friends .
positive	they are great !
positive	sent the phone away late but still received the money the next_day !
positive	highly_recommend :)

positive	until seeing all these reviews i have never_heard of a problem with them , i have bought tonnes of things off groupon and very please with what i have , i can understand some issues due to the different companies that advertise through groupon , guess that ' s just bad luck !.
positive	i recently ordered x0 pairs of earrings with swarovski elements , only one arrived , so i emailed groupon and they were very helpful , my second pair have come today .

positive	i must_say that the first 0 days were hell !

positive	i have lost half a stone in 0 days !

positive	after my son purchased a new yaris from pinkstones toyota stoke i felt_compelled to write a review !
positive	!
positive	it ' s that time of year to buy cars with the plate change , new models and good weather coming up ..
positive	so i treated myself to a lexs , then last weekend i went out to help my son buy his too .
positive	he was interested in checking out toyota so as we ' re local we booked an_appointment .
positive	we weren ' t sure what to do as we had booked an_appointment without really being 000_% on what car to get .
positive	after looking around ( a lot !)
positive	my son eventually settled with the new yaris .
positive	the salesman was very patient , helpful and friendly , which of course always helps .
positive	the new yaris also made quite an impression - it had a better quality interior than we had expected and the gadgets it offers as standard sold the deal !
positive	my son went for a dark green colour as he felt the red was a bit too ' girly ' for him ( lol )!
positive	i do have to agree the dark green does look good though especially with a slight tint of the windows .
positive	while the new yaris is a fantastic car ( surprising just how much car you get for your money these days ) what i ' m really raving about is the service .
positive	i think top customer_service is one of the most_important things these days and i really_appreciate it when i get it .
positive	everybody we met , from the girl on the phone initially through to our salesman jo treated us exceptionally well .
positive	the 0 % offer on the new yaris was also a great deal , so my son has gone for it and bought the car !
positive	so thanks to all the staff for making the process thoroughly enjoyable .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i ' d never considered lexus before and i ' ve previously always been drawn in by audi and bmw , but i saw the lexus stand in telford with the ct f sport on display and had a quick chat to the sales_rep .
positive	the looks were sharp and sporty so it had plenty of appeal !
positive	the zero road tax also made this car very appealing to me !
positive	after seeing the car i just had to book my test_drive to find out what it was like .
positive	lexus stoke was quite close so i went to them .
positive	i had high expectations ; i like to buy the very best and change my car every couple of years .
positive	the ct 000h f sport surpassed my expectations altogether - considering it ' s top fuel economy , it had a very surprising high performance drive too !
positive	i love high end gadgets and the f sport comes with plenty of gadgets as standard , so this was good too .
positive	needless to say , i ' ve ordered my new car .
positive	the whole_process has been fantastic from beginning to end and the staff have been very helpful / hospitable .
positive	i ' m looking_forward to the delivery of my new ct !

positive	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
positive	top draw .
positive	if it wasnt for amigos i would be in a mess so thank_you

positive	the music was great for dancing the night away with the girls !

positive	fantastic service , would definitely shop with them again and will recommend the website to friends and family :-)
positive	had an issue with the website ( my own incompetence !)
positive	and my sos email was quickly responded to and staff were incredibly_helpful .
positive	the delivery came very quickly and was extremely happy with the product when i received it .
positive	highly_recommend the website and will_definitely use again as their price for this specific item was certainly a lot lower_than anywhere_else .
positive	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
positive	would use again and highly_recommend
positive	my order arrived on the estimated day !
positive	at a good price too !
positive	will_definitely be shopping at g0m again !

positive	been using vistaprint for some years now and the quality and pricing has been getting worse , have looked for several providers of leaflets locally , i found printing . com liverpool as i was walking about and popped in to enquire .
positive	md peter was very helpful and only to keen to offer his advise which was very helpful indeed , quotations were swift and correct as discussed over the phone and in some_cases quotes were turned around within 00_minutes .
positive	order process was swift indeed and the designers were very quick to understand the needs for my business after an initial chat to understand what we needed .
positive	all proofs were send by email very quickly and once approved the end_result and quality of the product was excellent .

positive	i was a little_dubious after i had purchased the glasses as it was coming from_hong_kong , i wondered if it would take weeks for them to arrive and whether they would look as good as they did on the website .
positive	i have to say i very rarely write_reviews but thought i would this time as i was really happy with the goods and the service received .
positive	i received a text off dhl the day after i had ordered them telling_me they were on their way and a link so i could monitor them , however 0 days_later they arrived !
positive	thats quicker_than amazon !

positive	i also received update emails upon completion of each of the steps as well as one to inform me of the allocated slot .
positive	all in all this was a very pleasant , informative , and event free transaction , one that id be more_than happy to repeat .
positive	the website in general is very helpful , and has the most useful feature of any hostel website i ' ve used .
positive	the tags at the side detailing facilities is perfect to glance over at , and the layout is informative and logical , if a little cramped .
positive	making the actual booking was extremely quick , and i didn ' t have to go through 00 different pages worth of forms , just a pop - up box where i put in the payment basics and then done !
positive	booked !
positive	confirmation page pops up and email is sent out .
positive	just in terms of constructive criticism , the website itself is sized quite small , leaving a huge_amount of white space on the right hand size of the screen ( on all pcs i ' ve visited it on ), and also it would be helpful if the actual hostel ' s contact details were clearly on display on their respective pages .
positive	overall easy and efficient experience , would recommend .
positive	chris is a brilliant bloke , told him what was wrong with my console and he knew_exactly_what needed to be done .

positive	keep up the good work chris and thanks for help .

positive	), and great looking website .
positive	the site has a great range of contemporary products that also looks stylish as well as functional , it was hard to choose .

positive	i had breast enlargement june_0000 ... had done a lot of research and came_across nu cosmetics .
positive	i had been for consultations before with other_companies and what i liked about nu was that you have a consultation with the actual surgeon , rather_than a sales_rep .
positive	i was sooo happy with my surgeon , davood falladah , he advised me the best size and shape implant and gave me all the info i needed .. so i decided to book with them .
positive	on the day of surgery the staff were all soo friendly .. i didn ' t feel nervous at all !.. and after surgery again the staff were very helpful with arranging a taxi to a hotel .
positive	my surgery was in london so they advised me not to travel home as i lived too far .
positive	i am 00 months post op and really glad i chose this company .. the scars are hardly visible and i would definitely use them for further procedures !

positive	the only_criticism i have of hostel_bookers is the name - because it isn ' t just a site for hostels !
positive	sure , i have booked some excellent hostels using the simple , quick and no - fees booking system , but i ' ve also used it to book top - end hotels and apartments .
positive	the reviewing system i ' ve found to be very reliable , and the website seems to find cheap prices which other comparison_sites don ' t pull up .

positive	here you get loyalty_points , where you can then buy top of the range stuff in the bright store !
positive	plus the welcome_bonus at 000_%, really does give you value for your money !
positive	i would definitely recommended it to everyone !
positive	bingocams is probably the best bingo site i ' ve come_across .
positive	you get a £ 0 without putting in any card_details in , and the chat_hosts are amazing and fun !
positive	there no site like bingocams !
positive	i ' ve ordered a fair few things from ebuyer and never had any_problems .
positive	the site is easy to use and prices seem good .
positive	after a mildly frightening conversation with a friendly carpenter regarding the potential cost of solid_oak worktops , i found worktop_express online .
positive	i was very pleased with their prices , and it turns_out their worktops are very nice .
positive	i was a bit_sceptical after_reading several reviews online about these cash for phones companys , and although mazuma didnt offer the best price (£ 00 - mazuma , the highest being £_000 ), they had the best reviews .
positive	people were claiming to have been ripped_off by the companys offering more money saying they had recieved damaged phones , and giving out a fraction of the advertised price .
positive	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
positive	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
positive	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
positive	we ended_up using the best reviewed / cheapest surveyor from the list given to us from comparemymove and we are really happy with the result .
positive	i ordered the new iwc pilots watch from iconic_watches two_weeks_ago and it arrived today as promised .

positive	the next watch i buy will 000_% be from iconic_watches .
positive	well its a very awsome thing you guys got going on here , pay two pounds and get a random key i like it alot , its a shame i already got a key that i own !

positive	what ' s not to love !
positive	cjs_cd_keys is a great service that i cannot and i mean cannot recommend highly_enough i have been using the service for around a year now .

positive	really friendly guy who showed me all the safety checks when he had finished .
positive	i would definitely_recommend them .
positive	too quality firm .
positive	love that questions are answered_quickly whether you call or email .
positive	the staff know what they ' re talking_about as well , which is always helpful .
positive	good prices , not the cheapest , most stuff can be found cheaper on ebay or amazon but comes without the customer_services .
positive	fast delivery & product exactly as_described - thanks !
positive	i took the plunge and after looking for weeks i found them on google i decided to order two ralph lauren long sleeve polo_shirts and was amazed with the quickness of delivery and could not believe the fantastic quality of the stuff they had the supplier numbers in the washing label ( i expected not the best quality probably returns or something because of the price ).
positive	anyway to cut the long_story short i was that pleased i just ordered another four items on the same day .
positive	i tried to buy a key from another site on - line but they wanted photo identity

positive	your site is amazing i will be back
positive	this is one of the best digital software sites around .

positive	this was my first time selling a mobile phone over the internet so i was a little_nervous .
positive	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .
positive	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it ' s not in perfect_condition - who ' s phone is by the end of a contract period !

positive	booked online , was the cheapest to use and was right next to gatwick south terminal .
positive	bus left almost as soon as i parked and there were others waiting behind it and on return i only had to wait for 0 minutes at the terminal for it .
positive	at the gate my ticket was recognized nad was quickly on my way .
positive	will_definitely use again in the future !
positive	you read about online scams and stuff all the time , but i decided to give simplycdkeys a chance anyway , and the service was fantastic .
positive	i paid , recieved the email and got my cd_keys up and running within 0 minutes of ordering .
positive	my only bad point about this site is how they limit you to two purchases per 00_hours .
positive	i can see how it would be bad business sense to allow unlimited purchases which might allow hoarding of games to tout off at a higher price when in demand .
positive	however , the ability to purchase 0 or more per 00_hours would have been ideal .
positive	( limit same - title purchases to 0 or 0 or something , as i had to go to a different site to get the final expansion that i wanted ).
positive	otherwise fantastic .
positive	the overall online reviews speak for themselves in this case .
positive	huge_selection and some of the best prices ive_seen , easy to navigate and free_swag is always a plus .
positive	bought the game and within 0 minutes it had been delivered .
positive	i will_definitely be using these_guys again
positive	really the only place i go anymore .
positive	good prices , match a competitors and free_stuff .
positive	not much else to say but try it yourself .
positive	as above ordered on the monday_morning and had the game by tuesday tea time ( i just used the royal_mail free service ) hitman for 00 pounds bargain as its 00 everywhere_else .
positive	will use again
positive	easy , no booking_fee , fast , and friendly - that ' s why i use hostelbookers for already more_than 0 years from now .
positive	this is by_far the best experience i have had from a courier when rebooking collection .
positive	thank_you parcel to go and especially sammie_taylor
positive	i used to go to different online stores for all different things depending_on what i was doing and which had their own specified store brands .
positive	i quickly learned that even for name brands , supplementwarehouse will outcompete other_websites ' off brands in price .
positive	it makes it easier and more trusted this way and i wouldn ' t go with another company !
positive	best price i could find anywhere and fast free delivery !!
positive	couldn ' t ask for anymore .
positive	top_notch place to buy always pleased with the speed of my orders would recommend you to try it today
positive	fast delivery , easy website , good selection , great prices .
positive	what more could you want ?
positive	the site is well_laid_out and includes a variety options when choosing a place to stay .
positive	their information was up - to - date and detailed .
positive	good ill bay again
positive	my friend turned me on to this company .
positive	it takes you soo long to find a supplement that delivers what your looking for , taste , cost , etc and then you go back to your local nutrition store and they don ' t have it .
positive	supplement_warehouse always has what i want in stock , and their prices are always lower_than gnc , my gym , vitamin_world , etc .
positive	also the free shakers and sample give aways are awesome !
positive	i have used bondara for ages as they are the best .
positive	i have always received my orders on time or early and find their service excellent .
positive	they offer so much variety
positive	was really happy with the service from prezzybox .
positive	i order several items all for gifts to other people and felt the ease of their website was good , the options for delivery were good , the actual arrival time for delivery was exceeded ( always happy with that !)
positive	and the products themselves were perfect & of good quality .
positive	study material that has been provided is good .
positive	it excellent course material , gives an idea of topic and then research can easily be carried on .
positive	tutor support is excellent , up till now whenever i contact my tutor i am replied in a very short time with help that i need .
positive	i am interested in the field of teaching , therefore i am doing this course .
positive	i later plan to do teacher qualification too .
positive	yes i would recommend open study college to a friend as its a good and easy way to study from home and instant guidance is provided when ever needed .
positive	their prices along with the price_match guarantee is second to none !
positive	!
positive	i have been ordering from these_guys for about 0 years now and i cant really say much else but they are very good .
positive	they beat any other competitors price on the spot and the shipping is unbeatable .
positive	thanks .
positive	a friend of mine referred this site to me and im so happy he did !
positive	its got such a huge_selection in products !
positive	theyve got products available on their site that i have literally been trying to find for months !
positive	and theyve got such amazing deals .

positive	never shopping anywhere_else !
positive	!
positive	a really helpful company who deliver well_packaged , timely , quality products .
positive	simple and easy , no_fuss , no stress ....
positive	just a few_clicks and i was done and my accommodation was booked !
positive	great booking experience !
positive	used them last_year .
positive	so good and simple i had to use them again !
positive	i would recommend this sight to anybody wanting top selling games at low_prices .
positive	i saved alot of money buying football_manager 00 from here and the keys are delivered within_seconds and i mean seconds .
positive	amazing service and where amazing when i wanted to donate spare keys to them .
positive	amazing service , amazing company , amazing prices .
positive	00 / 00 would by from here again .
positive	nothing to say , really .
positive	i have always bought my supplements from dolphin_fitness , before when i used to buy maximuscle products , now that i have switched to reflex products and even in recommended to a friend that was looking for bsn syntha - 0 ; on all cases they are the cheapest on the net .
positive	would like to see them stock schiek training accessories , but that bears no reflection the speedy and satisfactory service .
positive	great price and fast delivery
positive	great free service and lots of paid help if needed .
positive	will_definitely use again .
positive	i wasn ' t sure to by the imei_unlock ... but after thinking a bit about it , i decided to take a shot in the dark .
positive	i bought an iphone 0 locked by at & t for 0 usd in miami ( using my uncle ' s contract ) and i gave it to my girlfriend .
positive	didn ' t trust the jailbreak , so i tried this .
positive	it all worked out as the site said .
positive	in less_than 00 hs .
positive	i got the confirmation_email , and the phone is now working for claro ( argentina ).
positive	thank_you !
positive	found website really easy to use , postal bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs ... deffo_use again !
positive	the whole_process of choosing glasses and ordering them went quite smoothly .
positive	there are detailed info on the website making the choice quite easy .
positive	i am quite happy with the glasses as they are what i expected .
positive	i highly_recommend ozeal as they have excellent service and great price .
positive	just compare it with the high_street prices .
positive	i won ' t have any hesitations using them again .
positive	hello im playing fifa_00 world_cup and i been buying fifa points to unlock players but is expensive .... i have bit concern about where to buy try to aboid an scam ..... but finally i choose mooga by recommendation and is great ... i bought 000000k and i got it in 0 minutes .... highly_recommend it guys and going to buy more i finished my coins already hahha .
positive	there ' s a great service called flubit which gets better deals on products , which are already at competitive_prices .
positive	what ' s more you are not committed to buying once they have quoted a price so it essentially works as an exclusive deal service for the exact products you want .
positive	as well as the competitive_prices the quality of the produce is always better_than the supermarket .
positive	the selection of products are fantastic and all for a great price .
positive	the only thing i would change is to put montgomery cherry extract on the list of products .
positive	the delivery is always quick and free which is always good .
positive	i ordered my no explode on 0nd january and it got to my door at 00 ; 00 today .
positive	i will be ordering from this company again and would recommend the to anyone .
positive	excellent service .. super_fast delivery .. will use again .. thanks
positive	good communication from the start i was nervous providing i . d to a company had never dealt_with before but was reassured the reasons_why .
positive	good delivery arrived speedy after payment , box had a little hole in it but considering the weather_conditions was okay with this .
positive	the second game was available on download at xbox_live which i didnt know
positive	another pointer for coolshop - i wasnt aware that the plug would be foreign three point , therefore needed an adapter to use in the uk luckily i checked the product before wrapping
positive	would use the website again
positive	excellent staff all very pleasant , welcoming and knowledgeable but not boring !
positive	!
positive	we got on near our hotel at victoria took red route , live commentary fantastic we enjoyed that much stayed on all the way around then went round again to get off and see sights !
positive	!
positive	brilliant value and funny commentary not too in depth to loose interest .
positive	great to see london at a different angle , then in contrast to take the river thames tour and see the sights from below , it was fab !
positive	!
positive	my 0year old didnt want to go on a bus tour after an experience abroad last_year where we were listening to all different languages and very boring tour , half way round i asked if he wanted to get off ' no way ', so i guess that sums it up .
positive	good idea that different nationalities can plug in earphones to listen to the tour in their language .
positive	great photo opportunity , bet some londoners havent seen all the sights we saw in a matter of 0hours !
positive	!
positive	the stops are very easy to see and i asked the staff about the latest i could travel back to reach my destination all helpful , plus can book other trips with the staff , got my london eye tickets from them .
positive	brill !!
positive	( 00year old female and 0year old boy )
positive	hi after purchasing from savewatersavemoney i found it nice and smooth to use and the mobile site has been designed well too it was easy to show my girlfriend future_purchases whilst out and about and we now have a good selection for our new property in the summer
positive	excellent fast service from_hong_kong , wow perfect time for christmas will shop with again
positive	title explains it all , i ' m really happy with the fast service and good offers they have :)
positive	great service and quick payment , emails to keep me updated and free delivery print off slip to send phone .
positive	perfect
positive	one of the best for me to buy anything u want .
positive	i giving 0_stars
positive	website easy to use
positive	ordered headphones one day got the next and as an added_bonus , they stuck in a lolli - pop :)
positive	will be using them again
positive	i have to be honest , the only reason i chose this company in the first place was because they offered me the most money for my laptop .
positive	which i thought was pretty good anyway .
positive	but not only was the offer the highest , collection was on a day that i chose and they courier they use texts you to give you a time when they will be with you .
positive	they collected my laptop on a friday and i had a call on the monday to tell me that they had received my laptop and would like to pay me the amount that they had quoted .
positive	they paid me via bank_transfer as i had requested and the money was in my account immediately .
positive	i would definately use this company again and would recommend it to anyone who was thinking of selling their laptop !
positive	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (£ 00 for £_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
positive	going back to the website , finding those sunglasses was super easy and they had everything i saw in the shop .
positive	the order process was very straightforward and delivery extremely speedy , with safe packaging .
positive	i would highly_recommend this shop for anybody who prefers to ' look offline , buy online '.
positive	never any_issues fantastic service
positive	i ' m a regular customer at red_hot sunglasses and they have never once let me down .
positive	in comparison to competitors their range is 0nd to none , the pricing is always the most competitive and most_importantly the service is spot on .
positive	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
positive	highly_recommend .
positive	jeg_har handlet på asos utallige gange og_jeg_har altid været yderst tilfreds .
positive	produkterne lever op_til forventningerne ud fra billederne og hjemmesiden er_meget overskuelig og med_en_god søgefunktion .
positive	de_har et stort udvalg af gode , kendte mærker til meget lave priser ( det billigste jeg_har set indtil nu !).
positive	ordren blev afsendt dagen_efter bestilling og_jeg modtog pakken 0 hverdage efter ( de lover levering på 0 - 00 hverdage ) - i forsvarligt emballage .
positive	portoen udregnes efter størrelse og vægt , jeg betalte ca .
positive	00 kr .
positive	for 0 mellemstore produkter - meget rimeligt !
positive	produktoversigten er efter min mening ikke så god .
positive	men tjek det ud - det_er besparelsen værd at bruge lidt ekstra tid på at finde det man leder efter !
positive	both_times i have had problems with logging_into my online course , the customer_service team have been instantly available for online_chat .
positive	they guided me through the steps needed to resolve the problem and ensured that it was resolved .
positive	i tried envirofone first who offered me less_than 00_% of what mazuma did and took 00x longer in doing so .
positive	really good service , phone received within 0 days , cheque received within 0 working_days .
positive	good all_round !
positive	flies from heathrow , no charge for checked in luggage , free snack on the plane , but still budget price .
positive	obviously it lacks shops , and a phone line , but these are two of the things that i have hated about previous network_providers .
positive	i have only made one query and it was dealt_with very adequately .
positive	fantastically cheap .
positive	for someone such as myself who is in no way a it person at all , i am always apprehensive using computer repair places , feeling like they see me coming and rip me off .
positive	so i took a chance with the service team .
positive	it has paid off , i liked the personalised service you get right from the first phone call .
positive	then when the engineer came to my house to diagnose the issue he moved appointments around in the day so he could get to my house earlier as i had night shift that night .
positive	i was very appreciative of that .
positive	he was friendly and i felt_comfortable inviting him into my home .
positive	also the best part is you see them doing the work then and there so you know what the labour cost is going to be .
positive	absolutely recommend them .
positive	a must use company .
positive	not only do they have a large_amount of quality items but the way that they communicate with customers is brilliant , like they really care which is very rare now a days .
positive	i will_definitely purchase from them again and i advise you to as well .
positive	i am not a heavy lifter , but i do often frequent the gym and stay in good shape with a combination of proper supplementing and diet .
positive	what i really like to do is shop online ....
positive	which works out really well for my boyfriend ( who is heavy into lifting ) when it comes time to place our giant , combined supplement order .
positive	we always order together but he only asks two questions ; ' what did you get ?'
positive	and ' how much was the total ?'
positive	i guarantee that since i started placing the whole order with supplementwarehouse . com , he has been surprised by my response to that second question on each occasion , after hearing everything we were able to order for that amount ...
positive	hands_down unbeatable_prices .
positive	yes , there is a shipping cost , but its simple to justify having to pay for shipping when i know that it doesn ' t compare to what i ' d be paying elsewhere to get my supplements .
positive	i don ' t need to ' ask ' for special pricing , i know i am getting the best deals !
positive	additionally , i continue to order from supplementwarehouse . com because of their always up - to - date selection of products and fast_shipping .
positive	a one - stop_shop for everything you need to ensure you are fueling your body with all the right things , whether you ' re male or female , working on gaining muscle or just like to stay in shape .
positive	based on their prices , efficiency , and selection , i always choose supplementwarehouse . com as my go - to stop for supplements and i would highly_recommend their products and service to anyone .
positive	as well as the obvious convenience of them coming to you , the price was competitive with other prices i ' d had for garages nearby .
positive	good customer_service too , they call you to confirm your booking if you book online , then they call half an_hour before they turn_up which is really useful .
positive	friendly representative attended , was all super easy .
positive	supplement_warehouse has the lowest_prices any where on the internet .
positive	the items i purchased can not be bought in stores and the original manufacturer tends to overcharge , and have little sense of expediency .
positive	s . w .
positive	allows you to track your shipment and even cancel or amend a current order ; assuming it hasn ' t been shipped already .
positive	it ' s not simply a percentage off the full price but nearly half the cost .
positive	even after shipping_costs , which are also lower .
positive	this company has achieved the rare status of being an online store with the advantage of group purchase but with small business ideals like customer_service , and sense of fair transaction for both_parties .
positive	i just wish the secret wasn ' t out so that i could continue to purchase these 0rd_party , first tier , products at basement prices .
positive	i only assume deals this good don ' t stay under the proverbial carpet ... this makes it economically viable to try this companies legendary products on a routine basis .
positive	i ' m confident that this will be one of the greatest deal giving websites on the net , in the times to come .
positive	so buy up quick before everyone , and their brother , wants a piece of the savings pie .
positive	overall an excelent company in all departments , fast processsing and delivery of all their goods , even to the channel_islands .
positive	all products are competitively_priced and i ' ve never_experienced customer_services better from any other company !
positive	top_notch , cannot_fault , asked to be informed when a product was back in stock got an_email in a timely_manner , was easy to checkout and was kept_updated of the status of my order at every_stage .
positive	will_definitely buy from them again .
positive	wonderful service , excellent price , all the music i need in as many places as i need it .
positive	just need to get the rhcp and the beatles agreed and it ' ll be perfect .
positive	couldn ' t believe it when somebody designed me some trainers , they ordered the wrong_size and they accepted the return .
positive	just hope they are recycled properly :)
positive	i ordered a pair of teva sandals from the site on tuesday around midnight , received a confirmation the next_day that my order was processed and on thursday at 0 a . m i received the parcel .
positive	excellent service , highly_recommended !
positive	absolutely_faultless and outstanding service , very highly_recommended !
positive	prices are great , some very cheap some average but nothing ridiculously overpriced .
positive	packaging was excellent , bottles are very securely packed and should be safe from even the most clumsy postman .
positive	delivery time was also excellent , arrived in very reasonable time and i was kept_informed about my order which was also much_appreciated .
positive	overall an outstanding and honest company and comes very highly_recommended from me .
positive	bought a ddr0 sodimm 0gb_ram card for my laptop as it was getting a bit old and slow but didn ' t want to throw it away as it was otherwise fine .
positive	installed the ram in about a minute , so easy !
positive	my laptop runs much_quicker now so wont be needing a new one for another couple of years .
positive	my item was dispatched super_quick ( the same day !)
positive	and arrived the day after .
positive	can ' t fault the service or products one bit , fantastic !
positive	the raybans were as_described .
positive	the 000 viewer is perfect for see the raybans before buying .
positive	delivery was free and fast .
positive	very happy with my raybans .
positive	highly_recomended .
positive	will def use again .
positive	buy all my wii and xbox games on it , cheap , quick and relable .
positive	ordered my camera on the sunday and it arrived on the tuesday .
positive	fantastic packaging , super secure .
positive	honestly can ' t find any fault .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	kirsty has been very helpful and understanding :)
positive	been ordering from chemuk for many years now , always been steller service .
positive	always worth checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
positive	i enjoyed shopping at supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	i highly_recommend everyone to use this website to make there future_purchases .
positive	the best in the business !
positive	would order again without a second thought
positive	excellent service , my items got delivered the morning after i ordered them .
positive	the prices they had for name brand supplements was significantly_lower_than in - store prices for generic stuff .
positive	simply the lowest i have found .
positive	shipping is so fast , it is easier than going to a store and buying it there !
positive	so i bought a cornilleau sport 000 indoor .
positive	i live in n . ireland and spent a while shopping around for the best price .
positive	without_doubt table - tennis - tables . co . uk offered the best possible price in the uk - they beat amazon by £_00 and all of their other uk competitors by ~ £_00 as they were the only company offering free delivery to ni ( others charged ~ £_00 for the 000kg delivery ).
positive	i did experience minor issues with deliveries but neither were within the sphere of influence of table - tennis - tables . co . uk .
positive	their customer_service was excellent , they chased up the couriers and provided me with information whenever i requested .
positive	also as a nice_touch they sent me some champagne chocolates to make up for the delivery issues ( which were not their fault ).
positive	overall a fantastic company with clued in , professional and courteous staff ( i dealt_with wendy , russell and tom ).
positive	buy with confidence knowing that you are getting a great price on quality products backed_up by caring customer_service - if you live in ni or roi , literally nobody on the internet can beat their prices !!
positive	!
positive	very patient and detailed service .
positive	takes the hassle out of moving
positive	i ' ve wanted some brushes from crownbrush for a while and when there was a 00_%_off code i thought it would be rude not to !
positive	i am really pleased with the brushes i bought ( all eyes on you set ) as they are such good quality , especially for the price .
positive	the best brushes i ' ve ever owned !
positive	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
positive	the colours are lovely , very natural and pretty palette .
positive	i ' ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
positive	thank_you crownbrush *****
positive	ordered l ' oreal blonde shampoo from a recommendation from my hairdresser .
positive	i found the best price with hq_hair plus i had a discount_code on an_email .
positive	within a few_days the shampoo was with me , i did think the bottle seemed small but you don ' t need much on the hair and i only use it weekly along side my daily shampoo .
positive	great prices , good offers , excellent delivery service always bang on time mo issues_whatsoever
positive	i have used moonpig for about 0 years now .
positive	various birthdays , anniversaries etc .
positive	always as i need , always arriving when i ask , never let me down .

positive	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
positive	would recommend again in the future for ( on - line support ) :)
positive	i bought a laptop , which was the cheapest i could find by £_00 .
positive	i ordered the item at 00 : am and it was delivered by 0 :_00pm , next_day .
positive	i was sent regular_updates_throughout the process .
positive	i read someone_else ' s complaint about returns , which hopefully will not happen to me .
positive	a copy of this review will be sent to the company , and i ' m sure it will be in their interest to listen to these complaints and improve the overall service .
positive	let ' s give them the benefit of the doubt .
positive	so far , so good :)
positive	i booked this company , by searching for the cheapest service online .
positive	my parcel was collected on the day , and was received mid day just 00_hours_later .
positive	after booking my parcel , i stumbled on these reviews .
positive	what i did was open a paypal_dispute immediately after processing the order .
positive	i posted a link to this website with reviews , and asked for a refund if the parcel was not picked_up as requested and delivered on time .
positive	hopefully someone from the companies office picked_up the dispute and made sure the item was delivered on time
positive	its only fair on this occasion , to give them 0_stars for their service , but , read the others reviews before considering their service .
positive	there is no number to call the company on if things go_wrong .
positive	it looks as though i got lucky !!
positive	!
positive	great selection and pricing .
positive	their specials and decent shipping prices make sw an easy option .
positive	this website not only matches competitors prices but will discount the lowest_price an additional 0 % !!
positive	i will buy all my wellness products from this site !
positive	my husband and i ' ve been using supplements for quite some time , we kept pouring money into it until we found you guys .
positive	thanks for the great deals
positive	would highly_recommend them and would use again .
positive	i ordered a dress but was too small so i sent it back and my refund was paid back very quickly and with no hassle .
positive	i did some digging to find the best price for my 0g ipod_touch and gadget_panda offered by_far the best deal .
positive	so , i posted my item off to the freepost address - there was plenty of postage attached to that for me to send via recorded signed for delivery for just the 00p royal_mail charge and nothing extra .
positive	i was kept_informed via_email as to the progress of my payment and i received the cheque promptly .
positive	this is clearly a young company - my cheque was hand_written in a stamped , addressed envelope ( very cute touch ).
positive	overall an excellent experience .
positive	easy to find what ur looking for , and grat prices
positive	you only deal with 0 site and do not get the hassles of you being led to various site .
positive	excellent layout , informative and you see what u want in a touch of a button ...
positive	nice one !
positive	suggest this place to everyone looking to get there work out supplements and dietary supplements .
positive	they really do have the best prices from everyone_else !
positive	!
positive	instant search result , quick and easy processing , sensibly designed email_updates providing up to date status of the process but with sufficiently discreet banners .
positive	brilliant service all_round , online sh !
positive	is impeccably reliable , so much so that i don ' t need to go to the store at all .
positive	i ' ve ordered from supplement_warehouse several_times and have always had great service to go along with their great prices .
positive	shipping cost used to be high , but now with their $ 0 . 00 flat_rate shipping it is no_longer an issue .
positive	excellent quality image , fantastic service and postage speed .
positive	can ' t recommend the company enough
positive	thanks !!!!
positive	0 *****
positive	double0tickets was a reliable service , stressfree ...

positive	thank_you
positive	the key was given to me as soon as i purchased the item and it activated perfectly on origin .
positive	thanks .
positive	we used alba_rose to purchase our_wedding_rings .
positive	from the moment we first went to the shop the staff were very professional and helpful , we have visited since to have our fingers resized ect and everytime they were happy to help no matter how busy they was .
positive	we designed our own ring ' s and they staff were very experienced in what they do and helping_us decide our perfect ring .
positive	we felt we got a very personalised experienced unlike the big name jewellers .
positive	we was also kept up to date about our purchase by phone and text which was very helpful .
positive	we have now picked_up our_wedding_rings and are very impressed with them and the presentation of them was beautiful in lovely boxes and bag .
positive	we have since recommended our friend to alba_rose who have since purcahsed their wedding_rings through them as they felt they giot a very good service .
positive	another added_bonus is they have suggested us to come back the week of the wedding and they will clean all our jewellery we are wearing on the day for free .
positive	thanks again alba_rose !
positive	we would definitely_recommend you to all our friends & family !
positive	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
positive	man i love this webpage , you might not get free shipping but you get free_stuff and if you find a webpage with a cheaper price they give you an even better deal on whatever you are ordering .
positive	i found the online ordering simple and easy to use .
positive	the option to purchase additional gifts ( a teddy_bear , chocolates and a card ) with the flowers was also very useful .
positive	the flowers were delivered the next_day , as promised in great condition .
positive	my girlfriend was very pleased with her_birthday surprise !
positive	i received the package in 0 days ..... in italy so i ' m impressed .
positive	thank u so much !
positive	awesome tour company !
positive	definitely highly_recommend morocco - excursions to anyone travelling to merzouga ... our_guide hassan mouhou went above and beyond for us !
positive	my cousin and i have traveled quite a bit and i have to say , he was by_far , the best guide we have ever had .
positive	he arranged so many things for us which were not a part of the original tour , our trip to morocco would not have been the same without his help .
positive	awesome value for money , beautiful accommodation and a real taste of true berber culture , much_better_than the big commercial tour companies !
positive	contact hassan and i promise you will not be disappointed ..
positive	phenomenal , simply phenomenal .
positive	breathtakingly beautiful , albeit cold , and unlike anything i ' d ever_experienced before .
positive	well worth it !
positive	hasan and ishmael looked after us well , cooking the best harira we had in morocco , telling stories and singing songs .
positive	our camp was tiny , private and silent - a perfect tranquil stop ( though if we went to the dune top we could see a tent city nearby that apparently housed 000 people with electricity etc ... what ' s the point of that ?)
positive	anyone going to morocco for the first time should visit the desert , and these are the folks to do it with .
positive	they ' ll look after you

positive	one of my best experience , only 0 working_days to get to italy .
positive	the price was the best in europe , they have absolutely gained a new loyal_customer
positive	very very happy with onlinekeystore , it was the first time that i was buying there but i am surely going to buy again !
positive	fast_shipping and low_prices
positive	product arrived 0 days after ordering as planned and was much_better value than other_places i looked , would use again
positive	we ordered from worktop_express because ikea didn ' t sell the lengths we needed .
positive	we thought it would be much more_expensive but it actually worked out cheaper and was by_far better quality .
positive	makes our standard ikea kitchen look really premium .
positive	delivery was great , i got a call an_hour before hand so i could go home to sign .
positive	make_sure you allow time to oil a couple of times before it goes on .
positive	from the moment i spoke to robert ( our holidays_please representative ) my anxieties about booking our dream honeymoon were forgotten .
positive	we were unsure of where we wanted to go and robert gave me advice and information each time we changed our mind about the destination .
positive	robert was very knowledgable about all the destinations and got back to me very quickly with hotel and flight options ( which were always within our specified budget ).
positive	he was honest about what we could and couldn ' t afford , to enable us to have the luxurious honeymoon we wanted .
positive	we decided on mauritius and got it all booked up very easily with robert .
positive	even when , 0 month before_departure , our orginal hotel decided to close for refurbishment , robert had already got 0 hotel options for us to choose from .
positive	it turned_out to be a blessing as the hotel we chose , with roberts recommendation , was absolutely superb and everything we could have asked for and more !
positive	we used the gift list service for our guests which worked_perfectly .. our guests commented on the ease of use .
positive	i have no hesitations about recommending holidays_please and using them again for ourselves !
positive	large database of places around the world .
positive	clean interface .
positive	no full pre_- payment .
positive	what to want more ?
positive	awesome deals and super selection !
positive	good shipping to boot .
positive	no_complaints at all .
positive	the best thing was the conversion_rate i got .
positive	i was booking hostel in switzerland and made payment in euro .
positive	i got a conversion_rate of 0 . 00 whereas hostelworld gave me only 0 . 00 .
positive	so thats a good 0 % saving for me .
positive	thanks
positive	i initially called up webtogs to get some advice and spoke to a really friendly woman with encylopedic knowledge of walking boots .
positive	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot on .
positive	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
positive	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
positive	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
positive	i have used double0 on various occasions and will always look on here whenever i am in a situation where i cannot obtain tickets anywhere_else !
positive	every time i have wanted to go to the 00 to see a concert double0 always come to my rescue .
positive	yes you may pay more but you are guaranteed to get good seats and the tickets everyone_else wants .
positive	i would always recommend them to anyone , you pay for what you get .
positive	thank_you double0 and i am looking_forward to going to see_beyonce very soon ...

positive	simply_games always get games out to you on time , sometimes early which is even better .
positive	compared to some online game retailers it ' s up there with the best for it ' s fast , reliable dispatch and the games always come sealed to a high standand .
positive	i would recommend simply_games to anyone tired of receiving not on time .
positive	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
positive	excellent !
positive	thanks for the help sammie !
positive	excellent service , very quick and easy , transaction was very fast and i am very happy to use this service again as they have very reasonable prices for my old_mobile .
positive	i have been taunton zizzi for many_times .
positive	everytime is so happy with everything , ie , food , service , environment , cleanliness .... all .
positive	000_% recommended .
positive	fantastic price paid at a very fast rate
positive	quick , no_fuss , nothing beats it for simplicity .
positive	te website is clear , helpful and there is a vast_amount of choice .
positive	many ' money off ' offers ( which all nutrition supplement websites have right ?
positive	), however , echo genuinely seems to be one of , if not the , website offering the best deals .
positive	delivery is very quick .
positive	also , due to stock issues on my last purchase , the option to change or wait was put forward and the consideration towards me as a valued customer was evident .
positive	will certainly be using echo_supplements again and recommend them to all who read this review .
positive	just chatted with rob on parcels 0 go . com brilliant sevice .!
positive	answered all my questions .!
positive	great :)
positive	everything went smooth !
positive	i really_appreciated this site for it ' s ease of use and easy to follow design .
positive	i had a hard time on similar_sites , finding the dates i needed to book , but hostelbookers . com only showed me the ones available for my dates !
positive	i ' m a fastidious researcher and i went to multiple sites , including to the hostel sites themselves for prices and hostelbookers . com matched the lowest_price every time .
positive	next time i need to book a hostel , i can save myself some time without sweating by going straight to hostelbookers . com , sans the research !
positive	i really_appreciate that .
positive	thanks !
positive	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .
positive	easy site to use and give the best prices out there .
positive	i had my first problem today with the site saying i needed the live help to assist me .
positive	i did and thanks to the very helpful and polite catherine my order has been organised and my parcel is being picked_up later today .
positive	great service .
positive	wish more customer_service people were that helpful .
positive	will_continue to use parcel0go for all my courier needs .
positive	the first place i look for a supplement is supplement_warehouse .
positive	i check their price .
positive	then , i spend some time looking at other_websites for their prices , to see if there are any lower .
positive	about 00_% of the time , there aren ' t .
positive	the other 0 %, supplement_warehouse wins the game with their 0 % price_match .
positive	the best supp source online .
positive	recieved the sigm 0 . 0 00 for nikon - sharp lens but does have issues in edges of image .

positive	really quick delivery and excellent product - new shaker looks so good !
positive	i took my son in to get his feet measured and they were brilliant .

positive	no hassle service .
positive	registered online and sent phone in on same day .

positive	quick delivery , great boots .
positive	great service and a pleasure to deal with .
positive	super smooth_transaction and a great price for my phone
positive	i ' ve used hostelbookers three times now and have been satisfied every time .
positive	the descriptions and pictures of each hostel are extremely useful and say so much about each place .
positive	i especially like the reviews and ratings !
positive	it gives the best insight_into what a place may be like .
positive	and i love the bars with percentage ratings for different things , especially the location bar !
positive	i also really like the feature that you can sort places by location when you ' re browsing hostels as i ' m usually a weekend traveler or trying to get the most out of a place in a short amount of time so being_able to select by location is key for me .
positive	hostelbookers also emails regularly and i like the no booking_fees as well as the deposit because you don ' t feel_like you ' re going to waste your money if something happens when you only have to put down 00 %, plus you can get the insurance .
positive	love this website !
positive	excellent , everything was perfect and the price was great .
positive	customer_service was friendly , and our items were delivered in pristine_condition and packaged well .
positive	we purchased a billabong winter wetsuit for my nephew , needed quick delivery for a wakeboarding comp he was competing in , the wesuit outlet provided second to none customer_service , they were extremely_helpful and we got the wetsuit delivered the next_day .
positive	my nephew was bouncing round the house he was so happy .
positive	would recommend them to anyone , they have a great variety of products at very reasonable prices .
positive	we are very happy customers !
positive	thanx
positive	really easy , not the best price but the most trustworthy and really clear_instructions .
positive	hostelbookers is an amazing site where you simply type in a destination and a list of hostels in that area pop - up by price , rating , location , etc !
positive	it ' s so easy and saves a lot of time .
positive	i highly_reccommend this if your looking for inexpensive places to rest your head !
positive	a fast friendly service wich cater to the needs of the individual , no_problems no_fuss and if there is then it ' s easy to talk to them , great team and i will recommend v0 in the future thanks again
positive	brilliant way to do a course for people who have busy schedules .
positive	very easy to understand course and very user_friendly .
positive	i would recommend e_- careers course to all my friends and family wanting to do a quick short course .
positive	i ' ve used them three times now and never had a problem .
positive	a great range of options , helpful staff with plenty of ideas .
positive	i ' m already recommending them to other groups !
positive	great service , delivery was faster_than promised and the video reviews of avalanche transceivers were really useful for deciding which one to buy .
positive	recommended .
positive	was happily surprised how easy it was to purchase my game , and at these prices its insane not to use their site .
positive	i got my computer exactly when they said and when i had a little trouble setting_up their costumer_service was very helpful
positive	the whole_process was very easy from start to finish .
positive	sign_up was easy and you just had to print off the postage label and post it yourself .
positive	when i was delayed posting it they emailed to check everything was ok and they held the price for 0 weeks .
positive	i have ordered 0 times from this website and i would recommend it to anyone .
positive	the price is great and the quality of the product is excellent .
positive	i bought cod black_ops 0 from cdkeyhouse and had no_problems at all , smooth and simple transaction through paypal and the key was delivered to my inbox in minutes .
positive	its a great service and i would recommend it to anybody who_wants cheep discounted cd_keys rather then paying retail prices .
positive	keep up the great service and support .
positive	received all products within a couple of days of placing my order , well_packaged and good value for money .
positive	thanks , will_definitely buy again !
positive	the product i ordered ticked every box . it was very good quality was very good value and came within 0 days . very satisfied customer !
positive	i have been there customer for very long time .

positive	as it is officialiphoneunlock . co . uk is the best unlock solution for unlocking any iphone , what impressed me most is the support of the team .
positive	my unlock was delayed due to a technical issue with carrier ( at & t ) and the carrier wont process the unlockings on weekend but the officialiphoneunlock . co . uk has worked on weekends just to unlock my phone though it was not their delay and made sure my phone was unlocked by sunday ..... thanks once again officialiphoneunlock . co . uk team .

positive	excellent service
positive	never once have i been disappointed with this site .
positive	top_marks !
positive	i know digitalrev mainly from their youtube_channel , and was actually suprised to learn that they have an online shop .
positive	i really like their videos on all_sorts of camera related subjects , and found that the particular camera i was looking to buy ( the canon_000d ) was cheapest on digitalrev out of all the retailers i was looking at .
positive	so i ordered it .
positive	it arrived within a few_days , was * very * securly packaged and i had no_problems whatsoever with any aspect of the transaction .
positive	will_definitely order with them again !
positive	if there is any_issues their team are helpful and try to get them resolved asap .
positive	paid about £ 0 for product plus delivery , arrived next working day and product was exactly as specified and worked_perfectly .
positive	not a single complaint , would advise to others and will happily use again in the future .
positive	i bought crysis 0 hunter edition from cdkeyhouse , reliable !!! safe !!
positive	! always nice service . so if you want to get a game key as a low price , i suggest this website
positive	cdkeyhouse . com
positive	this vpn is very stable , and very safe . when i use some chinese vpn before , i found my internet company can realized it , but after i use strongvpn , my internet company cant find me again , this is very important in china , you know .
positive	strongvpn ' s speed is good , all depend your internet speed after you change your ip ' s location to near your real location , all is ok , no pro !!!
positive	!
positive	highly_recommend will 000_% buy from them again .
positive	this was super easy , fast , and reliable !
positive	i was very skeptical at first , but this is an awesome service and so worth it !
positive	at & t took way too long to get back to me on this , but you guys took less_than a day !!
positive	thanks for all the help :) its much_appreciated
positive	daniel from parcel0go was great .
positive	very nice to chat to plus quick at fixing the problems .
positive	top_marks for him and parcel0go .
positive	great service every time .
positive	cheaper_than anywhere_else , plus the option to add a bunch of free_samples while checking out ?
positive	who wouldn ' t want to shop here .
positive	fast_shipping with one low flat_rate , i couldn ' t be more happy .
positive	they ' re helping me get huge .
positive	love this site , the descriptions are always easy to read and state the main points with out having to read an essay .
positive	maps and reviews of each hostel are also fantastic so you know where you ' ll be and what past visitors thought .
positive	stops the unexpected surprises upon_arrival
positive	prices are really competetive , delivery is absolutely acceptable ( 0 days from belgium ).
positive	i hope i ' ll buy more things on pixmania in future .
positive	this site has such an awesome selection of free_samples , extremely low_cost bars in bulk , and any product you need they have !
positive	i saved a ton of money and i was able to get everything that i needed all in one place , and i got a bunch more .
positive	i am extremely excited about discovering this site and this will be my go to supplement site from now on !
positive	judging from most_recent reviews it appears only london seems to get good service .
positive	i have had no_problems with streaming or disc delivery .
positive	although i have noticed google_chrome shows lovefilm . com to be an unsecure website .
positive	also that after having a disc delivered and returned they just made the same film available for instant viewing , this happened at_least four times .
positive	i have only used the service for three months .
positive	i would like to see instant service include dvd and blu_ray extra features like making of and deleted scenes then we can do away with discs altogether , provided lovefilm can retain the license to stream the content as i have noticed many films become unavailable after a time .
positive	hazard a guess many other_reviewers might have had streaming problems due to there internet_connection and service provider rather_than any technical fault with lovefilm . com .
positive	i only say because when i came close to my own download limit streaming grinded to a halt , took very long to load or did not even start at all .
positive	i have simultaneously been a member with lovefilms main competitor and have had no_problems either in fact its been a better service but lacking in new content .
positive	hostel_bookers is very helpful when it comes to hostels that do not have websites .
positive	by booking through hostel_bookers i was able to retrieve the phone number and email address of the hostel i had been wanting to book , but couldn ' t find anywhere online .
positive	thank_you , hostel_bookers , for providing me with the information i need to make future_bookings at this hostel on my own .
positive	in the future , when i can ' t find any telephone_numbers or email addresses for the hostels i want to book , i will book through your website once again .
positive	sincerely ,
positive	christopher cowell
positive	first off wow !
positive	what a phenomenal company to do business with !
positive	i ordered my oxielite pro 000 caps and it was less_than the 00 caps at gnc by 00 $!!!
positive	( it works wonderfully by the way ) you guys have a life long customer now i have told 0 people about this awesome site and you have 0 more life long customers .
positive	i was thrilled to receive my order just over 00_hours_later too i was in shock !
positive	you guys truly go above and beyond in every_aspect of the word !
positive	thank_you a million times over !
positive	(:
positive	heidi nordsell
positive	i buy all my supplements at supplementwarehouse because they have all the products i want at a good price .
positive	i ' m a customer for life !
positive	a real_life_saver when it comes to purchasing books for university .
positive	i love the free postage and packaging offers and delivery is always prompt .
positive	would recommend to anyone .
positive	i have ordered a few things from this company now and would recommend it to anyone .
positive	the products are very good value for money but do not lack in quality .
positive	the free postage and packaging is excellent , items arrive within a week and are always well wrapped ( especially important since the parcels are often containing glass ).
positive	do not hesitate to order from this company , i am always satisfied with the service and prices .
positive	00 / 00 .
positive	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
positive	i found the diamondgeezer . com website through google , which had just the ring i wanted .
positive	i was sceptical at first because of the website name but then found out the owner of the company has featured in an episode of dragon ’_s den , which gave me all the reassurance i needed .
positive	the website has a very useful_tool to check the progress of your order .
positive	unfortunately , i received the wrong ring at first but the customer_service was quick to fix their mistake .
positive	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
positive	the customer_service is unbelievably good .
positive	clive was the most helpful and polite person i have ever had the chance to speak .
positive	camerakings is very quick in communication .
positive	most of the times you can expect your e_- mail or facebook post answered within a few hours .
positive	also , they always do as they promise .
positive	i had two problems with a single order .
positive	the first was that dutch customs charged me with taxes which i had to pay in cash to dhl .
positive	camerkings refunded this within the hour !
positive	the second problem was a faulty baseplate on the gini rigs advanced extreme 00 .
positive	again , answered within the hour with the promise to immediately send me a replacement .
positive	i ' m very pleased with the service of camerkings .
positive	all companies should be like this .
positive	mazuma blew me away !
positive	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
positive	would 000_% use again !
positive	super_fast delivery excellent prices highly_recomended
positive	its a fast and easy to use website the prices where very good it took about 0 mins to set_up my account with them and 0 mins after_placing an order for them to mail the code only thing that was a little miss leading is the $ 0 on top activation fee whats that when its at home all in all a good site
positive	0 months_ago i preorderd aliens colonial marines from amazon due out on 00 feb_0000 the day before it was due to come out was emailed by amazon stating that due to unforseen problems i was not going to get my copy at the launch more_than a little annoyed i went_onto the amazon aliens : cm board to see if i was the only one having this shipping problem and as i gussed about 00 other loyal_customers where having the same problem .
positive	this is the fourth time amazon has messed_up a preorder i have made and every time they have just brushed me off with a weak apogee so after years of loyal custom with them i decided to cancel the preorder and close my account so i did a short google_search and i came_across simply_games and not only was the game £ 0 cheaper i was going to have to wait only one days as apposed to 0 days with amazon needless to say all my future_purchases will be with simply_games they are fast reliable and cheap shop with confidance 00 / 00
positive	hostelbookers beats out hostelworld for sure !
positive	as a low - budget many - month traveler , avoiding an extra fee makes a big difference in the long run .
positive	you can also log in and keep registration details , which makes booking a place much_easier - it is a pain to have to re enter all details on hostelworld when i am booking a new place every week !
positive	the details on locations gives you all the info you need in order to book , and the site loads fast on slow connections , which is very useful when wifi is slow while traveling !
positive	it also lets you select more lodging options than just hostels and sometimes these have special rates which beat out a hostel .
positive	i ' ll take a private_room for the same price as a hostel dorm any day !
positive	!
positive	its my fourth book from jessops , i was so pleased that they have been able to continue trading their photo_books are the best ones available on line or in stores , both for quality and value for money - although i would recommend holding out for the offers .
positive	with the software downloaded to your laptop or pc it means you don ' t have to wait for pictures to upload or go through suffering at times of high usage , you can complete at your leisure .
positive	this most_recent one was of my sons first year , it ' s a massive book and includes the text from an line blog which i have been writing fromm his perspective .
positive	really took a lot of time to arrange the text and pictures and getting it uniform throughout the book it was enjoyable to see it coming together and adding more and more pages .
positive	all i can say really is that i would and do recommend using cewe photo_books .
positive	i have always loved domino ' s pizza prob my favourite food !
positive	i downloaded the app a few_months_ago but have never used it so thought i would for the first time wednesday_night .
positive	i can not complain the pizza ( which was an half and half ) came exactly as requested but i just loved the extra bonus of the app saying at what point the pizza was at i . e baking or quality_control .
positive	very rare i have ever had complaint with dominos but when i do they are always resolved straight_away .
positive	kate
positive	came when expected as had easter inbetween .
positive	the website was easy to use without forcing extra products .
positive	excellent quality came individually boxed for protection .
positive	the free presents were not bad either !
positive	honestly i was sceptical of what i will be buying as the cost was the cheapest .
positive	i am greatly impressed with the promptness of the service and the fact that people at slr_hut did talk to me and helped_me change some aspects of the order after_placing it .
positive	it was very convenient and helpful and did not feel_like everything is automated which is a good thing for me .
positive	i received my item within 0 days which is even more impressive considering the fact that it came from usa .
positive	overall i do recommend slr_hut .
positive	if you can find what you want at the price you like , just go for it .
positive	got my keys within a few minutes after payment .
positive	they have good prices too , would recommend !
positive	i find a lot of bad review are about complaining the fact they didn ' t receive the right products etc .
positive	well i have bought products from ebay for over 0 years and i have only ever_encountered one slight mishap , which was shortly resolved .
positive	it comes down to the user to look out for the fakes or ' the too good to be true deals ', the actual website is great and a great place to buy items , hence the 0 star_rating .
positive	i use amazon on a daily_basis , and every time i have received a decent product .
positive	overall it is a good website to use and very reliable !
positive	best search_engine around and more , gmail is easy to use and so are the other services provided .
positive	i was unsure_whether to buy from them at first , but after phoning up felt_confident enough to buy from them .
positive	the product which was a sigma 00 -_000mm os for canon arrived_promptly in 0 days from america !
positive	as a general rule i do a lot of research on each product i buy , and the cheapest i found in the high_street was £_000 and slrhut was £_000 inc tax .
positive	it came well_packaged and the box and product were pristine .
positive	i would recommend this site to others definitely as the prices are far cheaper_than the uk !
positive	thanks a lot slrhut !!
positive	!
positive	signed_up with them a few_days ago and after about ten_minutes i understood the entire software .
positive	now i send my invoices within a few minutes every evening .
positive	great software !
positive	very pleased with my experience with these_guys .
positive	good selection of products on the site , simple process to order .
positive	arrived at my door the next_day !
positive	very happy , thanks .
positive	love it .
positive	i ' m useing it every morning .
positive	i spoke to chris and i booked my ps0 in for a fix of ylod .
positive	gave my ps0 to him and he fixed it perfectly in an 0 hour and 00_mins and showed me it worked_perfectly .
positive	recommend him any time and a very good company .
positive	first time to use this site and must_say quite easy and fast ..
positive	hope my experience in nice will also be great , then you can bet i ' ll come again for some new bookings ... hehe ..
positive	i ordered three small canvas ' s and they arrived within a week !!
positive	all the way from germany to the uk !
positive	they were packaged really well and the quality is brilliant !
positive	well worth the discount as well !!
positive	very impressed .
positive	well_done !
positive	arrived on time , even after adjustments made by myself late in the day , thoroughly_recommended .
positive	hostelbookers is a great website for travelling .
positive	i use it every time i travel abroad .
positive	there is no beating the convenience of being_able to view so many places by price , location and rating .
positive	one of my favourite things about this website is that all the places are reviewed by travellers just like me so i am more likely to stay some place that has a better review rather then just an attractive price .
positive	the reviews help me a lot and i believe it is very important to leave a review for all places i stay in for this website .
positive	easy to use site and very fast delivery
positive	they were very polite and helpful , called me within a few minutes of my request and didnt take up too much time .
positive	i have already recomended a friend .
positive	very easy to search for what i wanted and deffinatly the cheapest deal , no where local could match it .
positive	tyres_fitted the following_day .
positive	i ’ m so glad i stumbled_upon party_krakow when organising my mates_stag .
positive	if i hadn ’ t , i wouldn ’ t have been on one of the finest weekends away i ’ ve ever had or , in fact , returned to krakow just 0 weeks_later with my girlfriend ( with party_krakow ’_s assistance !).
positive	krakow ’_s that good i went twice .
positive	as with most stag organisers i immediately went straight to the british based tour companies with their flashy websites , easy payment options and – as i found out – cringingly flirtatious and patronising staff .
positive	i found these sites useful for ideas but their prices are heavily inflated compared to what you can get if you book it direct .
positive	this is what i was planning to do before i found party_krakow .
positive	they , by virtue of their contacts in krakow , could pull together a package for even better value than going direct individually .
positive	to add to that i met phil , their sales director , who couldn ’ t do enough to help us and advise us on various things for our weekend ( such as tips on where to eat / drink , exchanging currency etc ).
positive	having exchanged a few e_- mails and telephone_calls – to the point where my other half was getting slightly_concerned_about the bromance i was striking up with “ my main man in poland ” as i kept referring to him – phil had managed to sort our weekend out for us at a snip of the price they were trying to charge on said british based websites .
positive	the reason these companies get so much business is , i can only assume , is the fact that they have a british based secure payment website where individual stag goers can pay in instalments .
positive	which brings me to the only slight negative with party_krakow .
positive	when paying there ’_s an element of trust as you ’ re simply transferring money into their bank_account .
positive	firstly an immediate non_refundable £_00 followed_by half of the remaining_balance 0 weeks prior to departure .
positive	the final amount is paid in cash on arrival .
positive	all fine with me as i ’ d collected all the money from the stag goers well in_advance , had the opportunity to build up a rapport with phil and do a bit of research into the company .
positive	however , more sceptical organisers may be uncomfortable doing this .
positive	the sooner party_krakow invest in a secure payment website similar to their british competitors the better for them ( in my opinion ) as everything else they do is absolutely spot on .
positive	anyway , to the weekend .
positive	we were staying in the ‘ royale apartment ’_s which i was , initially , a little_dubious_about staying at as i was concerned_about disturbing other people in the block and being too far from the main square .
positive	it wasn ’ t a problem – the large apartments are robust enough to cater for a bit of excess noise , they ’ re within easy walking_distance of the main square ( approx .
positive	00 - 00 minute_walk away ) and on the door_step of the kazimeriz area which is where you really want to be anyway .
positive	it ’_s absolutely buzzing on a weekend .
positive	there ’_s a number of mini supermarkets to stock up on booze nearby as well .
positive	another bonus was that there are no keys – it ’_s all done on key codes .
positive	secure , warm , comfortable , plenty of hot_water , well located and good value .
positive	for our activities on arrival we immediately got picked_up from the airport to shoot some filthy large guns where we were met by our first guide sabine .
positive	she spoke excellent english and was really chilled and friendly .
positive	we peppered her with questions about where we should go out and what we should do .
positive	she was only too pleased to help us out .
positive	the gun shooting is over pretty quickly ( about an_hour for 00 of us ) but it ’_s absolutely quality and if you want to fire more ( we went for the basic package ) you can pay as you go after the initial shoot out .
positive	on the second day we got picked_up by the party_bus in the afternoon .
positive	this is unbelievable – it ’_s got an awesome sound system and is really stylishly decked out .
positive	i ’ ve never been in a coach quite like it .
positive	i was keen to book this as we could arrange a stripper for the stag in a controlled environment .
positive	this turned_out to be perfect as it ’_s essentially your own pub on wheels with a stripper .
positive	our_guide gosia joined us for this trip and after our 0 hour trip on the bus she came out for a beer with us .
positive	she was great company and , again , couldn ’ t do enough to help .
positive	we didn ’ t pay for “ all you can drink ” on the bus which we were glad about as ( after a boozy lunch ) we only got through 00 beers between the 00 of us .
positive	all you can drink is advertised at £ 00pp which – at 0 zloty a beer ( just over a quid ) – equates to about 00 beers in 0 hours just to break even .
positive	when the first beer comes free as part of the package we only effectively spent £_00 on beer between the 00 of us .
positive	unless you ’ re going to be drinking spirits / champagne or can drink at the speed of a beer every 00_minutes then i ’ d recommend paying as you go .
positive	also , there ’_s no toilet on the bus ( they do stops on requests though ).
positive	as for krakow itself it ’_s a beautiful city .
positive	it ’_s fun , relaxed , classy , tolerant and not in the slightest bit sleazy .
positive	if you ’ ve been put off from going by various hyperbolic reviews in the past then don ’ t be , do your research for modern day krakow and give it a go .
positive	it ’_s also still incredibly cheap – most beers will cost you less_than £ 0 . 00 for a large beer and you can get a massive feed for about £ 0 .
positive	as a stag venue you couldn ’ t really ask for more and if you put your faith in party_krakow you won ’ t be disappointed .

positive	travelled 00 - 00 november_0000
positive	great value .
positive	delivered promptly .
positive	nothing more really needs to be said !
positive	after viewing all these reviews i found vodafone no hassle with my contract .
positive	the network is always in reach for me and always the fastest 0g internet !
positive	i haven ' t contacted them through the phone yet because i ' ve had no_problems , but then again if you were to find a different network_provider you ' ll probably have same issues .
positive	the only_downside i can think of is that they don ' t offer unlimited_internet , just a 0gb internet package , which is plenty for me but can be a issue for others .
positive	great company , i always buy my supplements from supplement_warehouse .. its cheap fast and they have a larger selection than most everywhere_else ive looked .. plus they beat competitor pricing .. just no reason not to .
positive	i just spent an_hour online filling up shopping carts of everything i wanted from various supplement sites ... what a waste of time .
positive	first of all , supplement_warehouse has the best selection of products by_far , combined with the lowest_prices and free perks .
positive	shipping is a little_steep to my area , but still by_far the cheapest site .
positive	will_continue my business with none other than supplement_warehouse .
positive	good deals !!
positive	fast_shipping .
positive	great free_stuff

positive	awesome company , great prices and a massive_range of products , love to use them .
positive	i ' ve now stayed in 00 of their hostels throughout europe and am yet to be disappointed .
positive	they are independent hostels so you don ' t feel_like you ' re in a hostel factory like i ' ve felt before in some of the big hostels - in , pay , sleep , out ......
positive	whenever there ' s a europe ' s famous hostel in the city i ' m going it ' s an easy choice for me , i just wish there was one everywhere !

positive	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
positive	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
positive	my only small criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
positive	overall a great service .
positive	i recently_purchased a case for my iphone 0 , however was not happy with the fit .
positive	on contacting snugg , they provided me a replacement case of my choice with no extra_cost .
positive	the company has provided excellent customer_service and i would recommend snugg products to anyone .
positive	the representative i spoke to answered all my queries and was also patient , a combination you do not see with many companies these days .
positive	in addition the material quality of their products is of a high_standard , a added_bonus .
positive	thanks for your help snugg :)

positive	have been using , juno for many years ...
positive	they havent ever failed me , delievery / turnaround times are very good , 0 / 00 orders ( before 0pm ) arrived the next_day .
positive	price is normally very good , cd albums etc are normally equal to amazon prices .
positive	they ' re always failry upto - date on music release , and give accurate estimations on forthcoming music .
positive	any communications iv had with them in the past ( for later orders or damaged goods - which is extremely rare ), they responded quickly & professionaly .
positive	i dont really use the juno download section , as in my opinion beatport is the best & the most up front .
positive	however , i would say its well_designed and the sample player is really good , so if there was no beatport , i would happily use juno ... its cheaper too !
positive	!
positive	all - in - all juno is my prefered site for buying artist albums ( techno , house , progressive ) & dj equipment ( headphones , dj bags etc ).
positive	i dont use vinyl any more , but they used to be my main source for buying 00 ".
positive	hallo , the keys arrived the very next_day .
positive	please use my reply and name if you like including area where we are as part of your totally and highly satisfied customers in every way 0 / price 0 / efficiency / 0 / service 0 / delivery 0 / customer_satisfaction .
positive	a0 tops in everything .
positive	please use this as a recommendation .
positive	whilst the website does look a little dodgy it worked_perfectly and was much_quicker and a hell of a lot more secure than any other cd_key website
positive	of all the cd_key selling websites iv ' e used this is by_far the most secure one , simply asking for a phone verification and allowing the use of paypal put my mind to rest , this , in addition to the nice layout and the great stock notifications i would happily buy again from them .
positive	the service is speedy , and it ' s great value for money - nice and discreet too .
positive	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else .
positive	very fast delivery , happy with the service
positive	fantastic service , saved us a lot of money on the sale of our property .
positive	currently using your conveyancing services for the house we ' re purchasing and very impressed so far !
positive	i had been looking for a winter jacket online and had seen a few that i liked on a number of websites such as e_- outdoor . co . uk .
positive	having never owned a north_face jacket , i went to my local cotswold store and ended_up trying a few different_styles prior to making an online purchasing decision .
positive	i ended_up choosing the north_face redpoint jacket however , the store that i visited did not have one with a hood .
positive	i began googling the redpoint jacket when i got home and found that it did come with a hood .
positive	e_- outdoor . co . uk were the most competitively_priced and offered free delivery also so i ordered through them .
positive	the service from there onwards has been faultless .
positive	i received an order confirmation immediately , a text_message two days_later asking when i would like the item delivered ( with the option of changing the date or having the item delivered to a neighbour ) and received the item a day later .
positive	the whole_process was very professional throughout and i would have absolutely no_hesitation in using this company again or recommending it to a friend .
positive	on a final note , i am wearing my purchase as i type this review .
positive	the item was received in perfect_condition and exactly as specified .
positive	thank_you for a great buying experience .
positive	i came_across webtogs whilst searching for the best price on a the northface base_camp bag for the gym .
positive	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
positive	i ' ve used the company twice since , getting some argyll boots and a the northface jacket .
positive	all items were shipped fast .
positive	i bought my company ' s first colour laser_printer from them 0 years_ago and have been using them ever since .
positive	they have been consistently good value in toner costs ( and i do compare prices !)
positive	and always dispatch fast .
positive	i recently_purchased another printer which is serving me well .
positive	there was a delay when i ordered an extra - paper tray , but i got a call a few minutes after ordering to inform me of the delay .
positive	the item arrived a few_days_later as promised .
positive	i wish all companies were this reliable !
positive	i found supplement_warehouse to be the place to go to find the best deals .
positive	they will beat any prices you can find online !
positive	thanks
positive	superb company , well_priced , great customer_service and the ability to pre_- book a courier to pick your lens back up , so you know exactly how much you ' ll be paying before you order is excellent !
positive	roll on my next order !
positive	i can ' t believe the score is so low for dpd !
positive	ordered a phone from vodafone at 0pm yesterday , was shipped out at 0pm and arrived today at 00am - never seen anyone get an order from nuneaton to just outside of manchester so quickly !
positive	ordered plenty of things in the past that have come with dpd , including £ 0000 + computer systems , dpd being the only courier that haven ' t managed to damage the item , no matter how much packaging one uses .
positive	if you ' re planning on buying something , make_sure the company uses dpd .
positive	period .
positive	very good prices and very quick free delivery !

positive	i read previous reviews about this site a lot of people were very happy and therefore i took a chance and purchased an ipod_nano the condition description said scratched up back however when it arrived there were a few marks and i was really happy with the condition .
positive	i also used the next_day delivery service as i needed it for a train journey to scotland i left my house at about 00 :_00am and it arrived just as i had left , however it still fulfilled its agreement to get here before twelve , again i am happy with this service .
positive	( do not worry i borrowed an ipod from my dad and i had company anyway .)
positive	all in all really happy with the product and the service .
positive	it was a class day .
positive	description was spot on and all went without a problem
positive	the guys at sellmyhome are very thorough and fair and always available when you need them and indeed provide a very personal service .
positive	i can ' t imagine getting a better service , certainly not from a high_street agent , and when you factor in how much you would pay to a high_street agent as a % of the property value that makes this a hugely high value service .
positive	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else in the future .
positive	great company who saved my bacon on mothers_day after a disaster with a less reputable service !
positive	very easy to use , lovely choice and free delivery to my mothers ( fairly out of the way , rural ) address .
positive	thank_you interflora for cheering my mum up after her disappointment yesterday and saving me from being dis - owned :) from now on i ' ll be sticking to what i know !
positive	having been with vodafone since the beginning of time practically , when my contract was due to end i decided to shop around some other deals .
positive	couldn ' t find anything that bettered my current tarrif so contacted vodafone to see what they offered .
positive	customer_services were really friendly and helpful and i came away with a brand spanking new smartphone , at no extra_cost and on the same tariff with a few extras thrown in !
positive	i explained that i worked shifts and they arranged a time to deliver which suited .
positive	i even got a text from them on the day letting me know the exact time of delivery , saving me from hanging_around all day waiting .
positive	great service and i ' m very happy with my lovely new phone !
positive	it ' s very easy to book a hostel !
positive	i ' ll use it again !
positive	thank_you .
positive	i ' ll be honest , prior to this purchase i ' d never_heard of grooves inc and usually buy most of my electronics from more established websites like amazon .
positive	i wanted to buy the ' mighty morphin power rangers season 0 ' dvd set and grooves was one of the very few sites in europe to sell the product .
positive	i must_say that i ' ve been left impressed .
positive	the order was shipped and delivered quickly , with a great price ( 0 disks with 00 eps on each for £_00 ) and secure packaging .
positive	chuffed to bits that i found these_guys and will_defiantly use them again .
positive	bravo .

positive	first ,

positive	0 hours_later , my iphone was unlocked and is working fine .
positive	network : at & t
positive	model : iphone 0

positive	i get them to come to my work address as this means i don ' t waste my time
positive	great products at great prices .
positive	delivery is prompt too .
positive	will_definitely continue to shop here .
positive	never had a problem with them .
positive	i always know what i am looking for and i love the free add_ons !
positive	i did have an issue once with an_alternate shipping company , but normally ups or fedex is very fast .

positive	unfortunately the elastic band of the handstrap on the case came loose almost as soon as i received my snugg case in the mail , but the customer_services team immediately responded to my query and have already got a replacement on the way .
positive	friendly , direct communication with a fast response time .
positive	if you want to see how a top quality , no - fuss customer_service team works , look no further than the team from snugg !
positive	addiction to this website
positive	good value for money .
positive	would definitely use them again .
positive	youtube was the best video sharing website when they started years_ago and they are still the best video platform on the internet !
positive	google is still my number one search_engine .
positive	i tried bing for some time as i liked their picture change every day etc .
positive	but the search_results ( and that ' s obviously the most_important ) are just the best with google !
positive	i signed_up with this invoicing service a few_months_ago and was positively_surprised as it is very easy and fast to send invoices .
positive	last_week i had a problem with my revenue report which i wanted to export to an excel file and it didn ' t work .
positive	i emailed them and within half an_hour the problem was fixed .
positive	top customer_service !
positive	this company is amazing !
positive	i ' m a fitness model , and compete in shows !
positive	i ' m always in a hurry and some companies don ' t have the products i need !
positive	so , i truelly really on these_guys to get me preped and ready for my shows !
positive	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
positive	it was missing a button on the keypad so i was expecting to be contacted about receiving a reduced price .
positive	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an_email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
positive	happy days .
positive	amazing love this site , instant and cheaper_than high_street , what more could you want !
positive	!
positive	i love online shopping with tesco .
positive	it ' s fast , easy and i don ' t have to wrestle my way to the checkout !
positive	really pleased with my purchase .
positive	easy site to get around , found what i was after and the free batteries and no vat were great extras .
positive	easy payment , speedy_delivery .
positive	well recommended !
positive	friendly search and easy booking .
positive	fast and simple .
positive	finds the best deals and displays all relevant_information .
positive	have used them before and will_definitely return when booking our next holiday .
positive	the website is easy to navigate , offers plenty of information to help you compare each hostels and best of all , charge no commission !
positive	the website of choice for booking hostels :)
positive	the delivery was really quick and the products have been excellent and as_described .
positive	fab - i would use again !
positive	i would recommend beautybay again , they were really fast in delivery and the product is just what i expected .
positive	love that there are no fees and plenty of great reviews to help pick a place to stay .
positive	thanks for the dosh !
positive	very quick payment !
positive	this grocery_shopping site is like no other .
positive	i went about my weekly_shop as usual , only here i received constant reminders of great deals and smart opportunities to save more .
positive	best of all , i get to see a price comparison for my entire basket across all stores , so that i knew what the best store was to shop from .
positive	once i saw tesco was cheaper , i changed my store , and my entire basket was automatically moved there !
positive	it ' s the best way for me to do my weekly_shop , and be sure i ' m saving those extra pounds that make all the difference .
positive	thank_you mysupermarket !
positive	wow .
positive	for about 0 years now i ' ve been fiddling with toner save options and refilling my cartridge with cheap - o toner powder and suffering perpetual faint printouts .
positive	in the end , with my wife buying a new ricoh printer to replace it i finally snapped .
positive	i ' ll get a new toner .
positive	google ejaculated printerinks . com and i took a look .
positive	£_00 for a new cartridge ?
positive	buying an original cost £_000 so that ' s a cracking saving .
positive	bagged it and bought it and sat back .
positive	got an_email the next working day saying it was dispatched .
positive	but took over a week to arrive at my house .
positive	can only assume this was a royal_mail issue since printerinks were able to give me a recorded_delivery tracking_number .
positive	this isn ' t particularly_useful as you can ' t track recorded_delivery , you can only confirm delivery .
positive	of more use to printerinks than me .
positive	so now i ' m larry , i ' m so happy .
positive	toner saver is switched firmly off .
positive	toner density is set to max and i ' m printing for fun .
positive	viva la toner .
positive	viva la printerinks !
positive	i only usually leave reviews when i have a negative experience with a site ( like most people ) but after_reading some of the nonsensical negative_reviews here , i will break that habit .
positive	to cover some of the points made in some of the other reviews ;
positive	- accounts are free and do what they say they do , you can chat with models as a free user , it just depends on the chat restrictions set by each_individual model .
positive	premium features are naturally reserved for paying customers .
positive	- i don ' t know the exact amount but the 00_% figure is probably about right for how much models make per token earnt through tips or private shows .
positive	think that ' s bad ?
positive	factor into the equation the cost that the website bares when serving thousands of cam streams to thousands of users , many of whom are guests or regular members , where does the bandwidth come from for that ?
positive	how about when a model earns very little through lack of performance , do they pay back the cost of the bandwidth ?
positive	i would estimate there is a profit in there for the administrators but not as much as you might think .
positive	- as for tipping models for " off the site " perks , mfc makes it quite clear that all tips are just that ; tips .
positive	any agreement you have with the model in exchange for a tip is between you and the model , no moderation or mediation is offered for this , also made clear on the site .
positive	if you got taken for a few tokens , rate the model down and move on .. welcome to the real world .
positive	i have never personally experienced this but then i just give tips as a token of my appreciation to the model .
positive	- i have never personally encountered a poor juddery connection over the past 0 years of using this service but then i guess this is subjective to the models connection , server location and its upstream providers to your isp .
positive	- track your ip_address , you bet .
positive	find me a subscription website that doesn ' t do this .
positive	what other way would you suggest to trace and block fraudsters and spammers ?
positive	if you ' re a legitimate paying rule abiding customer , what do you have to worry_about ?
positive	if you are worried_about this , you should delete your facebook , hotmail / gmail account and sign off from the internet .
positive	- the website does indeed archive every conversation , not really a secret considering there ' s a link which allows you to view your past conversations with models ... without storing the information , how else would one make this possible ?
positive	you could always click the " clear chat logs " link , though that could be some sort of underhand trick or trap so best be_careful / s
positive	nonsensical codswallop quashed , now onto my experience with mfc ;
positive	i ' ve been a member of mfc since 0000 and still a happy paying customer today .
positive	i am also a member of other adult cam sites , but this website is frankly a hundred times better_than the others .
positive	i prefer this website because it is much richer in features for paying customers than the others , with most other cam sites you are lucky to get a basic " java " chatroom and the option to take a model private .
positive	mfc offers a non - laggy free chatroom , private , voyageur and group shows .
positive	i could go on but i will sign off by leaving a pro / con list and let you decide for yourself .
positive	pros_:
positive	- free to use for all users .
positive	- private archives ( great way to view your private sessions again , and again ..)
positive	- thousands of very beautiful models , there really is someone for everyone .
positive	- non laggy ( ajax ?)
positive	chatroom .
positive	- stable website and connection to cams .
positive	- variety of different_ways to spend your tokens ( privates , voyageur , group and tipping ).
positive	- a ton of other misc stuff i won ' t go onto list but it certainly is the most feature rich cam site .
positive	cons_:
positive	- ancient green layout .
positive	it may have looked nice during web 0 . 0 era but this is 0000 and time for a change .
positive	- plenty of ways to filter models but no way to filter by age ... somewhat of an oversight .
positive	- no possible way to change the email address associated with your account ( other than by contacting support ).
positive	- support is mediocre and very meh from my experience , and being a " platinum premium " member , i should in theory receive the highest priority level of support .
positive	having contacted support on about 0 occasions , i only received replies on 0 of those .
positive	it has nearly always been a technical or billing issue that i have contacted them about and not something covered by the wiki documentation .
positive	for any other website , i would have stopped visiting it if this had happened , so it ' s a testament to how good this site is that i have chosen to overlook these occasions .
positive	i neither work for or know the people who own mfc .
positive	this review does not contain an affiliate link .
positive	having a single point of contact at chillisauce was very helpful and they helped organise a great weekend for 00 people .
positive	everything went_smoothly and they even helped book taxis at the last_minute hunting_around for the best deal .
positive	if you want to organise a stag_do without any hassle i recommend using chillisauce .
positive	i ordered my ring in november and received it well within the predicted delivery time and wow what an amazing ring !!!
positive	i proposed to my girlfriend on christmas day and she hasn ' t stopped staring_at her new addition to her finger since .
positive	i cannot thank diamonds_factory enough for their great service .
positive	i also walked past a major high_street jewellers today and saw the exact_same ring for £ 0000 , this wouldn ' t seem a bad price for it until you see that diamonds_factory do the same one for £_000 !!
positive	seriously recommend them to anybody .
positive	we normally use car_hire 0000 but our last two experience was not very good since they changed to rentalcars . com so we decided to look_elsewhere .
positive	we chose elephantcarhire . net based on their reviews here and other_sites it was a great decision .
positive	the rates they offer are very similar but they work with much_better suppliers .
positive	it makes a lot of difference !
positive	we will use elephant from now on .
positive	it ' s my first time to travel
positive	so i didn ' t have any information about the satement .
positive	when i got exhausted , i found a great website . i couid reservate the hostel easier and cheaper .
positive	this website can help you wherever you go .
positive	you have wide_range to choose from , you can search on tyres compatible with your vehicle .
positive	easy to purchase , good prices and quick delivery , couldn ' t ask for more .
positive	will be using black_circles again .
positive	it ' s my second international transfer with transferwise and i couldn ' t be more satisfied .
positive	this could have the potential to seriously disrupt banks ' business in transfers .
positive	i had serious doubts about using it , it really seemed much like a scam like you regularly get by email , but then i saw two people i know on twitter recommending the service .
positive	after a quick chat with these_guys ( the simpletax team ), they said the service comes highly_recommended and they even knew the team behind it .
positive	can ' t recommend this enough , really .
positive	this was the second time i booked with hostelbookers and it was so easy .
positive	i love the way their site is set_up and how easy it is to use .
positive	i also love that they don ' t charge a booking_fee .
positive	i really like the fact that there are so many reviews on each hostel .
positive	i was very pleased with this site .
positive	i am planning a trip all through out europe and i will use hostelbookers for every stay i have .
positive	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
positive	!
positive	from the very first phone call to the final delivery i received excellent customer_services .
positive	the communication level was high and helpful and the product when it was delivered was exactly as i hoped , and was also delivered ahead of schedule too even_though it was a large order .
positive	also , i work using a purchase order system as i work for a local council and this was no problem for adband who were able to invoice me and release the product even_though i was unable to pay immediately .
positive	thank_you very much .
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending adband to anyone and would happily use them again in the future !
positive	i don ' t know what is better , the extensive_range of products buyhair . co . uk offer or their amazing customer_service !?
positive	my prostyles hair came super_quick and buyhair will not be_beaten on price !
positive	so affordable , quick delivery ( with very reasonable postage and packaging ) and a huge_range of products .
positive	i will always return to buyhair .
positive	don ' t hesitate to call them if you have any_questions or concerns , they are lovely and always willing to help .
positive	thanks so much buyhair .
positive	xxxx
positive	everything was really quick .
positive	the envelope arrived the next_day and i had money in my account that week !
positive	no_problems with booking , very fast email_notifications , good website
positive	i frequently use vanilla pods to make ice_cream and i suspect that i have paid way too much for vanilla recently by buying from a supermarket .
positive	schwartz put their pods in the same jars they use for all their spices ; totally inappropriate packaging as they have to bend the pods to put them in the jar .
positive	i bought 00 pods from vanilla mart for less_than the price of two supermarket pods .
positive	they were at_least 0cm longer and packaged better .
positive	great product and great service , will_definitely use them again .
positive	i ordered 00 drawing mannequins from this website , i ' d never_heard of it before so didn ' t know what to expect but the low price and great delivery promises caught my eye .
positive	got quite a few emails and texts to inform me of delivery days and times which was nice so i could make_sure someone was in .
positive	then a text to inform me my ordered was left with my neighbour , and a picture of their gate , the little things just show the quality of the service .
positive	i wiped out the stock with this ordered so received 0 out of the 00 .
positive	i emailed to ask when the remaining 0 would be with me , i had an_email back within the hour telling_me it would be only a few_days and apologised for the unconvinced .
positive	very impressed with the quality of the product and the service .
positive	thank_you so much !
positive	ordered a pair of raybans , came on time with great customer_service .
positive	would recommend this website to anyone .
positive	i hadn ' t used chillisauce before but i went on a stag organised via the company and was impressed with the organisation of the weekend .
positive	when it came down to me to organise a stag , i didn ' t hesitate to book through them .
positive	the prices are fair and the staff really help you tailor the experience .
positive	we stayed in edinburgh during the fringe and the location couldn ' t have been better .
positive	there are add on extras like activities such as highland games , paintballing , quad_biking which is great .
positive	nearly everything is organised for you - all you need to do is turn_up !
positive	i thought i ' d have to wait a couple of days for the keys to come through but they were there the morning after i ' d ordered them online the previous afternoon .
positive	i ' ve been ordering from supplement_warehouse for 0 years and have always had a great experience .
positive	thier price_match has come in handy a few_times , and they always have the lowest_prices around .
positive	plus you get free_stuff with every order !
positive	we bought my engagement_ring a week_ago from diamond_dealer direct ...
positive	i didn ' t really know what i wanted and spent the morning wandering around the jewellery_quarter feeling a bit overwhelmed by the huge choice !
positive	christina was very helpful !
positive	she went through loads of different type stones , shapes and bands until we ' d narrowed it down to my favourite ring .
positive	she was very helpful , friendly and down to earth - felt_like i ' d brought a friend shopping with me !
positive	also , the price compared to similar rings i ' d seen across the quarter was extremely competitive .
positive	i ' d recommend to anyone !
positive	great prices , fast delivery , good quality products and great customer_service .
positive	fast returns refunds too .
positive	00 / 00
positive	very pleased with designer paint .
positive	they have the best range of paints and the service is great .
positive	lots of samples available although some are ridiculously_expensive for the size pot you get ( fired earth !!!)
positive	and it is not designer paints fault at all .
positive	as a company i would give them 00 / 00 .
positive	:)
positive	super_fast delivery , great range of quality products .
positive	i purchased vega energising smoothie powder and it arrived_safely .
positive	very good price compared to other internet sites , easy to use website , very clear and simple .
positive	exactly_what i want from an internet transaction .
positive	they also answered a number of my questions over email and we ' re very helpful .
positive	would recommend to anyone and will use again .
positive	thank_you blue herbs :)
positive	i had a lot of email contact with aggressive health before i purchased my first vegan protein_powder .
positive	the advice given was great and mike was extremely patient with my never ending questions and was able to answer all of them .
positive	this company is ran by a fitness expert which made me feel so much_better when asking advice as i knew i was going to be recommended the right products rather_than being recommended the most expensive or supplement that makes them the most money like other faceless supplement companies !
positive	it was a pleasure_dealing_with aggressive health and i will_definitely be use them again .
positive	fast delivery , quality products , expert_advice .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	00 / 00
positive	great communication and very helpful staff thank - you for all your help !
positive	i ' m studying abroad in london for the semester so i ' ve obviously been doing some travelling and i ' ve used hostelbookers every time !
positive	the website is accurate and up - to - date and really delivers great service !!
positive	i recommend is completely and will_continue to use it for years to come !
positive	very pleased thanks
positive	shopto is the very best game shop i , ve ever used , the prices are so competitive , and always seen to be cheaper_than other online_retailers .
positive	the service is second to none .
positive	ive been with shopto for a couple of years now and have not once recieved a game late , ( after release_date ).
positive	on ocasions i sometimes get it a day before_release_date which i find amazing and is really good to show my friends on psn that i , ve the game early or on time .
positive	i saw a video of how the games get selected and dispatched and was shocked how the machines get the games out faster_than any other online games company .
positive	its a thing shopto should be proud of !
positive	i will remain to shop at shopto and tell my friends to do so too , as i think its the best personal service anyone can get from a internet gaming shop .
positive	thanks shopto
positive	andrew holt
positive	you guys_rock as always .

positive	great and quick support by david ( ec0000 )
positive	thank_you very much .
positive	not a scam , fast , simple and it works like a dream .
positive	would highly_recommend
positive	i ordered last_minute tickets to backstreet boy for this coming friday .
positive	ordered the tickets at a discounted price on sunday and they arrived today .
positive	a very reliable company to use , even_though i had my doubts at first , as i ' d not heard of them before .
positive	much_better_than viagogo and similar_sites , the price you see is the price you pay .
positive	would definitely use them again
positive	really polite and gave all the information i needed .
positive	i found this site via google , i won ' t lie , i had my doubts when i placed my first order , but i went with it .
positive	them being located a few hours away only , when i place an order , i receive my stuff very quickly .
positive	been a dedicated customer of them and referred many of my friends to them as well !!
positive	thanks for the great prices and keep up the great work guys !!
positive	!
positive	fantastically quick delivery of a set of headphones - ordered an in - stock item from amazon . co . uk half an_hour earlier and it hasn ' t arrived today .
positive	found the site through a recommendation - now here ' s mine !
positive	came with discount_voucher and a lolly - can ' t complain !
positive	digitalrev is probably the best company i ' ve dealt_with in quite a while .
positive	i ' m a musician by trade , so i ' m used to ordering through specialist stores , and they are awfully clinical .
positive	digitalrev provides something unique , in that they not only provide fantastic prices for their equipment , they have video tutorials which are informative but also fun ( think top gear meets cameras instead of cars ) and a lot of articles on the site itself .
positive	they run regular deals of various products , so it ' s always a good idea to check back regularly to see if there ' s a new bargain in stock , but their prices beat every other retailer on the web – including amazon .
positive	with jessops kicking the bucket , digitalrev , in my opinion , has the potential to become the uk ' s new household name for camera gear .
positive	the service provided by double 0 is excellent .
positive	i was delighted with the tickets i recieved for the ellie goulding gig that i go too on sunday
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	hassle_free and got the loan i needed within a few_days
positive	purchased french tv_unit from home kandi .

positive	service absolutely fab .
positive	order arrived on time , i am delighted that i decided to shop online with oakfurnitureland .
positive	would recommend it to anyone .
positive	the delivery staff were very pleasant and helpful too ."
positive	i can only recommend this keystore .
positive	i bought fifa_00 and got it after a heartbeat .
positive	nowhere else you get keys such cheap .
positive	i would definitely_recommend anyone to do courses with e_- careers .
positive	they make is hassle_free and there is always support there when you need help .
positive	this is the first time i used e_- careers , but definitely won ' t be my last .
positive	i can ' t fault the service from interactiveresorts , jonny morton was very helpful and replied by email very quickly .
positive	i had everything sorted after just a couple of emails and a phone call and am now looking_forward to my holiday in a few weeks time !
positive	i would definitely_recommend interactiveresorts if you are looking to get away this winter !
positive	it was the first time i shopped on this web - site and i ' ll definitely shop again !!
positive	the products are original , in a perfect state and really worth of value .
positive	the shipping was quite fast , considering that i ordered from italy and it took only 00 days to deliver .
positive	i am very satisfied
positive	the post back envelope arrived_promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .

positive	super_quick service - it was that fast that to get any faster you would need to print it before i even placed my order ...
positive	i have been buying from ebuyer for years , either by paying by card or getting credit i have not had one problem and it is even better when they give me free next_day delivery .
positive	what makes it even better is you can order some items really late and get it the next_day .
positive	i mainly stick to computer_components or entertainment products like my 00 " samsung i bought from them the other day at around 0pm and it was delivered the next_day .
positive	so all in all ebuyer is one of the best companies i have found .
positive	just wish they could stop tempting me to buy more stuff ;)
positive	came_across onlycdkeys with google so looked at the reviews from previous purchasers on here and everything looked fine .
positive	so i thought i would give it a go , and with in 0mins after registration and telephone verification i had 00 months ps plus instantly .
positive	so yeah in one word " brilliant "
positive	easy website to use and the items ordered were here next_day and also extremely cheap prices .
positive	we bought the perfect fit venetian blinds .
positive	was very nervous_about having to measure and fit the blind ourselves but they are brilliant .
positive	they fit like a glove and are extremely easy to fit when you know how .
positive	price was brilliant delivery was brilliant and will be back for some more for our kitchen windows .
positive	excellant all_round could not recommend enough .
positive	my father and i went to nepal in october this year in to attempt the everest base_camp trek with private himalaya / expeditions ( pe ).
positive	the experience was amazing and one we will never forget , right from the start we were so well looked after by pe .
positive	pimba , one of the guides and an everest summiteer met us at the aiprort and drove us straight to our hotel for a welcome beer after 00 hs of travel !
positive	the next_day we were due to fly out to lukla and as many trekkers will know the planes do not fly from kathmandu to lukla unless the weather is perfect ... we were not so lucky and it took 0 days for us to get out to lukla in clear weather .
positive	throughout the whole time at the aiport in kathmandu , pimba from pe did his absolute best each day to get us on any flight he could and really looked after us , ferrying us each day from the hotel to the airport and back when we weren ' t successful .
positive	each night he came up with a plan for the next_day until we eventually flew out on the 0th day and started our trek .
positive	for our actual trek we had our personal guide dorje and our porter dhjiban - both were brilliant .
positive	we felt very safe with dorje and he was a lot of fun , although serious when he had to be to make_sure we understood things ( like not having alcohol on the way up to ebc !)
positive	the attention to detail was pretty impressive , making_sure we ate and drank well , checking our oxygen levels each night and making_sure we were being honest about how we felt physically .
positive	as we had lost the 0 days at the start dorje had to change the trek on the fly and did so brilliantly without rushing us , always telling us " slowly ... slowly "
positive	dhijban our porter ( 00 years old ) was pretty awesome carrying our bags every day and beating is on each section of the trek ... embarrassing actually !
positive	when we tipped him at the end he came to say thank_you and you could tell he was very genuine ... he was very shy !
positive	after a few tough sleepless nights near ebc dorje was always more concerned_about our health than getting to the top but when we made it he took me up to the top of a steep ridge and we took some amazing photos for 00_mins before starting down in the snow !
positive	dorje became a friend , we had an amazing experience together and we celebrated in style on the final night in lukla ... i will be going back and i will be asking dorje to be our_guide .... the next challenge looks_like island peak !
positive	the best recommedation i could give is to use pe again and i will be doing that with my wife in the next 0 years .. island peak is a definite and there is always kili in the future which is what makes pe so impressive , their global scale .
positive	my father and i would both highly_recommend pe to anyone thinking of going trekking or climbing ... thank_you to the whole pe team and i am sorry i took so long to write this but work has taken revenge on me for taking 0 . 0 weeks off in a row !
positive	thanks very much

positive	when it comes in shopping online there is no better place than amazon , they have all the products that you need from supplements , foods , etc ....
positive	i often order bodybuilding supplements in amazon and it will arrive in my apartment 0 - 0 days after i ordered it , and the products are all in tact .
positive	no questions about your money what you see is what you get when you shop at amazon .
positive	no questions ask !
positive	i was really amazed with this site , at first i have some doubt that it will just be another company that has some delays , but no i was shocked when i ordered my nokia phone and it was delivered 0 days after i ordered it .
positive	i chat with the customer_service representatives and they answered all of my questions , even some of my questions are hard and cannot be found on the terms and privacy listed on the site , they still answered my questions .

positive	i was able to unlock the iphone_0s with r sim 0 but with iphone 0 i tried everything .
positive	ultrasn0w , geveysim , rsim , custom ipsw .
positive	once that baseband is updated it isnt going to downgrade by use of no_bb ipsw .
positive	got screwed over on that part .
positive	r sim is able to unlock a 0s but not a 0 .
positive	the advertisement said iphone 0 too but that was a lie .
positive	i thought i was gonna have to switch over to att for this phone .
positive	i found this website and did research .
positive	seemed legit i guess .
positive	i figured i ' d use my credit_card to pay for it so that in case it was a scam my credit_card company would refund me and help shut_down this site .
positive	i hate scam sites ..
positive	turns_out it ' s actually legit .
positive	i provided them my imei_number , paid for it , had to send a pic of my credit_card with my name on it ( fingers covering my numbers and exp date ), and then waited about 0 hrs before i received an_email_saying that its unlocked and all i had to do was plug in to itunes .
positive	my phone was jailbroken so itunes didn ' t try to unlock it .
positive	i had to do an official restore with my tmobile sim in the phone .
positive	it downloaded another 0 . 0 . 0 ipsw ( i installed an official 0 . 0 . 0 before btw ..), installed it and then asked me to check for a carrier update .
positive	checked it , installed it , and then at the end it finally said my iphone was unlocked .
positive	had to do my jailbreak again but other than that i ' m happy with it .
positive	i ' m writing this review just because they offer some money back for doing it and also cuz i ' m grateful it worked .
positive	what else i can say , got the best rate for buying euros for my holiday , arrived well on time , quite simple to order .
positive	will use again .
positive	excellent service and advice from graham , gives you his honest_opinions about buying the right digital_piano .

positive	i was reading the reviews whilst waiting for my tesco ' s shopping to be delivered .
positive	doesn ' t feel you with confidence as there are a lot of negative_reviews but i was pleasantly_surprised !
positive	anyway , i had a delivery for between 0pm - 00pm .
positive	they arrived at 0 . 00pm .
positive	friendly driver , he even apologised for the wait .
positive	he advised that only one item was missing ( it was chocolate so quite upsetting lol !).
positive	anyway , eggs were in the order and he checked them over before handing them to me .
positive	very courteous and much_appreciated .
positive	unpacked all the shopping and was happy that all the fresh items had at_least 0 days until expiry .
positive	the only item that had a couple of days was some strawberries but in fairness , when you buy strawberries in the shop , they have a maximum of 0 days anyway .
positive	thats it , all good , no_complaints ( they are probably saving my waistline not having the chocolate in stock !)
positive	and i would use again .
positive	i ' ve been using quidco for a few_years now but have really started to use it more intensely recently .
positive	well , what can i say ?
positive	i always shop on a quidco friendly site .
positive	its all worth it , from 00p to £_00 . 00 , everything adds up .
positive	most of the purchases track , but its easy to raise a claim if they don ' t .
positive	i pay the £ 0 a year ( although you can opt for the free membership ) as it is nice to be able to receive my cashback quicker .
positive	plus the live_chat option is really helpful and the staff are really quick to respond by email if you have a query .
positive	i now kick myself if i ever buy something online and don ' t quidco it !!
positive	in the last 0 months i have managed to track £_000 of cashback - 00_% of that has already been paid into my bank and the rest will probably come within the next couple of months .
positive	easy money for doing nothing but clicking through !
positive	super_fast service , received within 00_hours of ordering .
positive	brilliant !
positive	they have everything and then some , and their prices literally can ' t be beat !!
positive	i don ' t think i ' ll ever go anywhere_else for my supplement_needs !

positive	a very good service overall was a bit late on delivery but was kept_informed by e_- mail at evry stage .
positive	computer arived undamaged , ( concidering the lift was broke and i live on the forth floor ).
positive	only down_side was i spent alot of money they could have trown in somthing to sweten the deal .
positive	i always haggle at the stores when i ' m spending big money and always get some free bees .
positive	overall 0 / 0
positive	i unlocked an iphone0 .
positive	i messed_up the carrier like twice and they refunded me .. and after i finally got it right ( but after the 0 refunds i started to trust them ) it said 0 - 0 weeks to unblock for that carrier .
positive	so i thought worst case they dont find it and they refund me and that is that .
positive	well ... after 0 weeks ... im writing this after finishing setting_up my " new " and unlocked iphone :_d good job guys thanks !

positive	i also received a £_00 gift_card , very nice surprise !
positive	service is second to none , can email and even ring them thanks totally_wicked .
positive	good prices , great tasting juice !
positive	service is excellent , pleasure to buy from , highly_reccomended !
positive	i cannot_believe that people have had bad_experiences with this company .
positive	i have purchased many products from cotswold outdoor , both instore and online .
positive	every time i receive 00 / 00 customer_service , the products are always excellent and if on the odd chance the item does not fit or function properly , then i have always received a quick refund .
positive	i will be shopping from this store for many years to come .
positive	i ordered a leather restorer spray to treat my holdall and it was exactly_what was needed .
positive	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
positive	i can always trust that webtogs will not only have the gear i want at a competitive price , but will also provide a first_class customer_service .
positive	this website has great prices and many different companies to choose from .
positive	bought an engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com amazing ring fantastic price .
positive	contacted tyres on the drive & they were very friendly on the phone , i told them i live on a terraced street so the car would be on the road & they said this was no problem .
positive	they gave a 0 hour time_slot & arrived just before .
positive	chris & matt were very friendly & polite , and even_though i had ordered a new tyre , they told me that my tyre was in really good condition just had a tiny nail causing a slow puncture .
positive	they gave me the option of having the new tyre or having it repaired for less_than half the price .
positive	can ' t help but think many places would have taken the tyre , repaired it themselves & made the money on it , but instead they saved me £_00 .
positive	excellent service & value for money & i would definitely_recommend .
positive	the most professional company i have dealt_with for a long time .
positive	wired0fire did a great job of making a custom - built_pc .
positive	they replied to all my emails within a day - once i realised this was the case keeping_track of the order was great , as they could tell me exactly_what was going on , and they even install linux on the pc for me for a very reasonable additional_cost .
positive	great stuff , will shop with them again .
positive	ordered two items on line and opted for the next_day delivery option ... low and behold the very next_day by 00 am they were with me two fantastic products that were in a sale making them exceptional value and with the reward_scheme have made my experience even better for value will certainly be using facewest again and again it certainly looks as though the loyalty is rewarded i have already told my climbing partner where to come for his next purchase
positive	hostelbookers has wide_range of hostels so it ' s easy to find exactly_what you are looking for .
positive	and prices are attractive .
positive	i have ordered liquid from them and order came through slightly wrong , but after one e_- mail to customer_services it got sorted really well as i received missing item next_day .
positive	very good experience and would recommend them to anyone .

positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	this march , my brother has sent me the iphone_0s to me from america .
positive	i stay in india .
positive	i took my iphone to the apple_store and requested for an official_unlock .
positive	to my surprise , i discovered that such feature is not available .
positive	so i was not able to use it as an iphone .
positive	one fine day , a friend of mine has informed about this website .
positive	at first i was skeptical as how can a third_party unlock the iphone officially which the apple_store denied to do it .
positive	after going through the posted experiences , i got to believe it .
positive	with out any problem , after following the instructions , i had got my iphone immediately .
positive	now i can make my phone call .
positive	now i tell many of my friends about this website and all of them have got their iphone_unlocked officially .
positive	thanks for the website to unlock the iphone .
positive	i give a 0 star .
positive	i needed to reschedule a collection and sammie_taylor answered my request swiftly and very politely using the online_chat interface .
positive	great site for finding offers on lip balms and nail_polishes which is helpful for when buying gifts .
positive	extensive_range on colours and fast delivery with easy to use website .
positive	could be a site i use regularly ...
positive	called up floridatix to get various theme park tickets for the family trip to orlando this summer .
positive	very friendly service and all the tickets arrived within 00_hours .
positive	we ' re very excited to go and chuffed with the service .
positive	will_definately_recommend or use again if we decide to go back to orlando .
positive	quick , painless and easy .
positive	the only doubt i had was when my brother mentioned needing to vpn something for arma iii , which turned_out to be not really necessary given he got a russian key for the game .
positive	my game ' s already been bought and activated through steam and the only major problem was with the payment - skrill kinda glitched out a little on payment but some quick refreshing sorted that ...
positive	second order , got an anti_- fraud check .
positive	it amuses me that it would happen after i ' ve already bought something , although i can understand it and i now know i ' ve gotta change where my phone saves photos .
positive	that was half an_hour i ' m never getting back ...
positive	i can see again !
positive	awesome website with great choice .
positive	catwalk feature really helps to bridge the gap between website and high_street shop .
positive	always good stuff at great prices , big_fan !
positive	this place is great .
positive	the variety of different supplements and especially the prices have me keep_coming_back for more
positive	have been using kituout since our company started .
positive	weve had t -_shirts to banners made ..... all fantastic quality , quick turn_around and great customer_service !
positive	would recomend to all !
positive	:)
positive	being a full time ( 0am - 0pm ) worker , it is always hard to arrange time off for my service & mot every year and then trying to sort transport whilst the car is gone but this solves all my problems !
positive	i didn ' t even have to leave my office and received a call to confirm if i wanted them to do the recommended work or not ... fabulous service !
positive	i was recommended to your company and i can see why , i would recommend to anyone ... 00 out of 00 !
positive	i will come back and recommend .
positive	thank_you !!
positive	!
positive	an entirely hassle_free process .
positive	i entered what was required online , printed one document and because i was eager for my money , i sent it in a padded bag that i had lying_around .
positive	although it ' s freepost , i ' d recommend queueing at the post_office for a proof of posting , just for the £_00 compensation cover should your phone go missing in transit .
positive	within three days my phone had been received and the money was in my account !
positive	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
positive	so impressed that my partner has sent their phones to mazuma as well , and they got exactly the same great service !
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	have had some issues with paypal re payment , the seller has been so good and patient , keeping in touch and responding to all my messages .
positive	as soon as payment was received - item was dispatched and received next_day .
positive	also item was very good value for money .
positive	highly_reccomended .
positive	thank_you .
positive	arunas .
positive	i buy natracare sanitary products as i am unable to use normal ones due to allergies .
positive	my local supermarkey has now stopped selling them and i didn ' t know what i was going to do until i found the natural woman website .
positive	they have the full range of products and are the same price that i paid in the supermarket .
positive	the postage was resonable and were delivered very quickly , they are lifesavers to me !
positive	i ramdomly found this website and so glad i did .
positive	have bought loads from it and so have a lot of my friends and family .
positive	people can ' t believe i only paid £ 0 for most of the things i ' ve got .
positive	if something isn ' t right , they refund / exchange really easily and have never had a problem with them at all !
positive	recommend it to everyone !
positive	!
positive	my iphone 0 smashed screen got it back in 00_hrs wow !

positive	long_story short , royal_mail lost my package and i spent 0 weeks on the phone with automated switchboards before they admitted they lost it .
positive	then i was told i had to contact the seller and get them to send the item out again and that the seller could apply for reimbursement .
positive	i was worried that this was going to be even more hassle as bannafingers hadn ' t done a thing wrong , why should they be out of pocket ?
positive	but i rang them up ( phone was picked_up on the first ring !)
positive	and 0 minutes later my replacement trousers where ordered , with free next_day delivery to apologise for royal_mails mistake !
positive	and half the phone call was having a nice moaning session about the post service .
positive	amazing company !
positive	i had a problem and they fixed it immediately , no faff and no red tape .
positive	i feel a sudden pang of loyalty to bananafingers now and will buy here a lot more often with the knowledge that any_problems will be sorted .
positive	we ' ve used our local_branch of national for years and have nothing negative to say .
positive	they are prompt , professional , courteous and have always shown themselves to be reliable .
positive	what can i say about wired0fire ?
positive	where to begin is the question .
positive	i shall begin with some background first .
positive	i set out to build a custom_pc , for simulations and extreme graphics performance .
positive	this was 0 years_ago .
positive	the fabled alienware pc was an inviting option , but after_placing my order with them , my parts failed to materialise for a fortnight .
positive	i did some reviews and seeing the decline in customer_satisfaction , i bailed ship and requested a refund .
positive	then i found a small company called wired0fire .
positive	they had some good reviews , as did plenty of other_companies i found on the net .
positive	but what made me trust them from the start , was the professional and knowledgable team of people that greeted me on the phone .
positive	not once but several_times i rang them to ask questions and they knew their stuff inside out .
positive	also , they answered the phone within five rings and were always polite and helpful .
positive	so i to took the plunge and invested my hard_earned cash with them .
positive	and , i can proudly say , here iam 0 years later smiling contently at the beast that purrs beside my desk .
positive	one thing that was important for me when i was purchasing the pc was future proofing it for as long as possible .
positive	i wanted to make_sure i could upgrade as time went by and the system i wanted was faithly built as per my instructions .
positive	over the years i upgraded the graphics_cards , then i went sli ( twin graphics_cards for increased rendering performance ) and increased the amount of ram .
positive	one thing to note .
positive	they say actions speak louder than words .
positive	unfortanetly , i cannot show you what this pc can do but i will tell you of an experience i had when i contacted wired0fire about 0 years_ago .
positive	i was using 0000gtx sli at the time and i wanted to upgrade to 000gtx sli .
positive	i rang up wired0fire to ask if i could upgrade , or if there was anything i should be aware of .
positive	they could have just sold me the 000gtx cards , saying they wil work on my system , but they didnt .
positive	they pulled up my computer data from their records and advised that i would require different power connections for the 000gtx to work .
positive	there was also other concerns that might lead to potential issues and wired0fire advised that the 000gtx would be the next best thing to go for .
positive	the 000gtx was more_expensive .
positive	they could have sold that to me and left me to get on with it .
positive	they had no obligation to assist me as my warranty had expired years before .
positive	so , i think its clear that wired0fire are not money grabbers , out to make a quick buck .
positive	i can_honestly say , that even after all this time , i can still ring them up and they will help me through thick and thin .
positive	they still answer that phone within five rings and the person on the end of the phone is not a call_centre .
positive	this review is more of a thankyou .
positive	i sincerely thank_you toby , peter and the team for the standards you set out to reach and for maintaining excellant customer_services and satisfication .
positive	your computers are the best .
positive	you have won my respect and i cant tell you how difficult it is to find companies like yourselves in todays money driven market .
positive	to anyone reading this review , considering whether to purchase through wired0fire or not .
positive	i can tell you this , no one can beat them .
positive	they have a morale standard of excellance that you dont find in many companies today .
positive	most of them are out to get your money .
positive	these_guys are out to show you what you missing out on .
positive	if you want to go elite , then give them a call and you wont look back , you wont_regret it .
positive	my second order with digitalrev 0x happy .... recommended !
positive	i found it so good because i didn ' t realise how much i would get for an old phone .
positive	i compred other recycling phone websites and mazuma was the best by_far .
positive	this site was recommended to me by a friend so i decided to check it out .
positive	i was immediately blown_away by the low_prices and assortment of items .
positive	supplement_warehouse hase everything imaginable and for a low price .
positive	plus you can add tons of free items to your order , which is awesome !
positive	very happy with the site .
positive	i was slightly hesitant to send my phone off , even_though i will never use it again , to a company and rely_on them being ' honest ' enough to acknowledge it ' s delivery .. never mind giving me the money we ' d agreed upon .
positive	i was stupid !
positive	every_step was easy with mazuma_mobile , i just put my phone in an old box i had sitting around , sat that in the plastic envelope thing they sent me .. popped in my order form then handed it over at the post_office ( finding an open post_office was a nightmare , but that ' s a complaint for someone_else ! )
positive	0 days_later , money is in my account as agreed .
positive	:)
positive	excellent website , easy to navigate .
positive	very useful product info , videos and reviews .
positive	goods arrived next_day .
positive	all in all , brilliant service , thank_you webtogs !
positive	a great website with all the info you need .
positive	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
positive	really happy and i will use again when i find something that i want .
positive	as always with british_airways i had a great experience , friendly staff , on time and comfortable .
positive	i flew from germany via heathrow to newcastle and had a stress - free flight .
positive	i have flown with ba several_times and still have yet to be dissapointed
positive	from the moment i applied for their pack the whole_process was quick .
positive	my return envelope arrived within two days allowing me to send my old_phones off .
positive	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn ' t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
positive	the cheque was for the money i had been quoted .
positive	overall i was very happy with the service .
positive	was about to purchase a used car from a private seller who assured me it was legit .
positive	i used textreg . co . uk the night before and got a text back showing me the true history of the vehicle !
positive	saved me getting stung , can ' t recommend enough !
positive	i made two orders - one a couple of days before_christmas and one a couple of days after .
positive	both arrived in less_than 00_hours which was very impressive considering the time of year .
positive	the items were also the best priced i could find on the internet and arrived in perfect_condition , couldn ' t ask for more .
positive	not only was this the best price i found on the market but it was ready to deliver to my door ( uk ) in just 0 days ( coming from_hong_kong ) ... i ' ve already_recommended them to so many friends looking to buy a new camera and i wouldnt go elsewhere in the future either .
positive	well wrapped as well !
positive	came wrapped in a shedload of bubblewrap so i know it was safe in transit and delivered by dhl , which i trust .
positive	great job guys !
positive	keep it up :))
positive	ordered a pedal board case and it arrived next_day can ' t complain hassle_free will use gak again .
positive	very quick delivery high_quality products for low_prices .
positive	was using amazon back in the days of them only selling books and on a dial - up internet_connection .
positive	never once had an issue .
positive	pretty_much what all e_- commerce businesses should aspire to .
positive	i ' ve been ordering from moby memory for over a year , they ' ve always provided a reliable service .
positive	i ordered a micro_sd last_week and got it today , i ' ll definitely be ordering from them in future .
positive	ordered on the wednesday and my order arrived on the thursday !
positive	could not have been better especially over the christmas_period !
positive	many_thanks o truffle_shuffle and batman who packed my order !
positive	abousuley brilliant service and very helpfull spoken to a lady catherine_corless and she was so helpfull and talked me threw it step by step .
positive	will_defo be using the service again thanks again catherine xxxx
positive	quick delivery , thanks .
positive	i purchased a stuburt rain jacket that unfortunately developed a fault .
positive	sent a picture of the fault to golf000 and within a few hours they got back to me stating that if i returned it then they would send out a brand_new one asap .
positive	now that ' s customer_service .
positive	thank_you !
positive	to anyone in and around the derby area , buy your clubs from here !
positive	went to purchase a 0 wood and was blown_away by the customer_service there .
positive	was fully fitted for my new r00 0 wood and was given some invaluable swing tips to boot .
positive	oh and they were exactly the same price as the golf websites so great value for money as well .
positive	try them !
positive	ordered 0 footjoy gloves ( sci_- flex and pure touch ), price was excellent and delivery was 0 days .
positive	would say notification e_- mails of order status could be better but that ' s only a minor_issue !
positive	i use interlink on a daily_basis and have to say that they have been impeccable since i ' ve been with them ( especially compared to the nightmare that was dhl who i used before ).
positive	only thing is i wish they were able to offer more competitive_prices for shipping to northern_ireland ( still have to use dhl for that ).
positive	staff at my local_depot are beyond excellent and importantly they are reachable on a direct line and always answer within a couple of rings .
positive	with dhl you get put in a queue to speak to some teenager who hasn ' t got a clue and couldn ' t care less .
positive	keep it up interlink and don ' t rest on your laurels !
positive	couldnt be eny happyer with the prices thx ...
positive	easey way to sell best place
positive	i order a single baseball cap with a home made logo on it as a test of the quality of the products made by this company .
positive	the image i gave them was not high_quality and they tried to tell me this .
positive	unfortunately their emails got lost in my junk_mail folder , and when i finally checked this folder they had gone ahead and made the cap with the image i sent .
positive	the cap that arrived was well made , and the printed image was much higher quality than i ever imagined .
positive	the customer_service people that tried to contact my were polite , helpful and were trying their best to give my the best quality item they could .
positive	after about 0 attempts to contact me they made the cap as best as they could and i am very satisfied with the quality , speed of delivery , and the company as a whole .
positive	i will be ordering more from this company very soon
positive	really pleased to find the shoes i wanted at such a reasonable_price .
positive	ordered my usual salomon size but they were too big so sent them back for an exchange .
positive	received an_email confirmation of receipt of the returned goods and that the replacements had been dispatched .
positive	that was yesterday and this morning the shoes were here .
positive	amazing !
positive	why aren ' t all mail order companies this good ?
positive	i will_definitely be using outdoorkit again .
positive	i am extremely impressed by westin_gourmet .
positive	being somebody who has been raised to be paranoid about food safety , especially when it comes to chicken , i was very wary about ordering meat online .
positive	but due to being about to begin a fitness diet where i would be eating excessive amounts of chicken_breast , i decided to look_into buying it in bulk .
positive	after a bit of research , i came_across westin_gourmet ' s wonderful website , and regardless of my apprehension about having meat posted to me , i found myself intruiged .
positive	the sheer amount of choice on offer immediately captivated me and made me salivate , and the brilliant prices just made it all the more appealing .
positive	deciding to take a risk ( slight exaggeration , i did a lot of research online first to make_sure they were a reliable company ) i made an order of 00kg of chicken_breast .
positive	not only that , but after hunting through their numerous good deals i managed to acquire a free corn - fed whole chicken to go with it ( this deal has now expired but they appear to have frequent new deals so have a look ).
positive	when my box arrived i excitedly opened it up , not knowing what to expect .
positive	i immediately could see that my worries had been for nothing - the chicken_breasts were sealed in sturdy professional plastic packaging ( seemed more solid than what i get at tesco ), the whole chicken nicely contained in a bag , surrounded_by ice packs that were still frozen solid , and then encased in padding , all inside the box .
positive	and i got a box of freezer bags for free too !
positive	all this i promptly put in the freezer , very pleased with my decision .
positive	but of course , the final test was to come - the meat itself .
positive	for the price i paid , i half expected some steroid - filled water - injected live chicken to be sat staring_at me , its pupils enormous from the cocktail of chemicals it had been fed on .
positive	but of course ( thank_god !)
positive	this was also just foolishness on my part .
positive	because not only is the price per chicken_breast much much_better_than any pitiful attempt at a deal i have received from the local supermarkets , it is also very decent meat !
positive	i had unwittingly grown used to eating chicken_breast which had been bloated on water by money - hungry supermarkets , and so was very pleased when i cut into one of the enormous chicken_breasts from westin_gourmet and found it to be just pure meat !
positive	no water - injection , no added salt , just the genuine taste of good quality chicken .
positive	now of course , my review isn ' t all encompassing - i am yet to try one of their many appealing steaks , any of their wide_range of sausages and burgers , or their luscious looking lamb , but i most definitely will be doing so in the near_future , and i have every confidence that this company will impress me again and again .
positive	i can ' t recommend this company enough .
positive	for years i had been buying expensive supplements from online websites , slowly watching my money disappearing on products which would not last more_than a few weeks .
positive	it was disheartening .
positive	then i found out about myprotein . com , and initially , i assumed for their prices they had to be either an incredibly well - made scam , or incredibly low quality .
positive	however , after hunting for reviews and opinions on them , i began to realise the truth - they were genuine !
positive	now , i have been using them for years , and would not use anybody_else - the quality of their products speak for themselves , and not only are the prices significant lower_than the brand - name supplements , but they come in much larger quantities too !
positive	i adore this company , and feel that the only reason people can possibly be buying the more_expensive brand - name products has to be either a magpie - like attraction to colourful labels , or that they simply have not yet been directed to myprotein . com .
positive	i know i am gushing on , and so may sound false , but if you have a bit of money spare , buy some creatine from myprotein . com and from a more_expensive online_retailer , test them both out , and you will understand fully .
positive	long live myprotein . com !
positive	!
positive	help assist me in what i needed straight_away , thank_you
positive	had a good look around on the internet to find a supplier who not only had the right products .
positive	but also at a very competitive price .
positive	will be going back again for more stock
positive	used this company for the first time and i am pleased to say i will_definitely use them again .
positive	my goods arrived in very good time and i was delighted with the costs compared to purchasing these items fro the vet .
positive	i went with affordablemobiles after three offered a poor deal , affordablemobiles had the same deal but no upfront cost and £_00 cashback .
positive	i ordred at 0pm friday and it arrived saturday_morning at 0am at my work !
positive	i was amazed !
positive	brilliant service .
positive	would recommend to all .
positive	i ' ve used fonebanker for years every since my se k000 .
positive	you can get more money from other_companies but fonebanker is easy to use and fast payment times .
positive	always amazing and on time .
positive	excellent choice of products !
positive	servicing_stop did a wonderful job and i would certainly recommend them to my friends .
positive	they picked_up my car on time , done the mot and returned it in spotless condition .
positive	they saved me lots of time and money .
positive	very fast delivery , great price , perfect_condition !
positive	i always come back to supplement_warehouse !
positive	its great to support a local milwaukee company and the make shopping on the site fun fast easy and cheap !
positive	i recently_bought an electronic drum_kit for myself , excellent price on the website and such fast , free delivery .
positive	the only_drawback i can think of was the delivery man was really grumpy but that ' s fedex not gak !
positive	this is the easiest transaction i ' ve ever done online .
positive	check value
positive	receive bag
positive	send
positive	??
positive	?
positive	profit !
positive	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for quite a while now and have never been unhappy with anything i have purchased from them .

positive	thank_you supplement_warehouse !
positive	can ' t wait to rock the new t -_shirts i ordered .
positive	fantastic quick service thanks to chris day of i independent merchant services for getting us all set_up to take card payments .

positive	thanks again parcel0go !
positive	!
positive	0nd review : thank_you once again sammie_taylor .
positive	you were most helpful and patient in helping me out again .
positive	very easy and very fast .
positive	i played on 000 a few_times now and they have always been fair and allowed me to withdraw my money promptly .
positive	on top of doing everything they need to do as a casino 000 goes the extra_mile and always offers great promotions .
positive	ordered a selection of item and very pleased with stock available and how quickly items were dispatched and delivered .
positive	would definitely use them again 😊
positive	compared brands to multiple sites and there ' s nothing like this one !
positive	got a phone call to discuss my eligibility for a free boiler and the woman i spoke to talked me through everything and was very helpful .
positive	would definitely_recommend .
positive	massive_selection of supplements and best prices around .
positive	find it cheaper and they beat it , whats not to like .
positive	i ' ve already turned 0 friends on to this as their new source since i discovered it 0 months_ago .
positive	free_stuff on every order too
positive	only used once , but would certainly order from the company in future !
positive	speedy dispatch / delivery & was kept_informed of progress .
positive	the item was very competitively_priced & arrived as_described .
positive	this is a comprehensive travel policy that has the ability to cover you for whatever and wherever you are going at a great rate .
positive	moreover , the customer_service team are friendly , helpful and easy to get in touch with .
positive	so far , so good ... now all i have to do is start travelling with the knowledge that everything that might happen can be sorted out !
positive	using hostel_bookers is so easy - they even give you directions to the place !
positive	winning !!
positive	it is really easy to see the best deals and where each place is in town !
positive	sometimes i think the reviews are a bit harsh on places , but it is super helpful to read about the positives and negatives of each place !
positive	i will_definitely keep using this site !
positive	everything went_smoothly .
positive	we got the good quotes on the first day , amongst them was the perfect one .
positive	it was really a great help .
positive	this is an excellent company .
positive	i bought a htc from them about 0 months_ago but the previous_owner presumably did not pay his bills and my phone got blocked , a nightmare scenario after paying so much !
positive	after a couple of very reasonable discussions with kevin , the manager , phonehero kindly offered to replace my phone .
positive	i fully expected to have a long and hard fight but kevin was reasonable throughout our discussions and never brushed me off or was condescending .
positive	i would definitely shop here again knowing that i can trust this company !
positive	solid build_quality
positive	i recently_bought the finger mouse fan club tee .

positive	having to deal with the it side of website management can more often than not be an_absolute pain .
positive	however , 000 -_reg has made setting_up multiple domains , under one hosting_package a lot simpler than it has been elsewhere .
positive	found that regardless of my question , whether very simple such as transferring a domain or far more complex such as setting_up domain mapping and changing dns records , the customer_service was excellent at providing on topic information and relating it to my specific account as_opposed to just supplying generic help documents .
positive	it s really confortable to have the opportunity to book from your own country or previous destination and with few notice .
positive	it is really easy and quick to do it .
positive	fantastic service
positive	chosen purely_because they had by_far the best prices for the items i was looking for , the very quick delivery was an added_bonus .

positive	i dunno about repeat_business because it ' s not something i regularly need to keep repurchasing , but if i do , i know where to go !
positive	they have a good range of stock , all arrived within a few_days .

positive	the delivery was almost instantaneous and it worked .
positive	the checkout is easy enough to navigate , as is the website itself .
positive	it was also the cheapest price available anywhere for that game .
positive	i don ' t normally_write_reviews in fact this is my first .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
positive	they did exactly_what they said , they would do .
positive	i ordered a phone & headset bundle on the 0 / 00 / 00 and it arrived the morning of 00 / 00 / 00 i even got an_email with and hour delivery slot and the guy was here bang on time .

positive	i was interested in a pair of cdj ' s so had been on the website a few_times to check prices etc and i wanted to know info about the bstock .
positive	i rang the sales_team who instantly informed me of a better deal only available through the sales_team so i took them up on the deal .
positive	great lads in the sales_team , arrived next_day without a hitch , i am now smashing out mixes of nightlife 0 - happy days .
positive	no_complaints from me would not hesitate to use them again .

positive	great prices too !
positive	ordered yesterday and received the very next_day .
positive	0 hour eta .
positive	what else can you ask .... great service !!
positive	!
positive	no_problems , were interested in my feed_back
positive	i first found the website as they were selling some ski goggles that i wanted .
positive	however , the price was cheaper elsewhere .
positive	although they couldn ' t match the price , they did offer to reduce it and send the product out to me quicker_than the other website .
positive	the man who i spoke to on the phone was very helpful , and even recognised me when i called back later regarding my order .
positive	the item was received next_day , and shipping was included for free .
positive	i ordered the bose qc0 from rgbdirect as they showed up on google_shopping as being the cheapest .
positive	the website was not outstanding , however , they more_than made up for this with the price and the level of customer_service .
positive	i spoke to somebody on the phone who followed up on stock_levels and called back .
positive	he then called again to confirm the delivery date .
positive	overall , i was very impressed with the level of customer_service .
positive	i know a lot of people have got bad things to say about carphone_warehouse - i don ' t know if they have issues in terms of contract phones , but for ordering an offline phone they were pretty good .
positive	i ordered the iphone 0 on the first pre_- order day from the apple_store online with a delivery time of 0 - 0 weeks after the release_date of friday 00 september_0000 .
positive	however , due to some changing travel_plans , i cancelled the order .
positive	i then checked the carphone_warehouse website , which showed a delivery date of monday 00 september and the same price as the apple_store .
positive	i phoned to confirm this as it seemed too good to believe , and it turned_out to be true - i was however told that it may possibly be delivered on tuesday if there are any unexpected delays .
positive	to my surprise , the phone actually arrived on friday 00 september ( the release_date of the phone ).
positive	this was great - i managed to get the new iphone , on the day of release , without having to queue for hours at the apple_store !
positive	i ordered a shirt for a wedding from mytuxedo , and it was better value than anywhere_else i had seen .
positive	the site looked professional and was easy to use .
positive	everything was well integrated with their couriers so that i received updates from both_sides at the correct times .
positive	have used crucial before to order ram for my machine as theirs is one of the best rated .
positive	the selector on the site makes it much_easier to choose the correct product .
positive	i ordered yesterday_afternoon with the ( free ) standard delivery and got the item this morning .
positive	i love receiving firebox emails and going on the website .
positive	they have an interesting range of products , and they don ' t annoy me with a barrage of emails .
positive	no issues when i have ordered with them in the past .
positive	i love using the ba website and executive club .
positive	all of my flights are easy to manage , and with the app , mobile boarding and the ba credit_card , everything just seem to work seamlessly .
positive	i ' ve ordered many_times over the years from amazon .
positive	never had any_issues with payment , delivery or any other part of the service .

positive	( id had the fridge for years too )
positive	they then followed up to check we were happy .
positive	thankyou samsung .
positive	for me the service experience is more important than the actual transaction itself .
positive	dino ' s company has strong emphasis on customer_service and for this reason his organisation will keep on growing .
positive	unlike some shops in central_london were their pride and ego has chased a lot of customers away , dino ' s company is an exception .
positive	his entire staff is friendly , honest and again care about the customer .
positive	i recommend this company to anyone_looking to buy and sell a watch , it is the best .

positive	very cheap deals and arrived very quickly with superb packaging , would definately buy from here again
positive	having bought the engagement_ring for my fiancee in march_0000 from quality diamonds , we returned to purchcase both of our_wedding_rings from quality diamonds too .

positive	all in all , thoroughly_recommended and the whole team are great to work with .
positive	the interface of the site is quite intuitive - all needed fields are right at the place they have to be .
positive	data array is awesome - hundreds of hostels and good prices , really .
positive	more_than that , each hostel provide plenty of details about it - dozens of photos , all_kinds of rooms and exact prices , precise location and so on .
positive	integration with maps and guest reviews rise the level of usage experience .
positive	the only little thing that was a little uncomfortable - i couldn ' t find a way to look for specific hostel at the site , but sure that there are an option for it .
positive	we all know the impact of bulk sms marketing .
positive	it is by_far the best way to approach your target audience .
positive	i was dealing_with a bulk messaging company earlier but i started having problems with them regarding their rates as well as timings .
positive	i was being charged a lot more_than i was told .
positive	found voodoo sms as i was browsing .
positive	its been a year i have been doing_business with them and as their name suggests , they are magical !
positive	due to their advice and reasonable ( not ascending every other day ) charges i am having a great time with them .
positive	i have seen constant on - site improvement and hope to see more .
positive	keeping in touch internationally from mobiles was never affordable unless i got to know about inclusive international_calls .
positive	i have used digital calling_cards before and was enjoying cheap international_calls but then i came_across iic i tried it because free sounds better_than cheap and to my surprise its totally free .
positive	talking for free with my 00 inclusive minutes feels great .
positive	now i can stay connected to my friends with free international_calls from the uk .
positive	making free calls from mobiles is amazing when it is truly free .
positive	000 numbers has surprised me with their reliable follow me numbers services .
positive	i had to call my customers but i wasn ' t in the uk .
positive	000 numbers proved to be very handy as i got to hide my private number .
positive	they are cheap yet very reliable .
positive	i must_say that the service is amazing .
positive	i found it really easy and cheap to call my friends in scotland and australia .
positive	there is no more gibberish when making long_distance international_calls to your friends .
positive	i would suggest digital calling_cards to everyone who want to stay connected with friends without burdening their pockets .
positive	woot woot !
positive	i absolutely love this web_site .
positive	i came onto this website because a certain major supplement chain did not carry a product i wanted in the store .

positive	fantastic customer_service !
positive	of course after christmas we ' re all feeling a bit skint so i decided to sell my n00 and n00 to mazumba .
positive	i ' d looked around and they were offering the most money .
positive	i registered on the website which took a couple of minutes and they sent the paperwork through which arrived 0 days_later .

positive	very pleased and surprised at how easy it was !
positive	great customer_service from sammie h at parcel0go . com
positive	would highly_recommend very efficient fast services , products arrive in good condition and with excellent use by dates .
positive	also one of the cheapest sites around !
positive	i saved over £_00 on a year ’_s flea and worm treatment for my two cats ( by vets prescription ) which you think would slow things down , the items still arrived next_day after emailing my prescription straight after the order for my products .
positive	all you have to do is attach your order no and email your vet ’_s prescription to the address provided , and my products still arrived the next working day .
positive	also you have the opportunity to leave a comment or note with your order as in the past my items from other suppliers have been sent in a jiffy_bag and have arrived crushed , i asked for my items to be sent in a box to avoid this using the comments / notes box on the order form and that ’_s exactly_what they did .
positive	would not hesitate to recommend to anyone or to use again !
positive	i also had to put my cat with allergies back onto a prescription diet this order was also received the following working day by city_link less_than 00_hours after the order was placed !
positive	fantastic .

positive	very pleased with the service .
positive	very easy to use website - makes the act of sinning with a dirty takeaway even more effortless .
positive	no more fighting over who calls up and sends the order , you can simply pass round your laptop and add what you want .
positive	huge_variety of food and widely utilised by many of the takeaways so you can pretty_much get anything you want - from your standard pizzas to caribbean , sweets , and booze .

positive	excellent prices offered on beauty & perfume products , usually works out cheaper_than other_companies & offer free delivery as standard .
positive	only let_down is , it can take time for it to be delivered over however that cannot be helped due to the company being in guernsey & me being in london .
positive	other than that , excellent company & would recommend to everyone !
positive	a must visit website .
positive	i ' ve always had a good experience using hungryhouse .
positive	i can say anymore , other than , i will_continue to use them !

positive	website is easy to use , received email_updates plus i was kept_informed of the delivery date by phone .
positive	brilliant range of tyres too !
positive	ordered a phase 00 on the thursday and by friday it was sitting comfortably next to my big muff .
positive	absolutely fantastic , especially when you are able to track every_stage of your delivery through dpd ' s website .
positive	not forgetting they also send you a sms and email in the morning telling you the estimated time ( usually within an_hour_window ) they will be at your doorstep , allowing you to pop out of the house for a quick pint down the pub to dream of your new product before it arrives .
positive	of course every product i buy for my guitar will be done through guitarguitar .
positive	thanks folks
positive	these_guys are great , the webpage may not be really well_organised especially with those long lists of items but it ' s not too annoying .
positive	the prices are great for some products , e . g .
positive	things here may be cheaper somewhere_else but somewhere_else may be more_expensive .
positive	you just need to research your prices !
positive	but their delivery and dispatch times are terrific .
positive	i went via topcashback and as a first timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options available .
positive	and the prices were good too !
positive	it ' s so easy to use and you get paid for shopping !
positive	what more could you ask for ?
positive	i recommend topcashback to everyone !
positive	i did a lot of research before replacing a very dodgy cheap lamona dishwasher that had been unreliable for about a year .
positive	we decided on a £_000_+ neff after talking to a john_lewis salesman and reading which ?, however due to finances we had to lower our budget by £_000 .
positive	we had slightly low expectations vs the neff however we are both very pleased with the baumatic .
positive	beautifully quiet , due to the cutlery tray i can fit lots more in and everything comes out clean .
positive	it feels sturdy and well built .
positive	the negatives which i ' d already read about prior to buying were that it took quite a while to assemble and my husband got quite grumpy with the instructions and the trays can be wet post cycle , however importantly the plates are dry and once it ' s built those frustrations deminish !
positive	i ' d definitely_recommend for the price !
positive	information i wanted was very clear and easy to find - location , pictures , travel advice / directions from airport .
positive	simple process to find the best hostel
positive	i haven ' t ordered off your site before but the process was very quick and simple .
positive	i will_definitely be ordering again .
positive	never had a problem with this company have been using them for 00 months .
positive	the only problems were with my perscription when i first ordered and the company ways wonderful at helping me get everything sorted and even rushed through my order so i had lenses to go on my holiday with .
positive	i reccomend them to all my friends and family who wear lenses
positive	the bigboy bean_bag is a great accessory for any lounge !
positive	it ' s super comfy , super convenient and looks cool too !
positive	service from infrun was also top_notch , very prompt delivery and easy to use website .
positive	00 out of 00 !
positive	i stupidly lost my first pair of ray - ban wayfarers on holiday in ibiza ( after only four days of owning them ).
positive	needless to say i was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact i ' d have to shell out another £_000 to replace them .
positive	i decided to search the net to see if i could buy them any cheaper_than the full price i had initially spent in - store .
positive	after doing a quick google_search , i stumbled_across sunglassesshop . com .
positive	i was amazed at how much lower the prices were here than in the shops .
positive	i was a bit_dubious at first , but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little , i quickly realised i had nothing to worry_about !
positive	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for £_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!
positive	absolutely amazing service and amazing price , i have recommended to all of my friends and will_definitely be using this site again .
positive	( hopefully i won ' t lose this pair after four days though ...)
positive	it was unlocked within_00hours ..............
positive	thank_you so much friends !!
positive	!
positive	bought tickets to wireless for £_00 and very excited as rihannas only uk gig this year .
positive	doulbe0 tickets informed us of every_stage , from email letting us know payment details , a text_saying when tickets were dispatched and special delivery so that they definitley reached our flat .
positive	could not have asked for a better service .
positive	just got to enjoy the concert now :-)
positive	will use them again definitly !!!

positive	booked my appointment online , 00_mins later got a phone call to confirm tyre choice and size correct for make and model of car .
positive	gave me a 0 hour time_slot and who would be coming to fit my new tyres .
positive	frazer turned_up within the time_slot allocated and fitted my 0 new front_tyres in about 00_mins ( and it was freezing outside ).
positive	took 0 minutes to go through paperwork to say the job was complete , paid easily by card and that was it .
positive	i would definitely_recommend tyres on the drive to all my friends and family as they were reasonable priced and their service is second to none .
positive	thank_you and will see you again n the not too distant_future for my back tyres ....
positive	just do the shopping on your own .
positive	they are , on average , 00 - 00_% cheaper_than anyone_else .
positive	shipping is fairly expensive , but it ' s outweighed by the free_samples and gifts .
positive	bought some supplements at 00_%_off , then got 0 shaker_bottles and 0 samples for just . 00 cents extra .
positive	i think it ' s definitely worth the cost of a bit more shipping .
positive	got my pre order key 0 days early along with saving £_00
positive	the pc arrived much faster_than i anticipated at an excellent price , everything was good until my graphics_card was showing major artifacts , i contacted cyberpower and they responded almost_instantly ( email ) and sent dpd the next_day to pick_up the card then the day after i had a new card , very quick service .
positive	the new card i received was not working or even being detected it was brand_new though still in box , so i contacted cyberpower again , they responded almost_instantly again and suggested to send the pc back to see if something else was the problem .
positive	dpd came the next_day and then took the pc , the day after to my horror i get an_email_saying that the motherboard was damaged with pictures to prove it , i got angry because i was adamant that i had not damaged the motherboard and blamed them .
positive	cyberpower were brilliant no matter how annoyed or angry i got they dealt_with me professionally and calmly , they said that i could either wait to see if msi repair the motherboard or buy a new one from cyberpower and if the msi one gets repaired i ' ll be refunded .
positive	i demanded a full_refund but i was denied ( wouldn ' t blame them ) i gave in and bought a new motherboard then got a call saying that they would send my pc the next_day ( saturday ) it arrived working perfectly with the same graphics_card that wasn ' t even being detected before , so i was blaming cyberpower for something that they hadn ' t even done but i ' m pretty sure i cant of broken it or maybe i did , nonetheless few_days_later i got an_email_saying that msi repaired the motherboard and i will be refunded for the motherboard , ended_up with a better motherboard for free .
positive	unfortunately that graphics_card also artifacted not cyberpowers fault it was still in the box brand_new , again got a replacement within 0 or 0 days but then that card even artifacted but no where near as bad , i wanted perfection though so they suggested a nvidia card and now i ' m going for a gtx_000 for a bit more money .
positive	cant recommend cyberpower enough they sent me 0 free games for the inconvenience , with great service even after buying the product .
positive	i didn ' t even pay for professional wiring and they done it for free .
positive	thank_you chris and gulam for putting up with me .
positive	this electronics store seems to have everything and whats more is that nearly everything is always in stock too .
positive	amazing range of awesome products .
positive	urban_industry is my first stop for some new threads and kicks .
positive	having been nearly ripped_off by a local car sales office , i found these at this great price .
positive	have used kwik_fit before and will have no_hesitation using again & if you ' re any where in the anglia region jay who fitted my tires is a decent chap .
positive	high_quality products at reasonable prices a delivery service that is second to none
positive	in the last_year i ' ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
positive	only one issue with pricing but that was a fault i had caused to the phone .
positive	other than that happily_recommend their service .
positive	ordered my lens on the thursday and it was delivered on the monday .
positive	it was even quite exciting to see where my lens was in the world at various times using their tracking_system .
positive	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything went well and will be ordering again soon .
positive	eav made my shopping_experience extremely easy and provided me with lots of advice .
positive	order turned_up fast .
positive	thanks
positive	i recently was on a mission to find tickets florence + machine concert at the o0 in december . tickets are sold out for the gig and i spent a while looking at tickets on websites of secondary ticket agents ... who were charging an ' arm and leg ' for the tickets and sometimes over £_00 of the face_value .
positive	i booked tickets through 00tickets . com even_though i had not purchased any tickets before .
positive	the price was very reasonable and at centre stage .
positive	which was what i was looking for .
positive	i received the tickets in 00 days ( a month before the concert ) without any trouble .
positive	i ' d recommend 00tickets to anyone that is looking for a reliable service and a fair price .
positive	cheers !
positive	speedy payment , easy to use site .
positive	would be nice if they had an i - phone app .
positive	it ' s very easy to make a booking here .
positive	and the reviews , absolutely trustworthy .
positive	i am shopping to aldi regularily and i think it is an excellent company .
positive	finished the mind_blowing range you can find at tesco where you end up buying more_than you need .
positive	with aldi , you go straight to the point , and the selection of product you find is tasty enough for me !
positive	well_done !
positive	good company , good honests and hard working people , and extremely_helpful .
positive	i ordered many_times for my jewellery for my lip piercing , and my nipples , and the quality has always been there .
positive	on top of that , i got it wrong a couple of times ( i am nopt very good with sizes ..) and they never created troubles or anything .
positive	i could simply return my package , have a full_refund , or an exchange on one_occasion .
positive	i believe they actually make the body jewellery ( handy for special sizes !)
positive	including the bioflex jewellery that they created , and from their advice for my lip piercing , i gathered that they are also piercers more into the passion for what they do and not here to make quick money .
positive	often , i receive free extra jewellery with my order !
positive	nice to know there are still some good people out there !

positive	using the cv_store was a serious wake_up call that my cv was poor and i was making glaring errors .
positive	cv_store is very quick on giving feedback and creating a new look .
positive	my cv is now 000x better_than before - and the best feedback ?
positive	many recruiters have told me that my cv was what got me the interview or that it was extremely well_presented and crafted .
positive	well worth the money .
positive	the reason i chose double 0 tickets is because you can pick the seats and you know where about you will be sitting in the arena .
positive	i would find where i wanted to sit on the arena plan and then look at the prices for the seats and work out if i wanted them .
positive	i bought tickets from double 0 tickets in may 0000 for backstreet boys at the 00 arena in london , they have been my favourite band since i was 0 years old .
positive	i looked on all ticket brokers as i wanted front_row seats and didn ' t want to sit anywhere_else .
positive	double 0 tickets where the only company to have front_row tickets for this event and they where sold in a pair , which was great as i needed 0 tickets .
positive	the tickets arrived earlier_than i expected the seat where great and i had a amazing time .
positive	in 0000 i new pink was coming to the 00 arena in london and i wanted good seats again so i went_onto double 0 tickets and bought tickets in the vip area theses seats where amazing i got to see everything throughout the performance no matter where about pink was on the stage or up in the air lol .
positive	i have recently_bought tickets again to see pink at the 00 arena in april_0000 from double 0 tickets again good seats a great price and i cant_wait for the 00th_april .
positive	my tickets are already here and they tell me what area and row i will be sitting in , so camera at the ready .
positive	i would defiantly recommend double 0 tickets and whenever someone i want to see is on tour i will be using double 0 tickets every time .
positive	booked online , but my local_branch did not have them ready in stock , so told would take two days to arrive .
positive	i phoned other centers nearby and luckily one of them had the tyres in stock .
positive	phoned them , got fitted ... happy !!
positive	!
positive	whether your taking clients , the lads or the wife , the hospitality package offered by hospitality_finder is exactly_what you need for an enjoyable day .
positive	i have used them many_times for all types of events , but most recently , we attended the gold cup at the cheltenham festival .
positive	for a reasonable cost , we recieved indoor reserved seating , seconds away from the betting ring and track , a 0 course_meal , plus afternoon_tea and all the drink you could want .
positive	the waitresses were on top form and really created some banter .
positive	i took a mixture of clients and friends to the event and enjoyed the fact that it was an atmosphere relaxing enough that everyone could enjoy themselves , but also a great environment for networking and business .
positive	i would recommend this site to everyone !
positive	would definitely buy from this company again .
positive	had my iphone 0 screen replaced , they did an excellent job and now my phone looks_like new again !
positive	brilliant work !!
positive	!
positive	i ordered a nikon_d0000 for £_000 .
positive	it is a much_better price than anywhere_else i found in the uk or on - line .
positive	delivery was quoted at around six days , but it only took three via dhl where the order tracking was very good .
positive	my bank initially refused payment by debit_card - so i had to call them to pr - authorise the transaction .
positive	was surprised when i found out the goods were being shipped from spain , but they came through on time and as expected - and still cheaper_than i could find elsewhere .
positive	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .
positive	product was better_than described , will shop there again .
positive	highly_recommend !!
positive	!
positive	you can not beat free products , price beating deals , and the comfort of knowing my personal information is safe !
positive	i have all my friends switching to this site because they fall in love with keeping there wallets full and there free supplement cups filled with name brand supplements !
positive	thank_you sw !

positive	we received our painting on schedule , just in time for christmas .
positive	it was a gift for my hubby who loved it .
positive	the portrait is of very high_quality and the price was very reasonable for a portrait of such size and complexity ( many background details ).
positive	painting arrived in a strong tube and was well_packaged .
positive	the tracking_number was sent to us as soon as the portrait left their facility so we could track it online and it was then delivered to out doorstep .
positive	my only concern is that we don ' t have enough wall space for all the art that we would like to purchase !
positive	well_done 0st art !
positive	on my first order i had some questions about the product i was interested in : the staff emailed me back within a few hours with all the info i needed and explained their return_policy in detail in case i wanted to change my mind after receiving my order .
positive	i was so impressed that even_though what i wanted was available for a slightly lower_price elsewhere i didn ' t mind paying webtogs a few extra quid !
positive	also , they were still_awaiting new stock at the moment i placed my order , so they gave me an expected delivery time of about three_weeks - as it turned_out , the parcel arrived only six days_later ... and there was no need to return it !
positive	i ' ll definitely order from them again and will recommend to anyone look to buy outdoor_gear .
positive	the product that i ordered ( clarisonic refreshing cleanser ) was out of stock due to a uk shortage , so the super nice sales_rep ( abi ) from the company apologised straight_away and offered me an_alternative product .
positive	when i chose to wait_until the cleanser that i wanted was back in stock , abi sent me a really generous amount of trial size bottles of the product to keep me going whilst i waited !
positive	when the cleanser came back in stock and i missed the delivery and then was too poorly to collect the delivery from the post_office , so that it was sent back to currentbody , abi arranged to have it re - sent to me free of charge !
positive	excellent and really kind service !!
positive	i will_definitely be ordering from them again !
positive	!
positive	really happy how easy it is to find an hotel ... great prices ...
positive	i think it is brilliant that you can choose the pay later option !
positive	the customer_service at hellocanvas is amazing !
positive	they are so attentive and bend_over backwards to help !
positive	the products are super quality and are delivered quickly and the canvas comes really well_packed to make sue it arrives in perfect_condition .
positive	i would recommend to all and i will be back for another canvas soon !

positive	great site .
positive	just received my hugo boss prescription_sunglasses and i think its like a dream_come true , suit perfect on my face and the best quality i ever had in my life .. thanks select_specs !!!
positive	i will surely ship for more ...
positive	hostelbookers were great , cheaper_than hostelworld and without any extra fees .
positive	the reviews matched the properties well and i ' m already looking for my next accommodation through them .
positive	you should definitely give them a go .
positive	i ' ve been looking for a good , but cheap dvd writer for my desktop since my last one packed up , and i didn ' t need a blu - ray_player as i don ' t use my desktop for that .
positive	i found this lg after googling for a while and ebuyer had the best price and free delivery too as a special , which made it even better .
positive	i was genuinely surprised that something under £_00 would be free delivery , never mind £_00 . 00 !
positive	great experience , cheers !
positive	i ' ve used bc for ordering car and bike tyres .
positive	the pricees for car tyres are fantastic , and thats even without considering the fitting cost is included .
positive	nice to see more premier garages appearing too .
positive	the motorbike tyre was the best price i could find , and even with delivery cost was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
positive	easy to use .
positive	even when booking for the same day .
positive	it just works

positive	in depth descriptions of all the products is very helpful , dispatch is fast and dpd are great at getting you your stuff on time .
positive	will certainly use them again .
positive	needed a few large items shipped over from out the eu
positive	but i needed them asap
positive	so amazon contacted me to get my items delivered to my home
positive	got my items delivered the day before i needed them
positive	excellent customer_services
positive	having broke my last ipad i decided that i should get a case to help protect it .
positive	most places i looked on google had mention of snugg and good reviews so i decided o try one of there cases .
positive	the ipad case was delivered quicker_than the website said and the case is fantastic .
positive	i doubt my ipad will be breaking again any time soon with this case !
positive	i have just ordered another one for my nanna and will be using snugg again in the future .
positive	hostelbookers has a good collection of available places to stay , and an excellent database of reviews , which is very helpful for a traveller trying to find the best place to stay .
positive	in addition , the website design is simple but informative , allowing a person to quickly find the information one is looking for .
positive	great service .
positive	it the 0st time iv used parcel0go and what a great service .

positive	00 out of 00 .
positive	probably the only company where you can find smith fuel v0 goggle range .
positive	really pleased with dispatch options .
positive	i recently_bought valkyrie profile 0 for the ps0 and it came very quickly !
positive	the estimate on amazon was quite long but one of the staff_members send me an e_- mail saying to ignore it and they ' ll send it via_royal_mail 00 , and it arrived two days_later .
positive	very good condition , and it works_perfectly , even_though i was worried there would be some problems as my ps0 is quite old now !
positive	will_definitely buy from them again !
positive	i really like how fast they deliver .
positive	you can track the progress of your delivery via the e_- mail you receive with parcel number and the tracking website is very clear .
positive	it ' s also very useful when you ' ve missed the delivery that either they leave a calling_card to say where they have put the parcel safely or that you can go on the website and arrange a new delivery date .
positive	i would certainly use the service for myself , as the company i ordered the parcels from have been using this .
positive	i also really liked that the delivery drivers were friendly and to the point .
positive	again .. brought a code from these_guys / gals and was instant and legit .
positive	bf0_premium for £_00 instead of £_00 . 00 bargain !
positive	00 / 00

positive	i have purchased a number of items from alpkit and i have always been very happy with the price , speed of postage and after sales service .
positive	i would recommend their down jackets to anyone , i have had years of service out of mine and it has lasted really well .
positive	i also own a head torch which in my opinion cannot be_beaten at the price point .
positive	to top it all off they offer free postage , not really sure how they do it for the price .
positive	i purchased a pair of native boots from urban_industry .
positive	the price was the cheapest i could find on the web and they were offering free tracked delivery .
positive	the boots turned_up 0 days after ordering and were very well_packed .
positive	i can ' t fault the service and price , i would definitely order from them again and i would recommend them to others based on this experience .
positive	i have used dragonspecs twice already and their service / quality has been spotless .
positive	bought my first pair of glasses a couple of years_ago and contacted them again this year as i couldn ' t find my old order details .
positive	dragonspecs got back to me within 0 days and once i sent in my old glasses for reglazing ( which they normally don ' t do , but very kindly did it for me on this occasion ), i got my glasses back within a week and was kept_updated by alex from dragonspecs at all times .
positive	i haved used several other_websites and opticians before i used dragonspecs and have to say that dragonspecs has been outstanding in responding to queries than any of the other_websites / opticians plus you pay a fraction of what you would normally pay if you place the same order with one of the major high_street opticians .
positive	would definitely_recommend them !
positive	there are so many different brands and styles of products to choose from for all ages and from serious to quirky !
positive	i have bought several presents for friends ... and some for myself !
positive	:)
positive	i have had really good service which is a credit to the company they were very responsive to an_email i sent with a query .
positive	my items came really well_packaged , which really is a bonus as it prevents any damage in the post !
positive	i ' m very happy all_round and will_definitely shop with campus_gifts again and recommend you take a look too !
positive	:)
positive	our pre_- booked accommodation with a different company let us down with 00 days to go until we flew to mallorca with our two year_old_daughter .
positive	we found the late deals section on james_villas and were so happy to find that we could book an entire villa with private pool for much less_than we had been originally paying for an apartment with shared pool .
positive	we did book over the phone , as it was last_minute and we had a few questions , but this was all dealt_with by the advisors with friendly efficiency .
positive	confirmation , info sheets and documents were in my email inbox within half an_hour .
positive	our accommodation was clean , well equipped , and exactly as_described .
positive	we found it first time of trying , using the extremely accurate driving directions emailed by the advisor .
positive	the resort rep was very friendly and helpful when we contacted her for some info .
positive	in summary , a beautiful villa , managed by a fantastic company , and outstanding value for money ( especially when booked last_minute !)
positive	- highly_recommended .
positive	i chose this company because they offered the best value for money to buy back the brazilian currency i had .
positive	i used a comparison website to search for potential companies and covent_garden fx came out on top .
positive	they were very fast and changed my money for pound sterling almost_instantly .
positive	one piece of advice : the business is located at the other side of covent_garden from where google_maps says it is located .
positive	i ' ve booked a number of hostel through hostelbookers and i ' ve never had any_problems with them .
positive	i also find their prices are almost always cheaper_than hostelworld ' s .

positive	extremely happy with the over all service , staff are friendly and they offer you the best prices for your laptops !
positive	i normally used booking . com to find hostels but on the recommendation of a friend i used hostelbookers . com and cannot_believe_how awesome it is !
positive	their service is top - notch and the booking process through them is very easy to get the hang of .
positive	their listing functions provide practical and cheap options which is great for me because i hardly need a 0 - star treatment for a 0 - 0 night stay .
positive	it really is the go - to booking service when out and about !
positive	great radiator delivered at a great price - really impressed with the website , range and prices .
positive	thanks very much , oli

positive	recommended .
positive	i chose worktop_express based on their reviews and i wasn ' t disappointed .
positive	the product was delivered exactly when they said they would by 0 very helpful guys .
positive	on the phone the customer_service was great , they answered my numerous questions .
positive	the worktop itself is beautiful - the staves are thick and the quality of the finish is excellent .
positive	the fitters had no problem in putting it in .
positive	price smashed everything else i saw - specifically homebase and b_& q , but also ikea .
positive	the quality is also far better_than the samples i saw of these 0 .
positive	worktops do require complete oiling , but worth doing to pick your own finish .
positive	000_% recommended - thank_you !
positive	thoroughly
positive	putting time and effort into picking the right product and supplier will always pay off in the end .
positive	we purchased our new dishwasher from appliance planet after_reading great reviews on both the appliance and the supplier ’_s website .
positive	the dishwasher was rated the best integrated dishwasher on which ?
positive	and was fantastic value for money at the £_000 mark .
positive	i initially went to the website for price , but it was the customer_service and ease of use purchase that sealed it for me .
positive	once i was on the website , the range of products nearly got me to change my mind but i stuck with my original choice .
positive	the website was clear and very simple to use .
positive	the search_functionality on the website was intuitive and most_importantly the prices were incredibly competitive .
positive	the customer_service over the phone was fantastic , my call was quickly answered and they were very helpful and knowledgeable about the product – able to answer questions on spec and discuss delivery logistics with authority – and in fact i finally placed the order over the phone .
positive	there was no upselling or extended_warranty annoyingness of calling currys - or another online_retailer who called me back after a purchase to ask me if i wanted a longer guarantee - just clear impartial_advice .
positive	the delivery process was efficient and reliable – they would even do a free saturday delivery if we needed ; they called me to confirm delivery dates and were very flexible .
positive	i chose delivery for a date quite a long time in_advance and they were able to assist .
positive	i received a text_message reminding me of the order arrival and the delivery guys were really helpful and very accommodating on quite a tough delivery .
positive	the dishwasher , siemens sn00m000gb , itself is brilliant .
positive	the kitchen fitters were able to install it quickly and easily .
positive	the machine takes a large load for it size .
positive	the clean is fantastic every time , even dried on cereal comes off .
positive	we adjusted the top racks for our big plates which was thankfully easy to do – our last machine didn ’ t have that functionality .
positive	oddly it doesn ’ t dry our tupperware very well – but this is my only complaint to date !
positive	to sum up i would thoroughly_recommend the website and will be buying any appliances through them in future .
positive	thanks guys !

positive	=)
positive	i contacted ttb to arrange a static_ip_address , which was done with no_fuss and was working before i ' d finished the chat .
positive	i then asked for a ptr record to be setup , and was although i was passed over to someone_else for that to happen , he read over the chat , confirmed the ip_address and the hostname , and arranged the ptr setup there and then .
positive	very helpful , and i thank the two individuals concerned for their time and efforts .

positive	it ' s an awesome site which makes it really easy to find and book_hostels online .

positive	which i have to add ..... is also awesome =).
positive	the site is really easy to use , being_able to look at the room type available without having to click on the hostel every time is a bonus for me , as is being_able to sort it by price ( either dorm or private ).

positive	if i was referring anyone to buy from a record store it would easily be juno records !
positive	its not just records that they sell , they cover equipment , cd ' s , downloads , clothing , record players amongst others but it is one thing for a shop to have the goods and its another to treat there customers well and juno records certainly does just that , with great prices , quick shipping and great quality items juno records is the only record store in my opinion !

positive	dropped into stoneacre on wheatley hall road with the intention of just having a look around when after about 00 / 00_minutes was greeted buy a salesman ( tony illudge ).
positive	usually i try to avoid the salesman until i need to actually speak to one , however i found tony ' s customer_service brilliant , very direct talked no nonsense and told me all i needed to know , talking to him was like talking to a guy in the street and not an overbearing salesman like at perry ' s were i had been previous and felt the need to run away after 0 minutes which was refreshing .
positive	all in all from the original viewing of the car , test_drive and finance meeting to picking it up it only took three days , would of been less if i had been able to get to the dealers earlier on in the days instead of 0 hour before closure .
positive	tony kept me updated_throughout the whole_process .

positive	activities - dance party , sms treasure_hunt and meal .
positive	these were all excellent and exactly_what we had been told ( no little nasty suprises ) and again all very central around the hotel .
positive	overall , even_though my friend dealt_with funktion_events , i must_admit that they did everything we asked for at a great price .
positive	use this company if you want no hassle and top quality !
positive	loved the cocktail_making class which was part of my friends hen_party .
positive	everyone enjoyed it and had plenty of cocktails to drink plus food .
positive	thanks and will be recommending
positive	i ordered 0 pairs of contact_lenses as it was the first time i had used lenstore .
positive	i was pleased with the very quick delivery , and as far as i can tell the lenses are the same as what i usually get from my opticians , but significantly_cheaper .
positive	i ' ll be ordering more !
positive	if your fone brakes id send it to bozowi i sent mine and got my money straight_away was very pleased with the service i received
positive	very happy with wiggle .
positive	have used you guys a couple of times now and can ' t speak highly_enough of your customer_service .
positive	great prices , easy to navigate website , kept me up to date with my speedy_delivery and some haribo in the box as well !
positive	couldn ' t ask for a better company .
positive	thank_you .
positive	i ' ve ordered quite a few things from very and i ' ve never had any troubles with any aspect of them .
positive	delivery is always very fast and p_& p charges are always fair .
positive	i love wowchers !
positive	they have so many different things on offer there ' s something for everybody and the prices are always brilliant !
positive	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
positive	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .
positive	the money was transferred into my account a few_days after i posted them the phone - easy_peasy .
positive	great company , with a superb service !
positive	a rare find these days .
positive	a pleasure .
positive	requested a boiler estimate first thing friday_morning and by 0pm the same day my old boiler had disappeared and a brand_new one installed .
positive	nick quilter provided a brilliant service and is clearly an expert in his trade .
positive	i will happily use pimlico and nick again for big jobs like this .
positive	they may not be the cheapest but some things are worth spending a bit more money on for that extra quality .
positive	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
positive	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .
positive	would recommend !
positive	i had been looking for a pair of prada sunglasses for my girlfriend for weeks only to find blaze had them instock .
positive	i called the number on the site and was pleasently suprised to speak to someone so knowledgable and helpful .
positive	the sunglasses were sent to me with free next_day delivery in time for my girlfriends_birthday .
positive	blaze made purchasing online easy as i am not familiar with purchasing through the internet .
positive	will_definitely_recommend to all my friends and family .
positive	been buying from myprotein for a few_years now .
positive	love the products and they never dissapoint .
positive	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
positive	!
positive	i recieced email_updates_throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
positive	really pleased with my purchase as i ' ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !
positive	thanks for a really efficient service , highly_recommended .
positive	sainsbury ' s prices are very reasonable , and their ' basics ' range has the same standards of quality as their normal products , but they have more relaxed rules on size and shape .
positive	if they do not have something that you ordered in stock , they are very sensible about what they give you as a replacement .
positive	should you still not be satisfied , they refund you the item and sometimes even let you keep it .
positive	the website is very helpful , as you can not only sort through all the categories , but you can sort through all the different categories based upon what is on offer , so you can save a lot of money !
positive	for the entire duration of my time with t - mobile they have sought to resolve each and every issue i have ever had .
positive	now don ' t let this fool you into thinking that there are lots of problems with them , every company has a few kinks .
positive	the first problem i had was a lack of signal - a month later the merger with orange was announced , and soon after i was able to use orange signal too .
positive	when i found a cheaper deal with o0 , t - mobile not only offered me a deal that was far better_than the one i had found , but also reduced their price for new customers so as not to be_beaten .
positive	they have incredibly friendly staff , very reasonably prices , and the booster_packs are brilliant .
positive	overall , this is the best phone network i have been with , and i ' ve been with all the major ones in my time .
positive	mazuma offered a great price for my phone , got the pre_- paid envelope out to me in no time , processed the phone almost_immediately after receiving it and paid me the next_day .
positive	excellent =)
positive	the team at cambridge printing . com are more_than 0_stars in our opinion .
positive	our quotes come back within minutes and are always the most competitive , they are very conscientious regarding our delivery dates and times as we often need things turned round ridiculously fast or delivered to random hotels !
positive	they have done special printing for us of one off things things we ' ve needed like posters or intricate pop ups , and sometimes they even deliver to us by cycle courier in the snow and rain .
positive	we ' d never go anywhere_else for our printing .
positive	well_done cambridge , you ' re the best :))))

positive	hostelbookers is an extremely easy website to use , once you ' ve looked up your location you can arrange the given accommodation into ' prices : low to high ' etc which is very helpful if , like me , you ' re on a budget and want to try and find the best value for money .
positive	you can then select the amount of nights , press book , pay a deposit to hostelbookers and that ' s it !
positive	super easy :) i ' ve used them a few_times now and will always come straight back and hopefully my run of successful bookings will_continue .
positive	if its not the cheapest place to find your supplement_needs , they will match your price .
positive	best part they have anything you could ever need

positive	i was very happy with the selection and great deals .
positive	had reservations_about ordering tickets with " double 0 tickets " as they were not recommended by the festival organisers .

positive	but i must_say i have no_complaints .
positive	my wristband arrived today by secure post and i can ' t wait to go .
positive	many_thanks .

positive	very undecided if home learning would be for me .

positive	when the product didn ' t arrive due to postal issues , they immediately sent out another which arrived rapidly .
positive	i ' ve been very impressed

positive	i have used hostelbookers several_times and i was very satisfied all the time .
positive	you can choose the option that suits you the best - price , location , equipment and so on .
positive	i have used hostelbookers during my trips in marocco , norway , germany , switzerland and italy .
positive	i hope i will visit another places as well using hostelbookers , because i love traveling :) my best experience has been in naples where we stayed in cozy hostel sharing the room with other 0 people and the owners made for as a pasta party in the evening .
positive	they were very helpful and nice people .
positive	my funniest experience has been in bergen , norway , where we shared the room with other 00 people .
positive	acutually it was not a room , but a really big hall !
positive	:) i hope everybody has at_least as unforgottable experiences as me .
positive	we hired a nissan qashqai for 0 days during our trip to iceland .
