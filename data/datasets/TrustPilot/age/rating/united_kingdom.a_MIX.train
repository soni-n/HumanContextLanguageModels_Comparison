neutral	:( seats were fine for a 0 hour 00 min flight and arrived 00_mins early .
negative	it almost seems like they hope if they ignore customers or make it difficult to contact them that anyone who complains will give up and put it down to experience , but i am not willing to do this on principle so i will keep contacting them until i get a satisfactory reply .
neutral	if you have a problem , forget it .
negative	we meet a grumpy man , wonder he has power or not , but he speak very quickly and we can ' t hear at the first time .
neutral	the only_gripe i would seek to voice is that , out of maybe 00 orders in the past_year or so , on 0 of them i ' ve been sent the wrong_size or the wrong_colour , or else the item was never in stock in the first place and i ' ve ended_up having my order cancelled .
positive	a great offering and brilliant way to get_rid of those old_phones !!

positive	the service was excellent and i got a great deal on a beautiful trilogy ring .
positive	great department stores with fabulous foodhalls in those i have visited .
neutral	as i stated the price was good but the delivery time was too long .
positive	delivery was free but meant you could not say when exactly ( another £_00 on a £_000 desk did not seem worth it ).
neutral	well i am here to testify that dhgate is a relatively safe_place to trade provided you go in with your eyes open , exercise caution and shop wisely .
negative	it was coming up to my partners_birthday and he seemed to really like my phone so i asked him if he would like one , he said yes so we went direct to tmobile in - store to get his phone , this was not an issue , credit check went through swimmingly and was handed another new sony_xperia z and my partner was happy , a few_days_later my handset ( from cpwh ) started_playing up , the internet wouldn ' t load and phone_calls became muffled , i then phoned carphone_warehouse in order to report the fault and was told it was a sim error and to call tmobile customer_service .
neutral	ebay and paypal tend to sort_out any disputes reasonably , eventually , but their customer support is difficult to navigate , and can be very frustrating .
neutral	wasn ' t impressed with how customer_service responded when there was a problem with my order ( damaged on arrival ).
positive	the goods were delivered very quickly and tracked by royal_mail who texted and e . mailed me to state when they would deliver .

negative	apart_from making very little sense i ' assume ' my glasses will not be delivered until the 00th .
negative	i do not rate this company in terms of efficiency but cannot , as yet , comment on their product .
neutral	having_read the reviews on this site , all i can say is that if your i - phone is locked to softbank of japan do not expect a fast turn_around .
neutral	i don_'_t care what their supplier say '_s i want the correct liner or my money back .
negative	00 days_later a claim form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
neutral	they do have some nice offers , especially easy pay - but i think the shipping charges for every_single item are ridiculous and also 0 quid per item is quite steep .

neutral	and this was declined which i consider unfortunate .
positive	recommend .
neutral	i applied to cash genie and they gave me £_000 , which i then paid off . i applied to them about a week_later asking for £_000 as unexpected direct_debits made my bank overdrawn .
positive	would recommend .
positive	i particularly_liked the fact that as well as journey durations there is a little map showing trains taking alternative routes to toulouse to help decide which train to take .
positive	used transglobal services for the tenth time in recent times and once again the whole_experience was superb well_done to everyone getting large parcels to usa is so simple with this company
neutral	a lot of stress caused , hassle and then when sorted ( by me ) no apology or follow_up by company , i had to ring back to check .
positive	this was the best family holiday we have ever had .
neutral	i managed to get it working and am successfully communicating with my wifiplug , but not before spending about 00_hours reverse - engineering the sample code and java library ( complete with comments in * chinese *) given to actually glean some useful_information .

neutral	after price comparing i ' d use comet .

neutral	excellent customer_service sail and ski . shame for a company that provide decent products at a reasonable_price you have forgotten about the importance of customer care !
positive	nice_touch on including some free plectrums !
positive	absolute first_class service in every_aspect , would recommend them each & every day .
negative	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn ' t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
neutral	i have looked again at the website and i can '_t find anywhere that indicates the size of order to quailfy for free_p_&_p .
neutral	they seem to be more of a promoter now than a seller , most items i look at are sold by third parties , if i wanted that , i ' d be on ebay .
neutral	however seeing them in person later that night , they were a lot smaller_than i expected and was not how it was " as pictured " as they make out on the site .
negative	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth £_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is £_000 they new price is now £_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the £_000 .
positive	what more could you ask for ?
neutral	transfer - as above , plus driver unfriendly and spoke very little english .
negative	paid by debit_card .
positive	the flowers are very realistic and superb quality .

negative	they are still selling rooms on their website for much_higher prices than we paid . now we don_'_t have a hotel in glasgow because there is nothing available except for super hyper high prices because of the commonwealth games being on .
positive	top quality products and good prices cant go_wrong always at the end of the phone or message to answer any_questions quick reliable delivery to :)
positive	we have never had any_issues with the villas we have rented , always found them to be first_class .
neutral	i believe the couriers get paid per parcel delivered , so it benefits them to pretend to deliver and then not , only to try again and get paid again .
positive	i use interlink on a daily_basis and have to say that they have been impeccable since i ' ve been with them ( especially compared to the nightmare that was dhl who i used before ).
negative	never answer the phone - didn ' t have the stock .
positive	forsinkelse på min vare . sender en mail - bum bum inder jeg får set mig om , så er der svar og en løsning på mit problem .
negative	at this point
neutral	primark has great prices but their sizing leaves a lot to be desired .
negative	customer service manager is poorly trained & dosent understand customer service , offered to pop round with a customer return product to replace the one i ' d ordered and refund £ 0 . nah , thanks , but . i ordered new & kind of thats what i ' d like .
neutral	the online my dashboard status showed my order as ' processing ' which continued till after the battery had been delivered next_day , no email was sent confirming delivery or tracking available as mentioned in the delivery information of the web_page , although i received a mobile text stating a delivery eta while the battery was actually being delivered .
neutral	i emailed again saying this is getting ridiculous , i '_ve already paid for the goods i just want to pay for delivery !!!
negative	another complaint - sent a email to feedback_@ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
neutral	the experience for customers reviewing our service is generally great , and easy to use , and it ' s been helpful for potential_customers to be able to read previous customers ' reviews of our company .
negative	i paid £_000 + for what i thought would be 0 x £_00 . 00 face_value tickets only to receive 0 x £_00 . 00 tickets .

negative	i am furious at this point but i stayed composed .

positive	made it on monday , confirmed posted on tuesday . already at home when we arrived back from spain on thursday . ready for my friend when i next met up with her .
negative	as we were having issues getting scottish_power to take over ( meter numbers were not correctly registered to us ) we were sticking with first in the meantime .
positive	and boy did my first purchase with them pay off .
negative	sent all three items back within four days of receiving them after fifteen minutes on a high rate phone_call i got all the information i required .
neutral	went back to my basket about 0 / 0mins later and my bags had been sold to someone_else it seems !
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	a small thing that should have been picked_up on the pre_- delivery inspection .
negative	this company needs shutting down if all they do is rip people off .

neutral	ordered cash and currency card .
neutral	condition - new or used
negative	haha , more fool me .
neutral	delivery was fast .
positive	regular_updates and they were kind enough to hold my items when my kitchen plans were delayed .
negative	in other words i do not have any rights !!
neutral	after negative_review i ' ve been contacted quickly and problem has been resolved .
neutral	when the call was eventually picked_up i had to wait for the operator to find out about my claim , and when he had found out i was put on hold for 00_minutes .

neutral	i must add they were very apologetic .
positive	excellent all_round , well_packaged and very fast delivery
positive	they have been consistently good value in toner costs ( and i do compare prices !)
negative	after 0 weeks has elapsed from the beginning of your complaint , you should contact ofgem with all available evidence .
negative	send this for security was the responce .
neutral	my wife is a pretty good person to distinguish really good sites from the rest - she struggled to get through the process - unfortunately this site belongs in the pack as it is a bit clunky .
negative	rang twice and told it was going out today .
neutral	but they never really impress me with anything , no do they disappoint .
negative	having worked for a company for over 0 years who use citylink and send many parcels through them daily - i have never had so many incidents causing so much stress and problems from one company .
neutral	in the end i ended_up asking an ebay seller who was selling the same_thing !
neutral	as there was no scratches at all on either the screen or bodywork i was a bit disappointed .
positive	brilliant !
negative	i got an_email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn ' t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
positive	excellent value for money too .
neutral	they always blamed my computer and my router , so always prepare 0 computers and connect them directly .
neutral	i ordered two of these for a trip to the us
neutral	if they do , then i buy on viagogo - if not , then i don_'_t .
negative	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
negative	booked resorthoppa return_journey from dalaman to marmaris .
negative	the car_hire company hertz would not let me have the car as they claimed i was not on the electoral role .
neutral	he asked me to return it but i asked if they could deliver the correct tv rather_than us having a further round_trip of 00 miles .
positive	i have ordered a few things from safercigs and they have always been very good ; good products , good prices and excellent service .
positive	i contacted parcel to go via the chat to us on the web_page and [_name ] was very helpful in cancelling the pick_up and refunding the money back into our account .
negative	customer_relations department for the u . k . and ireland '
negative	poor service , still_haven_'_t got the t shirts ordered for my daughter '_s birthday .
negative	sent an_email on monday re complaint as this company only works from 0 - 0 , no good to the people that work for a living !!
positive	very happy with the item and the delivery time .
positive	would and have recommended to lots of friends and family .
negative	sent the engines back - they could not find anything wrong .

negative	!
neutral	0 watch the catalogue prices (_eg camera stuff can be eye wateringly expensive )
positive	secondly used 0 in the shower room can now see to shower great >
positive	from my experiences , i would happily_recommend them .
neutral	on suggesting to sainsburys that they include the price of any changed items on the delivery sheet we were told this was not possible and basically to stop moaning .
neutral	the website says you are allowed 0k each for hand - luggage , which is barely enough for a laptop + case - although in fact at both airports our hand_luggage was not weighed .
positive	i signed_up with this invoicing service a few_months_ago and was positively_surprised as it is very easy and fast to send invoices .
positive	there are some fantastic products , for really good prices and i was so excited once i found them .
negative	npower put an estimated reading on my final_bill that was much higher_than my actual reading .
negative	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
neutral	it ' s nonsense , i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery , i expected dpd or tnt or maybe fedex , heck , i wouldn ' t even have minded if it was yodel !
negative	just don_'_t do it !
negative	nearly a week_later no replies , no acknowledgement and no refund .
positive	unfortunately my costume was a bit damaged upon_arrival but was the manufactures fault .
neutral	since royal mails extortionate price increase have used collectplus and out of the 00 parcels none lost but the damage rate is high but only in the last 0 weeks - so what has changed or was i just lucky initially .
positive	very speedy delivery .
negative	they at first ignored my complaint and after several e_- mails and me stating that if they didn_'_t reply i was informing trading_standards they sent a very short terse e_- mail informing_me as far as they were concerned there was nothing wrong with my order but if i e_- mailed them the details ( which i already had done then ) they would look into it , so i sent the details again which they didn_'_t reply to so i have now have reported them to trading_standards and i have written to iflorist as instructed by trading_standards stating my complaint and asking for a full_refund but i am still_waiting for a reply but i don_'_t hold out much hope as they seem to have little in the way of customer service skills and their communication with customers is very unsatisfactory and not consumer friendly at all .
positive	i am a fairly new customer to isme , although i have placed quite a few orders , i am very pleased to say the items are delivered the very next_day .
negative	not only did they want my money , but they obviously wanted the new suppliers to take my money too - the cheek !
positive	many_thanks ipsl
neutral	i am also concerned that if the stickers do not come off will this effect a possible trade in ?
neutral	yodel has a bad_reputation and they lived_up to it .

neutral	thanks suzy

neutral	i have used opodo , bought tickets from the airlines and also read the many negative feedbacks .
neutral	money tranfer was quick but not great value at all .
positive	after 0 days i was getting no - where so i contacted sweatband .
negative	cost me £ 0 + to phone them to cancel the order - disgraceful service from a uk company , will never be buying from them again .
neutral	i have now been offered a refund which i will take , they admit they never had black in stock , so despite resolution i feel as if they were just hoping i would accept the wrong item , it would make me reluctant to buy from them again as they have lost my trust .
negative	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do . he said talktalk don ' t have an_email address for me to contact them but i told him i refuse to ring them again .

negative	i purchased 0 tickets about a month_ago to see russell peters last_night in o0_arena , when i was going through gates my tickets wouldn ' t work .
positive	i paid for next_day delivery for my item as needed it quickly , this option was a little expensive but as i had already got my vacuum cheaper it worked out ok .
negative	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
negative	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
negative	it is now 00 april but still no refund .
negative	an independent engineer found that the fridge is faulty and needs completely replacing .
negative	luckily i thought to see if it had been delivered today ( 00rd may ) - phoned the contact centre and they could not tell me where the parcel was being returned to and asked me where i asked for it to be returned to when i booked it - despite there being nowhere on the website to enter this information that i can find !
positive	i m very happy with the service . both our phones are now succesfully unlock and able to enjoy our iphone . thanks again .
negative	a week_later i am still_waiting and i am not a happy customer .
neutral	personally i lost less game time because of that than some , but it was still something of a failure to deliver on time and also they were somewhat lacking in communication as it was happening .
positive	the site is easy to use and the staff i spoke to were very helpful and friendly .
neutral	have not flown with virgin since .
neutral	controlling the machines with the ipad or iphone is about 0 times harder using than a normal control module , so be prepared for a few crashes and plenty of practise .

neutral	would i recommend selectspecs to a friend ?
positive	the ticket was dispatched on wednesday and it arrived on thursday .
negative	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left behind . etc .
neutral	i have spoken to a very unhelpful operative who was totally unmoved and uninterested .
positive	i have ordered over 0 items from shopto since i found the site and not once have they failed to impress me .
negative	!
negative	brilliant !
neutral	and this is that you can ' t put your own number or email address on the advert , openrent puts theirs on and all interest in the property must got through them , prospective tenants must leave a voice_mail with openrent then openrent send you a message with a link to listen to the voice_mail then you can listen to the message and get back to the inquirer , what is the point of this , i don ' t know ?
neutral	good luck , their website is hit and miss .
neutral	nothing wrong , but nothing exiting
negative	then they decided to put the price up , by £_000 !!!
positive	these were all excellent and exactly_what we had been told ( no little nasty suprises ) and again all very central around the hotel .
neutral	kate reeve
negative	and what ?
neutral	living in a rural village signal is not always very good , but with my last phone from vodaphone i have a signal most of the time !
negative	very slow to respond .
neutral	i was on a holiday tour couple of months_ago at derwentwater in the lake district .
neutral	couple this with their outstanding ' one plan ' which gives unlimited data with tethering (!)
neutral	the flowers received were greatly_appreciated and looked beautiful .
neutral	apparently , hotels . com only give cashback at full price but the whole point of hotels . com is that their prices are discounted !
negative	i guess this is quite personal and it may not happen to everyone but guys , please look at where you are ordering from if you do not want cold food !
positive	happy daughter !!

positive	great value .
neutral	first order was delayed but arrived after i was updated about stock issue .
negative	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .

neutral	this is not acceptable especially if i were to have planned the installation the day after delivery .
negative	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer_service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
negative	i received my key within 00_hours ( fraud check ) but now the company behind gw0 has banned my key , explaining that it is a fraudulent key sold by an unauthorised retailer , leaving me without access to the beta events and full game when it is released and almost £_00 out of pocket .

negative	hopefully karma will get them in the end .

positive	fantastic customer_service !
negative	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .

positive	their website was easy to use .
neutral	he offered a solution to the problem : he asked if i would i take the same order in a different_colour which could be delivered 00 may and he would also give me a discount .

neutral	( edit .
positive	i found the quality to be exceptional , i '_ve always been a bit_wary of using alternative cartridges to the printer brand_names but those cartridges were becoming so expensive i just had to give these a try as they were the only company i ' d seen that said they were compatible with dell printers .
neutral	this is aggrevating as it is messing up my supplementation so hopefully my friend ' s order comes sooner_than mine did .
neutral	however , it means i had to open the packaging to find out i had brought the wrong one . so . this isn ' t a problem though is it . oh no wait !!!!!
negative	what if i had paid full price !!

negative	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story . no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
positive	unfortunately they didn ' t fit .
neutral	an_hour later get a phone_call to say payment is declined because the card i was using was not secure enough . i was using an m & s mastercard , i have used this all around the world and for far larger purchases than the one i was trying to do with watchfinder . it turns_out they are unable to accept most credit_cards from third_party providors . m & s . a . a . amazon .( i use these cards because i get loyalty_points for their use ). wasted a load of time on something that should have been pointed_out at the checkout stage . not happy .
neutral	iv just rang viagogo and they answered straight_away , the guy on the phone was very reassuring when i told him i wasn ' t sure if the tickets were being shipped to my address or if i had to collect them he told me they would be shipped to me but if for some reason they didn ' t get there in time i could pick them up from the venue , but i ' m still worried after_reading all the horror story ' s people have had !

negative	david_: yes you were on friday i had a live_chat and it was confirmed .
neutral	customer_services polite and helpful and replacement eventually sent next_day delivery using a decent courier and they refunded my postage .

positive	pimba , one of the guides and an everest summiteer met us at the aiprort and drove us straight to our hotel for a welcome beer after 00 hs of travel !
negative	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
negative	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
negative	instead of refunding me just eat debited my account then said they couldn_'_t actually do that .
positive	i was very pleased to find all that i needed that day at a competitive price especially when i received it the next_day .
neutral	sometimes , they are as much as 00_% more_expensive on individual components than their main competitor .
neutral	the phone looks good , albeit i settled for the black because i urgently_needed the phone back .
neutral	chillisauce have all the right ideas , though some times the places they book with have no ideas !

positive	keep_up the good work well_done all
positive	a very easy website to use .
negative	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn ' t have suffered on my trip .
negative	it is now 0 months since delivery .
positive	dealchecker has to be the number one because , not only do they offer a massive_range of pick your_own experiences , their hand picked selection has something for everyone and is second to none .
negative	the first day the courier phoned me to say ' there was no flat number ' on the order and he had already left ; i asked him to phone the next_day before arrival so i could leave work to come for delivery .
positive	despite the result , had a fabulous time , the seats were fantastic , hospitality was top drawer .
positive	i ' ve only used blinkbox on my pc , so i can ' t speak for their smarttv or ipad versions , but the pc version has always worked great for me .
neutral	however , i ' m told the flowers themselves were beautiful so i guess the state of the packaging was down to the delivery people ( yodel ) rather_than serenata_flowers .
negative	i could perhaps take legal_action .
negative	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
negative	now they blame on the supplier and want me to wait another 0 - 00days
neutral	karen hardicre

neutral	final thoughts - go for it !
neutral	there is only 0 problem that put me of there service , some may like this way of working , after all it does work but i just find it a hassle and a bit of a put off for prospective tenants .
positive	the whole_process took less_than 00_hours from ordering to delivery .
neutral	you will find lots of counterfeit stuff on the site but this shouldn ’ t come as too much of a surprise as the site itself is effectively a counterfeit ebay - they even have a dispute resolution centre !

neutral	momondo er rigtigt godt når siden virker .
positive	flies from heathrow , no charge for checked in luggage , free snack on the plane , but still budget price .
neutral	the post web booking phone call needs to ask more questions about the tyres to avoid possible failed fitting charges of £_00 .

negative	i was given a yodel tracking_number but told i should have contacted yodel direct , confusing isn_'_t it ?
negative	won_'_t use lastminute . com ever again .
negative	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
neutral	however , this time they initially accepted the competitors price then later sent me an_email_stating they were not going to and were charging me their full price plus shipping .
neutral	so far it seems quite secure , and i got a good deal .
neutral	so the moral of the story is : order early and be prepared to badger them !

neutral	dates changed twice and the delivery driver got lost - a lot .
neutral	i visited the manchester printworks harvester pub a few_days ago , the service was slightly mixed , great bar service but unfortunately just average table service , the salad bar was very well stocked and regularly replenished , however the food although very tasty was barely warm and the plates were cold , the waiter did not check on us to check everything was ok and not very easy to get a hold of despite the restaurant not being particularly busy , i would have tried to find him to complain but i am disabled and find it difficult to walk around .

neutral	price : £_00 . 00
positive	i ordered a green vortex 000 edf jet from wheelspin_models as they offered the best price i could find .
neutral	it also lets them down , as the is no way to track this item either , and therefore can ' tt track it progess .
negative	in fact the fluid was two years old and they could have checked the moisture content of it as my local ford main_dealer does , and seen that it did not need changing .
neutral	i am not really happy about this .
negative	and a written apology which has still not been recieved !
neutral	the downside is that while one week you may find everything you need ; another week can leave you wanting .
positive	i don_'_t have time to go searching for the best deal for any given shape or size of package o a given destination .
positive	0 of 0 * rated for the best online keys on the web .
neutral	if the site itself had a better design (_eg .

positive	i would definitely_recommend away0 to friends and family
neutral	i ' d likely shop with them again , just be aware that they dropship from various suppliers directly ( most companies do , these days ) and as a result sometimes errors occur on their part of their third_party .
negative	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
neutral	due to us getting_married last_year , my name had changed but i hadn ' t thought to change it on the expedia account .
neutral	rustic charm is wearing a bit thin in places as this old lady is showing her age .
neutral	0 . drink prizes are too much
neutral	also , being in a sack makes it quite messy to use , so i would rather pay a little more for a tub .
negative	the customer service lady was quite good but no - one else has_been in touch and i have been told policy is policy .
negative	i suddenly became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don ' t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 £ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
negative	i took it back to cpw who sent it to their repair_centre .
positive	!

negative	luckily i don_'_t run my business in the same way , otherwise i wouldn_'_t even have a shirt on my back !!

positive	easy to order , product at good price and delivery very fast .
negative	we bought a washing_machine from this company after_reading the product description and believing it would fit into our new_kitchen .
positive	this is the first time i have ever been given such a precise 0 hour delivery schedule and it was bang on time .
neutral	still , i do not as secure as other online payment .
positive	network : at & t
neutral	either you are going to honour your promises or not , but if not , scrap the rewards system and lower your prices as you are not acting fair !
neutral	i need it to spend more now .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .

negative	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
positive	indigo thomas jacket arrived very quickly .
neutral	really like the customer_service . very good
neutral	by 0 . 00pm on 00th no tv had arrived and i got worried when reading some of the reviews on this site .
neutral	its been almost 0 month since i was first told of the it problems , surely it can ' t take this long to sort out ?
positive	i have used offtek for a number of years , they have never failed to deliver an exemplary service .
positive	i then asked for a ptr record to be setup , and was although i was passed over to someone_else for that to happen , he read over the chat , confirmed the ip_address and the hostname , and arranged the ptr setup there and then .
positive	well worth a try if you have a laptop lying_around collecting dust !
negative	a couple of weeks went by with no word back from iflorist so having got the phone number of the australian florist , i called them directly to find out their side of the story .
negative	tied like a hand tied and wrapped in left overs from halloween .

neutral	water has_been coming up throught my pavement for weeks and there has_been a leak for 00 years higher up the hill so if the water board fixed that we wouldn_'_t need to spend so much time saving water for them !
negative	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .

neutral	i ' m usually having glassware delivered so this was initially a concern as you can imagine !
positive	my one minor complaint . i couldn_'_t get a job there . which i really wanted as it was walking_distance from home & would save me a fortune in bus fares & i would get even more fab benefits being a tesco employee & a great goodwill ambassador for tesco .
neutral	i ' ve ordered with viagogo before , but i recently_purchased tickets for the madrid v real betis match on sunday november 00 , 0000 .
positive	i wanted to ask them if their lynx tail lx000 & their double bearing pitch slider came with the fittings to connect from their tail to the pitch slider & from their pitch slider to my microheli weighted blades , as the photos did show any , nor were any shown on their site , did one have to use the links from the original units ?.
neutral	still_awaiting order / or a refund .
positive	i can ' t imagine getting a better service , certainly not from a high_street agent , and when you factor in how much you would pay to a high_street agent as a % of the property value that makes this a hugely high value service .
negative	i did speak to chris baker the area_manager , but he was unhelpful , failed to take_responsibility and also failed to call back .
positive	they were also able to sort the issue and sent a replacement on my request .
neutral	?

positive	excellent , fast customer_service !
negative	they wouldnt let me speak to a manager , wouldnt give full names as their " not allowed ".

negative	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .

positive	highly_reccomended .
negative	i guess i ' m not gonna get paid .
negative	i have since got computers from a well - known on - line and high - street retailer for a lot of friends and friends on my recommendation have gone there instead of g0 and they have all been more than happy and believe it or not they are cheaper as well .

negative	i had paid £_000 !
negative	on 00 / 00 i receive a note from parcelforce demanding import vat and a clearance fee ( the latter being £_00 . 00 ).

neutral	the brands are good ad are reasonable prices .
neutral	i ordered my new mobility scouter through this company and they were great i ordered it on 0st aug and it arrived ready built on the 0th aug and there prices are great ,

positive	since i was in a hurry i had chosen express delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ).
positive	how remarkable is that .
neutral	the only bad thing with ao is being part of the drl group and appliance reviews being owned by the drl group :

negative	they claim that i can only cancel my ' subscription ' by telephoning them and will not advise what legislation they are depending upon to insist that i contact them on their 0000 tel .
neutral	one feature i do like with virgin is the fact that you can " take a break " from the casino and choose a period anywhere from 0 day to 0 weeks , i find it handy when i have a withdraw pending just to uset he " take a break " feature for 0 - 0 days , thus not being_able to log in and reverse my winnings !
neutral	some gripes : the ipod_touch i ordered was b + grade ( description said : with no scratches on touch screen but some ' minor ' scratches to be expected on the back )
positive	i found these sites useful for ideas but their prices are heavily inflated compared to what you can get if you book it direct .
neutral	when i ordered the website said the products were in stock , but when i called their customer_services a week_later , they informed me that some of the products were out of stock and they were waiting for a delivery before they could dispatch my items .
neutral	all told it took 0 days ( 0 working_days ) to receive my monitors and that ' s not bad - communication of delays could just be a little more timely .

positive	hostelbookers takes the stress out of choosing a hostel with lots of options to help you find the right one and fast !
positive	great customer_service !
neutral	personally i ' d rather that space was taken up by the film logo or strapline .
positive	the tee arrived really quickly and is fantastic quality , so soft and washes really well .
positive	the checkout is easy enough to navigate , as is the website itself .
negative	hence - no listing , and no bookings … and nearly 0 weeks worth or repetitive e_- mails getting no where .
positive	the fitters had no problem in putting it in .
neutral	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
positive	the apartment in amsterdam we chose was really lovely .
neutral	now their rates are almost similar to other a class providers and yet they are quite behind in terms of their quality of service as the calls keep cutting off alongwith poor signals reception .
positive	the quality of the curtain pole is superb and it was very easy to fit .
neutral	strange as i was told last_week that my order was due to be delivered on 00th_may .
neutral	they then sent me an_email asking me to rate them on trustpilot , but saying that if i have had a negative experience , to email them instead . but given that my negative experience is them not responding to emails .

neutral	game was well_packed and all ok .

negative	they replied to my emails saying something like my item was on high_demand .
neutral	finally , although not mf ' s fault , the meat is halal which i did not see before , had i have known this i would not have ordered as i find halal to be a cruel and filthy practice , however that is just my opinion .

negative	i have taken four flights last_year with ryanair , two to portugal from doncaster and two to dublin from birmingham .

positive	excellent service . would recommend this company to my friends .
neutral	definitely not a modern villa this one .
neutral	cheery delivery men though so that ' s nice !
negative	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing ones .
neutral	i was told i had to pay £_000 for the repair and when i queried it i was told that it was cheaper_than a replacement .
positive	i will be happy to recommend to my friends and colleagues . thank_you officialiphoneunlock a happy martyn .

neutral	the prices are a little cheaper_than other_sites but the shipping is awful .

neutral	bottom_line i guess i got what i ordered , but for the money i expected alot more .
neutral	unfortunately my order arrived damaged due to insufficient packing , however orbit quickly rectified the matter and replaced the damaged prints .
positive	perfect .
positive	i clicked the image and was taken to the spartoo website and was surprised to find it was actually very cheap .
negative	i ' m an experienced electronic engineer , designing medical equipment for the international space station , so it '_s not as if i ' m without relevant knowledge !
negative	firstly i had to chase my order .
neutral	clare indicated this was a one time offer and if i wanted to take it further to contact the furniture ombudsman .
neutral	another thing that strikes me questionable is on the back of the paul mitchell products it reads : " guaranteed only when sold by professional hairdresser , otherwise it may be counterfeit , black market , old or tampered with ."
neutral	who in this chain of between the order being placed and the item being dispatched is letting their team down ?
neutral	when i ' ve bought ' acrylic ' photos before , the photo is actually in the acrylic - so the image is transparent ish .
positive	on top of this they have a great refferal scheme .
neutral	ordered maxx essentials mct which was in stock according to their website .

positive	the website is easy to navigate , offers plenty of information to help you compare each hostels and best of all , charge no commission !
neutral	operatives struggle to understand what you are trying to achieve .

negative	to contract cancellation team , or the pay_monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
neutral	only thing i wasn ' t too pleased about , was that there was absolutely no communication about the actual arrival of my glasses .
neutral	we waited for the pick_up at the hotel and after the collection time had passed with no sign of the bus i called again to be told they had the wrong details and was asked to hold while they contacted the driver , after a while on hold i was assured the driver would be with us soon .
positive	will_defo be using the service again thanks again catherine xxxx
negative	what a mistake !
negative	cost of return postage was £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i rang on saturday_morning and thought i had cleared it up that i still have not had this furniture delivered and was thought i had said i would ring them after delivery to arrange .
neutral	i cannot_fault serenata for ease of use , delivery etc . the flowers i ordered included roses and hyacinths . both can be difficult to manage .
negative	i asked how long it would take before i got my refund and he said between 0_0 working_days .

positive	i bought an ipad 0 and it worked great .
negative	they can get you fired .
positive	particularly_liked the web based instructions for fitting .
negative	there is only an_automated voice at the end of the phone line and no reply to e_- mail , my daughter is heartbroken that her ticket doesnt look like it will arrive .
negative	then payment_sense is the one for you .
negative	i thought that was the end of it .
negative	btw i did cancel my order and ask for a refund , but it appears that that request was ignored along with all the other queries .
negative	i received an amount of £ 0 . 00 compensation into my account but no full_refund .
negative	well , while i was away , the replacement glasses appeared .
neutral	on purchasing items for a holiday including sun cream etc based on spf value and price , the items that arrived had neither the same spf values and increased the overall cost of the bill by over £_00 .
negative	first i was told that my tyres were illegal because around the outer edge of two tyres the tread was less_than 0 . 0mm deep .
negative	so i had to write an_email to thier customer_service email address and hope for the best .
neutral	it seems unlikely that they ran_out in the few hours between my order and their first email . the price was good , so maybe it is trade - off .
negative	i have never received such appaulingly low levels of customer_service , and i will not be purchasing from your website again , and certainly will not be recommending you to anybody .
negative	but here is my story .
negative	everytime i order through the website it takes the double the time if i call and pay by cash .

positive	i cannot express how much i absolutely adore this site !
positive	superb service , well priced and well_packed product .
negative	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
positive	but she really liked the cozy - and wasn_'_t i in her good books , phew : d .
positive	and i got a box of freezer bags for free too !

neutral	0 . watch out for " other people bought with " list as some of this can be totally mad - i have noticed it when the wrong memory upgrade was listed against a netbook - if you had bought the netbook with the upgrade , you had the wrong one !
negative	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
neutral	i do love a dominos ( even if my fav , the hot n ' spicy , gives me a runny bum the next morning ) but unless they ' ve got a deal running , they are a bit overpriced for what you get .
neutral	but all of this is no good if the customer_services is as useless as it is !
negative	first , it was almost_impossible to get to them , the hot line kept telling_me i have to wait , i waited for half an_hour and finally some one picked_up the phone .
positive	the curtains were good quality , beautifully finished and easy to order ; the website helps you through the measuring process .
negative	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
positive	the garden_bench i ordered was delivered well within time and it is just as_described online .
positive	i would recommend orbitremit to anyone_wanting to send money abroad . i use them for sending my pension from the uk to the philippines , and they have never let me down .
positive	another reason_why i bought from this company was because of their accomodating returns_policy .
positive	ordered a pair of clic frames with my new prescription fitted , order for was easy to use and also the attach a photo of your prescription for checking was simple .

negative	and no resolution to the water leak either !
positive	quick , efficient , good value .
positive	mince is so dense it feels_like a steak , never felt anything like it !

neutral	it may be a long work in progress but watch this space .
negative	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .

negative	the response - nothing !
neutral	do have to call an engineer you will have to jump_through many hoops ,
neutral	i read on pixmania delivery info that the package should be opened and checked on delivery to see if it was damaged or defective , since accepting it or signing it without doing that would deem it was delievered in working condition and i wouldn ' t have much ground to return it or get a refund .

neutral	not keen on itunes , but the apple operating_system once you have sussed it is great .
neutral	its an_email to a customer not a text_message to your mate .

positive	overall an excellent experience .
positive	i recommend this site to anyone looking for exercise supplements !
neutral	if it wasn ' t for these complaints it would be a 0 / 0 on build_quality .
neutral	statement below " express delivery " on their web_site says " orders placed before_midday will be dispatched the same day if the product is shown to be " in stock " on our website when you place your order " no ifs or buts , just a clear promise to dispatch that day provided it was in stock , you order by midday and you pay the premium .

positive	i also received my product way before the 00 days expected .
negative	cs don ' t know a great deal .
neutral	it was the last job in a big build , so did not have time to return them & get the right ones & hence went_ahead & had them installed .
negative	i had non stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
negative	i didn ' t pay a lot for the deal so i wasn ' t expecting much in terms of meal and seats but i was planning to make the most of it all the same .

positive	i would love to recommend this company to anyone who loves to shop online .
negative	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
positive	i usually wait for the free delivery offers and stock up on bulbs then , because whilst they are very cheap the postage is almost £ 0 . 00 , so its good to save a bit where you can .
negative	great business_model they have !
positive	so , good service from handtec and dpd .
neutral	in google it shows up as free delivery whereas it actually costs £ 0 . 00 for delivery in mainland and £ 0 . 00 + for n . i .
neutral	at this point i would like to say that i am in no way complaining , but am just totally bemused - you say you value responses , the proof of how much you really care will come in the form of a response to this - though i ' m not holding my breath .

neutral	opened a case on ebay , asked for tracking_number for the guy , the guy replied pretending he had a tracking_number , literally wrote 00000000 so ebay thought he had given it to me but actually just wrote ' there is nothing i can do '.
positive	no water - injection , no added salt , just the genuine taste of good quality chicken .
negative	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .

positive	they have a good range of stock , all arrived within a few_days .
positive	best deal on the internet - could not be_happier !
negative	as it clearly_states on your statement : " interest is charged on a daily_basis so interest payments will increase the longer you take to pay , even before the monthly payment date ".
negative	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
negative	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
neutral	if you are not in a rush and not bothered about communication between customer and company .
negative	they have still defiantly got it all - charm , charisma & professionalism .
negative	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
positive	excellent company - i was really pleased with the speed at which my order was delivered & the prices are amazing .
negative	they are quick and helpful to sell you a product but not so helpful to support you even in the initial start up stages .

neutral	you don_'_t see the shipping until the end , i advise double checking pricing on other online supplement companies before committing to your order .
positive	i just wish the secret wasn ' t out so that i could continue to purchase these 0rd_party , first tier , products at basement prices .
positive	they beat everyone on the internet , you cannot find a better company to buy from and all the free_stuff you can order makes ordering fun .
positive	i ordered from axminster because they keep a wide_range of keenly_priced stock and also deliver to northern_ireland .
positive	00 / 00 would by from here again .
negative	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you ' ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
negative	people beware !
positive	we had a very inexpensive holiday on malta organised by travelrepublic and we were able to book very reasonably_priced transfers .

neutral	i instantly rang the customer care line back and demanded that they find my phone , provide me with my original_quote and that i was utterly appalled that they had potentially funded some other person with the value of my handset .
positive	most recently i installed a crm system in my web space but couldn_'_t get email to work , it only took a couple of explanation messages to one . com , first to raise the issue , second to provide additional information and as always the knowledge and helpfulness of the support staff was outstanding .

neutral	ah sure it was ok
positive	i provided them my imei_number , paid for it , had to send a pic of my credit_card with my name on it ( fingers covering my numbers and exp date ), and then waited about 0 hrs before i received an_email_saying that its unlocked and all i had to do was plug in to itunes .
positive	very fast delivery , goods in first_class condition , would recommend and buy again .
positive	having a collection point at a local shop is a great idea ; being_able to drop a parcel off at a time to suit me helped a lot .

negative	please_bear in mind that gumtree is owned by - you can guess - e_- bay .
neutral	so anyway i thought i would set out some of the pros and cons of my experiences below .
negative	i got a reply a week_later from another customer_service manager , stuart james , just repeating the same nonsense again .
negative	i even went as far as saying " i ' m sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let me deal with any_problems i ' ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
neutral	although amazon '_s courier had no_problems with the bad_weather this company didn_'_t even try to get to my house .
positive	keep up the good work and will_continue to use for many years .
neutral	shame !
negative	same result the next_day .
negative	their people are rude , their call_centre staff useless , and there is absolutely no flexibility in delivery time .
negative	for example .
neutral	just think how frustrating you feel when you purchase something and the supplier can '_t provide you with a time_slot . provide your customers the same service and flexibility you want as a customer .

neutral	they used to leave the food bags in the porch .
positive	the sunglasses were sent to me with free next_day delivery in time for my girlfriends_birthday .
neutral	called crc and was told it was held at royal_mail and was their fault .
negative	appalling customer_service , to get a refund you need to return within 0 days of order . and so they obviously dont care about the christmas market .

negative	when i came to rebuild bike i removed the bar tape and found the £_000 set of carbon bars had snapped almost clean through leaving me £_000 out of pocket as it was too late to claim .
neutral	car good , new and good drive .
negative	i have now done this and am awaiting a response .
neutral	i booked a car through carhire_0000 for collection at_faro_airport on 00 july_0000 .

positive	i was offered as fancy or as basic as appropriate and am very pleased so far after 0 months
positive	quick transaction fast delivery .
neutral	i had an overseas visitor so we booked this tour thinking it would be the best way to see london in the short amount of time .

negative	after no response i emailed and called again to be told that this had been sent out to me in the post .
neutral	!
neutral	i immediately telephoned customer_services and spoke to clare caswell who was quite sympathetic and said i should not have been spoken to in such a way in my own home .
negative	after a week of waiting and calling , wasting the time and out of pocket , they allow me to use the sim again .
neutral	this was in april_0000 for goodness_sake , in hertfordshire ( we had no floods !!!)
negative	its either giving away £ 0 a month or paying £ 0 - 0 to get some actual insurance .
neutral	the item was sent to the ' order ' address instead of ' ship to ' address .
negative	decided that i would wait for the estimated_delivery date .
positive	i spoke to emma today and she provided me with all the details to enable me to book the parcel in later in the month for collection .
positive	i will_definitely be using this site again
positive	loved it .
neutral	unfortunately on the mobile site it didn ' t offer the discount which was a bit_annoying as that ' s why i decided to order from here as it made it cheaper_than other online sites .

neutral	well they ' ve taken a slamming in online forums for their service etc .
negative	you have been_warned !

neutral	the products are price are great though .
negative	should have just ordered off of ebay where the same part was £_00 cheaper anyway !
neutral	the delivery driver however was very helpful and a credit to the company and the product i eventually got is good quality , although the table cover is somewhat ill fitting as it is too big .

neutral	!.
negative	so , i ordered a delivery to deliver from my shop to my customer .
neutral	no mention of the hotel or car_hire so we contacted them again .

negative	i tried to explain to [_name_removed_] that the part was only returned because i did not receive the module and that after waiting for about one month i felt that i had waited enough and went out and bought another machine .
neutral	we ordered some smart designer handles , really good service , no hassle , easy to read and choose the ones we wanted .
positive	search options helped_us find the hostel we were looking fast fast and efficiently .
neutral	i called customer_services , i only called to find out where ( in the event that the tickets didn_'_t sell ) i could collect them from .
negative	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
neutral	unfortunately the whole_experience was let_down by slow communication and rather unfriendly sales staff .
positive	absolutely_brilliant you can buy all the things you need and get cashback even when things are already discounted .
negative	come on that ' s crazy !
neutral	and now i have a £_00 bank charge .
negative	regards
negative	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
neutral	the booking was confirmed with goldcar .
positive	i ordered a game from simply_games that cost less_than the other big companies i was thinking of ordering with .
positive	very easy to understand course and very user_friendly .
negative	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren ' t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i ' m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can ' t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
negative	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
positive	!
negative	update , finally i got my full_refund + some compensation .
neutral	quality of the prints which were a0 is good .
positive	co down ni
neutral	the different model arrived after a couple of weeks in early february but it did not charge properly and i asked for a refund .

positive	say what they do and do what they say .
neutral	i originally left a 0 star_review for just_eat after the complete pig ' s ear they made of my first order , but i decided to give them another chance after they sent me a promo voucher and ordering from my local takeaway worked out cheaper because of the discount .
neutral	the coffee is nice , however i think the coffee is colder than a nespresso coffee as the pod is plastic it does not conduct heat .
negative	customer service line has now been engaged for over 0 hour as my auto dial service redials every 0 mins .
positive	i sometimes have a look around to see what i would save by switching .
neutral	to stop it from being two stars , they did refund the postage and packaging since i didn ' t receive it next_day , however , why in hell are you using royal_mail during december is beyond me , for that , you lost another star .
neutral	ok to deal with , no_problems ( no communication really ) and a very good price ; but compared to others , delivery however was very slow , arrived two whole days after i would have expected to receive it .
negative	do not hire from this company you have been warned .

negative	the day after that the parcel was not in wrexham , it had been delivered five days late to the customer that had cancelled , and not back to me ????
negative	we had a hotel booked to be able to attend the commonwealth games in glasgow in july_0000 .
neutral	prices are ok but delivery is very slow and if they use yodel you have no_idea when it '_s owing .
negative	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
neutral	zavvi . com as a site has the best prices i have seen they are extremely cheap , yet do not order a game expecting it to arrive till at_least 0 weeks after you ordered , their postage system is the worst i have ever_encountered it is atrocious .
neutral	they clearly seem to think that coats are what europeans wear for fashion , not for function .
positive	the same excellent service which includes robust packing and timed delivery by dpd one of the best .
negative	we ordered a suite for delivery in feb , the delivery date was given to us .
positive	their low_prices are unmatched especially with there low price_match selection and quality first rate shipping .
positive	highly_recommended
positive	i had personnel service and was made to feel an important and very special customer .
positive	simply perfect !!
positive	would recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk to anyone .
positive	the man with whom i spoke on the phone gave me his name without being asked .
neutral	i may be tempted to shop elsewhere in the future .
negative	customer service is terrible , they never know anything and are not prepared to chase up an order or find its whereabouts .
negative	avoid
negative	presumably that is why they insult the caller by endlessly repeating the same - incorrect message at them .
neutral	this may have been down to the delivery company though .
neutral	they have a lonng way to go to learn customer service off someone amazing like say 00 red or titan bingo and casino or butlers or dream and so on .
positive	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
neutral	so i decided to go with the top_secret hotel which they advertise as :
negative	serenata promise a full 000_% guarantee / refund of not satisfied .
neutral	it would have been nice to receive a ' sorry ' of some kind for their error .
neutral	!

neutral	mike newman
positive	i '_ve used this service before and found it to be perfect .
negative	i am_currently taking_legal_action to get my money back .
neutral	from what i ' ve heard about club and first_class being great i can ' t comment but for economy class they just don ' t compare to other airlines like virgin , emirates or singapore that are leaders across all 0 ( or 0 !)
positive	i received the package in 0 days . in italy so i ' m impressed .
neutral	the problem came with the delivery driver who left the goods at the local post_office but failed to leave a card to say so .
negative	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let ' s say a more rounded design .
positive	is the best .
positive	really recommend them !
negative	they have no readily_available phone number so they seem to deter customers from actually speaking to them .
neutral	but if you are a customer trying tho contact them , you are virtually out of luck .
negative	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
negative	george
positive	i proposed to my girlfriend on christmas day and she hasn ' t stopped staring_at her new addition to her finger since .
negative	the initial booking summary before i paid for them did not say this .
neutral	sold a galaxy_s0 to bozowi for the sum of £_000 but then had an_email_stating they had downgraded my handset due to scratches ?
negative	anyway having punched my name and address into the computer it eventually said ' no '.
negative	then after a bad family holiday we felt guilty leaving the children so we called and asked if we could carry the deposit over and change the holiday to a family of 0 0 weeks in orlando with car_hire , this was a lot more_expensive and he jumped at the chance to change this holiday , he took a further £_000 deposit .
neutral	in the email it gave me the option to accept the new price or decline and have the handset returned to me at my expense ?
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	i believe that requesting a refund for the balance is not unreasonable , and was very annoyed and disappointed that homebase clearly thinks so little of its customers as to fob them off in this manner .
neutral	no smile or a thank_you .
negative	after dragging their heels , - not recieving emails , unable to open pictures sent i was asked to return the chair at m y own_expense .

negative	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
negative	i paid and ordered eyesential in october_0000 still reciving emails saying it will be with me in 0 - 00 days i have asked for a refund of the £_00 that was paid in good faith they are totaly criminal i am contacting_trading_standards on monday 00 jan
negative	i was assured the refund would be made in 0 / 0 working_days .
neutral	every time i have the trauma of getting to an airport at some ungodly hour to stand in a huge snaking line for what feels_like an_eternity to be told the flight is delayed and then when finally boarded to be charged a days wages for an insipid cup of tea with a damp sandwich i tell myself . never never again !!!

positive	multumesc oktal , tineti - o tot asa !
negative	i wished to send a review of my booking experience through trustpilot .
neutral	but apart_from that the site is a good idea and i continue to use the site .
negative	dont shop at the carphonewarehouse !
neutral	the prices quoted are not any different to local companies who all provide a more efficient service with an account you settle once delivery has_been made by credit_card at no extra_cost .
negative	still , no delivery but the usual update message " will be slightly_delayed with shipment till ."
negative	in my opinion their whole operation should be fully investigated by the energy ombudsman .
positive	however , the guys here have really helped_me with this and have been very patient and have resolved this problem for me .
neutral	ordered lord of the rings extended trilogy on blu - ray .
negative	it is noteworthy that took the trouble to respond promptly to paypal and they took the trouble to respond promptly to a review they didn_'_t want to appear but they simply couldn_'_t be bothered to deal with me once they had my money .
positive	my mommy ordered the seraquin tablets for dogs ( large ) for me .
negative	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
positive	service is superb quick and efficient and kept_informed of delivery situation all the way .
neutral	next_day delivery turns into three or four days , if you ' re lucky .
neutral	people on the phone at the flower place seemed okay and were very apologetic .
neutral	it ' s rapid , efficient and pretty_much guarantees you a replacement phone the next_day .
positive	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
positive	great selection , service and price .
neutral	0nd guy was ace - knew_exactly_what the problem was - the first guy had fitted the wrong part for our unusual loo - it has a " cycloninic " flushing system apparently , rather rare_these days !
positive	a good reasonable price for something that will bring wonderful memories to mind every time i see it .
positive	luckily , we sorted this out at the resort and the fault seems to have been with the accomodation providers , who change our booking !
positive	yes - you can trust this firm - good delivery - quick and item perfect on arrival

positive	pros_:
positive	the package was with me within 0 hrs of ordering .
negative	i put in a support request for ' where is my order ' and three days_later was advised ,
negative	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
positive	the day after i put my details online i received posting instructions .
positive	they have confidence in their service to advertise the telephone contact and not hide_behind e_- mail contact only .
negative	interesting enough it seems to me most reviews on here are by people who have only written one review in the past .
neutral	item not as_described , i failed to read the small_print but there is no justification for this considering that different products have different prices .
negative	i wondered why they were listed in the first place ?
neutral	not a bad website better in store though i thought the internet was meant to make life_easier lol
negative	i booked a dinner / theatre trip as a special outing for myself and three friends through lastminute . com .
positive	everything was just perfect really !
positive	this company is very reliable and give a great discount .
neutral	when i first applied the time frame stated was 00 - 00_hours after 00_hours the website updated to upto 00 hourrs and it was eventually done but it would have been quicker and cheaper to go direct to 00 .
positive	i have just taken delivery of my kitchen_appliances , oven , cooker_hood and hob .
neutral	i ordered a nest of tables from argos about 0 weeks_ago .
neutral	mondays flowers were very nice and delivered in the morning .

negative	received email_stating order coming 0st oct .
negative	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
positive	they '_ve always paid in a timely_manner , whether it '_s by cheque of direct bank_transfer .

neutral	beware product images are not always accurate and flooring supplies won ' t go out of their way to help !
negative	really ?!
negative	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .
neutral	they also didn_'_t like the fact that i was seen by a number of different optometrists at the oe , which i always thought was one of the main problems ( different info from different optometrist ).
negative	i then emailed a week_later after hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
neutral	brilliant for kids cloths for how quick they grow and good for if you need cheap cloths for working on site .
neutral	i ordered from bedzrus . co . uk as their price was significantly_lower_than anywhere_else online .
positive	i also really like the feature that you can sort places by location when you ' re browsing hostels as i ' m usually a weekend traveler or trying to get the most out of a place in a short amount of time so being_able to select by location is key for me .
positive	the customer_service over the phone was fantastic , my call was quickly answered and they were very helpful and knowledgeable about the product – able to answer questions on spec and discuss delivery logistics with authority – and in fact i finally placed the order over the phone .
negative	having looked into the company further i think the people i spoke to work for another company , and that infurn are a very dodgy set_up .
negative	it is now the 0th_oct and no sign of our goods .
positive	i ' ll be arranging one very soon for my friends hen_party and will be using funktion for that .
positive	would recommend them to anyone .
neutral	for a fast service your looking to pay over £ 0 . 00 and the economy service which says over 0 days is still expensive .
neutral	this lack of customer after service will make me think about purchasing from them the next time .
neutral	the radiators were picked_up and returned , and we ordered 0 different ones , steel and robust .
neutral	their process of continuous improvement peaked in the mid 0000 '_s and has fallen since then .
neutral	overall the london pass and travel card was great , our only_criticism would be that the guide would have been helpful to advise the places you can no take photography .
negative	0th & 0th have passed and alpharooms have still not addressed this request .
neutral	then , it hurts but i '_ll have to go with virgin , the worst sales company in the world !
negative	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
negative	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .
negative	merci asos pour tant d ’ efficacité .
positive	makita li - ion cordless drill / driver set .
neutral	the items eventually arrived and i ' m very pleased with them , but an improvement in communication wouldn_'_t go_amiss , especially as it was my first order , online and i became worried it might have been a scam .
negative	he said he ' d send me the pac_code within two hours .
positive	i was recommended this company by a friend who was trying to get tyres for his ural outfit .
neutral	however , out of the items i have ordered so far ( only been using for a month ), four items have said in stock when they haven ' t been , so i have received them late .
negative	avoid at all cost .
neutral	other use to clean the system .
neutral	i am so impressed - got this mail re my earlier review
neutral	i might use bedzrus again if their price is good , but i would prefer to use a more reliable retailer , especially with their unreliable delivery and signing as " damaged " policy which could be a potential problem if you just signed for the goods without thinking .
neutral	product is as decribed .
positive	my grandsons don_'_t want nan to buy them jumpers or sweeties !
neutral	but very expensive .
negative	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across_europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere . then delivered after christmas .
negative	please avoid this company at all costs !
positive	i am really happy with this website , it has provided me with more students than i can tutor .
neutral	bought a vauxhall corsa excoflex .

neutral	so i emailed customer_services specifically to ask for a response from a senior person in uk and all i got was a refund on a pound of apples .
negative	tried to ring the london office to complain but in just rings out .
positive	both really nice guys who seemed to want my business to perform well , im glad they found me and shared their service , which is that well operated you do genuinely feel you are there only customer and they have no one else to do anything for !, as everything is responded to so quickly .
negative	since then i '_ve discovered the ' chargeback ' facility through the bank , so i ' m going to try that before i take ' em to court .
neutral	i asked why she needed it , as we had already paid and that she should have it on their system already .
positive	00 / 00 and we ' ll definitely be using the service again
neutral	it ' s up to you !'

negative	don ' t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
negative	0 .
neutral	d & a proved to be terrible to deal with as to contact them you need to ring and pay 0p_per_minute for the privilege .
neutral	my girlfiend saw a picure of one of the bouquets and said they were her favourite flowers so i decided to order them as a xmas suprise .
positive	great service .
negative	this over the space of 0 weeks having given up i didnt bother trying the boots and instantly returned them .
negative	operator that i spoke to acted as if all in a days work .
negative	the first day the courier phoned me to say ' there was no flat number ' on the order and he had already left ; i asked him to phone the next_day before arrival so i could leave work to come for delivery .
neutral	their on - line site is vast which lets your experience down a little bit .
positive	i even got a text from them on the day letting me know the exact time of delivery , saving me from hanging_around all day waiting .
positive	absolutely_brilliant .
positive	the box it comes in is recyclable , ( i gave one to my neighbour , who was moving , so that she could put the contents of her freezer in , for transit to her new house .)
positive	he even answered my calls out of hours as i was often busy during the day , very impressed !
neutral	i will still buy from qs_supplies again as their prices are excellent , and delivery was ( mostly ) prompt .
negative	they even have the audacity to tell me they failed to pay the registry , but the loss of the domain is my fault for not checking with a third_party that they did their job !
negative	the store manager is ineffective .
negative	00 min .!
positive	issue - free online shopping as it should be
negative	was about to order a mac mini from here .
positive	good service from this company , goods arrive quickly and well_packed .
negative	nasty and horrible people .
neutral	the holiday inn at manchester_airport was very comfortable and the only complaint was that somebody damaged my car in the long stay car_park , my rhs rear bumper had a lot of white paint on it and several scratches obviously caused by a collision , it may polish out but the hotel accept no responsibility for any damage .
positive	i will_definitly be using this service again .

negative	“
positive	i found the staff both knowledgeable and helpful .
neutral	was given apology and refunded delivery cost .
negative	i have come home from work a third day to find yet another yellow calling_card .
negative	today we thought enough is enough and contacted trading standars and they told us that we have to email them and ask when they will be delivering the bed to give them one last chance and if it isnt forth coming only then can we ask to get our money back - i ' m just thinking , all this just to get our money back .
neutral	when i complained again , they did eventually refund the delivery charge .
neutral	however i was recently asked by an elderly friend to help sort_out a billing problem as she was getting_nowhere on the phone .
negative	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .

positive	it might be a coincidence but for years she used to suffer from a bad itchy_skin condition , causing scabs and hair loss .
positive	will recommend and use again .
neutral	the only thing i was concerned_about was that one of my boxes was quite badly ripped open , but luckily the contents was absolutely fine .
neutral	a good company if you ' re after your vinyl fast , but due to the speed of dispatch , items can sometimes arrive damaged , stock is questionable ( how long have they had it before selling it - this is crucial with vinyl ), emails can take over a day to answer and errors with orders have delayed work being completed for some clients - very frustrating !
positive	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
neutral	i have bought four new bikes from them over about a 00 year period , & had servicing work carried_out too .
neutral	the logistics of moving around a group of 00 are never going to be easy but on the whole chillisauce did very well , particularly with the transport side of things .
neutral	i think that if you are there for a longer period of time you can get your moneys_worth but in 0 days we didnt come close . we wanted to go on a boat tour but didnt have time unfortunately .

negative	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
neutral	the service team who helped_me seemed pleasant enough , but at times they didn ' t seem to understand what i was asking .
neutral	we oredered a years supply of fybogel lemon an were disappointed that it didn_'_t taste like the highstreet pharmacy lemon , but more like lemon / clementines , which isn_'_t the greatest of tastes .
positive	ian ( our bar man ) was such good fun and made the event extra special .
positive	it wont be long before i buy more !
neutral	this is not a problem as such , and the claims can be disputed .
positive	any_issues are resolved quickly by friendly and helpful staff .
neutral	this company has recently been hiding a lot of extras not included within my tariff and their tariffs are way overpriced compared to the other_networks .
positive	very quick , professional service .
neutral	rubbish and overpriced for knitting stuff despite having a large_selection .
positive	far cry 0 & fifa 00 xbox games as two_separate_orders both delivered within two days after ordering .
negative	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
negative	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
neutral	the site and idea is very good but the majority of users only come on here after a negative experience , nobody thinks ' i ' ve had a great product here i ' ll go and leave a review !'.
neutral	poor communication with regard to warranty issues .
positive	then a text to inform me my ordered was left with my neighbour , and a picture of their gate , the little things just show the quality of the service .
positive	thanks

positive	great price and fast delivery
neutral	and since my review was misleading " according to them ", i have to say that i did get a refund after two_weeks of contacting them through their website .
negative	internal drawer rails were flimsy .
neutral	didn ' t want to wait around for three days for kwikfit to pull their finger out so checked out some 00 hour small companies that specialise in coming along and fitting a tire quickly .
neutral	wanted to buy a tag ,,, initial communication with lee was great . not pushy let me take time out to decide whilst making helpful suggestions .
neutral	nice one guys keep it up !

negative	invoice number 00000 and invoice number 00000
neutral	we had a smooth day with timing and organisation and maps and plentiful champagne on the punt !
neutral	plenty of false economy here , especially when you realise that to receive anything near to the minimum service offered anywhere_else , you will eventually have to pay substantially more , regardless of the base price .
positive	an_immediate_response to my question which solved all my questions , great service !
negative	so , the resolution was , wait another 00_minutes for said food . er , no actually , id rather starve . luckily i got a full_refund , but seriously , they could put that on the webpage & inform the supplier to email them / us if they cancelled thinking it was a hoax .
positive	i sent them back and had my new pair within 0 days !
negative	don ' t risk it .
neutral	ecco could at_least provide a contract returns service to help make this easier and cheaper - and it would be nice if it was clearer on the site .

negative	also the guest house was not very good not worth £_00 a room £_00 is nearer the mark i think the hotel inspector should visit the staff can hardly speak_english and you have to explain what you want for breakfast and they still get it wrong . not impressed
negative	eventually we reached them by phone and asked if we could exchange it for another machine which would fit .
positive	i always end up ordering from supplement_warehouse .
neutral	however , they use citylink as their courier , and as a result there is always a very real risk that anything i order will turn_up late , broken or not at all .

neutral	i found the website easy to navigate and straightforward to use .
negative	0st time i ordered 0 things .
neutral	although the frame is cheap bear in mind that the price of even the most basic bespoke frame will be more_expensive than this whole item and a basic bespoke one would probably not end up looking much_better .
neutral	eventually , after numerous_attempts , i did manage to buy a good hp laptop at a very reasonable_price from a currys store in north birmingham .
positive	brilliant !
positive	the product was delivered exactly when they said they would by 0 very helpful guys .

negative	several emails later not received confirmation for delivery .
negative	i have no axe to grind against this company , but poor service from online_retailers is becoming a major issue for us all , don_'_t you think ?
positive	unlike another internet firm with a similar name .
negative	ebay will not care about seller why ?
neutral	a few_days_later i was shocked to receive information from an insurance company domestic & general giving details of the direct_debit , etc .
neutral	i like it but not 000_% satisfied still once u should browse through and have look to get some idea too rather_than believing others
neutral	oh well you lose some / win some with plants !
neutral	i knew the delivery time would be long , but it took until mid june for the chairs to be delivered .
positive	i purchased a stuburt rain jacket that unfortunately developed a fault .
positive	can only assume this was a royal_mail issue since printerinks were able to give me a recorded_delivery tracking_number .
negative	they kept telling_me they ' d send me the details i needed via text , and they ' d never come through .
negative	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it ' s not something i have to do ".
negative	bozowi did not like this and so they have threatened to sue me and have kept my phone and refused to respond to my emails .
negative	she contacted the depot to put a priority on this return .
positive	i would recommend parcels to go to anyone and especially your member of staff called catherine .
negative	shipping can be delayed . which is frustrating .
negative	absolutely awful !
negative	not at all happy and not the way to treat_customers !
negative	groupon could do well to learn lessons from wowcher .
negative	possibly the worst customer service on the internet .
neutral	what if this had been an urgent emergency ?
positive	they unlocked my iphone0 as they promised . it working perfectly without any_issues . they took 00_hours to unlock but not 0 hours .
negative	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over £_000 from my account without any notice or production of a bill .

negative	i then worte to them , complaining and they offered to send me one in a larger_size .
negative	after nearly seven weeks they finally agreed to give me a refund which i am still_waiting with eager anticipation .
positive	and the packaging was excellent .
positive	now even the lady in our local post_office uses myhermes to send her own parcels and our village supermarket has_become an agent for drop_offs and returns since i sang your praises to the owner .
neutral	i specifically paid for next_day delivery , expecting it to come next_day .
negative	( why indeed !?)
negative	now i am waiting again for them to call me back to tell me that they have spoken to the seller . the worst customer_service ever , with no clue_what is going on .
positive	?
neutral	one other complaint i have is that treats are not changed frequently enough and customers should also be awarded loyalty_points for frequency of shopping .
negative	be_careful that the good reviews here may not be real .
negative	0 ) if you do purchase don ’ t pay in full / upfront as we did .
negative	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
neutral	this is , in my opinion , very odd . as with trip_advisor , surely all reviews should be un - editable , and relate to one experience .
positive	people who love stationery , who find the fun in functional , they communicate brilliantly .
neutral	order first time from spartoo about 0 weeks_ago , order uk00 and uk 0 . 0 came , no problem with returning , but when i returned obviously me thinking they meant us sizes ( and common_sense ) i then put in to order uk00 . 0 hoping a 00 would arrive .

positive	i would use again for sure .
positive	you can find what you nees quickly and the booking process was simple and quick .
negative	ordered an oven .
negative	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
negative	regularly cut_off mid sentence after a massive amount of waiting time to speak to an operator who usually passes you through to several other depts so make_sure you '_ve got lots of free time to speak to anyone at talk_talk !
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	again three are out on their own .
positive	i would certainly recommend repairs0everyone to anyone !
neutral	after giving ebay feed_back i received an_email from you asking to resolve my average rating , i was asked to telephone you which i did 0 times over a 0 hour period with nobody answering .
negative	!
negative	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd ' s and what were they going to do about it .
neutral	however another random payment was taken from my account on the same day .
neutral	once , prime time dramas had 00 to 00_minutes between breaks .
negative	emailed over three times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or inclination to look_into or deal with my query .
positive	so thanks to all the staff for making the process thoroughly enjoyable .
neutral	he said he had a few two - seater sections available & asked if we would like a window seat to which we said yes to both .
negative	i have complained twice and am still_awaiting a response from customer service .
negative	i ' m not out in the sticks , just 0 miles from city_centre , and 0 mile from m0 !
positive	the drivers always seem to put their customers first and do their best to deliver on time .
positive	zutti . com
negative	they then refused to tell me why they wouldn_'_t give me credit , which is contrary to the consumer credit act and also to the advice given by their credit agency , equifax .
negative	without prejudice
positive	cheers_guys !
negative	-- update after august_0000 --
negative	0 month later , 0 further emails unresponded to and i still_haven ' t got the other cheque .
positive	- nuff_said ;- p
neutral	i placed my order with takeaway . com and it was transmitted to the outlet . but there it ended . the meal i got was late , luke warm and burnt . it was up to me to complain to the vendor . other sights that i have used give you a fixed delivery time and update you on its progress .
positive	!
neutral	after repeatedly gurning the house down i now do not know how to get the e tickets sent to the correct address .
positive	great photo opportunity , bet some londoners havent seen all the sights we saw in a matter of 0hours !
positive	i needed something very multi purpose to help me carry on living my life as i always had and even with the ever progressing , ever changing disease of multiple sclerosis this brilliant engineering masterpiece fits the bill .
negative	they said they would phone back .
neutral	lead times thus not great !
negative	then they told me it would take several days for them to get back to me with their findings , which meant the flight might become full in the meantime or the ticket price would increase .
neutral	they sounded great but whever i tried to order online or purchase in store they weren ' t available .
positive	for me the service experience is more important than the actual transaction itself .
negative	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn ' t even reached my account !
neutral	but you could also do without it during busy_periods as the queues for a lot of the places are ridiculous and so you ' re only limited to a certain number of places to see .
neutral	i received another call from daniel at the courier ( tas ) who again was excellent and apologised for the mix_up and that they would refund £_00 to nabru for the delivery charge .
negative	god help anyone who uses this company .
neutral	overall i ' d say i ' m happy , because the phone is good , but i don ' t think i ' d use them again .
neutral	i emailed .
negative	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
negative	giffgaf support has to be done via_email only and all you get is communication done over several hours or days at a time . so it will take up to 00_hours to answer a question via your account portal , no alternative is offered . it feels_like walking in slow motion for every question .
negative	" well , a number of reasons that mostly relate to the fact that harveys is awful and i absolutely regret having purchased them from you , coupled_with the fact that nobody has ever called when when i requested it "
positive	good quality merchandise
negative	- i wasted one day at work , because i had to take that day off
neutral	however the unusual my drop box delivery method was confusing and took time and effort to retrieve .
positive	a great experience , great product and great price .
negative	the engineer arrived_promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
positive	!
negative	manager refused to see me and was told nothing the branch could do .
positive	will happily use again .
positive	delivery was very prompt and goods were packaged well and all present .

neutral	great prices and great range of clothing
positive	these flowers were delivered to an actress friend who says they have really brightened up her dressing room .
neutral	and such is the same of facebook .
positive	thanks david and the rest of flubit !
neutral	when i phoned up to complain and inform them of the situation , i had to justify myself and phone back 0 times , as they did not think it was in any way possible that the items could have been missed , as the picker / packer swore he put them in the box .
neutral	when i telephoned to enquire where he was i was told the appointment was been 0 and 00am – this does not appear very efficient , if a fitter does not arrive until 00am half the day is gone !
negative	bought two pasta dishes to take to my holiday home for a quick arrival meal .
positive	when i found a cheaper deal with o0 , t - mobile not only offered me a deal that was far better_than the one i had found , but also reduced their price for new customers so as not to be_beaten .
negative	it was stated that the item would be delivered next_day .
positive	thank_you and regards from murphy .
positive	i was very particular that i found a company that would offer me the full package - as there are many out there that do not let you have the international warranty card , which greatly de - values the watch if you want to sell onion the future !
positive	they collected , they told me when it had arrived back , and they dispatched another , which arrived swiftly .
positive	i found power direct on a price comparison website & their price was simply unbeatable .
neutral	i discovered that whilst in transit , my parcel had been labeled with the wrong_address and found the website very one sided .
positive	the service from trionic has_been second to non throughout the process from asking questions , choosing the model , ordering , delivery and a phone_call to say it was on its way , as well as the helpful tips even after via_email .
neutral	this is an appeal to everyone who may have experienced the same problem !!
neutral	im unaware of where i would be 0 - 0 days before the festival .
positive	although the stated delivery was 0 - 0 working_days , due to materials not being in stock my order took 00 days to arrive .
negative	another sales adviser , he was insistent that no such deal was available , i asked to speak to the manager and asked him to listen to the recorded conversation , he firstly looked on their system and
negative	trans id_0000000
neutral	frustrating when there is always a line saying ' sorry , the last room was booked 0 hours ago , or 0 hour 00_minutes ago .
positive	!
negative	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
negative	whatever you are thinking_about how good the price or the website looks forget it , it '_s all just a scam .
positive	i ordered a fly by one piece - navy and orange size 0 for my fiancée for our holiday in turkey .
neutral	parcels are bubble_wrapped , air pockets and boxed and it doesn_'_t seem to matter , they are intact but the contents in bits .
negative	i placed an order on 0rd february .
neutral	however they sent me a revised_offer of just £_000 saying the home button didn ' t work properly , i considered the home button would have fell into the normal ' wear and tear ' condition as it was definitely still usable .
positive	returns and replacements are dealt_with swiftly by their customer support_team on electronic items which have gone faulty within the warranty_period .
neutral	nous sommes très contentes avec le produit que nous avons acheté , mais la livraison . quelques semaines avec une dizaine des emails qui promettent la livraison dans le meilleur delai .
negative	now , january 0th , always nothing received ( no refund no parcel ).
positive	the price was the best i could find at the time .
negative	i understand you have booked a new collection for today , they have confirmed this has now been allocated to a driver to ensure you have no further delays .
neutral	that '_s is the only reason that i have given a 0 *
neutral	i have called the call_centre but it doesn ' t recognise my parcel reference so i can ' t even pick it up from the service centre .
positive	i have introduced my daughter and i also buy for friends and family .
positive	the whole_experience was great .
negative	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
negative	i have rung this number left numerous messages and only twice been rung back .
positive	used about 0 times so far and perfect every time .
positive	recommended .
negative	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
positive	top seller super_fast shipping recomend 000_% that '_s for sure .
negative	spoke with a lady_called raj who told me that we had to go onto the system and cancell the order , which we did , that was last tuesday , today we call them again only to be told that payment has_been sent to my account for £_000 , after a long chat raj told me that she would give me their account details so that i could put the money backm into their account .
positive	i have registered the camera serial_number with canon and the camera works_perfectly with my existing lenses ( both generic and canon ).
negative	so valuable time and petrol wasted in a fruitless and frustrating episode .
positive	would definitely use them again
negative	i contacted them again clearly stating my consumer right and was ignored ( up to 0 times so far ) so got my local citizens_advice to contact them - again they made out i was in the wrong ( changing the reason they were refusing a refund !!).
negative	i would avoid this in the future as payment goes quickly , they take days to so called dispatch and i have never received the parcel .
negative	hey , i can do something better he says .
neutral	slow access and drop - outs are common particularly during busy_periods .
negative	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
positive	eventually ordered item on monday , it arrived tuesday_morning , sms in the morning of delivery .
positive	they kept me updated at all times by e_- mail , text and phone .
neutral	a bit of customer_service whereby you check the order and reply with the dates would be helpful !
positive	i would recommend using this website and i would use them again .
negative	looked at my bill and we had paid up but they had reapplied out final amount to the account again - no_idea why !
positive	luckily it was still ice cold though !
neutral	many_thanks for your help
positive	tnt managed to break a corner during transport and sarah and her team got a replacement to me very quickly with no bickering at all .
positive	great choice of products at low_prices !
negative	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost £_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
neutral	i lost one attempt ( which took me over an_hour to do ) by pressing a wrong key and had to start again !!!
positive	000000000
negative	i '_ve emailed twice and had no reply .
neutral	because of the pictures being a great quality i ordered another one for myself , again it arrived damaged but very well_packaged ?
positive	for everything you want and great customer_service , there ' s only one place i go .

neutral	they didnt look much like the picture so was disappointed .
positive	it was easy to fit so even my husband could do it .
neutral	!
negative	fortunately i paid by credit_card so will be pursuing them for refund and return postage_costs .
positive	i ordered from this company as i liked the look of some of their offers so i chose a bottle of anais anais and a bottle of together forever and although i had used anais anais before i had never tried together forever and a lot of perfumes don , t last very long on me but i put_together forever on at 0 am thismorning went to work as a social carer and nearly 00_hrs later i can still smell it on me as if i had only just put it on so i am really pleased . delivery of both these purchases was very swift and the packaging was very good . i love the wide_choice available from fragrance_direct and will_definitely be using them again they are very good

negative	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
neutral	despite email of email , no tracking_details , also no phone number to ring up , so they can just ignore you emails .
neutral	come on tesco !
negative	this was correctly charged at £_00 . 00 .
neutral	on this occasion the courier yodel left the parcel with a neighbours delivery and didn_'_t leave me a card to tell me where it was which leads me to suspect they didn_'_t even realise there were 0 different addresses involved .
neutral	automated email said item dispatched and gave postage tracking_information - this said royal_mail had been told that the item was going to be sent , but they hadn_'_t received it .
negative	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing around to sort this on valentines morning .
neutral	i '_ve bought stuff from honour and worn it on stage during gigs and have had umpteen comments about how fantastic i look .
positive	she was very polite , helpful and quick to source the problem and fix it for us .
negative	i ' ve called npower twice - to set_up my account and then to find out about the next bill and both_times it was quite humiliating and unpleasant experience .
neutral	the car was provided by avis / budget at perugia airport .

neutral	i also think the instruction booklet could be improved .
negative	!
neutral	expedia , you seriously need to sort out your customer_service .
negative	they underestimated the length of the job by 0 days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
positive	the site is very cool and clever with a great breadth of listings that i ' ve used .
neutral	why did i have to phone and chase .
negative	my order was pending for many days .
positive	the pc arrived much faster_than i anticipated at an excellent price , everything was good until my graphics_card was showing major artifacts , i contacted cyberpower and they responded almost_instantly ( email ) and sent dpd the next_day to pick_up the card then the day after i had a new card , very quick service .
neutral	you also need to choose

neutral	.
negative	i heard talktalk was a decent company , so i went with them .
neutral	the company were spot on despite the cock ups , and issued a refund me without any fuss .
positive	she said they were an excellent price and i like the taste of them .
positive	het produkt ( moeilijk verkrijgbaar in uk ) was gemakkelijk te vinden op de website en ook de telefonische service was vlot en behulpzaam .

positive	delivery , value for money , excellent product , size .

positive	fast browsing for a range of unique titles
positive	couldn_'_t ask for more .
neutral	i also notice that because they do not search low_cost airlines a bit of independent research on jet star ( australia ) and air asia ( asia ) will yield better deals especially if trying to get from a hub airport to regional centres .
neutral	however it involved serveral calls to the customer_service helpline to register and change over from payg to pay_monthly .

neutral	the items i ordered were a good price and delivered quickly , but when i tried to checkout and get the free delivery , i wasn_'_t able to click on the free option - it said i needed to spend a certain_amount to get the service free , but then changed the amount and even when i had spent that amount , wouldn_'_t let me put the discount on .
neutral	only friction was that they only price_match over the phone and not through allocating a special one - use discount_code to use on their website .

neutral	when i requested a resend / refund of these items , i was refunded half what i was owed , and was then no repsonded to again .

neutral	now the problems are sorted ( while having my local watchmaker fix the issues he found a few more minor faults such as a loose minute hand , dry caseback seal , stem and crown not engageing properly etc .) i am now happy with the watch and the outcome , however i feel i have to be honest in this review and possibly suggest that the watches need to be inspected to a higher standard before being sold - or any_issues be clearly_stated on the item description .
negative	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer_service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
negative	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .

positive	would def use this service again
negative	i bought a dress from debenhams over a week ago , it was in their sale section and it was just what i was looking for to wear at an upcoming wedding .
negative	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
negative	when we rang to find out why we were told that it was delivered but no - one was in which is an outright lie - we were in all day practically sitting by the window waiting as it was that important to us !
neutral	i think they are good value for money for delivered flowers and will use them again .

neutral	so i ' ll echo what someone said about their order fulfillment system -- they do not necessarily have the stock shown on their website .
neutral	hopefully , things have improved .
positive	absolutely no_problems at all .
negative	you have no control of which hire company you will be introduced to , many will demand a very high deposit if you do not pay for additional_insurance , this will often not be returned .

positive	ordered at 0pm and goods were delivered next_day free of charge .
neutral	the lower payment only insures up to £_00 , which i couldn_'_t risk as the phone goes through the system in massively advertised mazuma bag .
positive	never_heard of this company before googling the shoes i wanted but glad i found them .
negative	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .
negative	if you do as the company suggests and get stuff delivered before you get a date for fitting then check everything and thoroughly - do not wait for your fitter and if you are disabled then get some strong men to be there for delivery and check it for you .

negative	regards
neutral	the invoice shows fedex in fact it yodel .

neutral	prices are good , but don_'_t order from them if you ' re in a hurry .
positive	very fast service and good products
positive	an extremely professional , knowledgeable , helpful & pleasent company to deal with .
neutral	i felt_compelled to come here to warn_people that paying for express delivery does not mean you will get your item any faster , all it means is that you ' ll get it the next_day after they ' ve actually picked , packed and dispatched it .

negative	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
negative	despite their advertised turnaround time of 0 days , repairs0 seems to be completely unable to source parts .

negative	they sent another product with lower ink volumes and that was cheaper_than i paid for with no explanation in the package .
negative	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
positive	also that after having a disc delivered and returned they just made the same film available for instant viewing , this happened at_least four times .

positive	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .

positive	just_eat has changed the away the british order take_aways , no stocking up on menu ' s , there all located in one handy site , the only recommendation i could give is just_eat needs to show the takeaways food hygiene score , other than that just_eat do an amazing job , they are trust_worthy , honest and outstanding , pure brilliance and idiot_proof .
positive	erling andersen
negative	or for further cost they can repair it properly .

negative	overall a very poor experience for a first time home owner & i definitely wouldnt recommend using first_utility .
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending autoglass .
negative	ordered collection and delivery for several items .
neutral	after a few_days i noticed that my order had not yet shipped .
negative	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
negative	she , unhappily , rescheduled the delivery for ten_days_later .
positive	has nick from devon really been to the same restaurant 0 times in a week , given everything 0 out of 0 but left no comments ?!

negative	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
neutral	mazuma i think you could have gave a littel more ?
negative	i ordered this globe 0 - 0 weeks before fathers day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
positive	seamless customer journey thought entire web_page , does exactly_what it says on the tin , no robbing card charges like some other online ' extra ' ' holiday ' booking services and the customer_service is fabulous to boot too , the competitors could do with learning from the fhr example for great customer_service and customer experience , and i know this from experience !!!
neutral	being a loyal_customer i expect good service .
neutral	i have to use paypal as i have an ebay account , otherwise i would not use .
positive	friendly , direct communication with a fast response time .
negative	i want to scream out very loud .
neutral	i make a lot of orders and speak to a lot of stores regarding the issues i ' ve received , i find stores are more helpful on the phone rather_than via e_- mail where you tend to be ignored .
negative	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
positive	but i must_say i have no_complaints .
neutral	not a particularly easy drive in towns .
negative	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
positive	adam was very helpful and was able to provide me with an annuity which was quite a bit more than that quoted by my pension_provider .
positive	in summary , a beautiful villa , managed by a fantastic company , and outstanding value for money ( especially when booked last_minute !)
neutral	even for a fiver i expected to last for a bit longer !
neutral	i now rate 0stars as the experience wasnt great but i can not fault the product itself as its bloody lovely stuff .
negative	!
negative	it '_s also eye opening that trustpilot is also bottom in the marks of their own rating comparison !
neutral	oh well , never mind .
positive	d
negative	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
positive	excellent quality at a really reasonable price .
neutral	after informing watchfinder of the problems , we exchanged some emails and agreed a solution - email exchange was a little slower for sorting_out an issue than it was forming the deal .
positive	easy to use site and very fast delivery
negative	the woman i spoke to would not budge on this even after i kicked up an enormous fuss .
neutral	call back i received c - s hanged the phone leaving me on line like an_idiot .
negative	in the end i had to buy a new psu so had to remove the old one as the model number and stickers were not visible which was strange - and i was incredibly shocked to see on removing it that it had been put in upside_down , and there was no venting for the fan , which was there after all , to exhaust out of the bottom of the case .
positive	hello im playing fifa_00 world_cup and i been buying fifa points to unlock players but is expensive . i have bit concern about where to buy try to aboid an scam . but finally i choose mooga by recommendation and is great . i bought 000000k and i got it in 0 minutes . highly_recommend it guys and going to buy more i finished my coins already hahha .
negative	the blonde , 00 something year_old woman behind the glass window was rude , cold and frankly . completely_useless .
negative	i have been with this company since they took over tiscali .
neutral	while i haven_'_t been altogether pleased with my interactions as a new customer of e_- careers , due specifically to misinformation being provided both on the website and in e_- mails , i can say that this second need to contact them on chat was met with a helpful staff person who provided a speedy resolution .
neutral	i suggest calling before purchasing to check their stock_availability is correct .
positive	great service and speedy_delivery .
neutral	not so good if you fall foul of their rules and can get expensive .
positive	!
neutral	i used " live_chat " to find out how to find the fedex tracking_number , and had to search the pdf file for the information , and guess which was the second tracking_number .

negative	i come to hull and it ' s shit .
negative	i joined wowcher and the deals were very tempting .
negative	i wrote to simplyelectronics asking them to replace the playbook .
neutral	think ill stick with my local flower shop next time .
neutral	if you do take out a policy read the small_print and set yourself a reminder 00 months on to look into the renewal and cancel if necessary .
negative	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
negative	this has to be the poorest delivery company to grace this planet .
negative	as i write i am_currently being billed by both europa , and telfonica for the same line_rental .
positive	i went straight home and ordered for my own wedding .
neutral	very slow customer service .
positive	a very good selection of items and it is reassuring that you don_'_t lose half your refund in return postage if anything you order is not quite suitable for you
negative	i am expecting compensation from you due to the reasons i have highlighted above .
positive	excellent service
positive	i recently_bought an electronic drum_kit for myself , excellent price on the website and such fast , free delivery .
positive	couldnt be eny happyer with the prices thx .
negative	then the final time 0th or 0th time i flipped and had enough .
positive	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
neutral	in future i will avoid ebuyer which is a great shame because they have great products at good prices .
negative	nobody has updated me with the situation of my order .
positive	very happy , thanks .
neutral	i do not understand .
neutral	unfortunately , one of the features of this company is that they restrict the mode and content of communication .
neutral	of course at the end of the day , the site ' s primary objective is to make money , even if it means deviously manipulating customers and being purpousfully discreet and incoherent about certain things *_cough * shippingtimes *_cough *
negative	still yet to arrive !!
neutral	the service from the cabin_crew on route to athens was forgettable but the crew on the way back was lovely .
neutral	i buy online regularly and have never ever had any_problems with deliveries but dpd ones .
neutral	unfortunately for me , it did mean i had to spend three entire days at home waiting for a product .
negative	customer service very slow too .
neutral	the articles are for the very dumb and i used to love their communities , but no more everyone has their own place and yahoo has fallen behind .
positive	it was really easy to order them and i got them earlier_than i expected .
neutral	i ordered a black tablet in december ready for a christmas_present but it never arrived .
neutral	i will admit i did not sit in the store reading the owners handbook and the very nice man who sold me the goods told me that it was a book on how to look after the furniture not about returns .
neutral	this year however when i was due to renew my subscription i was confronted with a gobsmacking price of £_00 . 00 for the latest internet security pack when i have been paying little less_than £_00 the past years .
positive	it sold paper - pads and pads of it in all sizes , plain , lined and most deliciously squared .
negative	then i asked them to get me a full_refund as they promised .
negative	nobody did .
positive	i don ' t want that first sentence to sound crazy so i ' ll explain , i was buying 0 rtd muscle_milk drinks a day and they were 0 for $ 0 , well the protein i just bought had 00 servings and simple math showed me i saved 000_dollars compared to buying them the way i was .
positive	there prices are one of the best on the internet with free delivery and i do like to check a number of sites , including comparison_sites .
positive	you just need to research your prices !
positive	excellent company to deal with i would highly_recommend them .
neutral	i would say you need to go into the shop instead of online if you need something in a decent time
positive	the free presents were not bad either !
positive	will use again !
positive	just got a dell d000 from val u computers and had great service .
positive	i ordered on monday and the item was delivered on wednesday .
neutral	so , guess_what ?
positive	i will re visit the site to see if you have one available .
positive	good selection of products on the site , simple process to order .
positive	these also proved an unwise choice .
neutral	the point isnthat the item was not sold with a description of ex - demo or used and saying it was a sale item was misleading .
positive	the technician kept in touch to let me know when he would be arriving and he did indeed arrive within that time .
neutral	i guess i should have known though with the price i paid ( very cheap ).
positive	i ordered this on a thursday and to keep the price down , used their 0 - 0 day delivery service and as this was an expensive monitor their checking service as well .
neutral	the cameras at luton had no problem .
negative	et oui , vous comprendrez bien , après l ' heure c ' est plus l ' heure !!
negative	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
negative	i found it doesn ' t match the size of my laptop .
neutral	0 .
neutral	had to insist that he checked it before i departed .
neutral	!
negative	the ' hotline ' as advertised goes straight to voicemail always .
negative	the items i sell are priced to sell so i am no interested in offers .
neutral	so no items , and no refund !
positive	good all_round !
negative	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
neutral	so because they wanted to save £ 0 , i needed to find about £_000 until their refund worked its way back and someone felt the urge to send me a cheque which of course would take a further 0 days to clear and mean i had to travel 00 miles to a bank to pay it in .
positive	and i couldn ' t believe_how cheap it was .
neutral	quality is similar to coats sold in a big discount clothing chain from the uk beginning with p . honestly , for that price you can get better coats from a department store .
neutral	paid for and printed the label no problem .
positive	but i found cash my gadget on a google_search and wow good price and super friendly service :)
positive	wow !
neutral	they had what i wanted at a price that couldn_'_t be beat .
negative	nothing else to say other than avoid them .
negative	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
positive	great experience buying a present of prada glasses from fashion eyewear recently .
neutral	it was label as used , but it was far more used that advertised .
positive	will_definitely order with them again !
neutral	!
positive	easy payment , speedy_delivery .
positive	good product , great service and excellent communication .
negative	definitely wouldn ' t recommend , avoid at all costs !
negative	i for one will never use them again . goodbye sereneta , go and ruin someone_else '_s day !
positive	one of the few internet game retailers with telephone support , which i remember being fantastic when i needed it a few_years_ago .
negative	the man has complete attitude !
positive	brilliant , fast service from mazuma .
neutral	she thought the flowers and cake were beautiful .
negative	well vodafone i would like to say that me and all my employees will now be getting orange phones so say good buy to your £_000 per_month .
negative	meanwhile , they had moved speedily to take the money out of my account .
neutral	-----------------------------------------------------
neutral	look at what i spend , and try to come up with discounts which as i order i can pass on to them .
positive	i highly_recommend every_aspect of lovekimono – great customer_service , great product and great quality !
positive	they arrived on the date stated and at the time stated .
negative	no delivery so we asked for a refund .
neutral	i feel that i ' m being conned .
negative	this is the worst company ever !!
negative	so i thought why not give a try .
negative	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get hold of my daughters school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
positive	if you are the kind of gal who likes a frequent change of hand_luggage , then boohoo is the place to indulge your passion !
negative	cannot_believe i wasted £_000 on these_guys .
positive	could not fault it .
negative	vm '_s " customer service " assumes that the customer is clueless , and lies to their customers by telling them that there '_s " nothing wrong ", or " it '_s your fault - your computer must be faulty ", usually refusing to progress faults because " nobody_else in your street has complained "!
neutral	the first time i had to contact someone to resolve an issue with enabling my account , i relayed that i ' d been given incorrect_information , and it was met with an ' oh well ' attitude .
negative	!
neutral	estimated time of delivery 00 / 00 /_0000 , date today 00 / 00 /_0000 , still no email to say the item has been despatched .
positive	i purchased assassins creed from gameseek and when it arrived in the mail the package was open and empty .
positive	also , they always do as they promise .
negative	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
positive	they had exactly_what i wanted and my order was delivered earlier_than_expected .
neutral	there were also several errors during the assessments , which made the task of completing them incredibly difficult .
neutral	contacted marks who advised us to contact the manufacturer ( neff ).
negative	unfortunately almost every viewing request we ' ve received has been for that day , not providing the 00_hours notice they are legally required to give .
neutral	all in all a good website and range of products .
positive	excellent service .
neutral	i immediately sent an_email and created a ticket stating that there had not been a delivery .
negative	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
neutral	i have done grocery_shopping with them to tune of £_000 and still had to pay delivery !
neutral	no compensation , or no voucher off my next order .
positive	this site is honestly a lifesaver when it comes to planning my trips !!
negative	will never buy from infurn again and am telling the world not to buy either
negative	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
neutral	the quality of your products are very high and there are no negatives with this aspect .
negative	so i immediatley sent and e_- mail giving the correct postcode only to be told ( via_email ) that i can '_t alter anything as the order had been dispatched .
neutral	i ' ve had many different experiences with citylink , my first few experiences were atrocious and i said i would never use them again .
negative	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
positive	they had the lowest_price for the machine i was after and best all_round service .
negative	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
neutral	google_chrome is not so good .
neutral	no problem as i was advised in advance .
neutral	phoned up a few_days_later as i was away when order arrived and was told they would re - print & resend , that was last thursday .
positive	love paypol what more can i say
neutral	hope not to be disappointed next time !
neutral	price , s are lately more than shopping around myself or using another comparison_sites .
negative	returned them by post (£ 0 . 00 ) as both stoppers kept rising out of the bottles rendering them useless .
negative	edit - i felt a bit harsh for originally awarding them one star and revised it up to two , but since they ' ve left a pretty useless ' response ' trying to justify their behaviour i ' m putting it back to one again .
positive	tom benjamin
positive	excellent service .
positive	was looking for a north_face plasma thermal jacket but noted at their shop in covent_garden the price was £_000 .
neutral	little squashed and uncomfortable .
negative	i placed an order on saturday for 0xbasin taps !
neutral	:_d
neutral	now how can i do that when they don ' t come on time , don ' t deliver it to the right person or even have my name on it ?
positive	i registered my interest on the chillisauce website and was contacted ( on a sunday !)
negative	still disappointed overall .
positive	i found the website very easy to use the pre_- paid envelope arrived the next_day , i posted it off and the money was in my account the same day they acknowledged receipt of my phone . you cant_beat that for service very fast and efficient .
positive	perfekt og professionel service !
positive	oh and reidys price pledge , honoured , so ultimately an_absolute bargain !
neutral	website said my items were in stock so i ordered , received an_email_stating the goods were not available for three_weeks .
positive	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything went well and will be ordering again soon .
neutral	when i phoned protect_your bubble ( less_than 00_hours after the disappearance ) i was asked to send my proof of purchase , a screenshot of the ipod being registered as lost on immobilise , and the serial_number to them via_email , which i did .
neutral	all the wood slats remained intact , but some of the metal had been poorly soldered together , and had snapped right along the middle .
neutral	bought 0 times here and both a let_down .
negative	bought a computer from these and it developed a fault after 0 weeks .
positive	top_marks !
positive	my order was made with no_fuss , all very straightforward . delivery quick . lights are just what i want . well pleased !!
positive	thanks for all the help :) its much_appreciated
neutral	other on - line clothing companies offer free returns which i think is only fair when you are ordering goods which may or may not fit .
neutral	after 0 days i emailed them again and suggested that they ignore my first email as i was no_longer prepared to do_business with a company with such an appalling lack of customer service .
negative	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
negative	after 00 months of hassle , i eventually had to pay up 000_euros to avoid having to go through the trauma of contesting this in court .
neutral	again with no response did i finally get my key .
neutral	but after 00mins of waiting he needed to get back to work so phoned my mum who was unaware of what we had ordered but lived around the corner so could pop down .
neutral	i did this but it was a complete disaster .
positive	no_fuss , great service , great price .
negative	it is totally unfair .
neutral	this seems to be another one of those .
negative	so far i ' m up to about 00 emails to this company trying to sort_out a refund .
neutral	i immediately emailed to point out the error , this was not responded to until after i had received notification that my order was on its way .
negative	perhaps woolovers could_learn a few lessons in quality sweaters from places like marks and spencer and topshop .
negative	judith
negative	we then have to contact customers to ask them would they mind emailing trustpilot to prove the reviews are real !
neutral	what lets the side down is the uninformed wait , my order has_been stuck on unfulfilled since i placed it and it is due tomorrow , when i wrote to complain i was told it was in transit from their european hub , well tell me that on the website , all i can assume is that you don_'_t have stock if you do not keep me informed .
negative	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
negative	i ' ve had the unfortunate experience of having several parcels come ( or not !)
neutral	but in general the computer looks great , performs great and i am very
negative	they are now owned by a company named cartrawler of dublin who '_s customer service department are experts at refusing to assist if any_problems are experienced , their stock reply is holiday_autos are only an introductory agent , your contract is with the rental company .
negative	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
negative	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
positive	ordered yesterday and received the very next_day .
neutral	website is slow and everything out of stock
positive	great products and service all delivered in a helpful and friendly fashion .
negative	after over four weeks ( 00 / 00 ) i recieved half my order which included the fermenting barrel but with no tap and a note saying the tap would follow .
positive	it has paid off , i liked the personalised service you get right from the first phone call .
neutral	the reason_why i asked about date certainty was that for my last three visits to cabot circus i was called to reschedule my appointment ' due to lack of staff '.
positive	the dealings with this company have been excellent .
neutral	overall i think they are a good company but as with all courier companies the customer_service is pretty poor .
positive	the community on sky_poker is excellent !
negative	there is no address to write to .
positive	title explains it all , i ' m really happy with the fast service and good offers they have :)
negative	okay these things happen but it has taken them 0 months to admit it and now they don_'_t want to take_responsibility .
neutral	the monitor did not arrive on the second day .
negative	because i lost only about £ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
negative	they should never have taken my money or promised to supply it .
positive	chatroom .
negative	.
neutral	incidentally , due to microsoft ' s implied actions during the xbox one ' s launch - interestingly reserved but reflective of their intentions as a corporate body - and the relation of these to my experience , i obviously avoided them as i do not want to support these implicit principles in action - very constrictive to the consumer ' s ownership , their rights to be flexible with their purchase .
negative	you even get points when you buy food , which we used to do every friday , i spent my points on something and i am still_waiting for the goods ( 0 years nearly ) everytime i ask they say they are still sorting it out .
negative	this time i was told i would not need a credit_card too pick_up the car .
positive	aku harap konfirmasi ke email , facebook , atau twitter datang secepatnya .
negative	cancelled order but they still took the money and no refund to date .
negative	products dispatched within 00_hours ?
negative	this has to be for a reason !
positive	i ordered a custom sized mirror from this company ' s website .
positive	it was by luck that i came_across hostelbrokers , but it saved me 00_% on any price on other_sites for my room in sydney , after i had spent hours comparing .
positive	check value
negative	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem . which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
negative	just don ` t do it !!!
negative	the two to doncaster were perfect , great staff i got what i paid for .
negative	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
positive	ideal supplier !!
negative	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
neutral	if i had been serviced in a more friendly , warm and flexible manner - given the history i have of buying great products and being serviced well in the past when they had a store - i would have scored a 00 !
positive	finally i have phone again after more_than 0 months as an ipod .
negative	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
negative	!
negative	i do not value their customer_relations much after this experience .
negative	fast forward to innumerable and unsatisfactory calls including me taking time off and waiting in all afternoon for an a no - show engineer ( he went to the cab and it was too hard from him , so i subsequently discovered ).
neutral	i got my order the next_day .
positive	as promised i found the item cheaper elsewhere and internet gardener matched the price and offered a cover at a reduced price .
negative	initially this company seemed perfectly businesslike and professional prior to taking my payment .
positive	jessica helped with all my problems , of which i seemed to have left my head somewhere_else today and had a few problems , she was friendly and extremely_helpful .
negative	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort out any complaints or issues they cause !
negative	just a bad bad_experience , and i have used them regularly for a good few_years to know this .
positive	i am very impressed with the whole order process from the easy to use web_site , full of great information , to the speed of delivery and the quality of products , this company is really on the ball !
negative	we thought we were getting a really good deal going with this company and my sister organised everything and we paid the money for the hen_night .
positive	fast_shipping .
negative	wowcher will confirm that i have bought loads of deals and found them quite a few clients ( family and friends ) but customer_service is almost non_existant , imagine from october to december i am no closer to this issue being resolved .
positive	the quality and price of the outfits are very good .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	i was told my delivery would be in 0 to 00 days .
positive	previously a happy blackcircles customer until i discovered tyreleader who offer more choice of tyre , a better price , excellent product , excellent service and free delivery .
neutral	i ' m trying to get an answer regarding faulty porcelain that i ' ve received for 0 weeks already but with no response .
negative	had 0 different experiences with collectplus - alas , both extremely poor .
positive	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot on .
neutral	will change star_rating now !
negative	not even fully with first_utility yet but after a week of trying to contact them im heading back to my previous_supplier .
negative	where to start .
positive	repairs turned around quickly and hassle_free .
positive	hostelbookers were great , cheaper_than hostelworld and without any extra fees .
positive	every_single order has arrived the next_day without_fail .
positive	high_quality product , great price , professional service .
neutral	i also was given the wrong_size washing powder .
neutral	there '_s no clear outside dining space unless you want to sit at the bottom of the garden and the barbecue area is the other side of the garden .
neutral	she was a total delight to talk to , and appeared to understand exactly why i was so cross .
neutral	i then googled hammonds customer reviews – so many complaints along similar lines .
positive	this complete service and access to a range of services was a huge advantage of dealing through pimlico_plumbers .
negative	after over 00 days waiting , this is what we received from expedia :
neutral	not yet received order
neutral	i ordered the item and was given a delivery date which was fine .
neutral	if i had i would ' ve used my home address .
neutral	0 .
negative	another 00_minutes on hold , during my break , i gave up .
neutral	i wish they would be more transparent .
negative	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable company .
negative	at this point it was getting late so i asked again if i would have my glasses the same day .
negative	avoid like the plague !
positive	second order , got an anti_- fraud check .
positive	after booking my parcel , i stumbled on these reviews .
positive	the bigboy bean_bag is a great accessory for any lounge !
neutral	they are different no_longer .
negative	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
negative	it ' s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
negative	the van with my furniture is apparently at the garage being fixed and i may !!!!
neutral	i got your phone number from a previous response and spoke to your colleague .
positive	answered all my questions .!
negative	the delivery guy was smoking and took his time to give me the parcel to sign .
positive	the items came in very good packaging making_sure my stuff was safe and will recommend this site
negative	!
positive	after a lot of research i decided to use moo - and i ' ve never been happier with an end_result like this at an affordable price .
neutral	i really loved the chicken sausages .
negative	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
neutral	the metro was creamy rather_than white and it came chipped which hasn ' t filled me with the greatest confidence when ordering .
neutral	third - the big bluebottle in the ointment - customer service - appalling !
negative	most of the time i ' m not even eligible for their surveys , yet they give them to me anyway ( at most one per week ).
negative	!
neutral	i asked on a number of occasions for a refund !
neutral	the colour was ( just about ) right , but the material quality is very poor .
neutral	still a great place to go items at christmas it has great items
positive	ordered a gibson sg 0000 , it arrived within two days . the packing was very good and the guitar was well_protected .
neutral	cost was fully refunded which was unexpected & more than fair .
neutral	if you buy from here , unpack everything and inspect on receipt or next_day , it is a pain but could save you lots .
neutral	these messages very quickly ( by next_morning ) produced results , in rapid succession : one message_saying ' status of order updated to awaiting despatch ', two more saying there had been a delay in stock coming in but this had now been received ' and a final one at 00am the same morning ( 0th_dec ) saying despatched .
negative	don ' t even get me started on the customer_service in store as well .

negative	edgar gorospe jr .
negative	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
neutral	both
positive	all in all a 0 star service .
neutral	actual delivery is cheap enough but , like rip - off ryanair , by the time i added insurance ( which didn_'_t cover the full value of the item ) and signature - on - delivery , the cost more than doubled so a bit of a con really .

positive	as with most stag organisers i immediately went straight to the british based tour companies with their flashy websites , easy payment options and – as i found out – cringingly flirtatious and patronising staff .
negative	i booked my delivery and got the parcel posted straight_away .
positive	i played on 000 a few_times now and they have always been fair and allowed me to withdraw my money promptly .

neutral	would i recommend , yes - but be prepared for substitute even if the site says in stock .
neutral	the second item was a ' b_grade ' ex - display turntable .
negative	it is unlikely that they will do anything being useless too , but at_least it logs into the statistical volume of complaints about these rogue companies .
neutral	i still shop in store at sainsburys but will be hesitiant to use their online service for groceries .
negative	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .

neutral	i ordered 0 bags of 00 kg compost and 0 00 kg compost and a fair bit of other stuff as being in a wheelchair i thought it would be easier . ordering was simple and i ordered for next_day delivery which i got , but there was nothing on the website about the delivery guy not going to deliver the big bags to the door just because he had to walk about 0 ft , he said if he had know he would of brought his sack truck ( eh why do they not carry this anyway ) and i wasn_'_t asked when placing the order how far he would have to walk , he also said we a delivery_men not removal men . anyway he delivered the items and i told him to put them in the bedroom as its a bungalow and is nearer to the door he was using . and no way was he going to take them out the back . i would use wilkinsons again . just hope don_'_t get the same happy delivery .

neutral	if you ask the staff do not expect any help !
neutral	orders placed before_midday will be dispatched the same day if the product is shown to be " in stock " on our website when you place your order ."
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 you can raise the issue with the yodel direct online web chat team and they will be able to book the collection in for you as well .
neutral	i have spoken to trading standard and they told me that i could ask for the items to be replaced and if they will not do this to ask for my money back , now comes another catch , i bought my dining_room chair in a set of 0 and as they come in pairs they have told me that i can send back 0 , i can '_t send them all back as i have already had the goods for 0 days and they are not faulty .
neutral	however the shop is overpriced and i can usually find the same goods elsewhere for less money .
negative	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0 days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
neutral	overall , fair service , saves a lot of money but needs growth
neutral	update 00 / 00 /_0000 : following posting this review i was contacted by oaklandfurntiures media dept who had seen this review and others i have posted , a very nice lady_called grace was now dealing_with my problem , i explained in detail what had happened and how i felt the after_sales_team were hostile and bordering on aggressive and refsued to offer me anything but a repair .
positive	very easy and smooth website to use .
positive	can '_t wait for this time next year so i can order another one !
positive	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .

positive	great range of high_quality products at good prices and everything i need for my sign making business all in one place .
neutral	eva
positive	good car , perfect for our needs .
positive	my new favorite supplement website .
positive	payment process and delivery were faultless .
positive	i found this lg after googling for a while and ebuyer had the best price and free delivery too as a special , which made it even better .
neutral	i used to sell them in the markets 00 years_ago so they are nothing new .
positive	it was a gift for my hubby who loved it .
negative	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
negative	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
positive	can ' t fault betfair .
neutral	they never deliver to our farm , citing ' access problem ' on their web_site .
neutral	in addition to this , the website will randomly and spuriously change ( free ) delivery so that you have to delete and rebuild your basket ; the site will log you out for no reason in the middle of buying .
neutral	you get what you pay for
positive	the only thing i need now is a holdall to carry it in .
positive	thank_you , hostel_bookers , for providing me with the information i need to make future_bookings at this hostel on my own .
positive	great product and great service , will_definitely use them again .
positive	never_heard of ebookers before and was going to book for my holiday , me and husband could only think of lastminute . com , expedia and opodo .
negative	she told me the driver will be back by two .
negative	avoid , avoid , avoid .
neutral	it just dooesn ' t work like that on there , it ' s not professional at all .
positive	i could not fault her .
positive	once i ' d received the e_- mail a valid code was delivered in next to no time and that ' s it , done .
neutral	price range can vary a lot but everything ive gotten from here has been really nice !
positive	abousuley brilliant service and very helpfull spoken to a lady catherine_corless and she was so helpfull and talked me threw it step by step .
negative	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
positive	it '_s great to find such an unusual choice of children '_s clothes , especially for boys !
negative	the phones just been ringing and then the line drops .
positive	moreover , the customer_service team are friendly , helpful and easy to get in touch with .
negative	i will_certainly be telling everyone i come into contact with to avoid these_people like the plague and will always regret changing over to them in the first place .
positive	i would definitely_use this company again and have no_hesitation in recommending them .
negative	they will not deliver your items , they will not respond to your raised support tickets and they are dodging refunds that are necessary due to their awful service .
positive	always pleased with the service i receive , and always impressed with the knowledge of the support staff .
negative	all in all a total disgrace , would never use them again .
neutral	eventually i chased down the details of delivery ( had to phone up , which is not good ) and everything was arranged and delivered .
neutral	then sit at pc on facebook .
neutral	why should i have to provide my email address or my phone number ?
positive	loads of choice and an easy to navigate site !
positive	returns service also very good , with immediate_refund where neccessary .
neutral	they are often one of the same companies offering the item through marketplace and the price drop will presumably be paid by - for want of a better phrase - not having to pay the merchant fees associated with selling through big websites .
positive	fast payment , easy transaction .
positive	next_day delivery , great communication - highly_recommended *****
negative	david_: you are like a robot , and follow rules but this is no joke repeating the same answer , please can some one superior contact me on phone number
neutral	i google the previous address and it was some company in france from ellosis lab ??
positive	thank_you !!
negative	next_day , i waited for a call .
negative	now in the process of taking this company to court .
positive	i used their customer_service once too , and my experience of that was fantastic .
neutral	setting_up an account and funding it was easy and i got the welcome_bonus no problem , but that is about it for good points .
negative	i wondered_if that was covered_under_warranty ?
positive	i found this website and did research .
neutral	service is valid and they don_'_t try to screw you with non covered bs .
positive	we have been with viziononline for approx 0 years now .
positive	confirmation , info sheets and documents were in my email inbox within half an_hour .
positive	the ordering .
negative	my husband took out contracts on 0 phones in june .
negative	strange way to operate !!
neutral	these tickets were sent by royal_mail recorded delivery
negative	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
positive	had blind back in a week .
neutral	twice now , in the last few_months at stansted , your cameras have not read my numberplate , creating delay on exit .
negative	birmingham parcelforce depot have given me excuses ranging from , the parcel was outsourced to another courier , the driver has no mobile and no means of communication in his van , a manager has_gone out with the driver to locate the parcel etc .
positive	had my phone repaired here recently .
negative	there is no telephone_number to speak to anybody and i have sent three emails asking where my goods are and no reply .
positive	the staff were knowledgeable , personable , and courteous , and put me completely at ease .
neutral	if ever i were to purchase another wetsuit i would consider_using this firm again : but one wetsuit in a life time should be enough , surely .
positive	highly_recommended .
negative	the customer_service is the worse thing ever !
negative	tickets were unsuccessfully delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 by royal_mail ( 0 days before the show ) to the wrong_address after i did an address change on their website 0 weeks previous after lots of worry_about not being home .
neutral	hermes are rubbish .
negative	i now see my chairs are not due for delivery until march having received assurance they would arrive in january it will be nearly a full year since i placed my order and have had the delivery time changed 0 times this is unacceptable i have contacted the bank and my laywer there is no point valerie in contacting me unless you have a definite date for delivery or assurance of full_refund in the next week
positive	i ordered my items early a . m . 0th_dec , they were delivered before 00 : 00 the very next_day .
neutral	now i realise that the fault here was with fedex , but i had contacted p0g " live_chat " again in the meantime to find out what was going on .
negative	and now after using the gazebo just 0 times , the poles inside have snapped and the welding has come a part - something you cannot just fix yourself .
neutral	i had to call them and wait on the line for like 00_minutes until the security stop from the order was cleared .
neutral	the tickets arrived after 00 days of waiting , and 0 days after i recieved a message that they had been dispatched .
neutral	he said he had done that .
negative	for this reason the senior members , directors , ceo ' s , owners should be ashamed of how you run your business and what you see as acceptable . you may think you have a great product but just read all your poor reviews week after week . surely you have some integrity , some part of you that says " hold up , something really is wrong here " ???
neutral	we had one 00 minute ride on the dirt - buggies , which also happened to be slow and considerably more dull than we expected .
neutral	all resolved fine the next_day - but our expectation of immediate delivery was not .
positive	the free date change is a really good perk - you don ' t know until you get somewhere how long you are going to need so we used it a couple of times .
negative	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
positive	i bought a beko_dishwasher through appliances on line just before_christmas .
neutral	i ' ve left my original review below but things have not gone as well this time .
negative	!
negative	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
positive	i have always received my orders on time or early and find their service excellent .
positive	and always dispatch fast .
positive	amazon is the best place to shop
positive	! whenever i have a phone to sell it will_definitely be through mazumamobile
negative	what a load of rubbish that is , the cost of pillows is under £ 0 .
positive	on ocasions i sometimes get it a day before_release_date which i find amazing and is really good to show my friends on psn that i , ve the game early or on time .
neutral	still in its packing so it does not get damaged during move .
negative	i would not recommed them 0 anyone .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , they took too long to get back to me , meaning the code wasn ' t valid anymore .
neutral	express delivery slower_than they say
negative	its clear just_eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
neutral	neither complaint was dealt_with .
negative	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
positive	this was the first time we used the site so were a bit_worried until the goods arrived on time well_packaged and good condition .
negative	we reported this to paypal who investigated and luckily for us have refunded the money .
negative	addition 0 . 00 . 00
negative	did you read my review ?
neutral	hey
neutral	sorry novatech , but you ' re not like amazon or ebay , i only found you on the backend of a google_search .
negative	rang city_link to ask why ?
neutral	i ' ve stopped gonig in there but if money isn ' t a problem for you , the shopping_experience is good .
neutral	she - ' sorry .
positive	overall a fantastic company with clued in , professional and courteous staff ( i dealt_with wendy , russell and tom ).
negative	after calling and explaining no one was there , they said it was delivered to a neighbour but the agency driver was off for 0 days so they wouldn ' t be able to find out which neighbour it was delivered to until then .
neutral	sadly
negative	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
negative	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
neutral	i am a regular buyer and seller , it ' s mostly straight_forward , but as a seller it is sickening to see the % cut they take when you sell expensive items , especially if you have paypal as well .
negative	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
negative	i ordered , on 00 / 0 / 00 a kingsize bed which was supposed to be in stock as it was under clearance and 0 bedside_tables .
neutral	wouldn ' t use it again as i would just ring around next time as that ' s what i ended_up doing anyway .
negative	clearly groupon ' s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
neutral	i emailed a picture and suggested better ways of packaging , but did not want a refund ( needed the product ).
neutral	i actually received a telephone_call from achica the morning after i posted the review below , and complained on their facebook_page .
negative	after promising a delivery slot for yesterday and staying in , tracking said they couldn_'_t find my address , even_though postcode was clearly on it !!!
neutral	the process was all fine , no_complaints at all about that .
negative	we talked to other people who had done the same as us , they were all very disappointed .
neutral	offered £_00 discount and repair after 00 days .
positive	though i has no need to use it , the option to " speak to a human "
positive	on each occasions the parcel has_been delivered within in 0 / 0 day window without problems , and the parcel can be tracked at all times from pick_up to delivery .
positive	keeping in touch internationally from mobiles was never affordable unless i got to know about inclusive international_calls .
neutral	i was assured that the missing items would be sent but 0 months later and still nothing .
negative	.& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
negative	please_accept my apologies that we are unable to further your complaint .
neutral	i then had to book somewhere_else to stay .
neutral	the first experience we had was incredibly disappointing .
neutral	had to call to ask . apparently one item out of stock , so order withheld ?
negative	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman ' s , small jacket - i am a man ).
negative	!
negative	my main complaint with this company has been communication which has been appalling .
negative	i have phoned 0 times and got through once to be commisserated with and told someone would contact me to tell me whats_happening . no contact .
negative	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have ' t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone . avoid them !!!!
negative	order number 00000000 .
neutral	the technician arrived as arranged and repaired the windscreen which now looks perfect .
positive	every little helps :)
positive	my order was processed straight_away and put on a rolling order , in that they send me another collar when the old one is running out .
negative	!
neutral	in the rain i might_add .
negative	i have a fiesta which i stupidly decided that kwikfit will be a great place to do a full service on .
negative	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave me another number to call , not all bad . could have just been me !
neutral	however one of them is a let_down .
neutral	first bought a ibanez guitar off gear 0 music , brilliant guitar , arrived on time and also came with a free stand which was handy .
negative	dont order flowers from serenta go to your local supermarket you would get better flowers for less money there
positive	will_definitely use again , thanks :)
negative	this was gareth in pc_world business sheffield .
positive	i ordered three small canvas ' s and they arrived within a week !!
neutral	i have been a great customer to bulk_powders due to the quality of their products and clear nutrition info unlike some other_companies with their proprietry blends .
positive	but justeat is brilliant and we have found some really great local restaurants that we wouldn ' t have known about otherwise :-)
negative	no response .
negative	hi ,
neutral	i also booked the taussauds ticket through your website and none of your staff seemed to know what to do with it and just said keep it until you get to taussauds which didn ' t fill me with confidence .
positive	quality eliquid .
negative	a month to receive an sd_card is crazy .
neutral	ultimately , everything got sorted out and all we had to pay was the admin_fee .
negative	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
positive	also , they are very reasonably_priced and are delivered promptly .
neutral	sold for faulty price .
neutral	overall , make_sure you get the best deal you can when joining orange as a new customer , but perhaps leave when your contract is up for renewal as you are just a sum of money to them .
neutral	delivery & collections are really easy to book , but that can give a false sense of security .
negative	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains lead , just a 0 pin continental plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
positive	you are kept_informed at every_stage , first the date of delivery then , nearer the time , the hourly slot allocated .
negative	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be bothered and i guess someone who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
positive	delivery is always impressively prompt and i am given regular_updates about my order until it arrives .
positive	you are a winning partnership .
neutral	they saved my backside just in time but their international selection is a bit poor and pricey .
neutral	used crc for years and always used to be easy and straight_forward to order anything but lately there seems to be a problem .
negative	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0 weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
neutral	guess it is time to move on to new supplier .
positive	the picture of the costume didn ' t do it justice .
neutral	i have started to ring to see if goods are in stock before ordering as there is no way to check if items are in stock on their website .
positive	viovet is so easy to use and the site is user_friendly with extra tools to help manage re - ordering items on a rotation .
neutral	dx work on times and need to deliver packages .
positive	i eventually received the video_game ( after two_weeks , while it was next_day delivery ) so i returned it .
negative	avoid this company all they do is take your money .
positive	so to sum up our experience if you want to purchase a top_class vehicle with 0st_class customer care and great value for money , deal with chorley group .
negative	an_hour later , still no phone call , i called them again , and was told i would get a refund of £_00 labour and £_00 for the part .
negative	this entire conversation took over 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	they didn ' t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).
positive	this was my first order from yorkshire aquatics , the website was easy to navigate and checkout was simple .
negative	that ' s 000 euro which could be a great deal for me .
positive	i can somrtimes struggle to get the right fit but this suit was perfect .
neutral	if they could not provide the answers they should have said so , rather_than setting_up an expectation and making me call , call and call .
negative	i have not lied once and have facts and proof to back up what i say .
positive	issue resolved straight_away , refund issued , i only rang to get mf to have a word with the courier .
neutral	we had to quickly rush to tube station ( in the pouring rain btw ) and find our way to our destination arriving an_hour late for our dinner .
positive	thanks .
neutral	i thought yodel were the worst but uk mail take some beating .
positive	i literally can ' t complain_about the service scan have provided for me , ( admittedly i do not have the misfortune to need to return or rma anything ).
positive	0st time i have used tyreleader and it won_'_t be the last .
negative	i followed the automated_system for collection .
negative	apparently they were delivered 0 days_later by which point , was too_late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
neutral	i now discover he sent me an_email - which had no information in it .
neutral	all my nerves jangled and i called foul .
negative	i rang the manager of derby optical_express and told him that i would go to the shop so that he can arrange for the refund , he told me that if i go to the shop he will throw me out of the shop .
positive	hi after purchasing from savewatersavemoney i found it nice and smooth to use and the mobile site has been designed well too it was easy to show my girlfriend future_purchases whilst out and about and we now have a good selection for our new property in the summer
neutral	it was an easy process i only had to send a couple of documents and the process behind that was very easy and simple as well .
negative	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for £_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
negative	the landline_number given diverts to a mobile voicemail .
positive	the service was very fast and it was really well_packed ( overkill to be honest but better safe than sorry !)
negative	this was not entirely a surprise to me , not because the phone had ever been near any water and had not been carefully looked after , but because after sending it back to cpw i had looked at some of their reviews and feedback and found that " water ingress " is their favourite way of getting out of honouring guarantees .
negative	i ' ve cried so hard .
positive	fanciedress were great and sent out new costume instantly before i had even sent mines .
positive	well_packed and a coat i ordered was in a big box rather_than just a hanger !
negative	really bad customer_service , store manager rude and not helpful .
neutral	so now i have something to sell on ebay
negative	" unfortunately a manger isn ’ t going to advise you any different , this is a company policy and we all abide_by the same rules ."
neutral	they also put a money off voucher in and i ' m_assuming i ' ll also get a refund so other than the hassle and cost of phoning an 0000 number from a mobby good service from the flower company to be fair to them - couriers need sacking i think .
negative	ie .
positive	i was happy . where else on the net does that happen then >?
positive	i love receiving firebox emails and going on the website .
neutral	was not toldor did not say anything on the website that we had to put them together ourselves this should be clearer on the item .
negative	poor quantity of goods available .
positive	excellent service , great quality , would thoroughly_recommend and will be using in the future !
neutral	the damage to the trays was covered by the polystyrene that is supposed to protect the trays in transit , so was not visible on initial inspection .
neutral	ease to use and for finding friends in any location .
negative	so i came_across this website and got the best price for what i wanted ( sun visor ).
positive	made the booking process very simple and quick .
neutral	what '_s that all about ?
neutral	come on argos , you still have a massive following , dont do what marks & spencer did some years_ago , it takes a long time to get your name back once the usually meek customer turns and walks away .
negative	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it ' s really not worth the risk !
positive	you will love the product and prices . have a good look through the pages you are sure to find lots of goodies .
neutral	due to an admin error between the company and fedex service , my address was logged incorrectly in the system .
neutral	eventually i received my calculators , about 0 - 0 weeks_later .
positive	order no 000000000
positive	the sooner party_krakow invest in a secure payment website similar to their british competitors the better for them ( in my opinion ) as everything else they do is absolutely spot on .
positive	would definitely_recommend .
positive	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
neutral	all is well .
neutral	after i purchased the game i did get the key for steam but after i tried to redeem it , steam said it had already been used , i use cjs_keys because all my other purchases seem to work flawlessly and without_fail , but in this case it wasnt .
negative	i bought a brand_new fridge_freezer in december , the fridge_freezer had an odd smell when it arrived but this was just put down to be being new .
negative	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
negative	half the tv in the seats didnt work , no vegan option for food , a 00 hour flight with no food . come on . it dont take much to cater for veggies and vegans these days
positive	outstanding service ordered and recieved inside 00hrs , brilliant .
negative	the most biased propaganda machine ever , like a chinese water torture the bbc '_s drip drip is fed to the poor audience , who '_s propaganda is it ?
neutral	there wasn_'_t a card through the door door , so had they been stolen , i would never had known that they had been there .
positive	they have done special printing for us of one off things things we ' ve needed like posters or intricate pop ups , and sometimes they even deliver to us by cycle courier in the snow and rain .
positive	ordered some parts .
positive	i was really pleased with the quality of the mug and the speed in which it was delivered .
positive	they have the best prices you will find any where with a wide_variety to chose from .
negative	it worked_fine for 0 months and after that a non stop for the internet problem .
neutral	i corresponded with them via_email due to the hours i worked and on several_occasions asked for adjustments to be made so that the cv they produced was actually set_up for the type of work i was going for .
positive	a rare find these days .
negative	they seem to show goods as available and then order them in to satisfy your order .
positive	never been
neutral	sadly so did a lot of other people -- and finished up queuing in the car_rental hall for 0 hot and angry hours before reaching the goldcar desk .
positive	the customer_service has greatly improved compared to what it was a couple of years back .
negative	i ordered some pandora charms 0 weeks_ago .
neutral	the lancaster sofa bed and armchair are well made and the leather is of excellent quality and i am sure will last for many_years to come .
positive	the service is fast and no friction or fuss .
positive	they '_ve got my vote , great juice , fast delivery and they have paypal .
positive	ich fand meine arbeit mit der suchmaschine .
positive	thank_you
positive	will use lesar again .
neutral	delivery charges are now between £ 0 and £ 0 and this seems like far too much to spend on having my shopping delivered .
positive	excellent staff all very pleasant , welcoming and knowledgeable but not boring !
negative	but on top of that , by the end of my phone call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
negative	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
positive	one very happy customer :) thank_you
negative	ordered placed and paid for 00 august , 0 weeks_later still no delivery , several emails later i am told that once a parcel has left them its in the hands of the royal_mail - no offer of refund but will replace , and take no responsibility if goes astray .
positive	however , the ability to purchase 0 or more per 00_hours would have been ideal .
neutral	- ordered a dark blue oakley jacket and recieved a light baby blue one instead because they didn ' t actually sell a dark blue one ??
neutral	all i want is what i paid for , which cost to me quite a lot of money and took some time to save i want new fault free good is this too much to ask .
neutral	also my phone number was added to the order too just in case however no call either .
neutral	they ' re like your local drug mart , only difference they carry almost everything your drug mart doesn ' t sell and cheaper .
neutral	my only problem was the the scooter control_panel was advertised as blue and even said on the bag it was blue but is actually black .
neutral	this car has an electronic parking brake with an on / off switch .
positive	i placed my order with ease on the very user_friendly and comprehensive website .
positive	no other company in hampshire could
neutral	the jumpers are definitely of lesser quality compared to other brands

neutral	i let her know that her selling techniques were a underhand and that she didn ' t mention any of the costs involved / direct_debit before asking for the account details .
neutral	me - ' well , what do you suggest ?'
negative	if i am unfortunate enough to have to contact them i use the new business form as there is a slight chance they may read it unlike any customer service enquiry
positive	great deals and great service from chillisauce .
negative	waste of time getting this company to pick you up .
neutral	very fast delivery , a great looking chair but the assembly was a nightmare .
negative	have used valueshop on a number of occasions over the years and always thought they were good .
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	just cause this review isn ' t positive on the poor business , doesn ' t mean they can moderate my free speech .
negative	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
negative	i '_ve watched them from my office just post a missed delivery card without even knocking the door !
negative	in nov i stated my family were solicitors and i was going to
negative	i cancelled the direct_debit and informed them that i had done so and asked them to send the final invoice and i would pay by cheque .
neutral	the prices are really good , and when the items arrive are really well_packaged , but the delivery is oh so slow
neutral	driver was nice and friendly .
positive	so all in all buy here you won_'_t be disappointed .
neutral	she - ' well perhaps they '_ve gone home early '

negative	after sending questions to giffgaf over many days , they asked me to supply them my emei number from the phone which they still have not un - barred my phone after 0 month .
negative	in short , they ' re the worst delivery company that i ' ve ever_experienced .
neutral	very are good , you can buy lots of different things and spread the cost or pay it off there and then .
neutral	small gripe is the virgin + box has a tendency to freeze , crash , and take a long time to respond .
negative	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
negative	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .

negative	i ordered tickets to a boxing event weeks_ago and paid in full up front .
negative	then he continue to infer i lost the ip0s many months_ago since i never used it from last_year while he ' s not relevant to the claim process and my private usage of the phone when i used both phone due to the very terrible service the provided me .
positive	sold my phone absolutly fantastic service very easy to do i posted my phone in the pre paid envelopethat was sent to me at lunch_time i recieved payment into my bank accountthe very next_morning superfast and would reccomend to anyone
neutral	previously have visited the shop in shoreham with no issues so i hope its just a minor glitch with this product .
negative	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn ' t turn_up .
positive	at double this price i would have been amazed at the quality but at under £_00 what a great buy .
neutral	have had an issue with a rival company who has spectacular reviews , so i was quite surprised with the way things turned_out , especially as the competitor was dealing_with a more_expensive item .
positive	i contacted them and spoke to a really nice customer_services lady_who sent another copy out which i received the next_day .
neutral	they flatly_refused , hiding_behind the ' terms and conditions ' excuse .
negative	not booking with them ever .
positive	thank_you .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	the post back envelope arrived_promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .
positive	i can recommend this company to anyone and we will use you again .

neutral	i dont like lose my money on this way n anyway not any other ways cos who does ?
negative	because of an error the one on display had been recorded as stock .
neutral	that is pretty bad going .
positive	thank_you very much .
negative	a " reply " from the advertiser of the goods i wanted stated words to the effect that i was contacted and to confirm this , they also stated they were sending me a copy of the email that they claimed to have sent ; not a great surprise to note that nothing was received in either case .
negative	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
neutral	unfortunately , i could not find the estimated delivery time .
negative	the problem is they have a captive public who can '_t choose any alternative so you ' re at their mercy .
neutral	sadly both faded within 0 days of delivery which i think unacceptable .
neutral	but order has caused me a lot of time and stress , so not sure the £_00 saved was worth it .
neutral	some things didn_'_t work - eg .
negative	as my car was off the road with a broken alternator , i was urgently requiring a replacement .
positive	i have used wheelspin_models a couple of times now when others seem to be unable to get the items i wanted they have managed to get them and in a timely_fashion too . i get fed_up with the its on order line from some , but wheelspin dont show it as in stock if its not , they have several layers of stock so it shows straight_away if it its likely to be a few_days or a few_weeks .
neutral	lack of resolution .
neutral	annoyed as had to go and collect it
positive	two days_later , money in account .
positive	very vast delivery , and easy to deal with online or by phone , also hold great events
positive	i would like to say that it was a fantastic service from your company .
neutral	not happy .
positive	will use again for my hi_fi rquirements
neutral	the downside was the the patchy reception i got when i moved_house , so i gave vodafone a go .
negative	i ended_up hanging up on talk_talk .
negative	delivery company very rude !
positive	estimated time of delivery provided and a very polite phone call 00_minutes before delivery which was great .
positive	we were interested in a particular biofuel fire which was not available on site .
positive	awesome company , great prices and a massive_range of products , love to use them .
neutral	nice interface and layout , very simple to use .
negative	i needed the ink for my business so had to order from another supplier .
negative	i canceled the order .
positive	on the rare_occasions that i need to contact transglobal by phone the staff are extremely_helpful and efficient .
neutral	on holiday itself we had a fantastic time .
negative	we have purchased at_least 00 kitchens in the last 00 years .
negative	this was not the case .
positive	would recommend e0p to everyone , great value clothes and shoes , never disappointed .
negative	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0 weeks and they still_haven ' t produced the item i have now more_than paid for ?
negative	i have been a loyal cutomer for almost a year now and during this time i have bought loads of wowcher deals .
positive	she is extremely happy .
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 i still havent had an_email_confirming they got my letter ( that they signed for on the 00th of may ) after they get that i know they will allow themselves another 00 working_days before they might make the payment and that can apparently take up to 00 working_days .
neutral	no phone is available to call only a mobile that is on constant answerphone .
neutral	sticking with evans next time as they will match any wiggle price anyway .
negative	!
negative	we were within the their time limit for refunds but at the till we were told and i quote " sorry can '_t refund you on this bag because you haven_'_t got the 0 receipts .
positive	recommended .
positive	saves me remembering , and we are all happy , cody because of his collar , and myself because i didn_'_t have to go online and reorder .
neutral	the only other thing is the volume of e_- mails we , as customers , recieve thrughout the duration of our order .
negative	today they were supposed deliver to a manchester city_centre office block and when the package didn_'_t arrive on time they said that they " had left next door ".
negative	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
neutral	it sucks .
neutral	i think they have improved over the years , my broadband works quite well and so i '_ve not needed to talk with them for some time .
positive	such a refreshing_change after the truely abrupt attitude adopted by tyretraders . com earlier that same day .
negative	ok , play ads at the beginning of the show but then allow the user to skip them thereafter .
positive	thanks
negative	0 .
positive	dependable , easy and functional !
negative	finally received the product yesterday , not only with packaging in poor condition but also with half the rower missing .
positive	will_definitely_use them again .
neutral	i ordered a pair of titanium glasses with - 0 prescription thin / light reaction - coated lenses .
positive	it arrived extremely quickly and was very well_packaged .
positive	to be honest we couldn ' t quite believe our eyes !
neutral	as a regular cyclist i have used leisurewheels on numerous_occasions .
negative	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley face on the box ( a bit like apple .)
positive	will use again should i require their products .
positive	machine is so quiet and simple to use .
negative	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
positive	i ordered some items at short_notice for our royal wedding street party and my order arrived the day before , perfect timing !
positive	visual soft have been excellent from start to finish .
positive	would definitely recommend .
negative	superdrug get your act_together before you become the next company to bite the dust !
negative	0 ) white filler very visible at regular intervals on oak bed_frame , a large chunk of wood missing and a split .
neutral	de producten zijn namelijk wel van goede kwaliteit .
negative	as you can imagine it takes a great deal of thought about leaving a negative_review - however despite_repeated attempts to contact this company to make changes to an existing document - they made no attempt to either acknowledge or respond to our request .
neutral	just took an age for them to arrive .
positive	a first_class company to deal with .
neutral	it could do with someone asking the passengers not to occupy every part of the lounge as bedroom space .
positive	just as i said above !!
positive	for shear delight and a complete chill out where you can relax in complete privacy you cannot surpass a james_villa holiday .
neutral	i followed all the instructions as the lady advised and didn ' t get anywhere .
negative	they wanted 00 . 00 for me to end the contract that they are not supplying , well i will take it to the ombudsman first . oh and as if by magic the line came back for 0 mins , and low and behold their systems are always down so you can '_t be transferred to someone with a brain and have to keep pressing 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 and repeating all your details over and over , so frustrating and angry .
neutral	a lot of little marks in the band .
neutral	this means more hassle for me as i do not know what has actually been uploaded to your site hence i have to send emails_requesting details and adding the information again as well as having to incur another international bank fee for the additional transaction of emailing the photo to your office .
positive	the camera is better_than_expected and i willl be buying from this website again !
negative	we own our business and paid them for advertising that is all .
positive	i always look at ocuk first when i ' m wanting new computer parts , as i know they have great customer_service & will have the item i ' m wanting at a good price .
negative	overall , i am totally appalled .
positive	kate
positive	absolutely_faultless and outstanding service , very highly_recommended !
neutral	the chap on the other hand , always worked hard for you no matter what .
negative	think_twice before using partmaster , they ’ re good at taking your order and your money , but they will not respond to dissatisfied_customers .
neutral	i would use it again but with the awareness that the calendar had to be completed in one session .
negative	they may sound cheap but if they take your money , hold on to it for a few month and never send the goods , it is very expensive !
positive	ordered headphones one day got the next and as an added_bonus , they stuck in a lolli - pop :)
neutral	products and general service fine .
positive	i highly_recommend anyone looking for replacement rubberware to make blackcircles their first & last call .
negative	it is now 0 days since i sent my first complaint email to their customer_services team and i ' m still_waiting for a reply despite a follow_up reminder to them .
neutral	really pleased i found out about this website as i can now buy whiskeys that are not available in my area .

positive	arrival : nextday a . m . 00 / 00 .
negative	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
negative	loads more phone_calls to them and i finally thought i was getting somewhere on 0th_may after spending 0h 00_mins going through everything again .
neutral	news for you guys - most people are only available on weekends , and this extra £_00 charge makes some of your mattresses less affordable than another company .
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 there '_s a help button in the top corner of the page , and it will present you with some questions .
positive	!
neutral	i contacted rocket about this but they do not seem interested in correcting the mistake . with a bit more customer after care they could have got full_marks .
positive	i went with affordablemobiles after three offered a poor deal , affordablemobiles had the same deal but no upfront cost and £_00 cashback .
negative	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
positive	would have no_hesitation ordering from this company again , very fast delivery and great product .
positive	recommended
negative	the 0mm solder takes far too long to melt , and the tips for the solder irons are poor , they should at_least be chisel , not point .
negative	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
positive	using it since it arrived .
positive	i normally book my flight with american_express , i had to make a three booking to hong_kong to attend my grandma ' s funeral in april , flying during easter holiday season .
negative	!
neutral	oliver
negative	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
neutral	the money i spend ordering for my friends , without_any discount because they have no computers .
positive	was easy and delivery of medication was quick .
positive	i would recommend both joseph and the other staff at carlton leisure highly .
positive	russell made you feel at ease he took care of everything .
negative	when all i wanted to do is sort out this ridiculous account .
neutral	needed a better quality one or a little wider , it was also very very long , i could wear stilts or perhaps i will just cut a couple of feet off the bottom and make a wrap to wear with it
neutral	if you use ebay like i do you most_likely use paypal for your payments .
negative	the funds are returned back to your method of payment and we do not require you to provide any further information .
positive	will quite happily_recommend them to my friends and buy from them again .
neutral	glasses i just received are not as good quality as last time but have only
neutral	in conclusion i would recommend this company but be cautious in doing so .
positive	competitive , efficient and quick .
negative	now they ' re telling_me there ' s no address on my parcel , only the town .
negative	i have been with t - mobile for several years now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
neutral	i called the lost and stolen line ( they don '; t publish a number to get to customer_services - they suggest you email them ; not acceptable to me ) and the lady i spoke to said the pin system was down .
positive	special agent ' thedrinkshop . com ' delivered - overnight - ready for her arrival .
neutral	appears to be a good quality build and at a reasonable price .
neutral	the comfort of the sofa is a little on the hard side however the company say it will soften in a couple of weeks ( when the comfort guarantee has ended ).
neutral	definite signs the company is getting more inward looking about policies , recruitment issues with the odd rouge driver , and procedures over actually helping the customer out .
negative	i ordered a bouquet as a thank_you gesture to a friend .
positive	kept you up to date with where your parcel was .
neutral	well thanks for trying i guess guys .
negative	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
neutral	overall - quite helpful but they did keep me hanging_around for nearly 0 hours and initially told me that it would be about an_hour and a half in total .
positive	and trustpilot reviews made my choice even quicker .
neutral	if the system is down - why did you let me call the number , spend my money on the call only to not get the service i was paying for ?
neutral	there was a delay in sending the item , as i was sent a questionnaire concerning my use of the product and requesting personal medical details .
neutral	some bad products but overall a good service on returns .
neutral	the returns_procedure is excellent .
negative	struggling through the checkout with all my purchases , stressed about the ridiculous amount of time taken to get served and how i was going to get all this stuff out to the car without help from the few disinterested staff , i did not pay attention to the amount charged and did not notice that i had been charged £_00 . 00 for the shelving .
positive	it ' s fast , easy and i don ' t have to wrestle my way to the checkout !
positive	great wellies .
positive	will_definitely_use this company again
neutral	can you please explain how this is economically justifiable on cost , enviroment pollution , time etc in my opinion this put tremedous pressure on all your delivery drivers for no fault of theirs and escualtes the cost of using your service to your customers , resulting in a very unhappy customer .
positive	i ' m writing this review just because they offer some money back for doing it and also cuz i ' m grateful it worked .
neutral	i did learn from it though .
positive	i cant_wait to start looking the best i have ever looked or trained in my life .
positive	a + would highly_recommend funding circle to anyone !
negative	the other mobile was switched off !.
neutral	i would expect the 0 days delivery as it was bought with free delivery , but could do better with the dispatch !
positive	i have used hostelbookers during my trips in marocco , norway , germany , switzerland and italy .
neutral	but the other set were good quality , and yet the printed images on the desktop calendar are slightly dark , but more_importantly low resolution and not as sharp as i would expect .
negative	i would also like to add that trying to claim a refund is just as bad .
positive	was looking for some base_layer wind proof items , found the cold killer items .
neutral	- expensive .
neutral	they have excellent prices and an amazing selection .
positive	excellent all - round service - easy to load , checkout & pay .
positive	thanks dino_pc , i will reuse your service in the future and recommend you to all of my friends when they decide to upgrade !
neutral	i had to wait over two_weeks for my products to arrive .

positive	really good service , phone received within 0 days , cheque received within 0 working_days .
positive	amazing !
negative	the flowers i received from mrs kohberger on the thursday to my address only lasted 0 days before they died .
negative	do yourself a favour and keep away - they ' ve changed their name but you know what they say about leopards !
negative	the staff had to unpack the wardrobe and because of this removal of the packaging i had to sign a disclaimer saying that any damage to my house would be my fault .
positive	ordered two items on line and opted for the next_day delivery option . low and behold the very next_day by 00 am they were with me two fantastic products that were in a sale making them exceptional value and with the reward_scheme have made my experience even better for value will certainly be using facewest again and again it certainly looks as though the loyalty is rewarded i have already told my climbing partner where to come for his next purchase
negative	when i replied that it was costing me money she made no comment .
positive	thank_you so much friends !!
positive	the service i recived from sammie_taylor was probally the most polite and helpful ive ever recived i strongly sugges a pay_rise for this lady
positive	superb as a part of a cheeseboard , a filling for celery sticks and wonderful stuffed in a pork fillet , and roasted !!
negative	why pay for prime if the courier is rubbish !!?
positive	the 0 % offer on the new yaris was also a great deal , so my son has gone for it and bought the car !
positive	clare
positive	great experience , cheers !
neutral	was told that he could not answer those questions at the time and somebody would contact me in the morning .
positive	found website really easy to use , postal bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs . deffo_use again !
negative	your answers to my complaints have shown just how much attention you really do pay .
neutral	i paid this on ( 00 . 00 ) finally , i was stiffed on the return the car empty thing , but overall i am glad to say that despite the possibility of costing a lot , the car did not .
neutral	i ' m not so worried_about smaller purchases but i ' m now cautious_about making expensive purchases over concern about how long it could take to get a refund or replacement should anything go_wrong again .
neutral	really frustrating company to deal with .
negative	i ' bought ' bestival tickets from viagogo a week before the festival last_year .
positive	fast , quick delivery !
neutral	we now have a further week to wait .
negative	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
positive	i was after an oase aquamax pump , they sold me exactly_what i wanted at the right price !
positive	nice feature on the left , scrolling through price range .
negative	just to add to everyone_else ' s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
positive	i am very impressed with theplasticshop and can and will whole_heartedly_recommend them .
negative	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	sky is very expensive for what it is !

negative	com is so much_better
negative	i can now add to the review .
neutral	camera i wanted was still cheaper_than amazon . co . uk , though , so i bought it anyway and it did indeed arrive in time but the packaging was flattened quite badly .
positive	i often order bodybuilding supplements in amazon and it will arrive in my apartment 0 - 0 days after i ordered it , and the products are all in tact .

neutral	i was so shocked that i thought well if this is the attitude of the staff no wonder they don ' t know how to stock rotation .

positive	recieved the sigm 0 . 0 00 for nikon - sharp lens but does have issues in edges of image .

negative	absolute_rip_off .
positive	never had any_problems , great offers and discounts plus loads of products to choose from , i like the paypal facility , competitive_prices and free delivery . what more could you want . brill .
neutral	is it just perhaps that the company has_been overwhelmed by the goods being send and their processes are not robust enough to cope ?.
negative	i know they ' re a massive company and they brand themselves well , but if you ' re one of the cases where it goes_wrong , you quickly lose any love you had for them .
negative	" your first return back to us as -- not called for

neutral	one of which was a game console opening kit which normally retailed at £_00 . 00 but was on offer for £_00 , which we thought was a bit much when there were similar products on the market a lot cheaper .

neutral	i called nabru back who said she " would leave a message to her colleague about the possibility of a delivery refund ".
negative	this company has taken payment from my account and the goods have not been delivered .
positive	i get them to come to my work address as this means i don ' t waste my time
negative	they are ok but given the cost to return and the associated hassle i am better off keeping them , especially when they can '_t even be bothered to reply to my email .
neutral	why ??
positive	there no central then that . just in the main placa catalunya , where barca celebrate theirf football winning parties ,

negative	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
neutral	as the information doesn_'_t get out to everyone there are obviously big gaps .
neutral	could of done with being a little closer to more night life & closer to the sea front .
negative	just annoying this company !
neutral	for example , one one occasion my bike was making a clicking noise with every pedal stroke .
neutral	update_: wifigear eventually got in touch and said they had not seen my email and it must have gone into a spam filter so progress !
positive	i also needed my passport back immediately .
negative	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card_provider .

neutral	its now 0th_november still no response leaver still sticking why should i pay another company to fix this for me you get a years warranty .+ they had the cheek to send me extended_warranty info .
negative	in the end i left it and decided that of any phone arrived , i would refuse delivery and send it back .

negative	they assured me someone would call back in three days .
positive	my most_recent was burberry body intense which is normally £_00 but on here was £_00 .

neutral	by what stretch of imagination that is similar to an audi_a0 still perplexes me .
neutral	cutting a very long_story short one parcel did get to me well after 0mth but the 0nd one was still in essex i asked for that one to be returned to the collection address and my payment to be refunded as this is now 0mth after i sent them .
negative	amazon say they can '_t help , even_though when i put a claim in i had a phone_call from them stating that they were going to refund me ?!
positive	when he arrived there was no_messing_around , once i had given him the locking_wheel nut key he got straight to the job .

positive	hq_hair is the website for all things beauty , it has a wide_range of beauty products and all best brands to choose from .

positive	i recommend topcashback to everyone !
positive	i was there to take a cpr training session .
negative	which i did and called to check they ' d received it and make_sure they knew what the fault was .
negative	however , my experience with them has been the opposite .
neutral	the first time i could not fault them delivery was prompt and the results brilliant .
positive	i always get through quickly on the phone when ever i need to , the website is a breeze , with real stock_levels , once there was 00 in stock , i deliberated , then went for it and then there was none in stock , in the space of twenty_minutes , drat !
neutral	i can ' t fault the service or the website itself but i do recommend that you shop around for prices as you can save a few pounds on bestsellers and maybe more on lesser known books and as we all know it soon adds up .
positive	the website recommended a local fitter i ' d never used before but they proved to be excellent .

positive	i was a little_sceptical as others have reviewed , but no need to be . i was drawn to the currency_club through a money search_engine , and many good reviews . the best rate that i could find on the day and other days , better_than my bank and local eurochange . ordered on saturday lunchtime and received euros on tuesday_lunchtime .
neutral	the staff was very helpful and the rooms where nice but on my stay had some noise from other guest plus i was next to a rail way so as im a light sleeper i kept getting disturbed through the night plus at 0 . 00am i was woken to someone banging apart_from the lake of sleep the room was nice with free view telly and a hair dryer and a phone the bathroom was small infact it was very small .

positive	excellant all_round could not recommend enough .
neutral	shop a lot , good prices , goods are fair but delivery is rather shoddy , stuff out of bags , squashed sometimes and delivery people not very friendly .
negative	in a week this company has lost the plot , have angered many thousands of people .
neutral	i continue to use barringtons but am occasionally choosing to buy elsewhere because of your delivery charges - your options are not always the cheapest and more frustratingly you have accepted the order when you have not had the product in stock which has caused frustrating delays
positive	thanks guys x
neutral	we were told it had just been serviced but the light had been forgotten to be turned off .
neutral	so with the full_refund i bought the game else were , but this is were it gets interesting .
neutral	when i reported that this procedure did not work , they told me twice to re - do the same procedure , which i did , each time with the same outcome ( the phone does not work with other_networks ), then stopped_responding .
positive	it arrived on tuesday - very quick .
neutral	the representative offered me the replacement part free of charge for my inconvenience but i had to decline as i have already ordered the part directly from the manufacturer .
neutral	i had some shipped items was all okay thanks for shiply for chance but when my courier company did not turn_up n i was asking after help from shiply i did not get my deposit back - company did not pay shiply neither - but i got a sorry n i can relist option .
positive	top that experience off with very affordable rates and it ' s a winner .
negative	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer_service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
negative	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
neutral	i feel it only fair that i follow_up my initial review by adding that since making my complaint i was promptly contacted by the collectplus customer care team who have been excellent in addressing my concerns .
positive	i was so pleased i used superdrug online doctor i had done a home test for an sti which had proved positive so i looked on line to see if there was anything i could get without having to wait weeks for an_appointment at my gp surgery and came_across superdrug , it was so easy to use and order , my medication arrived in a matter of days and i feel in my self much_better i have bought another home testing kit to see if the sti has cleared but i will wait a few more days but i am very happy no hassle and all my symptons have gone i will_definitely_use this online dr service again if needs be
positive	i went to vision_express and the cost of the frames was over priced .
positive	the online ordering_process was very easy , but to top it off they are willing to drop their prices in order to retain your business .
positive	love their products !
negative	how a " company " with such horrendous customer_service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .

positive	the shipping was about $_00 but it was well worth it .
positive	i would definitely_recommend interactiveresorts if you are looking to get away this winter !
positive	the whole_process was very professional throughout and i would have absolutely no_hesitation in using this company again or recommending it to a friend .
positive	i immediately could see that my worries had been for nothing - the chicken_breasts were sealed in sturdy professional plastic packaging ( seemed more solid than what i get at tesco ), the whole chicken nicely contained in a bag , surrounded_by ice packs that were still frozen solid , and then encased in padding , all inside the box .
negative	following another couple of weeks and another unanswered email , i was told in a second call that the reason i still had no product was that the third_party supplier had failed to respond ( could they not have tried a different one ?)
negative	i ' m very unhappy with both the product itself ( it being potentially lethal ) and the post sales support from greenhouse warehouse .
positive	unfortunately one arrived damaged .
neutral	i ' m always pleased with fragrance_direct ' s pricing and their shipping is fast , however their packaging is appauling and this is not the first time i ' ve received items that have been damaged due to glass_bottles being left loose with minimal padding in a large box .
negative	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
neutral	their website states they do not give refunds if customers order the wrong_size , so my covering_letter explained that they did not send me the shirt size advertised , which worked for me .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
positive	i bought a dyson product for considerably_less_than other_retailers , and the free delivery service was brilliant .
positive	worth a go !
neutral	have used scan for years as my sole supplier of it products for my customers , however , i am seriously disappointed with the total_lack of customer support on this occasion .
positive	this way of getting a loan , is actually fun and exciting and you don ' t get ripped_off unlike banks !
positive	they email you updates during the process so you know it has arrived with them safely and when they start testing the phone , and then when you ' ve been paid !
positive	customer service was first_class , delivery was arranged for a time that suited me and was included in the price and then they rang me the day before to say they were in my area and would i like it delivered within the hour .
positive	i will_definitely be using their services again .
positive	impressive service .
negative	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
positive	the price of the item was very competitive particularly when taking the free

positive	looks_like value for money .
neutral	my last two orders were a disaster , in one case they advised nil stock and much later advised that they could no_longer obtain the product - i subsequently bought it cheaper elsewhere .
positive	gentlemen on the phone was unbelievably helpful , and extremely patient , even_though i took a lot of his time seeking advise :) :).
neutral	conclusion
positive	as long as you read the terms and conditions of offers you will be pleasantly_surprised at extra cash coming in !
negative	i would not use this website again .
negative	don_’ t hire from these_crooks .

negative	i was told that they can either ask the airline to get me a full_refund or ask the airline for me regarding my special situation .
negative	waited all day for delivery .
negative	i sent an_email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
negative	will_definitely not buy again .
positive	i have used glasses_direct twice now , purchasing a total of 0 pairs of glasses , and cannot rate them highly_enough .
positive	can rely_on .
neutral	so i decided i wont use it again cos not any guarantee from shiply if something is going on wrong way
positive	used their service for repairs and was very happy with the turnaround time and the work done .
positive	appliance direct helped_me with how to measure up , gave great advice and shipped me out a first_class machine for a fantastic price .

negative	i have since heard from other friends that they have had similar grievances .
neutral	ordered 00pm wed but not dispatched until friday due to security check .
negative	after this experience , i can only assume that my £ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
positive	now 0 star its the little things that count

negative	they apologize for the delays , cannot supply the tacking number , try to save time and propose to refund .
neutral	the apartment was immaculate when we arrived and was as_described in the specification .
negative	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don ' t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .

neutral	i then realised that contrary to my instructions my tickets had been taken off sale from prime position - no 0 on the list !
negative	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
neutral	when i had to send the item back i arranged a specific date but parcel_force arrived a day earlier .
negative	i did & was told that as i ' d paid them via_paypal and the item was out of stock , they ' d email me when it was in stock & notify me of the delivery day then .
neutral	so in summary three are great for the business side of things - a strong network with eye watering deals .
negative	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
positive	i ' d definitely_recommend to anyone_else arranging parties for whatever_reason .
positive	i placed my order at 0pm , product was dispatched at 0pm , and delivered to me the next_day .
neutral	i got a refund plus the £_00 i ' m sorry compensation but as it was a present and the birthday is tomorrow i will have an unhappy birthday boy on my hands unless i go out and buy one at a lot higher price in the shops .
positive	also if you don ' t own a pair of iso - acoustic monitor stands then don ' t rest until you do . these things should be sold with every monitor , by law .
neutral	so much for the saturday delivery .
negative	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
negative	however the next_day having arrived and you guessed it no costume .

positive	exceptionally fast service and never had a snag yet , despite my requests constantly changing and being a little complicated .
positive	regards dave jones
neutral	this said i would probably use them again though they will not be my first choice .
neutral	basically , they had one shot to make a good impression on a new customer and they messed it up .
neutral	the counterfeiters work in much cruder factories and this is evident in everything they produce , be it electronics , clothing , cosmetics or even viagra .
negative	they are making it very difficult for us to increase or even decrease our profile .
neutral	i ' m a 00 / 00 and i got the m / l leggings and they were just way too tight !!
positive	thanks
neutral	?
positive	i even got a free bag included with the guitar , with a couple of plectrums in it !
neutral	absolutely horrific , jammed full with tesco . com pickers with their big green trollies .
positive	good prices , quick service , polite and helpful staff - what more could you ask for when ordering online !
neutral	not impressed with the respect for their customers and given there are 00 , 000 reviews ( which will be only a percentage of customers ) on line they must be raking in cash .
neutral	purchased my sandybridge computer in march_0000 and very pleased
neutral	i uploaded the photos to make a calendar , but couldn ' t save my progress when building the calendar , and had to start over again as i couldn ' t complete it in one go .
positive	thank_you e_- careers .
negative	told that it wasn_'_t in stock and no details of when it would be available .
neutral	they also explained that it would be in stock in a few_days . was also told item would be sent by express delivery so i would get it within my revised deadline .
neutral	the man came to prepare the report on a friday , and attempted to repair the computer_desk , which was done to an ok standard , but not one that we were happy with , as we could easily see the area that had the filler in and if you ran your hand over it , could feel it was rough .
neutral	i was understandably not happy with this as driving with a destroyed windscreen and a 0yr old for a week is not the best of conditions .
negative	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
negative	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
positive	super selection , great prices , beat competitor '_s prices with discount too , and at your door in no time , plus free stuff !
neutral	it seems like the longer i ' ve been a customer the worse my customer_service has gotten .
neutral	staff was ok and accomodation also .
neutral	sometimes having to wait over a week for a delivery .
neutral	i haven ' t seen her for an year and i wanted to make her a little surprise as much as i could .
neutral	also a a free pair of headphones were also received .

positive	full of bally games and all the popular igt games .
positive	bought as a replacement pair eye catching pattern and colour great item . fast delivery service would use again .
negative	( they still tried to get me to cancel the order though because then they would not have been in breach of contract ) well that is simply not good enough .
neutral	noise was a problem and to be honest it was not entirely the fault of the hotel for the outside noise , a busy main_road with flashing car reflections lighting up the room all night and i did hear that if your room was on the other side you were subjected to tesco lorries day and night so it was a no_brainer whichever room you were allocated .
neutral	edit_: 0 hour later i received another key .
positive	having placed the order i received progress updates via_email & the glasses arrived the day after dispatch .
negative	i will never book another holiday with them .
positive	they are excellent quality and will be def purchasing more products !
negative	stay_away from lambda - tek .
positive	phenomenal , prompt , , punctual and very professional , and at a price not to be_beaten
neutral	so , although were were very pleased with the apartment itself ( despite the awful building noise ) and had thought about returning next year , we shall go_elsewhere , although we will probably use blue_chip again .
neutral	after sales is poor , and i ended_up receiving my retention certificate 0 days before it was due to expire ( and that wasn ' t sent special delivery as i asked , or not even recorded ), i have now found out this was extended so that ' s improved things somewhat , but again i found the whole_process very difficult with numerous contact instances on my part .
positive	michelle dealt_with our query and she was absolutely amazing , she was very patient and accommodating .
positive	my game ' s already been bought and activated through steam and the only major problem was with the payment - skrill kinda glitched out a little on payment but some quick refreshing sorted that .
negative	we had the receipt .
negative	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone call from asda , nothing !
positive	sent a picture of the fault to golf000 and within a few hours they got back to me stating that if i returned it then they would send out a brand_new one asap .
negative	service agents with communication difficulties
negative	just so disappointed i have waited all this time and given you the benefit of the doubt .
positive	he offered to bring my package into the house to wherever i needed it and when i said my husband would sort it out he made the offer again to make_sure i was certain .
neutral	otherwise , prepare to be messed about .
negative	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
neutral	i am aware of wear and tear but . so soon .
negative	they sound professional on the phone , have no manners ( the voicemail left by [_name ] was " yeah hi erm ." and generally seem like an exceptionally poor organisation .
negative	booked return flights london to koh samui , via bangkok on british_airways and connecting with bangkok airways .
negative	people need to be warned about this shambolic company . will keep on at them till i either receive my goods or a full_refund
neutral	quote from their site " your flowers are with our trusty couriers ".
negative	i asked to speak to his supervisor & was told " oh he '_ll only tell you ." thanks but i '_ll have a chat with him anyway if thats ok with you .
neutral	but plans are afoot to remedy this in the new year .
neutral	the website remembered my card_details and i clicked on this option before remembering that my card had been reissued due to fraudulent use .
neutral	booking was easy and we had few complaints at all about the overall holiday .
neutral	she said we ' ll it ' s just for the price plan , to set the direct_debit up .
positive	i bought a new car at the grimsby branch with a trade - in of my old car .
positive	definetly come back to study more !
neutral	premier_inn provide a ' budget service ', i have to say that i have rarely seen this term so overused .
negative	i wish i had never looked on the curry '_s website & had just kept my old fridge /_freezer .
positive	would recommend .
neutral	however , when they got it in stock they were good to their word and there was no problem with the delivery arrangements or the goods .
negative	now 0 weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
positive	i ordered a coat for a christmas_present and considering the busy time of year it was delivered within 00_hours .
positive	000_% recommended .

neutral	i did my order on friday and it arrived on wednesday .
positive	came when expected as had easter inbetween .
neutral	whoops could have been a disaster - disappointed that the birthday balloon was a mothers_day balloon so that went in the bin !
negative	the worst was that they charge you £_00 per_person on your way out from the airport to come back !
neutral	sorry . not impressed
neutral	now -
positive	very satisfied .
positive	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
positive	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
positive	so yeah in one word " brilliant "
positive	shipping is very reasonable especially since the freebies and discounts surpass that amount .
neutral	:(
negative	!
positive	nothing happened , i rang them up to my disbelief they said they were not available , i said why are they on your website .
neutral	when talking to my bank about your transaction they say it was accepted on their end , but you still refused it .
positive	hi , it pays to research the product you are seeking .
negative	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
positive	the packaging was whisked away and a quick demonstration reassured me my new machine was in working order .
neutral	i input the dayes and wet througb the various screens before inputting card_details .
neutral	i paid in full and they were happy to take my money but then i got a email_saying they thought the transaction was fraudulent when i did have to log_into my banks secure portal to send the money in the first place !
neutral	at my last check up , on 00 april , i was told that nothing can be done do fix those issues mentioned_above .
neutral	it can be slow , a lot of the time .
positive	its inexpensive and easy to get .
positive	i have been using servicing_stop for a number of years now ever_since seeing it introduced on the dragons den program .
neutral	each was a single cell mounted with a picture from the film .
neutral	having received no reply i decided to give up an evening waiting to deal with customer service who said the email did not reach them so i had to give another four weeks worth of notice and pay for a service i was not using .
positive	00 kr .
positive	;) even zanzibar will be cheap , and as we are going on an around - the - world trip this couldnt have been better !
positive	including the bioflex jewellery that they created , and from their advice for my lip piercing , i gathered that they are also piercers more into the passion for what they do and not here to make quick money .
positive	first time i have used these_guys as it was by_far the best price , with other cd_key companies i have been waiting around four a couple of hours for the key to come through , not this time emailed it to me instantly , will_definitely be using again
positive	invaluable effort !!
negative	( i will be forward a link of this review to them to make a point )
neutral	the internet is bursting with bad_reviews about this company , and i must_admit that on a number of occasions i have sworn never again to deal with companies who use them .
neutral	this means , if you absent mindedly click ( like 00_% of people ), you will end up sharing fairly quickly .
positive	i booked a delivery for my parcel using parcel0go but there was a problem for the courier in delivering the parcel as i had the incorrect address on the parcel , so i was concerned that the parcel would not be delivered so i contacted parcel0go through there online live_chat and was very surprised to find how fast there service was in dealing_with quires as jessica was very helpful and she was able to re - arrange the delivery to the correct address with in just a couple of minutes
positive	would most definitely use again and recommend .
positive	this time packaged far better with fragile stickers on .
neutral	whilst i did not ready the t &_c '_s end to end ( my fault ), i seriously did not expect the delivery drivers to take photographs of the appliance in situ in my house .
negative	thus i don ' t have another £_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
neutral	this was after having to provide the acconts information a second time .
negative	i received a couple of emails to find out if i still had the remains of the damaged goods & with every email i received i responded .
negative	please_please_please do what a review site is supposed to do and show reviews good and bad - dont make it so easy to block a bad review just because a company is paying you to be on your site .
neutral	not worth the money and unfair i would have to pay to return the item .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , , i web chatted again ( now getting a bit angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised asked about the parcel contents and raised an even bigger flag to find the parcel .
negative	four days_later ( and one week after the electrician visited ), i still had no resolution , and no returned phone call from service team .
negative	even after that , the order wasn_'_t fed through .
negative	i will take this matter with relevant department so this company can pay me for causing me massive inconvenience !
negative	this is the third time i ' m writing you .
negative	0 days_later my items came .
negative	deal with them at your_own peril !

positive	??
neutral	i like very much buying from littlewoods but they tend to put to much interest on some items and you end up paying top price for a lot of items .

negative	note
positive	thats priceless !
negative	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?

neutral	no_problems whatsoever with the product its fantastic , but the courier service was very difficult to say the least .
negative	i could have been on the loo , wiped and got to the door in the space of time it took him to try and ruin my purchase so no_idea how he expected it to save time .
positive	mommy also likes the reminder option to have meds sent so i dont run out .
neutral	i got a reply fairly quickly saying that it would be passed on to the relevant_department .
positive	hands_down best place to buy anything you need for your workout .
positive	i used to have to phone companies and then wait for them to get back to me with an answer as to if they could screen my wife and me , not any more .

positive	we have been looking everywhere in diy_stores for a replacement kitchen_tap and nothing was quite what we wanted .
neutral	i think it would be better if they had a facility to reserve a pair of glasses until they ' re restocked as i wouldn ' t mind waiting or at_least have an alert system when stock_levels of popular frames have been replenished or if they will infact re - stock them at all - it would make the experience a lot_easier and save me constantly checking the website just incase they ' ve become available again .
positive	excellent delivery .
negative	david_: yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
negative	avoid them .
neutral	on tuesday_evening cjs announced on facebook at 00 : 00 , a promise to send out diablo iii product keys to all customers experiencing ' partially shipped ' at 00pm , within the next two hours .

neutral	colin
negative	only stayed there 0 nights .
neutral	the drivers were up to date etc .
neutral	i am unable to claim this amount on my credit_card due to it being less_than £_000 and nochex who processed the payments do not enter into disputes between buyers and sellers .
positive	now i send my invoices within a few minutes every evening .
neutral	i was contacted later and offered a full_refund for the trays , which i accepted .
positive	finding what you want is easy , ordering is simple , delivery is speedy .
neutral	stayed here in march prior to a morning flight and had a really great nights_sleep .
positive	turning them on allowed me access .
neutral	there are many better websites , and some worse .
neutral	but according to the customer sales_advisor " it doesn ' t have the correct sizes that you need " but sure enough after we had purchased the items .
neutral	guess_what , on arrival the card was swiped , and they informed me they would be charging 0 , 000_euros (£ 0 , 000 ), unless i took their cdw insurance at 000_euros (£_00 )!
negative	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !

neutral	nice flowers and great being_able to order in the evening for the next_day .
neutral	home delivery is something they need to work on , it ' s a kind of it ' ll get there when it gets there , because of this i never use home delivery , so i always have a good time with argos .
negative	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
negative	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
neutral	would also like someone to provide me the 00_% that code was supposed to save me !!
neutral	i '_ve used medic_animal for a while now - recommending them to friends and always having great service - but recently i '_ve had a few minor problems .
neutral	great value for some nice items .
negative	what a load of rubish these lot are .
neutral	im now a bit_concerned_about what will happen next , ordered 00k gold plated playing cards . email received saying thanks for order etc etc stating postage paid for item . do i need to do anyhting else or is that it , do i sit back and wait for item to be delivered ?
negative	i hope this is not due to being measured incorrectly by the surveyor , that subsequently had to be cut down to fit the existing hole !!
neutral	even more annoying is that they are often stuck over the product '_s information and instructions .
negative	i ordered a summer bundle of pumps , shorts and 0 t shirts .
neutral	love the system improve your customer service and it will be 0_stars .
positive	from start of search to completion , fast communications , calls and posted documents all arrived when notified they would .

positive	will_definitely buy from them again .
negative	when my change of details quotation was received i sent an_email to their customer_services and was directed to their website , no help what so ever as it would have required someone to talk to me and go through the file to resolve the issue !
neutral	the racking has done a really good job and i can actually find what i want !!
negative	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0 months .
neutral	the middle support leg on futon base the bolts came lose , hence threads were shot , so i had to drill through and put new nuts and bolts in with loctite !
positive	brilliant service .

neutral	i placed an order on 00 mar 0000 and was told delivery would be 0 - 0 days to uk .
neutral	the delivery times stated on the website are not true and both my items arrived chipped
neutral	generally , the website works well but the bookings do not go flawless in all cases .
negative	i can guarantee this did not happen .
neutral	hi
neutral	however , i have ghosting , blurry vision , slight double vision and shading on numbers and letters , headaches and pain / pressure behind my eyes .
neutral	on the 00th i live chatted to ask where the item was , i got told they had no stock and would get back to me with a delivery date .
neutral	plus , when i ' m drunk , they taste soooooo goooood ;- p
positive	i love their wide_range of supplements but even more so love their low low_prices .
negative	awful company .
neutral	good price and delivered very quickly but the product was not as

neutral	i did point out to the caller how ridiculous and frustrating it is for customers not to be able to telephone them , and was told that they do not have an incoming line (!)

negative	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
neutral	my order was processed and delivered very efficiently .
positive	well described and illustrated system which solved a big problem .
positive	not forgetting they also send you a sms and email in the morning telling you the estimated time ( usually within an_hour_window ) they will be at your doorstep , allowing you to pop out of the house for a quick pint down the pub to dream of your new product before it arrives .
negative	they won ’ t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
positive	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
positive	very impressed with mazuma .
negative	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
negative	its my fault orange are so incapable of sending bills or being_able to locate customers when they call in .
neutral	why did not get a call and why does the website say i changed the delivery ?!
neutral	still_waiting for a refund !!
positive	price - excellent |
positive	what a coincidence !
positive	strongvpn ' s speed is good , all depend your internet speed after you change your ip ' s location to near your real location , all is ok , no pro !!!
negative	they have absolutely no interest in making the customer happy or delivering anything remotely approaching quality .

neutral	product was ordered online and arrived next_day even_though it was on 00 hour delivery !
neutral	as i entered into 0000 , it became_apparent to me that the £ 0 quidco fee would be taking a lot of my cashback .
positive	plus really quick delivery about three days

neutral	otherwise i would have chosen another courier .
negative	avoid . avoid . avoid !

neutral	i would definitely buy from this company but just not from the pre_- owned selection .

negative	0 . refuse to help you ,
neutral	the flowers where lovely , so i would recommend with caution .
negative	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated_delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .

positive	very competitive_prices , quick delivery with no charge .
negative	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
neutral	if you buy four different coins , say five of each , you now pay the " free " postage four times , and if you are like me and want to buy five or six different silver items , maybe a bar and two different gold coins , you pay it eight or nine times .
negative	the cards are not live or random in my opinion .
neutral	they called me after i wrote a bad review and started complaining_about it !
positive	i cannot_praise ryan enough at alba rose for my gorgeous wedding band , which fits my engagement_ring like a glove .

negative	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn ' t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
neutral	except , giving facebook the right to share my stuff is less high on the priority list than giving little jimmy what ' s left of my retinas after i succumb to a horrible but thankfully brief death at the hands of an overworked and underpaid bus driver who wasn ' t looking the right way at the right time .
positive	he has a large cauliflower ear and cannot use in - ear_plugs .

positive	when i returned to pick_up the product i eavesdropped on a couple of staff / customer conversations .
negative	this was by the ' delivery company ' used ( yodel ) who were truly atrocious .

negative	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
negative	and it makes me so upset that even after the e_- mail i tried to find a number to call someone from dpd to explain what happen , i couldn ' t find any number on their web_site .
negative	company did agree to a short_term credit_note to exchange the easy plumb kit but seeing as they do not have much to exchange for having purchased everything else i needed am a bit stuck and credit will only last a couple of weeks provided i can get it back to the warehouse within a deadline .

neutral	but as i say the trophy '_s are great and excellent value
negative	i am writing about tesco westwood store , scarborough . i used to shop there regularly , spending about 000 - 000_pounds weekly . accessing the store on foot is a nightmare , you have to walk round the entire outside of the store , the main doors are round the back . i returned a blind i had bought to customer_services , the woman was so horrible , and you would have thought that she was refunding me from her own pocket . there was some fittings missing , but she talked down to me , and i was offended . another time i was in store choosing easter eggs for 00 people , so was spending a bit of time in that aisle . an assistant was re - stocking with a large trolley in the centre of the aisle . she was looking very stressed , and was obviously displeased with me looking at the display with my trolley . she was only doing her job , but it was her face , as though i was in the way . i went elsewhere . the next incident was awful . i was in the store with 0 children , and an assistant was stocking the biscuit aisle . there was a packet of broken biscuits on a shelf , and my little girl picked_up a broken piece and ate it . well , the assistant went to town on me , saying she could call the police , it was theft , and was so wrong . i was so upset , i wsa actually buying mobile_phones and the weekly_shop , and i put everything back and left the store crying , and shouting at my little girl . i have never , ever , been in there again , or shopped at tesco in any other way . also , at that store , if you need to call a taxi , you have to wait outside on the ramp in all weathers . they are taking over our town too , it will be the final nail in the coffin for scarborough , i can tell you .

neutral	i then discovered the raid enclosure itself had been badly handled by god_knows who and had scratches all over it .
negative	i decided to use collect_plus to send a parcel to scotland .
neutral	when i finished my current toner , i bought it through this site again , ordered but didnt receive any confirmation_email after 0 days , so i emailed and like everybody said , no one reply .
negative	the up shot is that my son has had phone for nearly 0 weeks and to top it all off they want £_00 of me so they can sebd the phone back .
negative	only then did they admit that not only did they not have any but they couldn_'_t get any either .
neutral	ok site .

negative	!
neutral	and regardless , it makes you look bad . and your competition better .
neutral	it ' s ok to buy something like maybe spirulina , vitamins , granola bars etc .
neutral	they advertise free fee weekends but yet i still get charged .
positive	they also allowed me to track my item even_though i took advantage of the free postage available !
neutral	there should be a time limit to how long you can keep items in your basket yes , but they don ' t have once they just disappear .
positive	i feel a sudden pang of loyalty to bananafingers now and will buy here a lot more often with the knowledge that any_problems will be sorted .
negative	once i saw the reviews i thought it a good idea to contact by email to see when my order was to be fulfilled as it had been 0 days and no communication .
neutral	other than that i found a great delivery service
positive	when i moved into my barn i didn_'_t know where to start . the floors were all black slate with underfloor_heating and although it was a warm feel it just didn_'_t look cosy .

neutral	he did a fantastic job , working very competently with great professionalism and very tidily .
positive	i always come back to supplement_warehouse !
negative	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	upon_arrival the toilets were not clean and there were not enough towels left out .
neutral	the amount of times i ' ve had to send books back , in particular , because they have carelessly thrown it in a box or unprotected envelope .
neutral	i went to the room which was clean , tidy and a reasonable size and started to use the wifi but it wouldn_'_t work properly and when i went to connect my phone , it said i had too many devices connected .

positive	would highly_recommend this band as they made my wedding so special .
positive	my son and i spent some time designing the new_kitchen layout before we started seriously_considering potential suppliers .
negative	and i am very disappointed no contact , no apology nothing the chap gave me the complaints details whom i could contact then these promptly disappeared off the screen as soon as he ended the chat so the only way i can complain is on here .
neutral	in most_cases i wouldn ' t mind but i have no_idea with the label on the back of my product means , take it off before use or what ?
negative	phoned scottish_power they give me a pin to wipe it off .

negative	promised a mirror which never arrived even after several phone_calls to customer_services .
positive	many_thanks for the help , advice and service
negative	he fitted the new one and the heating was working again which was great .
negative	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
neutral	subsequently received an_email next_day to confirm my order .
positive	the staff are excellent : all uk_based , all easily_accessible through a short automated ' phone service .
negative	the website was slow and sometimes non - co - operative and in the end , we ordered .
neutral	hope i have helped as there seems to be a load of peeps hacked off with viagogo - you just need to be careful and do some checking first .
positive	reebok were an_absolute nightmare so sweatband replaced the machine with a kettler ( which they recommended ).
neutral	well i took exception to this as it didn_'_t say in any single piece of correspondence that it had to be a minimum of 00 quid i won_'_t bore you this lucky argued with me for about 00_minutes .
neutral	first off i '_ve got to commend upon price point .
positive	i never go_anywhere_else these days , there is no need .
positive	staff always very knowledgeable which makes for informed purchasing at good value .
negative	second one is they have refunded me ( which i already had and answered to that one , that the money was sent to a wrong account ).
neutral	i think that your service to more rural_areas needs addressed as this is the 0nd time i ' ve needed repairs and had to wait a week for them to be completed and i don ; t see why we should get a second rate service becuase we don ' t live in inverness .
positive	prices are more then fair , so i am sure i will be buying more games from this site .
neutral	i ordered a personalised knife from them a few_months_ago .
neutral	about 0 month_ago me and my boyfriend went in to maplin , we were buying things to use on games consoles we had managed to rally up around £_00 worth of items in about 00_minutes we only had 0 items .
negative	tomorrow i ' m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
positive	- free to use for all users .
negative	then i was subjected to high_pressure_sales tactics trying to sell me goods and services which i did not need , at very imaginative prices .
neutral	one thing i have learnt tho is their delivery service is a bit poor if you choose the next_day delivery option as 0 out of 0 times - it has never got here the next_day , and the saturday delivery is even worse - that never comes !
neutral	desk staff were helpful , though at the airport there was nobody in the office at the car drop - off point and the key needed to be left at the desk inside the airport terminal .
negative	it '_s taken me two calls 00_mins 0st time to see where bed was and another 00_mins to chase them again to find out where the bed is , on a premium telephone_call rate .
negative	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
negative	in fact i never_heard from them again and an entire year has now passed .
neutral	over the years i have had to contact ebay customer service a few_times and have never been happy with the service .
neutral	i wouldnt mind but its common curtosy if delivery is more_than 0 working_days to email and explain_why delivery will take longer .
negative	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn ' t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn ' t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
negative	!
positive	great product .
negative	the sofa was filthy and consisted of a narrow plank across as a seat which was not only uncomfortable but dangerous as we kept falling down the holes on either side , the only other chair broke the first time it was used , the kitchen was infested with insects ( rep told me that if i cleaned it they should go away - this was in our first day so left like this for us ); and there was a building site across the road and as the pool was in the front_garden it couldn_'_t be used as dust blew across it all day , never mind the noise from drill , men , cars etc .
positive	i would with out doubt reccomend them thank_you very much 0 the excellent service that i got from you .
neutral	after many phone_calls to expedia over several days , they maintained this lack of customer_service .
positive	the coach / bus was waiting as we came out .
neutral	i will think very hard before buying from them again , unless they offer free returns .
negative	00 days_later and still nothing !
positive	i came here for a specific shirt my sister told me about , and when i saw all of the other products i was very impressed .
negative	00 days_later i asked for my money back as they obviously had no_intention of sending me the items i purchased .
neutral	i checked my order a week_later and nothing had changed still didn ' t say dispatched , i checked it again a couple of days_later and it said delivered .
positive	would recommend this site .
negative	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
positive	cheapest price and immediate delivery for an oki toner cartidge .
neutral	we have used resorthoppa for a few_years ,, before them we always got a taxi ,,, so when we heard about resort_hoppa we were delighted my family have an apartment in spain and we are very regular users of the hoppa , and never had any complaints , but what has gone wrong this year , everyone of our friends and family have not been happy with it , the time waiting for other planes to land to fill the hoppa , i can not understand_why if you do not have enough people dont you use smaller buses / coaches , surely this would be more visable ,,, please remember when , you have travelled for hours and your hot , tired , you just want to get to your destination , and not be hanging or sitting around waiting for another plane to land to fill the coach ,,, you will loose custom , people are complaining already
positive	ordered some curtains - they arrived in a timely_fashion , fitted_perfectly , quality is excellent
positive	- non laggy ( ajax ?)
negative	but it ' s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
negative	by friday_lunchtime i still had heard_nothing so i contacted the delivery company myself and was told i would have the mattress that afternoon and if i called back after two i would be given an exact time for delivery .
positive	yes i would recommend open study college to a friend as its a good and easy way to study from home and instant guidance is provided when ever needed .
negative	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
neutral	what worries me is that the e_- mail says the tickets are going to be sent 0 to 0 days prior to the event which means i might not be able to pick them up in kazakhstan which is where i am from as i would be leaving for london three days prior to the concert .
positive	i saved a ton of money and i was able to get everything that i needed all in one place , and i got a bunch more .
positive	picture of them on the last sunny day we are likely to have for a while - on request .
positive	best service i have received in a long time .
neutral	never sent parcel through them , but i know person that used to work there .
neutral	in the end they took a 0 % of the price but still made my mother wait quite a long while .
neutral	i spoke with someone from oe head_office on 00 april who said that i should not be told that and they offered me to meet with the surgeon , mr alex george on 00st_may .
neutral	lack of information in the website .
neutral	i do however hate that they try their best to get you to sign_up for a credit_card , i almost did by_accident .
neutral	normally my aircompany of choice until last flight .
negative	t : 000 0000 0000
negative	hehe ). in all fairness to her she says she will ring ups to find out why and call me back .
positive	the fitter turned_up early and called before he arrived .
neutral	in every other respect i was pleased , easy upload , quick delivery etc .
positive	great comms and delivery service .
neutral	i needed to return a few items for various reasons at different times .
neutral	of course you are going to opt into the " pay £_00 for same day fransfer " as like i said , if you are applying for a payday_loan then you are probably in an_emergency .
neutral	but my problem is that they shouldn ' t have given me the option to choose this delivery if they weren ' t going to send it out .
neutral	i sent it on the 00nd january hoping to receive my money soon like the phone companies , there is a reason_why i sold my beloved xbox_000 !!
negative	00 : 00 : 00 my address is entered address 00 : 00 : 00 how will i now get my items back ?
negative	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0 months .
positive	really good
neutral	other than that , i ' ll test the lens when the camera from digitalrev arrives and hope all is well from there on out .
positive	i only usually leave reviews when i have a negative experience with a site ( like most people ) but after_reading some of the nonsensical negative_reviews here , i will break that habit .
positive	it ’_s sad but the fault has to lie somewhere …. and i will be using ao in future even if curry ’_s has a better price !
negative	after browsing their website i found some items that i liked .
positive	kitty from london
positive	the cap that arrived was well made , and the printed image was much higher quality than i ever imagined .
positive	would recommend to my friends
negative	surprise !!
neutral	but it was the way the company handled the situation and the way they genuinely cared_about me as a customer and were sympathetic to problems experienced by myself .
negative	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
negative	stay well clear use amazon or any other site .
negative	i had returned two_separate packages of ink_cartridges for refund , because they refused to be accepted by my printers .
positive	could not believe the discounted price 😀.
neutral	i bought a desire after being told it was the best . of a bad bunch

positive	i am very impressed with the product - good quality and comes gift boxed ( i ordered a keyring ).
positive	i too ordered yesterday and my jacket arrived 00 oclock this morning .
neutral	i used to be a huge ocado fan - compared to previous experiences with grocers their items were on stock and they delivered on time in one hour windows .
neutral	most of these issueshave now been resolved with a ' spares ' package .
positive	the car was supplied with a full_tank of diesel , with no refund for unused .
negative	it now looks_like the wait for the doors will extend to three or four months .
neutral	sorting this out was left to the resort staff , which with no help from uk skifrance they eventually did .
neutral	no one answers the phone - they don_'_t respond to feedback - frankly avoid at all costs if possible .
neutral	conclusion . results can '_t be trusted 000_%.
negative	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn ' t mine ( wasn ' t even in the same county ).
positive	no automated replies , just proper answers .
negative	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
neutral	now that our area has the same driver all the time all is well for the moment , but in previous years we had some terrible experiences .
neutral	the product was good and deserves at_least a 0 - star_rating , and the price was worthy of a 0 - star_rating .
positive	talk 0 . 0 has_been invented !
negative	seems to be run by a bunch of amateurs .
neutral	but the worst part was the lack of information - no - one seemed to know what was happening .
negative	0 hrs later i got a reply saying it was not £_00 . 00 but in fact over £_000 to change .
neutral	in this age of communications , it is inexcusable .
neutral	phoned , and spoke to a very helpful assistant who indicated that delivery was awaiting a part of the order .

neutral	however i have to admit prices are reasonable and when they get it right - there ' s nothing better_than good ' ol pizza_hut .
neutral	also there fees are not clear taking you by surprise .
positive	i noticed 0 packs of meatballs had went brown due to this so gave musclefood a call .
positive	the stools were extremely easy to put_together and are supplied with alan key do so .
neutral	screws loose on chairs
neutral	the website such as buying items can be a real pain , tesco is a brilliant company and i love them but it is just as easy to go to a store than using the website .
neutral	- the pricing is not transparent , with only the basic plan having an a price shown on the website .
positive	the service we received from our advisor ian was first_class and in my opinion unbiased .
negative	ok if you haven_'_t got the idea by now , do not use ecar !!
neutral	the packaging was scruffy to begin with , looking like it had been sealed and re - sealed a number of times , and the turntable itself was tatty .
positive	well worth the money .
negative	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer . they put the blame down to switching from british_gas . that british_gas owe me the money .
negative	rang and was advised waiting for stock and as soon as they came in they would be sent out .

negative	surpirsed they are still in business based on these reviews !
positive	i bought a pair of headphones from hifiheadphones and didn_'_t get on with them .

positive	sure_enough the following_day i recieved the item , the item was packed extrenely well , after unpacking the item , i checked it closely , and it was in perfect_condition !

positive	a year later i noticed excessive_wear on the jacket around the waist draw - cord .
negative	i haven_'_t detailed all our issues on here because it '_s just more of the same as in previous posts .
neutral	however , my mistake was in not realising how expensive the delivery was , adding more_than 00_% to the item price .
neutral	why wasn_'_t the £_00 fee for the fastest service refunded to me ?
neutral	there '_s absolutely no atmosphere to be found anywhere on board and it feels_like travelling on a ghost ship .
positive	and found cjs_keys i got my key within 00_minutes and could play in 00 ,
negative	steer_clear of this company .
neutral	i have not heard_anything since .
negative	so much of it was dented , scratched , chipped etc so even before it was fitted i was told a french_polisher would be out to rectify .
positive	there are so many different brands and styles of products to choose from for all ages and from serious to quirky !
neutral	amazing .
neutral	although this was annoying it wasn ' t a real issue as i had got the items i had ordered .
negative	water pouring down the driveway , offered appointment monday , agreed phone back to confirm this , did so in 00_minutes and now its 0 days_later ?
negative	when these items were ordered i was told there were plenty in stock , however once the order was placed 0 days_later i was informed that the cpu coolers were not in stock .
positive	how '_s that for customer service ?
negative	this month , having not been supplying my gas or electricity for a month now , they have taken another month '_s direct_debit amount out of my account so that i am now in credit by £_000 !!
negative	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !

positive	cannot_praise them highly_enough and are now looking at villas for next year .
negative	when i questioned how they were going to compensate my expenses they said they would send me a voucher for a future event ( incidentally i am still yet to receive this ).
positive	booked hostels several_times in different_countries using hostelbookers . com and there were absolutely no_problems with reservation / stay .
neutral	it sounds_like a little niggle but i was 000_miles_away and i wanted to know that everything was alright .
positive	it would be great if everyone took this attitude .
negative	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
negative	the next pick_up us arranged for next saturday .
negative	what a story .
negative	the initial experience was more than acceptable , with next_day delivery .
negative	there is no way to cancel an order online so phone is the only way .
neutral	i was then told on the phone that i would be contacted once they could confirm the stock_availability and delivery date .
positive	the cost of the costume was great and it fit_perfectly too .
neutral	the shipping is where i would say this company loses out on getting the other two stars , it takes a long , long time to get to it ' s destination and i felt that once you order from them and they have your money they are not very forthcoming with their communication .
positive	( do not worry i borrowed an ipod from my dad and i had company anyway .)
negative	the driver was rude , arrogant and offensive to her and refused to leave the parcel as " she was not the addressee " and stomped off in a huff with the parcel , leaving her speechless and distressed .
positive	if you want stuff quick for a gig / tour this is the shop for you !
positive	secure your hostel with 00_% deposit and pay no booking_fees , unlike_other similar websites .

negative	got home at 0000 .
negative	i bought 0 handbasin taps from argos online .
positive	!
neutral	i ' ve picked 0 seats .
neutral	( incidentally , the receptionist was the same one who checked me in the day before who had made a big point of explaining their premier_inn ' good night guarantee ').
negative	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team . sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
positive	la date approche , le stress et l ' envie monte mais avec sara on ce sent déjà rassurer .
negative	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager . ( bad mistake ).
neutral	company was good to deal with on the phone but their warehouse let them down as there were essential parts missing from my order - the warehouse claimed everything was in the package for the courier .
negative	this has_been delivered .
negative	i complained as this would take us beyond the date that the event was taking place , the agent i spoke to was unhelpful and a bit rude and said i either wait or have groupon vouchers - i actually just wanted to go to the event so i said should i go or not as we don ' t know if it is tracking place but the agent just said she could not advise and that the voucher did not expire for a few_months - how could this be when the event was in less_than 0 weeks ?
negative	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
negative	i call back 00_mins later to find out anymore info available because the package is time sensitive .
negative	or the fool using it .
negative	was promised delivery by 0 . 00pm .
positive	goods came as_described and in time .
positive	" the bed_linen is always of excellent quality and so sumptuous .
positive	i ordered some mats but when they arrived the clips didn ' t quite line up with the ones in the car .
positive	i particularly like the quick updates by email and text_message advising me of those who have expressed interest in my property .
positive	recommend it to everyone !
neutral	we were not dropped at the correct terminal and not notified that this was he case .
positive	i will be recommending the shower_doctor to all my family and friends !
neutral	the service was fine until i noticed that an engraving had spelled ' brian ' as ' brain '.
positive	and it looks_like it is very good quality so i am_delighted .
negative	well i guess you get what you pay for .
negative	so far from very , on three different occasions
neutral	so thank_you amy of 0wm you did more than_expected .
negative	it seems to be impossible to do so .
neutral	phoned and asked to cancel the order .
negative	why was my review deleted ?
positive	i have used hostel_bookers previously before and i simply cannot_fault them .
negative	sometimes , i wonder when folks write a bad review , however , not until it does happen to you .
positive	i have just finished sage course , left it for last_minute though but once i sat down to get on with it i found it really easy to follow , even without much accounts experience .
positive	i ' ve often shopped with zavvi , as they ' ll post some very competitive offers .
positive	ordered samples which came super_fast .
positive	very easy to search for what i wanted and deffinatly the cheapest deal , no where local could match it .
negative	i will never use this company ever again !
positive	i would definatly order from them again !
positive	great for feeding larger dogs .
positive	as i am unable to get out it is lovely to be able to choose a card with my own special touch added and not having to rely_on others .
negative	i sent a recorded delivery letter to their website address citing breach of contract & demanding a refund & it was returned undelivered !
negative	.
neutral	i find particularly annoying and un - user_friendly that you cannot sort the hotel choices by price .
neutral	the packing dept needs to pay more attention to what '_s mentioned on the order .
negative	letters never acknowledged .
negative	i called up and they said the terms and conditions state it is not refundable or changeable .
positive	shopto is just amazing everything its next_day .
neutral	calling an 0000 number is expensive too , especially when there is quite a long queue .
neutral	as a consequence , about 00_% of the order were bent and damaged , and not usable .
neutral	i like the choice of games , especially the ones like pixies of the forest that explode and let more fall for an other chance to win .
positive	amazing service , amazing company , amazing prices .
neutral	a choice of seller
negative	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
neutral	😉
positive	i had dozens of responses per day , everything from nigerian scammers to 00 year_old dreamers , plus some incredibly stupid offers .
neutral	but zoomfish deducted £_00 -£ 00 because of a tiny scratch which doesn ' t affect phone functionality .
neutral	that ' s not very fair .
positive	will certainly be using echo_supplements again and recommend them to all who read this review .
positive	oh_dear !!
neutral	the staff at the tills are nice but the rest of the staff are very rude .
neutral	let '_s wait_until 00th_may and see what happens .
neutral	but i don ' t like it .
positive	no hassle service .
neutral	after realising that the loan gets paid into the guarantors account and the risk to the guarantor is the same as if he / she were to get a loan themselves .
positive	good value and reliable delivery .
positive	the only_downside i can think of is that they don ' t offer unlimited_internet , just a 0gb internet package , which is plenty for me but can be a issue for others .
neutral	a * normal * clean is more than enough ( we print around 000 a0 sheets on
neutral	while i like to concept of cashback sites , i find quidco doesn ' t quite cut it for the average shopper .
negative	yes booked yodeldirect but given yodel tracking_number frightened mouse !
positive	did not need to pay upfront and the price was cheaper_than booking with the hostel itself .
neutral	i called betterbathrooms who were very apologetic and concerned that there had been damage caused in transit .
neutral	i had hoped that writing a review here would at_least contribute to warning others , but even at here i have been frustrated .
neutral	to be fair , rubbersole tried to track down my delivery but they were just as unsuccessful as me .
positive	very pleasant to deal with , the mats are great quality and i was very pleased with the price .
neutral	however a bit of trust regained !
neutral	many_thanks faye gordge
negative	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
neutral	( i have no_idea what they were ).
neutral	even_though i paid extra for it .
positive	recommended .
negative	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
positive	really good price , well_packed item and next_day delivery .
neutral	thanks for asking me my opinion : anytime at all !
negative	then disaster hit , i lost my job .

positive	when we go back to nyc i will buy this again .
positive	!
neutral	great , but . my last 0 orders have had one item unsent in each , with an_apology and a promised future refund .
neutral	back to second and third opinion .
negative	---
neutral	).
positive	very pleased with the quality and price of these products and delivery too .
negative	i went into using gumtree as a seller with my eyes open as i had heard some pretty awful stories .
positive	great hairpiece i can just put my own hair up in a ponytail then clip on ponytail attachment , hair looks great !
neutral	i '_ll definitely_use argos again but perhaps for a product like this i '_ll use a different company where i can inspect it before i buy .
negative	after i ask to know why this package has been delayed when the " new " address has no changes from the original , i was greeted with a lot of stuttering and dithering before being put on hold for 00_minutes for him to " investigate ".
neutral	totally pointless !
positive	it ' s also very useful when you ' ve missed the delivery that either they leave a calling_card to say where they have put the parcel safely or that you can go on the website and arrange a new delivery date .
negative	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
positive	why would anyone want to use any other freight broker !
negative	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
negative	i was annoyed but agreed to let them make the glasses up for me on the following_monday and post them to me first_class .
negative	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
neutral	first of all the prices which you pay for the games are fantastic in comparison to other_places and yes it is legitimate as i got my key with only a little_bit of hassle .
neutral	when will payment be made . my transaction / listing id is 0000000
negative	!
neutral	virgin_media are very good when things work , but very bad when things go_wrong
negative	i topped_up £_00 .£ 0 . 00 off . i checked my meter . it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
neutral	especially , given how competitive the glasses are priced .
positive	i ' ve never had any delays and get all my order the next_day ( often in the morning ).
neutral	update_: received my parcel today .
positive	00 / 00 service , always cheaper_than the rest .
positive	my car passed it '_s mot but i was advised to get two tyres quickly .
neutral	the booking through usrentacar was fine but on arrival at orlando the budget reprenetative sought to persuade us to pay for an unwanted upgrade .
neutral	bought a new sofa at the end of last_year .
negative	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without any one spotting the mistake .
negative	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
neutral	the hostel has a great location , right next to the city_center .
neutral	probably not .
positive	all in all an eshopping experience that it would be hard to better .
negative	once a great place to shop but amazon is now my first_port of call .
positive	by_far the top price paid across all ipad_recycle sites .
neutral	therefore effectively pay for the holiday twice .
neutral	00_% of the results where technncally impossible from my local exchange .
positive	i found go - electrical via a web search and found the dualit kettle at a very competative price .
negative	their ' live_chat ' has been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we ' ll get it there when we can '.
neutral	i had problems with the initial set_up - but this was down to the engineers rather_than their contact center .
negative	order not received , message to customer_service ignored .
positive	i appreciated being_able to adjust numbers of photos , add and subtract , change sizes , and add text .
neutral	i just had one disappointment as i had found our perfect property but when i contacted the owner i found out that the prices were wrong .
positive	but what made me trust them from the start , was the professional and knowledgable team of people that greeted me on the phone .
neutral	why should this happen with computerised stock control ?
neutral	bad values for money
negative	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
negative	after spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
negative	we had worked with groupon on and off for 0 years and to start with even_though we were paying a lot for the advertising we got quite good expose so we just ignored the cost but as time has_gone on , the service they provide has got worst we have had to wait weeks to get paid and this after they have had the money from our clients weeks if not months before hand , no business provides a service and then should have to wait weeks to get paid and then only after threatening_legal_action do we get paid .
negative	regards ,
positive	the print is excellent quality and the t shirt is brilliant .
neutral	easyjet or sleazyjet as some of my friends like to say . are the prices fair for what you get . hard to say tbh .
negative	in the end the problem was not in my house but with their own equipement .
positive	communication and support was fast and clear at all times .
positive	thank_you for a great buying experience .
negative	after_speaking to someone about this via livechat , they informed me without giving a reason that we did not qualify for the express delivery and it was only 0 minutes late , i don ' t know how bad his maths is but i did get an inclination that he can ' t add up , as it was 00 - 00_minutes late .
neutral	0 : the inks last well and you can get some good deals on genuine inks
positive	customer_service was of an excellent quality , the advice given was clear , the consultants i spoke to were honest , efficient and did what they said they would do .
neutral	overall , the experience is geared towards individuals or large groups staying in dorms , but loses to the competition when it comes to guest houses and b_& bs .
neutral	finally , there seems to be no contact number for iflorist .
negative	!.
neutral	proper part extremely well_packaged and does the job .
negative	i ' m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
negative	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct address .
neutral	but the cube was a different_story !!
negative	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
negative	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
positive	love this site .
positive	booked the valet service a week in advance .
negative	i called at_least 00 times to the customer_service ( uk ) and nobody never picked_up the phone .
negative	no way of complaining to trainline without using premium_rate line .
negative	i emailed them three_weeks_ago and have not gotten a reply yet !
neutral	0st how can you get details of driver that wont stop
negative	i tried to purchase an iphone on line from them coming from their store in derby .
negative	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
neutral	best choice
negative	if you use these - dont expect to see good money for for tickets or any money at all !
neutral	paid £_00 for a bouquet to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday and not worth the money at all .
positive	absolutely amazing band !
positive	they told me all the supportive documents needed & my case was approved within a few hours on the same day .
positive	i have just recieved my hublot classic fusion from iconic , the whole_process of buying has_been excellent , james was very knowledgable when i first contacted them and gave me the options they had . next_day delivery after payment will_definately recommend and use in the future , also the price was the best i could find
neutral	the only time i purchase from game is when they have offers or promotions on ( not very often ), if they had more promo codes and online discounts many more people would shop there , but they are to arrogant to match prices with other online_retailers .
neutral	it was not waterproof and in the end i bought a single waterproof mattress cover and had it made up into an under cover , which given the cost of the bed i felt unhappy doing .
neutral	constant hassle from their sales teams about upgrades and new contracts ( they don_'_t like to let go ) are infuriating .
neutral	removal of a number would mean the profile becomes inactive until a new valid number is associated with it again .
positive	they were delivered within 00_hours of ordering !
negative	bought two_sets of decals one set was fine , the other were clearly ancient stock , with a white residue on the printing and signs of water_damage .
positive	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
positive	i bought this for a friends birthday , i requested help and they were helpful in helping me to speed delivery up due to time constraints .
positive	!
neutral	think wisely before choosing to shop with jessops , all in all they ' re okay but according to other cases i think i got off lightly !
neutral	such a shame that the delivery is such a let_down to a good quality retailer
neutral	their website could use some updating as it ' s not the most user - friendly , but it gets the job_done .
negative	!
neutral	although i found the service fairly stress_free and the products were delivered in the promised time_frame , i don ' t think i will bother with yesstyle products again .
negative	they then emailed a new delivery date of the 00th - guess_what - it didnt_turn_up !
negative	classic , absolutely classic !
negative	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
negative	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
neutral	daft , so you will need to handle the blacks with caution .
neutral	not good enough , e0p .
negative	when we discovered the following_morning that half the kit was missing an we rang them we were pretty_much just told that it wasn ' t their problem and that we set unrealistic deadlines .
negative	i would not spend a penny with a retailer that has so much out of date stock ( over a year to two years ).
negative	so i '_ve had to wait for days with still no resolution and with a decent weekend coming up will have to spend it looking at the uneless pile of aluminium and wood on my patio .
negative	the laptop battery failed after 00 months into a 0 year warrenty and batteries - trade . co . uk would not send a replacement battery .
positive	every issue or query i have had with any of my domain_names has been addressed superbly .
negative	i accepted this .
positive	i haven ' t contacted them through the phone yet because i ' ve had no_problems , but then again if you were to find a different network_provider you ' ll probably have same issues .
negative	!
positive	happy to recommend .
negative	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn ' t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
negative	that last line will probably be one of the most common phrases you will hear from icuk .
positive	wether it ' s the new thing on the market or our regular supplements and protein we can always depend on supplement_warehouse to have it in stock and at a discounted price you can ' t find any where else !
neutral	it was well_wrapped up so what happened ?
negative	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
negative	i would recommend anyone not to use holiday autoos .
positive	highly_recomend using this company
negative	0 .
negative	once again , no reply .
positive	hi thanks for iphone_unlock .
neutral	i would buy from them again , as the prices are so cheap . but i guess that is the risk you take with this sort of transaction .
positive	placed order less_than 00_hours ago . four new tyres_fitted in less_than an_hour and my brakes were checked too .
positive	fantastic customer service .
negative	get your money back ** fraud ***
neutral	i followed your instructions but still could not connect .
positive	they offer a lot of products at what i consider to be value for money prices .
negative	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
neutral	it took another 00_hours , so in total , i had to wait 0 days from the beginning of the process to completion .
neutral	i ordered my key without noticing the key wasn ' t being released for two days .
neutral	the major problem we had was not having anywhere big and flat enough to lay the four hoop sections level to assemble before fixing together , and i can_assure you that if you don_'_t you will encounter numerous problems .
negative	but they can not only not pay you but leave you negative feeback brilliant idea ebay !!!
positive	they are a great on - line company with a simple , well displayed site .
negative	after a very lengthy phone call to parceforce i was told it was an issue for hmrc , cue another long phone call to hmrc where i was told i would have to go through the process of claiming my money back through them and a lot of agro .
neutral	so , i rang back ( another 00_minutes on hold !)
positive	the company had the cheapest price for the product i wanted ; this did not come at the expense of service , quality or delivery .
neutral	we searched for a room and breakfast .
negative	booked on the monday for a wednesday collection which wasn_'_t collected .
negative	yes i got angry with them but not without provocation .
negative	do not use this company !
neutral	i needed it for an event i was going to in 0 days time so i waited like any normal person would .
negative	the miracle of their survival is totally based on the unfair competition of using the royal_mail ’_s existing network and infrastructures which are not available to other very hardworking , organized and responsive services .
positive	slightly annoying that deposit is non_refundable if anything were to go_wrong on the couriers end but all went_smoothly for me so no real probs :)
neutral	but , when viewing prices after entering your details a prominent message is displayed stating that your quote will not be cheaper by going directly to the insurer . got my suspicions raised straight_away , so i went direct to admiral and guess_what , almost £_00 cheaper !
positive	their website is easy to use too .
negative	one guy even go so " smart " with me saying that if i ' m on a smart_meter then i have to pay what ' s on the bill even if it says it ' s an estimated bill .
positive	i got the tyre i wanted and fitted when i wanted at the touch of a few buttons !
negative	edit
positive	much less hassle than hanging_around in tyre shops waiting room .
negative	i '_ve already exhausted myself adding comments to the other reviews .
negative	when i queried this they asked me to send a photograph so the matter could be referred to the right ‘ department ’.
neutral	mr mathew dale
negative	why can '_t they do like santander where they confirm via a text_message to my registered mobile_phone .
neutral	bij isc waar wij bij zitten is infurn ook al een ' bekende '.
positive	if you want to go elite , then give them a call and you wont look back , you wont_regret it .
neutral	0 days after order , no sign of the goods and no tracking_information provided 0 days after the order .
negative	on the advice of trading_standards to try and resolve my problem as mentioned in my review basicly the pixels were missing on my galaxy_note 0 after 0 months and went to cw for repair under_warranty and came back with a crack in the screen which was not there when they took the phone from me ( they were responsible for the crack ) anyway on ts advice i wrote to the managing_director by recorded delivery that letter which was signed for by this company has_been totally_ignored , not ever the courtesy of a reply i have sent another letter by recorded delivery will see what happens now . then i am afraid it off to court i have to say before i took the contract for the phone they were very helpful but once signed on the dotted line customer service just doesn_'_t exist with these so called professionals anyone_thinking_about using these_people read all the reviews on this site and all over the web first i wish i had .
neutral	i have logged a returns question and i am awaiting a response .
positive	ordered my new headphones around lunchtime , and was using them less_than 00hours later .
neutral	we received a call the following wednesday ( nearly another week ) to discuss this report .
neutral	emailing as per there website suggests returns a reply eventually !
negative	i '_ve demanded a refund and will let everyone know how i get on with that .
positive	browse twitter cause there is always discount_codes for free postage or 00_%_off !
neutral	therefore i was unable to assemble this item .
neutral	i e_- mailed the seller and they put one in the post straightaway .
neutral	this never arrived either so i emailed them several_times without reply .
negative	when opened there were bits and paperwork ( reg docs etc_.)
negative	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
neutral	poorly information about current order status and history of order .
negative	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work colleague .
neutral	the vip bar_crawl was a bit of a waste of time for us .
negative	i ordered online with pets at home and i wish i never bothered !
negative	i had to wait 00 min to get trough since it was urgent .
neutral	i had the paperwork from the solicitor , and noticed that even_though it said no win no fee , i was asked if i had house , car , or any insurance that had legal cover , if i didn_'_t win my case , then that would pay nah '_s solicitor , as i haven_'_t got this , they will take out an insurance_policy on the case , that '_s if they decide to go_ahead , so where is the no win no fee ???
positive	i call that a result , very pleased :)
negative	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn ' t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
neutral	i find the pizza ' s to be average and very expensive , also they are a bit stingy on toppings ive found .
negative	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge . that is outrageous !
negative	that is what it should say on their checkout basket .
neutral	i think they insist that sellers actually have the tix in their hands before allowing them to be listed - maybe wrong , but never had a pick_up to do when using them .
negative	perhaps the owner of the company has never_heard of the offence of " sending a malicious communication ".
neutral	i was expecting it to arrive on monday or latest tuesday .
positive	ever since i found out about this website through a friend , its the only place i get my supplements from .
neutral	i do feel the website needs to be laid_out a little better .
positive	good valution on phones and good fast process
positive	they did everything for me .
negative	i '_ve also had similar_experiences to those mentioned by others with this company regarding deliveries .
negative	my husband had to take a day off work otherwise the delivery would have to be rescheduled .
positive	the holiday was better_than_expected , very helpful staff , perfect oranisation , lookin for next year `_s with them at the moment :)
negative	we offered to meet them half way and pay £_00 but they refused .
neutral	not recommended
neutral	regards ,
positive	then another to say that gary would deliver between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
negative	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
negative	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
neutral	it ' s a great idea and it ' s nice to get money back on my transactions etc .
neutral	very good service , but the sheer fact that you cannot speak with anyone when something_goes_wrong with an online order is extremely frustrating .
neutral	that ' s how you keep the money rolling in .
negative	waiting 0 months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
positive	supplementwarehouse . com has the greatest sales of any online supplement website .
positive	i was given a tracking code to keep in touch with my order .
neutral	i fly regularly and choose these cheap flights but just make_sure that you don_'_t go over the allowance otherwise you will be stung .
positive	the option of sending ' waves ' allows you to know if someone is interested or not without having to type out a message !
positive	wasn_'_t expecting such a superb keyboard .
negative	received a call one saturday saying that they were from orange and wanted to discuss my upgrade options .
positive	i won a canvas_print and the service was extremely fast .
negative	so now i have a pair of trainers that won ' t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
positive	ordering online is easy and getting the tyres_fitted at a time and place convenient for myself is vital .
negative	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again .
positive	connection to wifi great also , definitely recommend .
positive	i would recommend it to anyone_looking for supplements !
positive	the condition shows that it has had very light use , and with a shutter count of a tad over 00 , 000 i am very happy indeed .
negative	he said he did not know what the problem was so could not order a part .
positive	a company you can trust .
neutral	however customer_service is truly terrible , appalling in fact .
positive	this is the second item i have purchased from this company , and again excellent service and customer_care , have already_recommended to friends and family .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 tamworth , gb arrival scan
neutral	sam was helpfull but it took a long time for him to respond i felt like he was being advised what to say or coached
positive	i will_definitely be using these_guys again
neutral	or is that one person is doing the work of three ?
neutral	i still_haven ' t received it .
neutral	i don ' t think this is a fault of efestivals though , i think this is more to do with the fact that organisers are being allot more secretive .
positive	will be using the chocolate trading company again .
negative	last_week 00_mins late this week 0 hours late .
positive	fantastic .
negative	off the phone went again .
neutral	---------
neutral	change courier services and i might .
positive	the canon instruction_manual referred to a uk address and contact numbers and the packaging contained a uk 0 - pin plug .
positive	many_thanks .
negative	derby depot apparently put the items out for delivery on 0th_april and apparently put a card through the door .
positive	snelle_levering , zeer vriendelijke klantenservice en goede prijs - kwaliteit verhouding !
negative	the company then takes it up with the po not the other way around !!!!!!!!!
negative	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
negative	oooh how it ' s been going on and on and on .
positive	i will definatly shop_here in the future .
positive	i will use again .
positive	i am planning a trip all through out europe and i will use hostelbookers for every stay i have .
neutral	as a commodore de luxe passenger i expect priority boarding and disembarkation like you used to do .
positive	the shed is great value for money and we highly_recommend this company !
positive	we go on many cruises and the ships tours are really expensive .
positive	my girlfriend was very pleased with her_birthday surprise !
negative	i should state in fairness that the service that i received from the retail side of this company in specfic relation to this situation and their attempts to try & resolve matters , was entirely decent & genuine , a shame this cant be reflected to the web side of this company .
negative	[ these results are based_upon last years which ?
neutral	ebay can be very good - as long as you don_'_t have a problem .
negative	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone_else the money back .
positive	order arrive quite quick , very impressed with their low_prices , will_definately_use this company again .
neutral	please can you get back to me asap
neutral	i find it odd that the person delivering was an elderly woman in normal clothes who was in a normal car and had lost the stylus pen in her car somewhere .
negative	a charge of the retail value of any gift not returned will be applicable .
negative	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
negative	despite several phone_calls i am still_waiting for a printer i ordered before_christmas .
negative	i bought a replacement from amazon and wish i ' d gone there in the first place .
neutral	but again when it comes to their clothing i wouldn ' t buy from them ever again .
positive	the order was received about 00_minutes outside my window but this did not concern me as i was kept up to date and knew the driver was in the area .
neutral	my order was brought out in a dirty and battered cardboard_box that the assistant opened to check the contents were ok because , he said , it was wet when it came in .
positive	ok so cheapest doesn_'_t mean best service but i was so impressed by them - i recieved an_email from them confirming everything , then a phone_call to let me know my preferred delivery date was confirmed , and was told the driver would contact me to advise a delivery time .
neutral	i am looking at air optix ( day and night ) which select_specs have priced at £_00 , this is compared to lentiamo . co . uk which is almost half the price at £_00 ???
negative	bought lava lamp - told at till v clearly - its ok to try it at home and no_probs to get a refund if i didnt like it - took it back 0 days_later after plugging it in just once - v rudely refused refund because " tried it " [ which meant i had " used it " ] - omg !!!
neutral	the pan i ordered arrived eventually but then the seat arrived with no fitting .
neutral	i will not order from healthysupplies because of this , unless they change their packing procedure .
neutral	wer bei thrifty mietet , sollte also eine kamera mit blitz bereithalten ( auf dem schwach beleuchteten parkplatz war bei regen kaum was zu sehen ).
negative	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer_service , i finally decided to switch to another provider .
negative	i could not get through to the courier despite ringing many_times , and in the end left a voicemail to say that i had to return to work .
neutral	website now showing goods out of stock and no support from gameseek , other than to say that the goods have been posted .
neutral	the other flowers i orders did have a card
neutral	but they don_'_t .
positive	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
negative	on the saturday i went to appliance direct ordered and paid for a new one all i got was a receipt for the money i paid , was not told anything about no refund . on the sunday my freezer started up again had been told on saturday delivery would be monday after 0 oclock first thing monday_morning i rang to explain what had happened .
positive	i had no_hesitation in booking through them again this year as it was another long_haul holiday and their prices were excellent - really good savings !
neutral	they are a network of extremes as i '_ll point out during this review .
neutral	i always use the high gloss option , which is always favourably commented upon by customers .
positive	will sure use again
neutral	it was a good experience , i used hostelworld most of the time but had good experience this time hotlerbookers .
neutral	i asked if the trainers could be delivered next_day and he asked for my 00 digit number from the card - again , felt like i was interrupting his flow - but i went with it and gave him the details .
negative	bought two front_tyres & had them fitted by one of their so called expert tyre_fitters .
neutral	when phoning problems i get transferred from here to there and spend hours holding .
negative	so i took them off .
negative	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
negative	and again .
positive	just couple of clicks and all done from your home and no bothering going to the bank or western_union or all this money transfer companies .
negative	. few weeks_later debt on it again .
positive	the crystal had come off , the hands were missing and it needed a service and some tlc .
positive	this is the second time i have bought from them through ebay and i thoroughly_recommend them based on my experience .
neutral	grace has agreed to call me to make arrangements on my return .
positive	seemed legit i guess .
neutral	not pleased with the quantity restrictions .
neutral	had a few bad purchases just lately and had trouble getting it sorted .
positive	it looks expensive and of top quality and sits proudly on a shelf in my living_room .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	the product is fantastic as well both in terms of value for money and taste .
neutral	i tried building this spec ( of the order ) on my own and ginger 0 priced it cheaper .
neutral	whilst generally the quality of item is value for money , sometimes i find prices not as comparable to elsewhere as i would like so that would give me pause for consideration before i buy .
neutral	please can someone get this sorted and send out a replacement , it ' s been nearly a week now .
negative	that said , having better customer support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).
positive	another great experience .
negative	no .
neutral	i didn ' t complain_about this because i don ' t know if this is an avoidable sort of thing or not .
positive	great website with lots of choice and easy to navigate around .
neutral	and my order is yet again at the stock allocation stage .
neutral	then i asked if he had put them on next_day delivery .
negative	their reply was that they have 00 days to do the refund .
neutral	it was my choice to pay the big premium so i can '_t complain_about price , but the complete absence of customer - facing ( accessible ) service is a real flaw in their business_model and should be a real concern to shoppers .
negative	sweetie , if my data is not in your system - when i provided you copies of it - maybe there just might be something wrong with your system ?
positive	booking process itself was seemless .
negative	when i started the contract i attempted to have my existing number transferred over to vodafone but after two_weeks it wasn_'_t done so i settled for another number .
positive	!
negative	i said no refund me .

positive	the flight was on time , and all in all my partner and i were genuinely impressed .
neutral	great if you want a pc without an os and useless bundled software .
negative	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking . endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!

negative	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
neutral	and they seemed arrogant enough to think that after all i ' d gone_through , i would still surely be placing orders in future with them , hence the credit .
negative	particularly when the goods are not perfect through no fault of the customer .
positive	its got such a huge_selection in products !

neutral	i think missguided can be a handy website to use but you have to approach it cautiously / sensibly - do not order from it if you have to have the item delivered within a certain time - frame and if you have a problem make_sure you are proactive and follow it up and they will respond .
negative	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
negative	complete_joke

neutral	waited the two week advised period , chased the new delivery date only to be told it will be another three_weeks !. this is a supplier issue , so to some extent beyond dawsons control . but its very frustrating !

neutral	she not only said that the screenshot that i send them wasn ' t from the website she wanted to see .
neutral	however my main gripe with these bays are the shelves .
negative	the first pair ( transitions lenses in a half frame ) fell_apart in under 0 days .
neutral	my order arrived today , couple of days_later than_expected , but as we have just had easter , i expect that had something to do with it .
neutral	however , the fact that their shipping is so expensive sometimes deters me .

neutral	hardcopy catalogues are so out of date .

neutral	having used gear0music a couple of times i will not be using them again , whilst their products are fine and prices very good if they insist on using yodel as a delivery provider i will not use them again .
neutral	sometimes they would hold some of the files probably making money !

neutral	the eye_test went ok although none of the tests were explained to me .
neutral	very good on the hard_sell but not so easy to read the bill - the pricing is not clear and there are extras which suddenly appear .
positive	we first looked at john_lewis , took a chance and saved a thousand_pounds .
positive	cheers
negative	that will be a no then .
negative	this company say they deliver a fantastic service but when something_goes_wrong its the worst customer_service , you have to chase the for answers , get told its someone_else ' s fault and then ignored when you want to cancel the order and get your money back , its to late now ill have to get someone to wait in monday as well as i am working . nice one .
positive	i ' ve never used simply_games before , but i am glad i did .

positive	james atkinson
negative	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has been taken against me for complaining .

positive	the response fully explained what had happened and my order was upgraded to first_class delivery without_any cost to me and the order actually arrived well before their " expected " arrival date .
neutral	the item was in stock when i bought it - my payment was taken in good faith that they would deliver in accordance with the web promise of fast delivery within their specified set time frame .

neutral	recently i had to book a hotel in london for a short - notice business appointment , the hotel that was recommended was a bit too far from anywhere , although it was a bit ' cheaper ' for london standards the quality was very low , incredibly small rooms ( misleading pics ) and very cold .

negative	do not go with talk_talk .
neutral	rang c / s twice , had delivery charge refunded and was told i would have to wait for depot to confirm receipt of collection from wrong_address .
neutral	it only got better after an unflattering review , but if anything that ' s even worse because it seems to suggest they can do better if they wanted to - they just choose not to unless they have to !
positive	i have used this site for a while now and every time i order from then i can gurantee i have the items more or less next workin day and at great prices :)

neutral	i have ordered several items recently using marketplace .
positive	this is the second time we have used hotel direct , excellent service , really friendly .
negative	the customer_service was totally unhelpful .
neutral	you have been_warned !
negative	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
negative	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 . meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves . yes . as good as half the amount i paid .

positive	have been very happy from the day my colour swatch arrived ( very professionally presented ) to the day my vertical blind arrived within the 0 days promised .

neutral	marlyn0000 @_hotmail . co . uk
negative	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has been handled , i would have spent close to £_000 a month -> £ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of £ 0 in chicken value .

negative	i also had my phone line , my broadband and ipad linked to o0 , and yet they still seem not to value me as a customer , or to execute any basic task i ask them to e . g . help with a broken phone .
positive	if i were you i would go to isme online .
neutral	i knew it would fail due to some issues with welding that have been highlighted for the past 0 mot ' s as advisories .

neutral	the power_supply unit i found in the machine was 000w as_opposed to the agreed spec of 000w , the wireless card i paid for was incredibly bad and knocked out when it felt_like it .

neutral	this was my first order with very and i had high expectation .
negative	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don ' t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
positive	digitalrev provides something unique , in that they not only provide fantastic prices for their equipment , they have video tutorials which are informative but also fun ( think top gear meets cameras instead of cars ) and a lot of articles on the site itself .
negative	then , to my total disbelief , i find that both the tables that they have delivered are damaged .

negative	after a lengthy conversation , it turns_out that i had actually been declined a handset by cpwh , they had in fact done their own credit check which was passed , only subject to a second check by the network_provider which was tmobile , this credit check takes up to a couple of days and cpwh send out a handset under the assumption that you will pass the networks own check , this wouldn ' t have been a problem if i hadn ' t have gone to the tmobile store to take out the second handset because i passed tmobile ' s credit check in - store , it cancelled out the one i had already taken out from carphonewarehouse which had actually just declined the check ( four days after the handset was delivered ), i was then asked to return the handset to the sales_person and was left with no phone because i had already sold mine !
positive	many_thanks .
negative	in short . bogus network !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	charges are ridiculous , money held ( pretending to be protection when they have direct_debit to my account !!!)

neutral	city_link may aswel call them shitty link excuse my french but once they left a parcel in a bush in my garden that was of value of over £_000 and did not have no card through door to say it was there and stayed out for few_days .
positive	portoen udregnes efter størrelse og vægt , jeg betalte ca .
positive	their website has a very nice layout which is easy to navigate and their 00 point check ensures any guitar i buy from them is immaculate .
neutral	at_least the headlights and air_con worked .
negative	so of course i ordered it as it seemed like it had the best reviews and the payment was safe and secure .
neutral	your product & response faultless , but as far as the complete experience goes , i can '_t ignore the fact that by choosing a company that doesn_'_t value it customers as your delivery option you have made it almost_impossible for me to order from you again .
negative	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
neutral	actually , now i '_ve said this , i may go back to waitrose . you can trust them .
positive	i knew what i wanted but so many retailers want top whack for these boots .
neutral	i ´ m a little_bit confused about the possibility to buy tickets for tomorrowland 0000 .

neutral	still having problems getting into my virgin_media after a year of trying .
positive	happy days !!!
negative	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
neutral	the woman delivering knocked on the door so quietly that even our dog who was sitting next to the door didn ' t hear it !
negative	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don ' t stock that ' response .
neutral	i was interested to read other reviews where people with disabilities have experienced problems and must draw attention to the fact that disability legislation in this country calls for " better_than equal treatment "!
negative	update , it is now 00 january but still no boot mat .
neutral	my rad was supposed to be delivered 0 weeks after i ordered it , however a week after the delivery date , i still had not received it , contacted plumbnation who said they would email me the following_day to let me know what was happening , no email , so i cancelled my order , pity they couldn_'_t be as quick at refunding my money as they were at taking it .
positive	photographs reproduced with true colours and crisp definition ( except where i chose to keep in photos that the website indicated were not optimal .
neutral	she made some useful suggestions too like checking for the latest drivers .
positive	as i had a fair few questions_regarding the products i sent out emails to snorestore which were promptly replied to .
neutral	i bought items from asos . com on 0 different occasions .
positive	overall , this is the best phone network i have been with , and i ' ve been with all the major ones in my time .
neutral	i was never probably able to access my account on - line despite spending hours waiting to speak to customers service , whose english is often so poor that the are incomprehensible .
positive	fast delivery , excellent items
negative	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
positive	kala ka - fmb baritone ukulele arrived safe and sound today - post free and only three days after ordering on line - beautiful instrument - and soundly packaged - and £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else i looked - just the job - well_done nevada_music .
neutral	other than this , great service
negative	don_'_t expect customers to read little labels to determine whether a product is on a particular offer or not .
neutral	i was going to order two but decided to order three as there was a special_offer of a gift .
negative	amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re - order it . hello muppets >>>> thats_why i ordered it in the first place . wont order from amazon again as if i order on line i expect it to be delivered
positive	i have not bought a piano yet but would think that he is interested in finding the right piano for you rather_than the most expensive / best margin .
positive	having spoken to many garages to replace a run flat tyre i then rang e_- tyres who quoted a far cheaper price and came round the next_day to my house to replace my tyre .
positive	so i ordered it .
neutral	the staff where helpful and friendly , breakfast was good , the hotel was near the venue i was going to , i would book here again if nothing for the staffs good nature and attendance towards me , and everyone_else there as apparently it was the busiest it '_s been for a while .
negative	ultimate_appliances must be the worst internet based company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter .
neutral	we had booked a speedy_shuttle but were messed about and sent to another desk at the other end of the airport which had nothing for us so went back to the first desk .
neutral	then found all the reviews on trust_pilot so sent messages to info @ nicecans . co . uk , admin @ nicecans . co . uk and filled in ' customer complaint ' form from web - site , saying i would be contacting consumer direct etc .
neutral	basically a good service but .
neutral	their internet service is very good though , i have a log in page to view my bill online .
positive	delivery very prompt .
neutral	dont get me wrong i like amazon .
positive	a great place for your health / supplement_needs :)
negative	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
positive	if i ever do find a cheaper price , they beat it .
positive	have dealt_with ebuyer since they started and they have only got better .
neutral	some of the clothing is good quality , like the t -_shirts .
positive	no_hidden_fees either , which makes tsohost one of the few companies in the industry that ' s honest about the cost .
positive	will_definately use them again without a doubt .
negative	unfortunately some companies i order from do not specify which courier they use and i often have the unfortunate luck to have hdnl for some of my orders .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	i ' m now left with £_000 + camera that doesn_'_t do what i purchased it for .
neutral	good qualty clothes , especially for babies , great sizes .

neutral	j mack
neutral	hi at the moment i am on a dmp and enquired_about an iva .
positive	best of all was the fitting service , having a motorhome brings added pressure when needing new tyres .
positive	thanks for the great prices and keep up the great work guys !!
neutral	- their customer_service call_centre is based overseas , which makes calls a bit of pain as you have to try and understand instruction from a foreigner with poor english .
negative	they need to be exposed so that other consumers do not fall victim .
negative	i rang them again , they eventually got back to me to say they ' d put one in the post .
negative	i ' ve been with them since i had my first ever phone .
neutral	i gather that the shop is better_than their on - line presence .
positive	easy to use and zero cost - why wouldn_'_t you ?
negative	i recently did a project on comparing on - line parcel companies and here are my findings .
negative	i paid 00 . 00gbp :(((
neutral	but they don ' t have a culture of proactive customer_service , they just like to keep everything ticking along , and trying to make your complaint go away quietly .
positive	i haved used several other_websites and opticians before i used dragonspecs and have to say that dragonspecs has been outstanding in responding to queries than any of the other_websites / opticians plus you pay a fraction of what you would normally pay if you place the same order with one of the major high_street opticians .
positive	i was also impressed as i only purchased my canvas on the website at 0 . 00 monday aftrnoon and it arrived just after 0 . 00 tuesday_morning !
neutral	i paid £_00 . 00 to be told something that i already knew !
negative	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
negative	when we tried to leave they wouldn_'_t transfer our account to the new company we chose .
neutral	i emailed back to clarify if they meant a replacement unit as having paid a lot of money for ready built items i would not expect to have to repair a damaged item myself .
negative	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
neutral	at the base and at the rear of the frame is the ' limited_edition ' number .
negative	only the agency can give me refund .
positive	the second game was available on download at xbox_live which i didnt know
negative	their email stated they were confirming an offer to buy , and would let me know if my order was accepted !
positive	well . after 0 weeks . im writing this after finishing setting_up my " new " and unlocked iphone :_d good job guys thanks !
positive	couldn_'_t fault ao . com one bit and will be doing any future appliance shopping through them .
positive	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
neutral	arrived eventually caused problems but it was valentines_day .
positive	from ordering till delivery was only a couple of days it was so quick .
positive	i ' d like to meet their m . d .!
negative	these are the same t &_c ' s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c ' s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c ' s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
negative	their costumer_service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
neutral	this will rule out my ordering from them again , unless desperate for a particular product
neutral	she mentioned the 00 - hr helpline and a call - out service they offer if any_problems .
negative	i quicker to get in your car spend 0 hours in the supermarket and come home than trying to order a weekly_shop on this site .
neutral	my advice is for people to order small_quantities initially , to see if the quality is up to par , before placing a bigger order .
neutral	i ' d not heard of such a thing and if firefly are letting car ' s oil levels run so low that the oil light comes on in the first place - then this is not good practice for the engine .
negative	they don ' t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
neutral	i wanted to host an existing domain on a uk_based server , so this seemed a good hosting option .
positive	shipping is per order and not necessarily per item which is nice too .
positive	many ' money off ' offers ( which all nutrition supplement websites have right ?
negative	i have sent the phone back by special recorded delivery at a cost of £ 0 to me .
negative	it failed it ' s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
negative	wrote a little message for my mum .
negative	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february 00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
negative	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally ignored too .
positive	the order was correct and delivery was swift .
negative	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
positive	code : ha000 - 000
positive	overall it took 0 weeks , but it '_s free money so the wait is insignificant .
negative	but this was about to change .
negative	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
neutral	i have dealt_with many who have advised me that i would have to wait for stock and the bill will be settled upon completion of order .
neutral	elbec called me and we arranged a delivery date .
neutral	don ' t get me wrong i ' ve ordered from them a lot and will probably continue to do so but the prices they charge for their products i feel are expensive for what it actually is .
positive	over the last couple of years i have placed 00 or so orders with shopto . net .
positive	customer_service - extremely_helpful and always there to deal with every issue you might have .
neutral	definite short fall in communication by sales / web team in this matter .
neutral	complained and did get a very quick response and offered 00_%_off as an_apology .
negative	my advise to all avoid . avoid . avoid terrible service !
negative	unfortunately my 00 year_old mother is not tech - savvy so customer ' service ' refused to take any further action .
negative	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
neutral	i would suggest anyone staying here to pop across to tescos , a stones throw_away , and get all you need for less_than half the price .
positive	yessssssssssss !
positive	i always love buying with fragrance_direct .
negative	kind_regards
positive	i ' m thrilled with all of the products and super happy with the next_day delivery .
negative	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
neutral	this was strange to me , so i tracked my parcel via their website and it said no one was in to sign for package ?
neutral	change that and it will be 0_stars !
neutral	poor service in the vip lounge .
negative	on the due date i did this but heard_nothing .
neutral	why are the notes on this wrong , or am i just being fobbed_off ?
positive	very punctual , careful and helpful delivery guys .
negative	when i turned to the store manager for an explanation his answer was " well it is from our budget range what do you expect " this left me not only furious but also in an awkward position as i had already installed the bath and toilet , i could not wait another 0 weeks for another replacement so i was effectively forced to keep my old sink .
neutral	when i arrived at tesco the monitors weren ' t there , and the staff , whilst attempting to be helpful , told me that they couldn ' t do anything and i ' d have to call cleverboxes myself to find out where my goods were ( and i ' d have to find the number myself because they didn ' t have it !).
neutral	it is just the problematic part of finding a phone number , getting through to someone , and trying to change your delivery dates / address .
positive	excellent service .
negative	by this point , tickets had tripled in price on ebay , and were very , very difficult to get hold of , as the event had long sold out .
neutral	i am waiting for my aqua hydrate water and i am so excited .
neutral	the website is poorly laid_out and looks about as cheap as some of the advice .
neutral	i use easyjet every year to go on holiday to majorca .
neutral	rung up , pleasant lady answered the phone , all went well until i couldn ' t provide other drivers details , was told to ring my insurance to get that info , rang my insurance , not allowed to give it me for data_protection , fair_enough , waited for scheduled call back from nah at 00 . 00 and didn ' t get the call until 00 . 00 .
neutral	the second bag however , has quite a lot of white bits , right throughout the mix and , no matter how hard i shake , these white bits will not dissolve , making the mix a little bit lumpy and less enjoyable .
negative	i explained that this was not convenient , as i had discussed with the manager before .
positive	being somebody who has been raised to be paranoid about food safety , especially when it comes to chicken , i was very wary about ordering meat online .
negative	then i decided to go all out three years_ago and buy one that cost £ 0 , 000 or thereabouts , all the best components i could_afford .
positive	would recommend it to anyone .
negative	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
negative	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
negative	( i have email as proof ). when camera arrived , there was no factory seal , just a ' shop seal '
negative	if they can ' t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
negative	what does this mean .
negative	returned three of six items as poor quality , got an_email_confirming that they received the items ant that refund is just about to be done .
neutral	no surprises to say that 0 items ( which were way too large to be hiding under flaps ) were not there .
negative	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum sticks out quite a way )
negative	asked for full_refund to which she said we will refund you in full .
positive	we all know the impact of bulk sms marketing .
neutral	having read their estimated_delivery time of 0 ~ 0 working_days , i thought i would receive my skis quite soon .
negative	just recieve notification that my flight was canceled by airline in 0 days before flight .
negative	lost all my patience . and decided to just cancell the contract and finish with this crappy miserable service .
positive	our first night spent in linekers bar was great .
neutral	the company refused point_blank to refund anything , so i am down the cost of 0 metres of worktop .
negative	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
negative	very poor service .
positive	i have been promised a 0 day turn_around , so fingers_crossed it ' ll be ready .
positive	much_cheaper then some of the more known blind companies with no drop in quality .
positive	amazing service !
negative	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
negative	i have advised wowcher that i would be complaining to the oft because this clearly breached the trading practices act because not only did i not receive the product they sold me i was ripped_off by paying dearly for posting a product that i cant get a tracking_number to .
neutral	which i found a disgrace !!!
neutral	had to pay 0 postage_charges as you have to order banners seprately from other products .
positive	i '_ve bought from bikers gear twice now over a period of nine_months .

neutral	come on double0 sort it out does the left hand no what the right is doing ?
neutral	only time will prove the overall value of this shelving system .
positive	i recently bought a pair of running_shoes from these_guys .
positive	trusty .
negative	dodgy company , would never use again .
neutral	while the quality of the wool and the finish are both very good , the overall look of the jumpers is not as good as many others that i own ; i always find myself choosing a different one rather_than the woolover when i go to the wardrobe .
neutral	customer service is fast and pleasantly polite & helpful but i cannot_afford to purchase too much at one time being inhibited by income .
negative	i am and i voted in may .
negative	when i said no was advised that ws would contact the delivery company .
negative	anyone knows_how to deal with scam like this ?
negative	only gave one star as you have to enter something !
neutral	pity this little incident let them down really as generally their products are good and their support has_been strong with good technical_knowledge and assistance .
neutral	your products and prices are top_notch but your shipping is very unreliable .
negative	so i track it down , and request delivery 0 days_later knowing i '_ll be away for 0 days - and they just dump it on the doorstep while we ' re away !
positive	very pleased with the work tops .
neutral	i was on two crutches due to an injury and tired from the flight and my wife was unhappy about completing paperwork again so we took the upgrade but were not happy with the unethical tactics .

neutral	good reception , nothing really to complain_about , would give 0 / 0 except rip - off price on extra data - £ 0 . 00 per 0mb .?
neutral	my advice - go_elsewhere and don_'_t touch hammonds with a barge_pole !!
neutral	that 0 seat can be taken up by 0 person .
neutral	as the title_says
positive	haha .
negative	the person who gave them a 0 star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
positive	his prices are very good aswell for what you get .
positive	there ain ' t no wings and angels , but there are boards and dudes .
negative	the ic and tv connection kept disconnecting every 00_minutes and caused no end of headaches , plus the callcentres in india do not help .
neutral	it keeps crashing and have to reboot it .
positive	tried to buy the same sunglasses from a different company as was so messed_around , so i tried blaze instead and i ' m so pleased i did .
negative	i will no doubt never be using orange or ee , ever , ever again and will now be taking_legal_action_against them .

neutral	also their stirling store is very bad for putting clothes on wrong_size hangers !
negative	we have been advised by trading_standards that under the sale of goods_act 0000 we received an item that was not as descibed , so we are entitled to a refund or exchange .
positive	i would definately use this again .
neutral	i spent 00_minutes on hold today , and similar times daily ringing up trying to get this sorted .
neutral	the delivery people however are a joke !
neutral	i was a little surprised at the condition of the toyota car when i frist saw it .
positive	and prices are attractive .
neutral	very arrogant in their dealings with the public .
neutral	had to send an_email & wait for response .

neutral	don ' t sell anything that ' s expensive to ship !
negative	they realised that their website was wrong and sent me a lower model tv than i had ordered but did not charge me any less .

neutral	despite the woman on the other end of the phone speaking clear english , and being english myself , she then_proceeded to repeatedly ignore me , and my partner , after we kept telling her she was reading us my previous address .
neutral	it took just over a week for the money to reach my account which i wouldn t call especially fast or slow .
neutral	i got a reply the next evening , within 00 working hours as they promised .
neutral	you know the items are 00_% over priced compared to other shops , but the quality is good .
positive	we have now picked_up our_wedding_rings and are very impressed with them and the presentation of them was beautiful in lovely boxes and bag .

neutral	most of the time if i email , i would be lucky to ever get a reply .
neutral	
neutral	seems to be a number of dishonest or ignorant sellers selling secondhand tools who forget to describe or photograph damage , very frustrating , however certainly not all though .
neutral	what i am not happy with is that delivery of the replacement cistern follows the normal delivery course , ie about five days .
positive	yes 0 day !!!
positive	never had any_problems with them and would recommend .
neutral	notified after four days of out of stock item and taking a further week to deliver .
neutral	smart people .
neutral	listing fees , then the listing fees , then the 00_% commission hits you .
negative	interlink_express have been to my house several_times before but the tracking said that the address could not be found .
neutral	i '_ve just booked a hotel in nice for 0 nights that was £_000 cheaper
negative	0 .
positive	if something isn ' t right , they refund / exchange really easily and have never had a problem with them at all !
negative	if they respond now to this review with some sob - story or ' excuse ', they need to ask themselves why didn_'_t they contact me to give me a reasonable explanation or , more_importantly , get on and deal with the issue .
negative	they are selling brackets for £_00 /£ 00 /£ 00 & £_000 then sending brackets that are priced at £_00 on their website .
positive	perfect item and perfect service .
neutral	i ' ve played here quite a while its an ok casino with some good games , i ' m mainly a slot player & although there is a decent variety of slots casino cannot compete with some casinos that have huge varieties of slots ( bet victor , paddy power , grosvenor ) . to mention a few .
negative	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .

positive	thank_you hostelbookers for helping me to save my money for the travel and i trusted you .
neutral	the whole social_media connection is a big turn off for some reviewers .

neutral	a ratings system on their site would be good as that way i could say to other people not to bother with this asus motherboard and pick something else .
positive	i purchased a triton_shower from the shower_doctor no problem ordering , great price and speedy delivery what more could you ask for .
neutral	the prices are great , after you take the time to find them cheaper somewhere_else and then deal with the time for inputting the information to get the price beat deals .
neutral	therefore i would suggest that an easy to use screen detailing the shipping details and estimated delivery date would have made this move from a 0 to a 0 .
positive	superb
neutral	after paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery i was disappointed that i was having to chase around my delivery .
positive	phones0cash also gives me reviews on new phones so when my upgrade is due i can choose a phone from the help of phones0cash .
negative	do not use this company for anything , ever .
negative	however , please be advised that this timescale can increase or decrease based on individual bank practice .
positive	i am very satisfied
neutral	being out of stock is understandable on items that you don_'_t have control over .
neutral	one thing i noticed , which may just be a coincidence , but in all the time i was playing after sign_up , and i switched rooms a few_times , i was seeing the same name appear as a winner frequently .

neutral	needless to say , i wasted three days off my work with no further sign of hearing from parcelforce ( apart_from automated confirmation of having processed my redelivery orders ).
neutral	try book depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping .
neutral	the sales_person dale was very knowledgeable and extremely_helpful in us making the right choice .
positive	great site
positive	thanks

positive	as a nervous newbie , i felt concern on the day it was due to be collected , for ' next_day delivery ' when the day was closing fast , and the parcel had still not been collected half an_hour before the ' end ' time . but then , in the nic ' of time the courier arrived , and all was well :-)
negative	i really want the bed and some sort of compensation for all the hassle and money lost through days of work and no decent nights_sleep .
positive	would like to see them stock schiek training accessories , but that bears no reflection the speedy and satisfactory service .

neutral	turns_out we had to pay an extra fee of 00 € at the arrival !
neutral	overall service is good
negative	in one of her nonsense answers she was asking me to fill in the attached form ( which was not attached ) and send my postage proof even if she could see that she has already confirmed me they got the items back .
negative	after several phone_calls , they claimed that they never received the form and asked for a copy which was sent recorded delivery .
negative	( 0 ) pay a broker fees equivalent twice of monthly wage and we have no_idea of import and tax duty so wait but there is no time_frame as soon as we clear the parcel we will deliver it to you .
negative	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .

positive	=)
positive	i then checked the carphone_warehouse website , which showed a delivery date of monday 00 september and the same price as the apple_store .
negative	the automated service is far from helpful .
neutral	i would not buy my main evening wear or other casuals here .
neutral	it can take up to 00 + days just for them to resolve it ?
negative	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
negative	your asking the customer to do your job for you .
neutral	perhaps people are unable to prevent themselves from stealing bedside_tables ?
negative	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long queues .
positive	just select currency , enter the amount you want to exchange , travelex do the conversion , you decide on your method of payment you can either pick it up at the airport or have it delivered to your door .
positive	this is the place to go !
negative	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
positive	the product is fantastic , i am feeling really good and can ' t believe i am already seeing results after such a short_period .
positive	good service .
neutral	poorly , hastily written replies to my emails .
negative	booked a delivery through parcel0go , thought i ' d try city_link , next_day service , city_link failed to collect two days running .
negative	then the problems started .
neutral	although the service was superb i would look to see if there was a more inclusive package so that i am able to budget accordingly in the future .
negative	since i do not have a credit_card i asked to cancel the booking and have a refund .
negative	my signal finally came back last friday for about a day . then a pigeon flew into the mast or something and i ' m left without signal again .

positive	would have no_hesitation in using mazuma again
neutral	handluggage beware !
neutral	i think overall the ticket prices on viagogo are better_than some sites and the layout to choose the tickets is also really good .
neutral	what did not impress me was the fact that the money was taken as soon as i placed the order , regardless that there was no stock to send .
positive	the envelope arrived the next_day and i had money in my account that week !
negative	absolutely apalled .
positive	the company and driver we chose were brilliant - couldn_'_t fault them .
positive	when the first beer comes free as part of the package we only effectively spent £_00 on beer between the 00 of us .
negative	i thought maybe it was a one off , but no , i placed another order , made sure the address was exactly the same as paypal expected , so no_problems with that this time .
positive	there is always something to find for a present .
positive	would recommend them to anyone , they have a great variety of products at very reasonable prices .
negative	the assistant , whom i admit was very pleasant , asked me for my name and post_code so as to check on the status of my collection .
neutral	first the network is now imho brilliant .
neutral	the setup is also much_easier than other_providers i tried ( i moved to sky from aol , who made a lot of fuss about ' allowing ' me to transfer )
positive	very sound .
negative	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
neutral	now the springs have gone .
neutral	but still a long way to go to match dfds ' prices and level of service !
negative	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times . nothing from superfi , ok , bit worrying , but ok .
negative	what an underhand devious money making scam !
positive	thank_you
neutral	they had tried to take money from my bank , which was not agreed !

neutral	pity about delay but good communications and a good price so will try this company again .
neutral	they weren_'_t .
positive	if you need to return anything they issue you with a credit within a couple of days of posting product back .
neutral	the online service made a arduous task simple and effective .
positive	all_round a problem free transaction which will mean they will get my business again .
neutral	that is where they lack to their competitors .
neutral	it `_s been a sort of up and down three years .
neutral	i can see other banks offer much more for the same price .
positive	had my product listed with full description at a great price and it was in stock .
neutral	are clueless in seattle but most of us with a wide format pro printer
negative	the parcel were chocolates which could have been ruined as they were out in the rain ).
neutral	and if you want to have it delivered on saturday you have to pay £_00 for it .
negative	however , i was fobbed of with a response from the team_leader that i spoke to originally .
negative	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
positive	second instrument i have bought and again unbeatable value and quality on the gear 0 music own_brand gear .
negative	with some effort on my part i will make the bracket work but most people do not have the time , energy and expertise necessary to do this .
positive	excellent service highly_recommended .
negative	i made an order for a chair on 00 / 00 / 00 and cancelled it the same evening .
negative	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
negative	the driver then got back in the drivers seat and drove off .
positive	the result is a very happy customer who would happily use performance_alloys again and recommend them to anyone .
neutral	someone should tell the staff that a smile and cheery countenance is a way of getting customers to return .
negative	according to their website i can ' t have a refund whilst the order is ' partially delivered '.
neutral	a quick phone_call and this was sorted , a new box was sent .
neutral	so i rang him and he proceeded to lie that my order would be there the next_day ; it turned_up an_hour later .
positive	excellent quality - happy with the product .
negative	i thought that was fair_enough and was confident that everything would be sorted_out , as i knew i had been totally clear about the timings .
neutral	in the end we gave up !
negative	october , fully five weeks after they were ordered .
neutral	with a 0 year_old and 0 year_old at 00pm this is difficult - especially when it says transfer is 00_mins ( which it was when we finally got going )!
neutral	when i emailed them , they said i ' d bought the last one , and that those brackets were now out of stock , so they only charged me for one .
negative	still no key
neutral	0 / 0 is generous .
neutral	this company sent me an unlocking procedure that is readily_available online for free instead of an_email_confirming that my phone was unlocked .
negative	when i phoned them to see if they habe received my cheque i was told this they didn ' t accept cheques by 0 advisor bit was advised by somebody_else that i could pay by this method .
positive	friendly , informative and fun !

positive	a . eaton
negative	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn ' t need to give notice to leave .
neutral	when booking i stressed the importance if 0 in the party witg specific dietary needs and was reassured we had a choice of the full menu and needs would be catered for .
neutral	won_'_t but anything_else now until they give me the credit .
positive	the booking page is clear it tells you exactly_what you need to pay when you get there and also about cancellations , which as a backpacker is key information as plans always change !!
negative	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
positive	the product i ordered ticked every box . it was very good quality was very good value and came within 0 days . very satisfied customer !

neutral	having written a bad review due to a very sub_standard bouquet , containing roses that were dying , i now have to write another review because i '_ve had a replacement .
negative	they told me that they can only refund half the amount even_though i paid insurance !
positive	shipping is so fast , it is easier than going to a store and buying it there !
neutral	i am starting to get worried .
negative	i was told i was not allowed a refund .
neutral	i am now trying another on line supplier , who '_s products are equally competitive and won_'_t be signing_up for any more auto re - orders with anyone .
neutral	picking_up at a box office on the day can be a hassle but i have always been emailed letters of authorization from the original purchaser to take with me .
positive	goods as promised with rapid delivery .
neutral	this wasn ' t explained in_advance and it wasn ' t possible to fix the problem .
negative	but the story dosent end there . then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!
negative	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
negative	avoid_avoid
negative	the very few positive_reviews on this site indicate a company trying but failing to offer customer service , if you are lucky_enough to order something de cuisine have in stock then i am sure they will send it .
positive	great company who saved my bacon on mothers_day after a disaster with a less reputable service !

negative	they said they couldn_'_t find me and that the parcels were improperly addressed .
positive	had used parcelforce for many_years , but it '_s become expensive and the website is unreliable - along comes hermes where i can book parcels with ease and pop along to my one stop shop to drop them off , no waiting , no hangups .
negative	and your account is to follow .
neutral	some of the times have been my fault in not wanting a replacement at another time / day , but not always .

neutral	the thing about currys and it ' s sister companies pc_world and dixons , is that they do offer very good prices on certain products but they are really difficult to buy as they are usually out of stock , despite being continually advertised for sale .
neutral	their methods to sign people up are sneaky and it ' s left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth , before the goods have even arrived .

neutral	and then a massive service charge pr ticket was also added frustrating but we got to see the show and my wife was very happy however she does not know quite how much i paid yet :)
negative	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
negative	i thought they had gathered them all .
positive	but there it was on your website and just a few short days_later it is sitting smugly waiting to be installed .
negative	changing registrars is what they told me .
negative	david .
negative	avoid .
negative	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
neutral	two items were received damaged and unusable , i failed to spot worktop damage until i unpacked it for the install four weeks_later .
neutral	pricing and delivery very good , however beware of signing_up for their automatic re - ordering !
neutral	booked a place for 0 nights in birmingham and everything went through .
neutral	when my contract completed i emailed stating my intention was to finish the service .
positive	at first i was skeptical as how can a third_party unlock the iphone officially which the apple_store denied to do it .
neutral	service is ok but some of the images for barbour on your site are awful .
neutral	i am beginning to wonder_if they are they a real company at all , or just people who take your money and then don_'_t deliver - literally !
positive	in the end it proved to be straightforward .
negative	since the last few_days , the customer_service phone does not even work ( just the machine that says press 0 to . press 0 .).
neutral	the range of products are amazing .
neutral	as mentioned in other reviews nabru address themselves as the company name , this does not fill you with confidence .
positive	can ' t wait to rock the new t -_shirts i ordered .
negative	after this review i finally got a reply and a postal refund and eventually the watch which they posted to my invoice address and not my delivery address ,

negative	a complete_disaster from start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
neutral	however , one problem spoiled it all and that was flimsy , inadequate packaging !
negative	you are given two cards , a bp card to pay for the fuel and a nectar card - yes they get the points and you have to record the number of nectar points on your manifest .
positive	!
neutral	i am very surprised that so few have reviewed dhgate and those who have , had nothing particularly nice to say .
negative	the result is i can not make a claim to get my phone repaired .
negative	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 ' s era pc with a script to read from .
neutral	i ' m sure it wasn ' t their fault – and their support staff was helpful when i contacted them asking for an update – but if you want your game in a hurry you can ' t rely_on them to deliver it super_fast .
positive	i like this .
positive	will use this company again .

neutral	no hand soap in the bathroom .

positive	there was a very slight_delay with my order due to the item not being stock and i was immediately e_- mailed to inform me of the expected delivery date .
neutral	due to my experience with dx , i will not be using gymroom again unless they can get my goods to me via a different delivery method .
neutral	so i went to have my eyes tested again to see what my new prescription would be , and i thought i would grab a cheap deal on groupon as i kept seeing them come up .
neutral	i checked in , the poor guy behind the counter was manning both the reception_area and the bar !
positive	outstanding service and great value for money .
positive	delivery always on time .
neutral	the drawback of this : potential_customers are led to believe a product is good when maybe it is not so good .
negative	cal themselves cheap ?
negative	i sent my blackberry bold to these_guys as they gave me the best quote .
positive	we booked our flights with adam who was very helpful as i had mistakenly mis_- spelt my name but he managed to change it without me incurring charges .

positive	had a query and used the chat service and was connected to ashley .
positive	we went to la sala for a lovely meal and cocktails one night .
negative	argumentative , objectionable , rude , insulting - you name it .
neutral	i cancelled my order straight_away , that means 0 weeks in total of waiting , i ' d had enough .
positive	highly_recommended !
neutral	00 / 00 / 00 00 : 00 .
positive	so nice to have your car picked_up and brought back to you and at a lower cost than the dealers prices
neutral	was bit surprised at i have 0000 standard model and was charged extra for this .
negative	i tried talk to them , their web form doesn_'_t work at all , anyway after couple of days i managed to contact them and all they do is quoting their own polices .
positive	our camp was tiny , private and silent - a perfect tranquil stop ( though if we went to the dune top we could see a tent city nearby that apparently housed 000 people with electricity etc . what ' s the point of that ?)
neutral	however , . when we arrived home i immediately noticed that they had given us the wrong_size of tv so i rang and spoke with dale who apologised for the error .
negative	back this was 0 and a half weeks_ago still_waiting for my
neutral	i contacted them by email explaining the situation but no reply ( however according to their website this should not have been the case ).
neutral	unfortunately it only has 0 takeaways in my area when just_eat has something like 00 and more .
positive	would definitely_use this company again .
positive	serenata was not the first choice , but it will be in future , interflora '_s loss is their gain .
negative	i suggest that others do not use pet suupermarket as you will lose money and get ripped_off !
neutral	rubbersole were good and despatched quickly .
neutral	also , i had to communicate with office with keys etc .

positive	nothing more really needs to be said !
negative	kind_regards ,
neutral	), doors , bathroom noise etc .
positive	i was a little reluctant since i know its best to taste n try before you buy but didn_'_t have much option .
neutral	on the upside its simple to send your stuff and completely hassle_free , on the downside you get a fraction of what your stuff is worth and its not guaranteed to be accepted .
negative	the companies who send parcels by this company should be_ashamed of themselves . yodel is not fit for the purpose . 0 cards were left and each time we went to their depot but was told we needed a tracking_number , but we didn_'_t have one so we couldn_'_t give one . on the 0th visit we were told it had been returned to sender . the manager refused to talk to us . the sender has not received it back even after 0 weeks and yodel does not know where the parcel is . reading other reviews i can believe they still exist . i would be_ashamed the even admit i worked for this company , thats if i did work for them but i dont .

neutral	disappointed with their service
neutral	other_firms offer better odds in general plus the ability to put your bets on the night before with some of your bets being gauranteed .
negative	this person was polite unlike everyone_else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
neutral	quickly , you can have a bargain .
negative	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail message .
negative	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
neutral	often find what i want that i am unable to find elsewhere .
positive	my friend was really pleased with her gift .
neutral	as the drivers are snobby
neutral	a full 0 hours after they said they ' d first turn_up , they did .
positive	this march , my brother has sent me the iphone_0s to me from america .
positive	high_quality products at reasonable prices a delivery service that is second to none
negative	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
neutral	the good points are that it tastes great and is reasonably_priced , but i am a little_concerned about the inconsistent quality and may consider trying another supplier for my next purchase .
neutral	they also sent me the tracking_number in the e_- mail , which i needed to collect my item there .
neutral	it seems both companies have technology that proves once again that if you feed it garbage you get garbage out .

neutral	average service doesn_'_t wear these days .

positive	if they do not have something that you ordered in stock , they are very sensible about what they give you as a replacement .
neutral	free delivery is great and they ' re generous with the periodic issue of discount_codes , etc .
neutral	the greeting cards look good and i was pleased with the result .
neutral	i received my order for my 0 stone emerald cut trilogy 00k white gold ring , looks beautiful design , delivery , was great ( i live in germany ) and communication was also really good .
negative	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality_control for the following reasons ;
negative	( 0 ) " you did not pick_up the item " all capitalised .
negative	if you want reliablelty stay_away from interparcel
neutral	real world .
negative	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
positive	hardware next_day by courier for free .
neutral	also they only seem to take designer clothing in mint_condition which they pay you pennies for , you are better selling it on ebay or taking it to a shop who buy designer clothing .
neutral	just a thought .
negative	i waited nearly 0 hours to be picked_up spoilt my holiday
neutral	the only resort appears to ask my credit_card company to reimburse me for damaged goods otherwise i will have to resort to the small_claims court .

neutral	please now will you snd me my voucher for £_00 for nike jacket i returned .
neutral	france has got so much to offer and you ' re wasting it .
negative	lucky i paid via_paypal i have asked them to step in and refund me .
positive	the chocolates were well_packaged and none of the items were broken .
negative	i will never shop there again .
negative	my point is i ’ ve had to refund my customer as he paid for 00 hr courier not 00 hr courier .
negative	i explained that this was not the type of car i had paid and after insisting that this was not satisfactory she made a call to her manager and then told me there was no other car available and that as far as the rental company was concerned i could take it or leave it .
neutral	?
negative	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
negative	yes building up of credit may help to pay for higher bills in colder months .
neutral	waiting for 0 more dresses so hopefully these will arrive like my 0nd packages , and they changed my mind as i am now a returning customer !

neutral	i booked two flight tickets with bravofly and i got a confirmation e_- mail of different flight details .

negative	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip offs !
negative	i do understand that vehicle breakdowns are beyond anybody ' s control , but am not understanding of the fact that asda does not rectify their failure by arranging for a re - delivery at the earliest convenience .
negative	they will also promise to refund , and then will not investigate for 00 working_days if anything goes wring .
negative	my customer calls me to say the goods havent arrived ( despite us doing our job and the courier failing to deliver - obviously the customer will balme us as we are their contact ).
negative	what a shower !
negative	as with too many companies they care more about the image of good customer_service rather_than the implementation of it !
neutral	after a few email '_s back and forth , my radio actually shipped 0 days after_placing the order .
positive	my collect_+ point is quite close so it only tool about 00_minutes from the time i decided to use collect_+ to the time i dropped_off my parcel which was delivered the following_morning .
neutral	these deals come up often so keep checking .
neutral	some bright spark in the warehouse must have thought it was appropriate to send it in that state .
neutral	the only reason i still placed my order here , was that i talked to a nice representative on the phone , who while could not match the overall shipped price , did give me a $ 0 off coupon , bringing the price to the same as the second lowest advertised shipped price .
positive	wow .

neutral	i have to say iv actually never felt inclined to write a review .
negative	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
neutral	the shed arrived early in the day but i had no call , so it was lucky my wife was in .
neutral	obviously not petsupermarkets fault but a follow_up to yodel is in order .
neutral	unfortunately the courier service used by bed kingdom proved unreliable first time around .
positive	sent it away and got it back 00_hours_later !
negative	worst website i have ever shopped from in my life the customer_service is just disgusting , i advise everyone to avoid this website .
neutral	only thing that makes me give them 0_stars is quite often there are long queues to pay .
negative	while speaking to ankita ( another maganer ) she told me that i had to call to the loyalty department to cancel , when requested a call back i was informed that that wans ' t possible . and i had to call in the morning .

neutral	i did comment to customer_services in case it was faulty . the test is .
neutral	i found applying for and then purchasing the insurance for my macbook_pro pretty simple - no issues there .
positive	after 00 years on an over - firm and less_than comfortable millbrook mattress , i wondered whether the firm baronet was the right choice .
neutral	communication is the key !
neutral	my only reason for not giving more stars is their after - sales support .
positive	arrived on time .
positive	i took my iphone to the apple_store and requested for an official_unlock .
positive	my recommendation is that a centre support be used when fitting a 000cm pole , especially when hanging heavy weight curtains .
neutral	i appreciate they don ' t have the technology of just_eat but a confirmation_email or text with estimated_delivery time would make me use this site again .
negative	good luck with that attitude .
neutral	ok i have been with talktalk for about 0 years and have to say the actual broadband / phone service has been excellent .
negative	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
negative	they sent me an_email my order has been shiped and i checked with my wife she said she haven ' t received anything , so i again checked with them they tried to convince me that order has been shipped . atlast i reported it as a scam

positive	great prices , easy navigation , fast checkout . and i can '_t wait for some super freebies supplementwarehouse offered !
neutral	would i buy again ?
negative	i ’ ve placed a second order a week_later with the musclefood hoping it would appear on the second order , this was not the case .
positive	and the ease of use of their website plus google_checkout / paypal for payment is so easy even a child could do it .
positive	the website was great as it gave me differant ways to make my choices , either by selecting a design , or perhaps the colour first .
neutral	i was unable to contact the company as their e_- mail was always off - line so sent it back (£ 0 . 00 for postage ) and to their credit , they refunded my money within a week .
positive	we are very happy customers !
negative	this leaves you and i , the paying customers , with high pings , packet loss exceeding 00_% and sore fingers from typing so many frustrated emails to their support staff over the weekend .
positive	i paid online for the rental to be collected from girona airport , spain .
positive	i have ordered several_times from sw . com and will not enter a gnc or other venue .
positive	you will not get a stock answer to a question you did not ask , or , even worse , ignored .
negative	total rubbish .
positive	so , i truelly really on these_guys to get me preped and ready for my shows !
negative	this is the last time i will deal with them or the far east again as i would rather pay extra from a uk company .
neutral	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
positive	i had been for consultations before with other_companies and what i liked about nu was that you have a consultation with the actual surgeon , rather_than a sales_rep .
neutral	i made it clear to them that i would be willing to pay extra for my desired length , but got no reply back .
negative	i ' m now with tesco who have much cheaper packages and only english call_centres .

neutral	the original review was titled ' almost exceptional ' and gave ****.
negative	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
negative	had to wait for wrong item to be returned to pcw before they would despatch the correct item .
neutral	you can make plenty cash here or lose your account unfairly if a buyer complains for what ever reason .
neutral	failed to deliver in timescale specified , following email of complaint the owner rang me direct to apologise and explain_why on this occasion they have let me down .
neutral	i am glad it was only a short trip though , as they do squeeze a lot of seats on one plane , so it was a tight fit .
neutral	i have been using for over 0 years and i have watched as this company has slowly increased its prices and squeezed the average seller for almost every last penny .
negative	i asked for a refund if it was not delivered on sat , i was ignored on that question .
positive	if you ' re buying online anyway , go through_topcashback and build up a treat fund :)
negative	! with a 0 pound goodwill_gesture on top ( why thankyou . not ).
positive	this is one of the best digital software sites around .
negative	i am starting to wonder seriously if this is a scam .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres online .
negative	i know the car i purchased wasn_'_t a £_00k range_rover or jaguar ( it was only £ 0000 ) but surely every customer should be treated fairly .
positive	i only say because when i came close to my own download limit streaming grinded to a halt , took very long to load or did not even start at all .
negative	i will no doubt never be using orange or ee , ever , ever again and will now be taking_legal_action_against them .
positive	we been intreduced to the other guests and they made sure to put us in the guest_list of some of the clubs for tonight ( free entry )
neutral	the flowers i ordered were not delivered on the specified day which was a real disappointment as they were for a sick friend just out of hospital .
negative	ps .
positive	and still don_'_t know how you done it for the price with
negative	ebay has a dismissive and very ignorant policy against its sellers and encourages buyers to act in horrendous ways by instilling them with all the power .
neutral	when asking if they could just bring it any way , seeing as it wasn ' t that far to travel , it seemed laughable to the person on the other end of the phone , and we had to wait another 00 days .
negative	think about it !
negative	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns up .
positive	my phone is now officially_unlocked .

negative	however , please be advised that this timescale can increase or decrease based on individual bank practice .
negative	i asked for a refund .
negative	they were rude , very dismissive and did not try to help resolve the problem at all .
negative	i checked my phone balance , and i spent over 00 pounds on waiting in the line and phoning them for about less_than 0 hour talking in total , where as on their website , it says 00 p per_minute !!!
positive	!
negative	i was willing to wait , 0 week , then two_weeks . was told it will arrive by a certain date when i queried .

negative	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
negative	i since found out several others have dine the same and that they are being_investigated .
neutral	slight it issues i think

negative	i have repaired the cardigan myself . the polo neck i have worn no more than twice , and the seam at the neck has a hole in it .
neutral	this is a good site where much savings can be made , but it is important to keep the customer in the picture all the way to avoid un - necessary panick or concern over missing items .
negative	after 00_minutes and no phone_call from them i got back on to the 0000 number and got through to a gentleman by the name of suheb - it took more than 00_minutes before my call was answered and then i was kept on hold for several more minutes before he came back to me and said he would have to do some more checking .

positive	i just paid , printed out the address_label and took it to the nearest drop_off point .
neutral	will be giving them a call monday to voice my concerns because a £_000_+ graphics_card not screwed to the case and not seated correctly is something they need to speak to the engineer about .

negative	two_weeks on and multiple emails no response for the warranty claim i need to raise .
neutral	i chose it because of the cost .
neutral	i was extremely pleased with the knife when it arrived .
positive	paperwork straight_forward and easy to understand .
positive	i have faound them easy to order from and they keep me informed regarding the order .
neutral	i found it ok but certainly not in the top category - prices are good and the main advantage for us is that a specific item that seems to be hard to find on the high_street and supermarkets is normally available
negative	ring customer_services with the last 00p credit , the automated selection ( choose 0 , choose 0 etc ) takes me in another loop , then says no credit remaining , thanks for ringing , goodbye .

neutral	firstly it took 00 days for the goods to arrive but more_importantly the courier service (@ home ) dumped the boxes in the main hall to my building ( 00 flats in this mansion block ) and left without getting a signature or allowing me to examine the boxes .
neutral	the order came very quickly , i was quite impressed when i saw it in my mailbox .
positive	problem sorted

negative	when i asked for the bank_details of this direct_debit they said you don ' t have one set_up .
negative	we had to pay £_000 for 0 days .
neutral	whilst i ' m not down rating the quality of the product , things like the delivery really do make a difference , and i am glad that i got to pick the day i wanted it on , however in this day and age you would think that it wouldn ' t cost anything just to have the driver call and give an eta so you can actually feel free to get on with your day without expecting the delivery to come at any moment .
negative	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .

neutral	i was impressed by the range of equipment that scubastore had and on that basis moved away from my usual on line scuba gear retailer .

neutral	can be pricey on some items but they are quick on delivery .
positive	in addition the material quality of their products is of a high_standard , a added_bonus .
positive	i was very impressed with how quickly my order was delivered .
positive	( even_though one item was out of stock when the order was made ) thankfully no avalanches but was reassured to have the kit with me .
neutral	this was due to an error in the online booking system .
neutral	i was happy with the ease of the website , it was very easy to use , to find glasses i liked , and was happy could choose way of paying , and got a 0 %_discount for paying by cheque :)
negative	they had their chance .
positive	i do however love going into sigma to pick_up gifts for him .
positive	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
positive	ordered a dunoon mug for my mum overseas , package arrived in fantastic packaging ( i was nervous with it being breakable ) but was very satisfied and arrived within 0 days which was perfect .
neutral	all this advertising aldi and it is paying off but don_'_t get complacent . customer_care is important . people read_reviews and poor reviews are bad advertising !
neutral	i reviewed a poor quality product ( it was v cheap ) and they have not put my review on the website .
positive	their well_trained and knowledgable staff will have , or will find you the answer .
neutral	yeah , good price but not the right product .
positive	found fantastic , table and chairs , wardrobes superb ,
negative	they wanted to charge me an administration charge of 00_% plus return carriage .
neutral	spending alot of money you really should know the seats you are getting .
neutral	i ' ve met many bright happy people in primark , but i ' ve also met some seriously rude and angry people who need to learn that when you come to work , you put your game face on and just deal with it .
negative	0nd february_0000 and no bills provided since october_0000 a total_lack of support and no way to run a company , i have tried everything to sort this issue but no help from the company .
neutral	again , it felt a little less_than warm . great website and great products and ( though they have no_idea ) i have been a customer of this business for over ten_years .
neutral	the items that you would expect to be cheap from a mass buyer are cheap , but its more about the random things that are over priced .
neutral	why ?
positive	free delivery for uk residents and never had a problem with them .
negative	this firm would make an ideal candidate for the tv program dont get done get dom .
neutral	unless you pay for priority boarding ( extra on top of your flight ) you have top stand in the queu for ages and as i am a pensioner can not stand for long_periods of time due to an ailment .
neutral	flight centre are very helpful and definitely try to get you the best deal possible .
negative	even the ' contact us ' link on their website does not work !
neutral	ref_: cr00aqpvb00r
positive	i used to go to different online stores for all different things depending_on what i was doing and which had their own specified store brands .
neutral	further , without being given a courier ' s tracking code to narrow_down when the order might arrive , it meant having to stay at home longer_than anticipated .
neutral	other_airlines should learn from jet0 .
positive	i will_definitely_use watchfinder again and tell all my friends about it .
positive	the company have fully refunded my money as a result of the delay and sent me a new frame .
neutral	i have been with orange for most of the time i have owned a mobile phone .
negative	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer_service ( call_centre ).
negative	several phone_calls and emails later .
negative	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
positive	i also asked for delayed delivery which was no problem at all .
positive	dropped_off the car and there it was when we got back a week_later at 0 am .
neutral	'.
negative	their so called " expert ", roy , told me professionally qualified people such as architects are thick and can '_t programme thermostats , it was then i told him i wasn_'_t thick and quoted my qualification to prove it , he said he was sorry for me .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 dartford , gb departure scan
positive	order no :_000000000
positive	delivery time is second to none .
neutral	the tv is a french one and a plug converter was supplied .
negative	please solve this problem .
positive	( and great deals !)
negative	seller can not leave_feedback to their buyer ( to help other seller understand the buyers )
negative	yes !
positive	not cheap knock - offs either !
negative	called ' service .

neutral	recentley purchased vtech winnie the pooh spinning top .
negative	bought the top model !
neutral	i think delivery charges could be made clearer .
negative	!
neutral	a quick simple review of game , don ' t buy pre_- owned items from this company as they do not check if they work correctly and give you a terrible refund .
neutral	this year we booked our holiday and a minor error was made on our part with the details of persons travelling .
neutral	error acknowledged and company undertook to resolve problem , which they did to their great credit when item arrived at required address within 00_hours of the call .
neutral	i didn ' t received the item shown on the picture .
positive	the reviews matched the properties well and i ' m already looking for my next accommodation through them .
positive	very happy that my son will be kept quiet for a few_days with his 0 day gold pass !
negative	i find both the cancelling of my order and the fact i have to wait for my money for five days terrible service
positive	which i have to add . is also awesome =).
neutral	i am not a fanboy from comodo but i must to say i never will be infected while i use it , now i use it , is my third year and i am a happy usser whith the product , but i think you have a lot of things to improve .
positive	many_thanks .
positive	i would like to thank them for their fast and uncomplicated service .
positive	good company to deal with .
positive	hostelbookers is an extremely easy website to use , once you ' ve looked up your location you can arrange the given accommodation into ' prices : low to high ' etc which is very helpful if , like me , you ' re on a budget and want to try and find the best value for money .
neutral	the price is crazy cheap , i love the style of most of the stuff in there but sizes seem way off , i thought it was just me being awkward but i have spoken to a few people of different_sizes and they agree .
negative	even so i had one person ask if i '_ll make a 00 mile_round_trip for an item which cost £_00 .
negative	he was adamant that i owed this money from a previous order even_though 00 per_cent of the order was returned over a month_ago and was showing on my account as returned .
positive	this course made me able to see pitfalls of my current managers and that is great as i can actually correct them now and suggest different things .
neutral	i have only used ryanair once and the experience was passable .
positive	i recieved all keys on time , and they all worked_perfectly .
positive	i was very pleased with this company , reliable friendly service would recommend to anyone will be using them again in the future competitive rates and was very pleased .
neutral	last_week , my husband got a puncture in one of the back wheels which is now as flat as a pancake .
neutral	this time i was looking for a specific tyre and initially only saw one speed rated h . this seemed fine as the rating goes up to 000mph and my car does not go_anywhere_near that speed .
negative	i have now been waiting since the 00th_march .
negative	it really beggars_belief how inept and short - sighted sky have been in this process .
positive	it is highly used by many travelers .
neutral	on opening the package i found the item was damaged and have found it very difficult to resolve the matter .
positive	we stayed there for two_nights and we were really happy about this accomondation !
positive	i was searching for the best prices on various bits of kit for a triathlon and found mytriathlon with the best deals .
negative	if your looking for a service provider i would strongly urge you to look_elsewhere !
neutral	however unfortunately 0 box didn_'_t arrive at all .
positive	they were very professional .
positive	rooms are very spacious and hotel is definitely a 0 star quality .
negative	customer_service advisor mary - ann lied to me and couldn ' t help
negative	i called their cancellation department and explained the situation and loss of business i suffered due to their incompetencies .
positive	great service .
positive	well_done webtogs :-)
negative	do not buy anything from there .
neutral	group tyres of the same type in one place and provide sufficient information so that the lay person cannot go_wrong .
neutral	i ' ve seen items sold by them at 00 +% more_than most others sell .= them !
negative	first impression , appalling .
positive	the prices are spot on and my order is always delivered on time , or better .
positive	excellent , highly_reccomended .
neutral	i find myself using amazon for all of the things i once would have purchased here .
negative	?- in " this economy "-- shop elsewhere , where they appreciate your business .
positive	can '_t wait to get to the turks and caicos islands to try them out .
positive	the website is easy to navigate and the updates i receive are very welcomed and informative .
negative	their technical_team asked me to do a list of testing including unscrewing by bt phone box and i could not put it back .
negative	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
negative	so if i hear nothing further and dont receive product or refund then small_claims court and off to maplins .
neutral	but my original review just got over written .
positive	we normally use car_hire 0000 but our last two experience was not very good since they changed to rentalcars . com so we decided to look_elsewhere .
negative	next_day i contacted world_stores and received a call back late_afternoon asking if my mattress had arrived .
positive	only slight niggle , is that occasionally they ' re a couple of £ more_than competitors on some items , but once the free postage is taken into account ( i ' m an active member on the forums , so i also get free delivery ) it works out cheaper anyway , so i ' m happy enough :)
negative	the senior technician arrived on the day stated and rectified approximately half of the 00 + issues leaving us now waiting for the french_polisher to be appointed to maybe finish the job fully .
positive	james ( and no i don_'_t work for the company )
neutral	they do tend to go around the houses on pickup and collection though .
neutral	however when we arrived we were given a family room .
neutral	the product is in perfect conditions .
positive	thanks guys !
positive	i ' ll definitely be using them again .
positive	will use again .
positive	my connection is superb and the allowances / dataplans are as good as any .
positive	perfect in every way .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad ' s gift for his_birthday in it .
neutral	ordered and paid for two of the same items only one turned_up .
negative	hundreds of unnecessary numbers for diff departments and they cant seem to put you through .
negative	in summary they are unhelpful , untrustworthy and more_importantly they are bare faced liars .
neutral	delivery bang on time but unfortunately to wrong_address !
negative	they charge me full_amount and after 0 months im still trying to get my money back !
neutral	jambo pallets used to be good from here .
negative	when i asked for a refund of the deposit , hostelworld said they ' ll look_into it and then never replied since .
neutral	i would say that the company and delivery service cant be_faulted .
negative	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south african talktalk customer_service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
neutral	i have recently_purchased a 00 month web_design course which was £_00 . 00 from which i received a £ 0 credit onto my account from my email , i went through my purchase and my £ 0 credit was not honoured .
positive	delivery came special delivery and the purchase was with me within 0 days .
positive	animed always despatch my order quickly and the prices are competitive , what more could you ask for .
negative	i ordered a camera from simply_electronics 0nd_april and like the bulk of the reviewers on trustpilot have had the same appalling experience with non delivery , even_though there was always stock showing on their web_site .
positive	delivery to northern_ireland a bit_pricey but this is the case with most mainland sellers , guess its because parcels need loaded on to space shuttle and dropped_off at space station before onward journey to the distant land of n . i
negative	firstly , i do not like being called a liar .
positive	i recently_bought valkyrie profile 0 for the ps0 and it came very quickly !
neutral	however , the location is superb , literally a 0 - minute stroll from a fantastic beach with a small supermarket no more than 000 yards away .
positive	would highly_recommend .
positive	quality of cooker - hood is good .
neutral	call me cynical but i do think that some companies actually put on their own " fake " reviews to help boost their ratings which ultimately makes a mockery of the review system .
neutral	also , they don ' t post any information about artwork dimensions , should you want to upload a personal design ( i looked up measurements then doubled for good resolution , but the colour looks iffy to me , something i could ' ve adjusting in photoshop had i known the colour info ) purely_because of the credit thing i wouldn ' t have returned to moonpig out of principal , but i recently_moved abroad , and found the service to be much more worth while as my relatives will receive the cards much_quicker_than if i sent them from here .
neutral	but it is cheap and reliable
neutral	unfortunately the language barrier takes a long time to explain .
negative	i had two_weeks of headaches and went to my appointment .
positive	brilllllllllllllllllll
neutral	no others in stock nor available so had to choose new tap - :(
positive	the following_morning received an_email to say the phone had been received and the payment being transferred .
positive	i must_say that the service is amazing .
negative	after the sales rap i told them that i would not be entering into any agreement until the end of the two_weeks so i can see if the google site had any benefits .
positive	delivery was very quick as it has_been with the previous items i purchased from physioroom . com & i would recommend them to anyone .
negative	it ' s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
negative	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
neutral	it ' s easy enough to registered and setup payments into your bank_account , my only problem with the service is the fee ' s !
neutral	i did not hear from anyone .
negative	a bit of hope for you all
positive	easy process .
negative	far too late to fit an alternator outside anyway .
neutral	i will post my comments after the appointment .
neutral	!
neutral	we had been so impressed with the service received to plan our trip through russia , asia and australasia .
negative	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
negative	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
positive	the taste is subline and very good for me .
neutral	but don ' t appreciate paying over the odds for costume jewellery when it does not last .
neutral	0 antipishing and advices of malicious webs in a graphical form
negative	i shall say it to all those who intend to buy on - line at funkymoose uk .
positive	most of the time i find that it ' s cheaper_than the other hostel booking sites and even the hostels own websites !
positive	the titan dining_room chairs i purchased were much_better quality than other_suppliers chairs for the same price .
neutral	- that they did not attempt to deliver the next_day , even if their policy says so ,
positive	thank_you for your excellent service once again and venetia in customer service for her help
negative	b . t .
neutral	i suggested someone might have informed me of the fact as they were quick enough to charge me an extra £_00 delivery .
neutral	i use to be a regular fashion world customer , but i find that there clothing is getting more exspensive but the quality is getting very poor . so i have not ordered anything for over a year now think .
neutral	they gave us a date 00 days after delivery , however we were then called back and this was changed to a further 0 days after that .
negative	staff on the tills are doing their best under poor management .
neutral	the back of it seemed to have quite a heavy use to it .
negative	i have used lastminute . com for the last time in my life .
negative	ordered last_week and paid extra for 0 day delivery .
negative	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn ' t their problem .
positive	having the in store warehouse near my location allows me to browse the shelves to see what deals they have an if i can find that deal on line i get the discount avoiding shipping_costs and the waiting time .
positive	btw the product was great too
negative	ordered an item on june 0th , which i ' ve still yet to receive .
positive	pucka company , i ve been using them for 0 years and not only meeting my expectations but i am over the moon , customer_service is great too , just like emma i spoke to earlier and she was brilliant .
positive	no matter what i need justgolfonline have always got it .
negative	what a bunch of idiots .
neutral	shop here if you want the best prices , but be prepared to wait a bit longer for your products than you would from some of the more popular websites .
neutral	i bought the liner to be used when i am carrying a mountain bike in my mondeo with the rear seats folded .
negative	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
neutral	it now seems like the massive means is bored with the delivery service , and their is not a lot of effort into making it right .
negative	on opening the box i found the sink was covered in mud and dirt with deep scratches all over !
positive	it deserves the money .
negative	bt00 0nx
positive	adzuna schist etwas neuer zu sein , aber das ist in diesem fall eher positiv - die seite wirkt frischer und dynamischer , und das design ist sehr sauber ohne viel werbung gehalten , was mir sehr gut gefällt .
positive	i would recommend them .
negative	no phone call in 00 days to say this .
neutral	the print came as ordered and was ok but you can see the edge of the frame through the print , this in my opinion is poor as printed canvases from other_suppliers i have do not have this problem .
neutral	steer_clear of the people they recommend for solicitors / conveyancing .
positive	will_definately_use again .
positive	lol
negative	this is my first and last time having anything done at kwikfit .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone who_wants good value for money followed_by an excellent customer service .
negative	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
positive	could not get better service long may it last
neutral	having to wait a day for a collection is a pain and surprisingly slow , i don_'_t know why this is the case ?
negative	i have contacted the company but still_awaiting reply and there is no telephone_number for me to call .
positive	i found age_partnership to be most helpfull i could not have asked for better service for are equity_release they got it through in a matter of weeks not mounths i found eny of the staff i spoke to whear very frendly and not at all pushey and allways had the time to talk abuot every day things rather_than do the work then get you off of the phone . i would not hesatate to reckamend them to enyone keep_up the good work . thank_you once again . j williams . ref .
positive	there was no tv but there was free wifi which was good .
positive	delivery was superfast too so i am very happy .
negative	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
negative	the house is in zone 0 in london so geography can ' t be a problem , surely .
neutral	order processed_efficiently .
neutral	the customer helpline are no help !!!
neutral	came_across this website thought it looked good hope not too good to be true . got tickets for a gig tomorrow and hoping tickets are 0 ) legitimate and 0 ) here in time to get to gig . will def use again if everything goes ok ( i ' d number 0000000 )
positive	this electronics store seems to have everything and whats more is that nearly everything is always in stock too .
negative	to put insult to injury they
neutral	so not a very good start .
neutral	possibly a software problem apparently .
neutral	this one i got some days_later .
negative	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .
neutral	i asked why they needed this for ' security '.
positive	i once had to book a very last_minute flight over the phone .
neutral	their solution ( not the manufactuers ) was to give a partial_refund because the cost difference was disproportionate in their terms .
positive	easy process , very fast from being posted out the envelope to send phone in to receiving money only took 0 days .
negative	i called to ask an explanation and they kept telling_me the same things all over and over again .
negative	this is basic stuff .
negative	the proof of a company with good customer_service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i ' m not the only one who thinks so ).
neutral	as such i stayed home waiting for the delivery .
neutral	could '_ve been fabulous .
positive	great prices , good offers , excellent delivery service always bang on time mo issues_whatsoever
positive	i will be shopping for more furniture soon and will_definitely be using oak_furniture land again .”
negative	it wasn_'_t and would take 0 - 0 weeks to deliver .
negative	; on 00 september we called into the local_branch who were unable to help us although they had the tablet in stock .
neutral	good overall broadband and phone service talktalk but with a customer_service as bad as yours customers will change providers , like i have .
neutral	i ' m happy that it works but it does not instill me with a great deal of confidence .
neutral	i went through all that hassle just so i can receive it in my hands and not wait extra days or have to travel to pick it up somewhere .
neutral	their shops are filled with smiley salesmen ( sales people ?)
negative	also the online bill is hopelessly out of date and no record of meter_reading i have given , what '_s the point of having this ( yesterday '_s ) information for me to peruse ?
positive	i was very impressed at how speedy the whole trancsaction was .
negative	so even_though you don ' t have any movies at home they will say " well they ' re on its way ", thiefs i will say , not impressed at all and never again !
negative	stay well away from them !
positive	anyvan provided some very competitive quotes which saved us a fortune .
neutral	i eventually learned that the couriers had been holding the sink for a week or more but i felt that i should have been updated on my order progress as this is what other internet companies do .
negative	i drove to the shop with the bq to find it dident exsist only to be told by the hairdressers where it used to be " she went last_year and works mobile from her van " !!
positive	i have added to our order each time i purchase because of the amazing selection of bars , supplements , etc .
positive	i love the up to date information , from letting you know your order was dispatched , and when it was delivered .
positive	so keep_up the way your company is going and very good luck in the future .
neutral	they obviously don_'_t like
neutral	customer_service apologised and arranged for another to be sent out which arrived 0 days_later ( total of 00 days ) which was the correct leg .
neutral	the stress - free way in my experience , is to go direct to the airline .
negative	i will not be in a hurry to deal with this company again unless they prioritise their customer service personnel and their whole refunding system .
negative	so , it is either argus who are not describing the size of vehicle properly or it is alamo in florida who say you have undersized just to get you to pay extra , both mis_- advertising .
negative	( 0 ) it is an international parcel so you can either come to scotland pay documents hand over fees and clear the parcel yourself or
positive	would highly_recommend and will use again soon !
positive	i love them !
positive	we always order together but he only asks two questions ; ' what did you get ?'
negative	we ordered our internet online .
negative	i booked internal_flights brazil with tam airlines using opodo , but had to make changes .
negative	look through the statistics it is basically self explanatory .
neutral	oops people who travel with you sleeping on the seating with their dirty boots and shoes on the seating showing no regard for others .
negative	just waiting for the contract to end so i can get_rid .
negative	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction . the same day i made the purchase . thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
positive	in fact i now wish i played golf , so i could show off by looking very smart on the golf_course !
positive	the item was very easy to find and to order via their website .
neutral	three stars for now , but will be back to try you again .
negative	sent iphone and payment and then heard_nothing for the best part of 0 weeks .
negative	no surprise there then - another example of this companies substandard attitude_towards customer_care !!
positive	i pay the £ 0 a year ( although you can opt for the free membership ) as it is nice to be able to receive my cashback quicker .
negative	big_mistake .
positive	contact : informed of status via e_- mail updates .
neutral	we hebben ruim 000 euro winkeltegoed gekregen als compensatie .
neutral	quick delivery of all items .
positive	i got my cheque through the post within a day of them receiving my phone .
neutral	it took several emails to the sales department to find out what was happening .
positive	from the beautifully calibrated downloadable profiles they supply free of charge . easy to use file uploading and ordering system on their web_site . and the highly professional and attentive after care service whenever i have a question . print turnaround is lightning_fast too , and i am always overwhelmed by the quality of the prints .
positive	thanks .
negative	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
neutral	pleased with delivery time and communication .
positive	their track record for me is quality , they really do work their hardest to please their customers and give them the best shopping_experience for gaming .
neutral	purchased a lg 00 " tv plus a motion grey stand on sunday which is the first time that we have purchased from this company .
neutral	we have always found them to be both welcoming and efficient , and consider them to be far more customer friendly than rivals such as ryanair .
neutral	i was re - ordering my latest order .
neutral	how come there are no pictures of the dresses every time i go on the website all l get is a bold question mark instead of the pictures how on earth am l meant to select and buy the lovely dresses :-(
neutral	however , everytime i complained , it was given another job number , new instructions and was a nightmare .
negative	if you have any further enquiries please raise an_email support ticket and our customer service team will swiftly assist you .
negative	now seeking_legal_advice totally fed_up
neutral	we argued this on the phone to be told we could return it for a refund but that we would not be able to receive an exchange - although they were exchanging the other items !
positive	went_onto website found what i was looking for paid through paypay so i did not have to key in loads of card_details , and items delivered quickly with email_updates
neutral	while equal in value this was not what i had ordered or paid for .
negative	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
positive	a one - stop_shop for everything you need to ensure you are fueling your body with all the right things , whether you ' re male or female , working on gaining muscle or just like to stay in shape .
neutral	arrived very quickly and yes very heavy to put_together .
neutral	for what they do i think its worth it , they cut some corners with regards to things that they provide such as guest_list entry to standard pub which doesn ' t need a guest_list .
positive	they guided me through the steps needed to resolve the problem and ensured that it was resolved .
negative	can '_t do anything unless i come back to the store .
negative	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
positive	came_across mytuxedo whilst doing an internet_search and they had everything i needed from the tux to the bow_tie and more .
negative	we and the kids had a really bad day out here - luckily i wasn ' t paying but a relative was and we all felt upset she had wasted her money , even the kids .
negative	this company is absolutely abysmal .
negative	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
negative	i have emailed their customer_services .
negative	they charge you £_00 to return your phone , which i ended_up paying .
negative	eventually i went to the depot and collected the delivery myself .
positive	i was given an additional allocation for a month free of charge .
positive	website is easy to navigate .
neutral	so clearly they must of dropped it off at the wrong house .
neutral	meant we had to ask at different car_rental desks in the airport who they thought the supplier might be .
positive	quality products and a very good price !
neutral	also the envelopes they send seem to go down after a time , you start with 0 , you send back the 0 films in 0 envelopes and they put 0 new films in the same envelope so you down to one and then they say you can send them back in a freepost_envelope you have to buy yourself !
negative	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
negative	sent my iphone 0 for new screen paid for special next - day delivery 00000 said it had been sent on friday 00 july but wasn_'_t delivered on 00th as it should have been .
negative	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
negative	i ' m going to stick with [_external reference ], more_expensive ( like £ 0 more ) but at_least i know i will get it !
negative	as an update viagogo phoned tonight to offer a refund as the tickets will not be delivered .
neutral	when i stumbled_across their website and thought for a moment that i could do my christmas shop online .
positive	the rug arrived in double quick time and was exactly as shown on the web_site .
neutral	since i live overseas this leads to the box getting smashed and the records getting warped or bent .
negative	waited until monday still not recieved called back on monday to be told the money would be in my account by 0pm that night it wasnt called tuesday again told i was the next in the que to be paid and it will be in my account by 0pm still not recieved called today and demanded i speak to the manager , at 00 . 00 i was advised he will call back within 00mins - called back at 00 . 00 to be advised the manager was on his lunch and will call me at 0 ; 00 , he still hadnt called me back at 0 . 00pm so i called again id been left a message on my phone whilst i was waiting for them to call me and it was a rather blazay " sorry for the confusion " the money will be in your account by the 00th_july for 0 what confusion ?

negative	all attempts of communication did not seem to be effective at all as i got no response on my query .
negative	in my opinion they finally have mangaged to make the whole exerience uncomportable , from booking on line with all the £ extras , restricting hold_baggage to 00kg and insisting on their cabin_crew selling cheap features and offers in flight !
negative	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .

positive	then when the package arrived there was a lovely note in the box along with a packet of love hearts !
neutral	breakfast was not included and recommended cafe too far to walk .
neutral	great , at a time when identity theft is at its highest they ' re handing us leisure vouchers instead of trying to protect their customers .
negative	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
negative	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
negative	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn ' t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
negative	they don ' t even have something as basic as simple as 00 / 00 0 . 00mm solder .

positive	i ordered a 00 ' s groovy baby outfit with a wig and accessories all for a great price .
negative	to add_insult to injury , as i never agreed to go on direct_debit ( since i realised they couldn ' t find their own ass with two hands and a map , i didn ' t want them to have access to my bank_account ) they charged me nearly £ 0 per bill for the privilege of getting an incorrect statement every month .
neutral	i always find tescos to be entirely satisfactory .
neutral	so while they seem to have a pretty good reputation overall just bear in mind that if it is wrong they don_'_t jump_through hoops to rectify the situation .

neutral	i checked the delivery terms and it said you have to wait 00days before you can put in a complaint .
negative	wrote to legoland customer_services but just got a bland response which did not address the issues i raised .
neutral	you can avoid the £ 0 restocking fee by writing to inform them that you want to cancel the contract but you have a limited amount of time .
negative	as i ' m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .
positive	really helpful on phone , easy on line , great customer service .
neutral	after worrying for days , seeing the reply that my iphone had been unlocked gave immense relief to me .
neutral	price was by_far best on the market , however when coming to book the effort i had to go to was unbelievable from website refusing to take payment over days and days , then price changing over the phone finally managed to book after 0 days and over £_00 more despite the price via website being cheaper !!!

neutral	she also confirmed that they will be refunding all of my money back in to my account that i paid with .
positive	very good service and i would recommend them to others .
neutral	flowers were good , but the message transcribed was described as unorganised and superimposed , making it difficult to read and of course appreciate the purpose of the flowers and meaning .
positive	nothing on the market even comes_close to the quality of their products , level of service and prices .
positive	got my keys within a few minutes after payment .
neutral	this us my local restaurant but i am continually being short changed on the coffee sizes .

negative	i ' m temped to eat it but i also don ' t want to die .
positive	the dishwasher , siemens sn00m000gb , itself is brilliant .

negative	i cannot_believe the bbc have sold out regarding the coverage of formula 0 .
positive	most impressive of all was that the garmin camera i got from handtec .
positive	haha sorry i had to say that because i honestly don ' t know how they got my late 00 : 00 order to me within 00_hours of payment !

negative	will up date this after this date .
neutral	i logged in and to my horror it said i owed over £_000 as i had cut_off sky before my contract had ended .

negative	i do however want answers from infurn and a definative answer as to when my itm will actually arrive !
negative	in terms of the two letters that you have advised you have sent to carphone_warehouse ; if these letters have been received in our central office , it is possible that they have not reached our department yet .
negative	they quickly found the order but said it would now be in store on 0 / 00 august .
neutral	the initial problem was a system fault that took 00 emails to rectify .
neutral	hassle_free , but prices could be a bit higher i think .
neutral	i will keep you updated .
neutral	" sorry for the confusion .
positive	it puts buyers and sellers in direct contact and cuts out the time lag .
neutral	the company does do well with beating prices with the on hand price_match .
negative	do you really think i ' d accept less_than a 0 . 0 %_discount to take a second_hand unit ?
negative	i doubt i would have received it then without numerous_emails and a threat to cancel my order .
neutral	in one place no one even spoke spanish !!
neutral	the third said she didn ' t know what seats i ' d get .
negative	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .

neutral	firstly the two items i ordered were wrapped in one thin sheet of paper , with no invoice / dispatch note / pick note ( same as the first ) and held together by one thin piece of clear tape which was actually open at one end !
negative	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
negative	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i ' m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
neutral	the delivery guy gave me the impression that swapping worktops was a fairly regular occurrence .

negative	i moved_house on 0th_oct_0000 and it took until the middle of feb_0000 to receive all the money they owed me as i was in credit when i moved , after many expensive phone_calls and being on hold for a ridiculous amount of time i was almost reduced to tears of frustration after they credited the wrong account and said i couldnt have my money until they found out where the money had gone , if i wasnt so stubborn i would have given up , but why should they keep my money , please_please dont use them i just wish i had seen this site earlier .
positive	so all credit to the company for excellent customer service too .

positive	excellent quality image , fantastic service and postage speed .
negative	it won_'_t accept mine , and correspondence to an anonymous person or computer come back over and over that ' they have set_up the address ' - they don_'_t acknowledge that when i try to validate it the " next " or " continue " button is greyed out ( even_though i have sent screen prints ) so i can '_t set_up my ad .

negative	never arrived although booked days in advance .
positive	the products ' picked ' in - store usually have at_least a 0 day shelf_life or the freshest date possible - so all in all can '_t grumble .
negative	even worse , they dare to charge £_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
positive	those cost £_00 on their own at specsavers , so it '_s like getting the glasses for free !
neutral	my order has finally turned_up , 00 days after_placing it , even on opening the package there was a bit of a surprise . my order had actually been shipped from one of the other online companies i usually deal with , not proviation or icom .

neutral	i often recommend friends and internet posters to atkinsons as they are different from the rest .
negative	all i hear is their terrible hold music . which i can describe as being even more painful than waiting and knowing my money is going down the drain .
positive	the delivery is always quick and free which is always good .
negative	having been with icuk for several_years we ’ ve experienced first - hand the gradual degradation of the quality of service and network performance of this isp .

neutral	set your price and dont go over it .
neutral	new to the site and it '_s good to air my views .
positive	i do like to have a good winge and moan now and again .

negative	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
positive	great prices and helpful staff but had to phone them for delivery advice and place a order for £ 0 , 000 and it cost me £ 0 . 00p on their premium_rate phone no 00000000000 .

negative	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
neutral	i have used viagogo a load of times now for both music and sports events and have always got what i paid for in the end .
negative	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , going by their times etc , i should have got my parcel tuesday .
neutral	they also didn ' t send me any notification of shipment when they shipped the order .
positive	top_marks mazuma !
positive	i did some digging to find the best price for my 0g ipod_touch and gadget_panda offered by_far the best deal .

positive	dont think_twice - book it !
negative	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of £_000 .
positive	i found them to be most helpful .
neutral	pleased i didn_'_t order and more .
neutral	i ' d rather they offered less specific dates / times that the courier can meet , than not be able to rely_on it .
positive	flights on time , good baggage_allowance and a professional service .
negative	this has totaly
negative	customer_service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
negative	they then said that the offer code was on spends of £_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
positive	delivery was duly made on the day so i cannot_fault the service .
positive	i called beko repairs who ordered a new on / off switch as it wouldn_'_t turn on .
neutral	please get back asap .
negative	it was easy to buy and pay for but what happened then was a disaster .
positive	absolutely excellent , they offer a really good product and i can_assure you they keep their word with the guarantees , my battery failed , i sent it back and two days_later a brand_new battery turned_up , if i need a battery again for another car this is 000_% the place i will go !
positive	i ' d never_heard of slrhut so i was a little_wary .
positive	i especially liked the text_message advising product delivery date and an option to amend .
negative	it is horrible that numerous_calls has not stopped them from writing to me for paying service i never used !
neutral	i will still buy from you from past experience , but i find this episode out of your norm , & think you ought to know something isn_'_t quite right .
neutral	the site is well_designed and easy to understand a few_minutes later i was all booked up with confirmation arriving very quickly by e_mail .
neutral	the item i ordered arrived a day late but a voucher was given to me .
positive	ordered l ' oreal blonde shampoo from a recommendation from my hairdresser .

positive	i had been looking for a low count nikon d0h for some time , and just happened to stumble on mpb_photographic after doing a google_search .
neutral	maybe it '_s just the area i live in and other areas are better .
positive	quick , cheaper_than other_companies and everything up to expectations for my recent holiday in maspalomas
neutral	00000_000000
negative	the comapny is a sham and it is about time either trading_standards or the isp '_s collectively do something to stop consumers being_ripped_off yet again
positive	i love supplement_warehouse , the discounts and low_prices make my wallet smile and my arm pump
positive	what more can you ask for ?
positive	so easy to do .
neutral	bad points is fees are too dear to sell things
negative	no .
neutral	i really like facebook although i prefer the old setting and think that people should be given the choice whether to change back or not
negative	it took 00_minutes to sort out the same old problem .
negative	i think that booking with late_rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
positive	but for me it was still on time .
neutral	use infrequently and due to this account expired but was still held i was just unable to access .
negative	chucked in to the plastic_bag then chucked in to the back of a courier van .

negative	including kkarparks ltd . more car_parking .
positive	thank_you very much ,
neutral	i already explained to oe head_office that i can '_t make on 00 april due to work_commitments and june would be too late .
negative	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
neutral	when i asked whether o0 was selling a service that would allow agencies to leave messages at will , the guy refused to answer !!!
positive	without shiply i would find it hard to order goods and services far away and having the ability to obtin quotes from numerous providers with feedback from others helps to make the right choice for each delivery .
neutral	supplement_warehouse has great low rates on the base price , but beware of the over_inflated shipping charges .
negative	completely_unacceptable .
negative	next_day after phone_calls again the shower_cubicle arrived - on a pallet huge and secured - on my own and disabled and driver left it on pallet ( just like other goods ) on my front - no noticeable damage at this time .

positive	many_thanks for your highly professional service .
negative	with myprotein receiving such praise from other people who have ordered from it , i set my hopes quite high for the product .
neutral	so i replied and said " your reply was far from helpful .
negative	they were offering a £_000 love to shop voucher with their deal .
negative	i even had to buy another item from another shop because i needed the heater .
negative	this was a very unpleasant and embarrassing experience and i am most upset that i was ripped_off .

negative	also note : unlike so many other people on this site , i have actually once received an order from hdnl , however this was only after a failed delivery and i picked_up from my local_depot .
neutral	unfortunately the last statement is the only one that has_been maintained and in fact improved upon .
positive	my wristband arrived today by secure post and i can ' t wait to go .
neutral	however , the delivery service and customer service was far below that in standard .
negative	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
negative	my money is in their bank_account earning interest when it should be in mine , which is tantamount to theft .
neutral	company said would refund never did !
positive	disputes are settled quickly & easily
neutral	my phone arrived swiftly - quicker_than i had expected .
negative	not very reliable at all
neutral	i am rewriting my review .

positive	ordered the audio_technica ath - m00 headphones on 00th_dec , received them the next morning .
negative	i emailed three times , and rang twice .
negative	0 william street
neutral	i ' d quite gladly lose out on the alteration fee not to have to deal with them again .
negative	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
neutral	once registered - my cards appeared in the app and i was able to transfer money from one to the other seamlessly ; very simple .
negative	used their tracking_system to find out delivery company used would be xdp derby .
negative	i received no text .
positive	now don ' t let this fool you into thinking that there are lots of problems with them , every company has a few kinks .
neutral	but did expect a reply .
negative	it has_been one and a half years now .
neutral	finally given an offer discount that worked .
neutral	i gave 0_stars purely_because of the huge_selection they have
positive	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
negative	this despite the fact that they fully reimbursed two ladies who went to watchdog on bbc with exactly the same issue .
negative	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
positive	overall we were very happy with both product and service .
neutral	purchased an oak and iroko worktop , the oak worktop was fine but the iroko had a number of minor imperfections , which you can accept on one side , the rough / underside , but not on both , these had not been apparent on initial inspection .
positive	my driver steve was great and i left it all to him to organise he was polite and professional and kep me informed every_step of the way .
neutral	it '_s a useful option for the occasional parcel though and i like the ability to see the different carriers options and rates .
neutral	they tend to send you standard " cut and paste " answers - not really reading the question you have asked .
positive	nice to know there are still some good people out there !
neutral	but after all that it was all set_up ready to test which was all fine until the next_day i went on it and the strap snapped and sent me flying back luckily my partner stopped me from falling out , i did have hold of handles but no matter how tight i tighten them they are still loose , to be fair they are safe just when the wobble you think they wont hold you .
negative	redhill appliances seem to be brilliant , when they have things in stock , but the worst when it is out of stock , they just take your money and then don_'_t care and take ages to refund you .
positive	great service and although i have not replied they called me straight_away .
negative	avoid if you don ' t want to be disappointed because i ' m disappointed in every transaction i make
positive	i made two orders - one a couple of days before_christmas and one a couple of days after .
negative	hence to say , i will never ever buy anything from bathstore chelmsford or any other bathstore outlet again , they are nothing short of crooks dealing in second rate and damaged stock , their staff are rude , unhelpful with no morals .
negative	you ' d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
positive	it was a huge help to have notification by email of the one hour_window the delivery was expected to be made - sometime between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 , it arrived exactly at 00 . 00 !
neutral	service companies who receive monies for supplying a service should be accountable for checking the information they supply and confirming correctly to the client - not shrugging it off as not their fault .!
positive	most of us have stories of waiting hours for deliveries or services that never came ; of not knowing what was happening , taking time off work only to find we had wasted a day .
positive	very happy
positive	placed an order for a tissot gents watch , which was £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web , on friday_morning .
neutral	i ordered a very expensive laptop from alienware about 0 years_ago , which in all honestly did exactly as it was supposed to , i was informed of it '_s progress every_step of the way ( build phase , packaging phase , shipping phase ) and it all went rather smoothly .
negative	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
negative	by the time my boiler is fixed and up and running i will have been without heating and hot_water for 0 weeks .
positive	i have no_hesitation in purchasing from barrington_sports again
positive	i really like using ebuyer , not only is it one of the few stores listed on topcashback that sells computer_components and peripherals , but it also and has a very user_friendly design and very comprehensive search_function .
positive	sometimes it '_s a case of better the devil you know .
negative	friday 00st june_0000 my package is picked_up by ups for delivery to manchester .
neutral	shopto quickly send a new copy of the game out , however did not credit my postage back , so am a bit annoyed about that !
positive	turned_up spot on time , a personable guy and well kitted out vehicle , looking good .
neutral	they should maybe remove the option to order " standard ( as pictured )" if it ' s not going to be .
positive	i always haggle at the stores when i ' m spending big money and always get some free bees .
negative	errrrm no !
negative	our household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
negative	i feel the need to point out this company is in league with marisota , if you search for their reviews it will tell you alot of what to expect !
positive	i am pleased to review this company as my experience was faultless .
positive	booked online , but my local_branch did not have them ready in stock , so told would take two days to arrive .
negative	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
positive	can heartily_recommend them
neutral	i had to refund the buyer and will not be using this carrier again .
neutral	a palm is filled with cash and a blind eye is turned .
positive	great price for a really good quality dog_food , including delivery the price worked out £ 0 cheaper_than going to tesco for a 00kg_bag of bakers , which i dont rate at all .
positive	it is always nice to find a company that you can contact by telephone , especially a normal ( rate ) number .
positive	give them a run for their money
negative	ordered a speaker for a vivaz was totaly the wrong one
positive	i '_ve bought items from several suppliers over the years , but i regularly return to simply_supplements because the goods always arrive quickly , they have never made a mistake and their prices are as competitive as any .
neutral	when i lived in london i stopped using whisky_exchange because parcelforce are so poor , wich is a pity as the prices and product of whisky_exchange are so good .
neutral	while one of us had 0 nights in a comfy double_bed the other had to make do with a made - up couch as hard as rocks .
positive	the enclosed instructions on ' installing your memory ' and ' troubleshooting tips ' are very helpful .
neutral	this was a good price , covered all that was necessary and was clearly outlined .
positive	love this site , the descriptions are always easy to read and state the main points with out having to read an essay .
positive	thursday : posted phone to mazuma
neutral	i have booked a holiday and paying in two parts after the deposit .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	posters took a week to arrive , not bad timing i suppose , but i am still_waiting for the replacement poster that i exchanged for the original that had ' sold out '.
negative	i was told yes / big chance / maybe .
positive	nearly everything is organised for you - all you need to do is turn_up !
neutral	i would recommend cleverboxes via tesco with the proviso that you take the delivery date as an estimate and don ' t try to collect your goods until you receive email confirmation that they have been delivered .
positive	my friend used funktionevents because of their good reviews and helpfulness on the phone .
positive	i highly_recommend ozeal as they have excellent service and great price .
negative	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
neutral	!
negative	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
positive	picked my motorhome up on time .
positive	double0tickets was a reliable service , stressfree .
positive	the ct 000h f sport surpassed my expectations altogether - considering it ' s top fuel economy , it had a very surprising high performance drive too !
positive	don_'_t think i could ask for better .
positive	good prices too .
neutral	the item took a long time to arrive which wasn ' t a problem but the delivery drivers were useless .

neutral	i really wonder_why i bother even trying
neutral	i was contacted by sarah who was excellent in explaining an iva to me , but decided at this moment in time it was not in my best interest to have an iva and i am satisfied with carrying on with my dmp .
negative	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
positive	perfect martin factory fresh .
neutral	not sure if they just hire a useless courier service ( as per review below ) who apparently couldn ' t find two st . bernards if they were in the same telephone booth as them or they are just ripping me off .
negative	the manufacturer ’_s servicing book with a schedule of work required at each service was left on the passenger seat .
negative	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
positive	i have bought an acme cyclone pro recently and i was very impressed with the postage and the hassle_free part of the order .
negative	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
negative	in the past they refused to refund me my money , £_000 , when malev went_bust .
neutral	alt andet end maden fungerer perfekt på båden .
positive	referencing was painless , quick and value for money - and it came with the opportunity to get rgi
neutral	apart_from that i am satisfied customer .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	i bought a mattress called " relyon firm support mattress " which from the online description i believed to be a normal sized mattress which was firm and had excellent orthopedic support .
neutral	was waiting in for my order , i was only called after the two hour delivery slot had passed , to be quite frank i was seething as i was counting on the delivery for dinner .
negative	sorry its been so long for an update but have been unwell ( this case being a contributory factor )
neutral	responded to one claiming that they can ' t see the print screens of the websites that i had to put in my email .
negative	i gave her 00_hours to get serious and give me some decent answer to my enquiry .
neutral	i am sure that it is fine but i am concerned and wish to be reassured that my flowers are going to be delivered especially as i paid £_00 .
negative	i will be taking my custom to my local homebrew shop from now on .
negative	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
positive	ordered front line flea_treatment for an abandoned young female cat that has invited herself into our home .
neutral	sadly i can see signs of the company changing from ' nothing is any trouble ' to more of a private equity investment company .
positive	used for a few_months now , never had any_problems and great prices !
neutral	so the information supplied by the company on google_shopping is misleading
neutral	after several emails and tests they couldn_'_t get this to work either .
positive	always fast and prices are so low i don ' t bother looking elsewhere anymore .
positive	the website was not outstanding , however , they more_than made up for this with the price and the level of customer_service .
negative	bewarr everybody .
negative	they came back to me the next week admitting they don ' t have the item in stock any more .
negative	it was food but the packaging was ripped open so it was mouldy !
neutral	this time the courier routed the package incorrectly and it took a further ten_days to arrive .
positive	factor into the equation the cost that the website bares when serving thousands of cam streams to thousands of users , many of whom are guests or regular members , where does the bandwidth come from for that ?
positive	il catalogo è vastissimo e comprende tutti gli occhiali più belli e alla moda .
negative	the next evening still no parcel , rang again !
positive	the looks were sharp and sporty so it had plenty of appeal !
neutral	however , i was shocked about the packaging of the goods .
negative	when you can '_t physically walk into a store and complain you stand a chance in being treated like dirt .
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
negative	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response . then i wrote on this site . then got a response , agreed on a refund . returned item . heard_nothing again . 0 emails later .,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
neutral	saw a groupon deal for a toshiba 0tb external_hard_drive .
positive	first_class .
positive	the items were very well_packed .
positive	such nice people to deal with , too .
neutral	watch this space !!!!
positive	spintee
negative	so i did .
neutral	its also pretty close to the official bt version .
positive	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on the free home_trial until i found the right pair .
positive	easy to buy
neutral	ebuyer has a fantastic layout but seems poorly maintained ( the ' lists ' function has been replacing the catalogue system for a long time now , yet no ' lists ' link exists outside of trying to use the old catalogue function in your account ).
negative	not really trusting her less_than enthusiastic assistance , i asked for confirmation in writing !
positive	very good quality case , delivery good .
neutral	and i don_'_t trust the po .
positive	nice quality touches with pockets , lining and so on .
negative	that is another lie ; the outer treads of front_tyres wear more than the inner edges because of the extra scuffing load put on the outer edges when turning sharp corners .
neutral	to get this done promptly i decided to try that and timed my call .
positive	thanks !
positive	no more sitting around at the garage .
neutral	i ' m lucky in a sense as this phones contract is up next month but i will be keeping an eye out for any marketing / sms sign_up texts in the next month .
positive	i looked at the tracking_info later that evening and early the next_morning and every_stage of the route was logged so i knew_exactly where it was .
negative	?
negative	it '_s so appalling it '_s a complete embarrassment .
negative	they suck . save_yourself from this nightmare .
positive	glasses arrived very quickly and were pretty good quality .
neutral	now if i decide to sell the item on it will be missing a box and therefore i lose money .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend their services in the future .
negative	!
positive	very pleased !
neutral	their service over the last few orders has_been poor .
negative	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
neutral	the process took longer_than_expected , having being told the plate would go to auction in july , it ended_up being in october .
positive	excellent
neutral	it works great , but it did take longer_than it should have for a digital_copy ( 0 days in total ).
negative	why advertise what you do not have ?
neutral	i would carefully consider_using this company again .
neutral	my taps are dripping !
negative	i will make this as brief as i can .
positive	got the tyres i wanted at the right price , right time , right place , could not get any better . perhaps knocking on your front_door to say they have just been fitted .
negative	kolejny pre_- order z tym sklepem i znów coś niegra . zamówienie złożone 00 . 00 . 0000 klucza nadal nie ma . ostatni zakup w tym " sklepie " który nawet ukrywa komentarze na stronie zaraz jak pojawiają się te prawdziwe na jego temat .
negative	for the amount of time i spent trying to resolve this i don ' t feel that this touches the surface of the compensation i deserve .
positive	i have earned cashback just by login to topcashback first think you should too my family love it think you too would xx
negative	avoid these_crooks at all costs .
neutral	as i write this , apparently the tent is now in the lundy shore office waiting to come to me on the next boat - this is no problem as because of where i live on lundy i ' m used to ' stuff ' taking a few_days to get here - but .
negative	this sounds_like a scam !!!
neutral	purchased a small item which i could keep track of my purchase .
negative	i called my helpful agent to enquire if we could down grade to a 0 week holiday instead of 0 and stay in a cheaper accommodation . this is when the help stopped , he informed me that the price would actually go up !!
positive	the go - karting itself was brilliant fun on the day and everything was ready for our arrival .
negative	in conclusion my experience tells_me that you will get a far better deal , coverage and customer service by voting with your feet .
neutral	i await your explanation in reply .
negative	trust_pilot has requested me to authenticate my review of house trip 0 times .
neutral	still high , but not so ridiculous )
negative	several weeks from first order !
negative	they claim that they can provide a " 00 mb / s " service .
neutral	i used p0g to send two parcels to the netherlands from manchester , using fedex .
negative	0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for them to collect it and refund my money .
positive	will use again
positive	the communication level was high and helpful and the product when it was delivered was exactly as i hoped , and was also delivered ahead of schedule too even_though it was a large order .
positive	from ebuyer today !
neutral	great introductory deals but gets expensive as not really enough provided to keep you going all day with no lunch so if your a normal person like me you end up buying a sandwich too costing you double and defying the healthy goodness of the graze box !
negative	avoid !
positive	my astra 0 . 0 cdti 00 van blow up could not get a recon engine for less_than 0000 pounds until i found engines on demand called peter and got one sorted in 0 days , i was back at work in a week life_saver !
negative	in debt your are now £_00 in debt .
positive	will certainly use again in the future and recommend .
neutral	i cannot_believe the reviews i have read , the 00 ' x 00 ' polytunnel i purchased was hardwork to erect , and that '_s after laying a base of 00 " x 0 " sleepers that were spot on level .
positive	the ride to the city was smooth and comfortable .
neutral	a flight is meant to be a pleasurable experience , and the simple things matter !
negative	we were completely at a loss as to what to do , especially with the time difference , we could not phone argus up and explain the situation .
neutral	i have emailed to say if the replacement is not available then i would like a refund , once again a stony silence .
neutral	endless phone_calls and chasing up !
positive	it also has very responsive and helpful staff who have helped my recover my account recently and also has the prices i have seen on the internet .
negative	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
positive	hostel_bookers is very helpful when it comes to hostels that do not have websites .
neutral	update_:
positive	this is what internet_shopping should be about and these_guys set the standard .
positive	i don_'_t know what i should do for the best .
negative	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
neutral	wouldnt live without the search_engines
neutral	ebay has improved its sales conditions for sellers , still needs to curb over charging for postage !
positive	hostelbookers also emails regularly and i like the no booking_fees as well as the deposit because you don ' t feel_like you ' re going to waste your money if something happens when you only have to put down 00 %, plus you can get the insurance .
positive	dedicated service to get you the best deal .
positive	we purchased a billabong winter wetsuit for my nephew , needed quick delivery for a wakeboarding comp he was competing in , the wesuit outlet provided second to none customer_service , they were extremely_helpful and we got the wetsuit delivered the next_day .
positive	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
neutral	erything put_together makes it really expensive .
positive	they are by far the best company on line that i have ever_dealt_with .
neutral	the process of creating my invitations was very easy .
negative	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
neutral	thing is , i only placed the order because i wanted the freebie offered .
negative	i sent them several emails but all replies were vague and unhelpful .
neutral	not as good as it used to be , from personal experience the site is going downhill fast and little is done to protect buyers . i find a lot of time wasters you buy something and never receive it as the seller never put a reserve on their item and are not happy to let it go at the price you won it at , but they tell you they have posted it and then happily refund your money which they have had for a week or so hence no item and a wasted experience which is so regular .
neutral	i will never be able to go with sky again due to this outstanding amount i owe them , but so be it i am a very happy virgin_media customer now :)
neutral	pretty disappointed and there are far better companies out there to be honest .
neutral	the problem however was that i had not received the items or even a card to say the delivery people had been .
negative	wren give the impression that this is business as usual for them .
positive	dave cochrane
negative	i made my first and last ever order with this online seller that is for sure .
positive	it waseasy to use
neutral	!?!
positive	now they are clucking away happily again .
negative	, i have called my bank and lodged a complaint as i don_'_t believe a refund was put through , otherwise the bed would not have turned_up today !
positive	dealing_with fashion_interiors was hassle_free and their delivery was spot on .
neutral	i ' m used in receiving what i order the next_day or the day after .
positive	items were always as_described .
negative	if only i would of read reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
negative	to host on my servers and not there '_s by the way .
positive	we booked early and got a really good price - we booked two rentals , one for six_weeks and another for seven .
negative	another new bottle of which the cap was also at great risk of exploding .
negative	i then emailed them immdeiately and asked them to change it .
neutral	one other thing .
positive	com before , and will again .
negative	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
neutral	0 .
negative	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
neutral	we also struggled with timings when we picked new activities .
neutral	i am writing to you with regards to your comment written on the trustpilot website regarding your booking with bravofly .
negative	remember the website said it was in stock .
positive	i also found them dramatically cheaper_than other holiday websites .
negative	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
positive	never had an issue .
negative	all in all i am not surprised .
neutral	to show you how i think about it i ' ve put the positives and negatives below :
positive	other than that , excellent company & would recommend to everyone !
neutral	i was so upset about this especially as we had spent over 0000 pounds in store .
neutral	upon complaining i did get a normal room with a normal balcony but had to pay an extra € 00 for the privilege .
negative	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted line .
neutral	they don work on my hob , so i took them back to exchang for some that do .
neutral	i know you might be saying that it ' s the courier or royal_mail that is delivering it late but when you speak to play . com there responce is wait 0 more days and call us back .
positive	would definately recommend them to others and would buy from them again .
positive	!
positive	we even get the first service for free .
negative	as i say lots of you have had great holidays , but if a problem they leave you high and dry and don_'_t help at all , oh sorry the rep did bring a desk fan so the windows could be kept shut at night because of the road noise , didn_'_t go far between five of us .
negative	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
negative	we went to mexico , so flight of 00_hours you need a lot if food to buy then . we did get the menu but it wasnt enough .
positive	good cheap prices very fast delivery and a0 service would recommend .
positive	david
positive	many_thanks .
positive	i bought tickets from double 0 tickets in may 0000 for backstreet boys at the 00 arena in london , they have been my favourite band since i was 0 years old .
neutral	delivery can be very patchy and amazon expect you to wait 0 weeks before declaring it missing
positive	the tickets arrived earlier_than i expected the seat where great and i had a amazing time .
neutral	i was encouraged to call fedex which_amounted to time and energy wasted as i could not do anything to progress the order / delivery as i was not the account holder .
positive	money was paid into my account on the day promised .
negative	i will never use apliances direct again
neutral	and how can they guarantee that when i now have to get_rid of about a third of the coat width to fit me ?
neutral	while the ortlieb messenger bag was the lowest_price online , it turned_out there was no point in paying extra for " guaranteed " next_day delivery .
neutral	although , i have no experience with the actual service , the sign_up was quick .
positive	bottom_line , i wish i knew about sw before now because 0 . they match prices ( with a simple reference site and price ) 0 . more of what im looking for so i dont have to go 0 - 0 places 0 . freebies that are coming out my , well you get the point !
neutral	whoever saw me , whether the nhs or private surgeons , complemented the surgery i had .
positive	i was a bit_sceptical at first when i saw those products at those prices but my sceptisism was totally dispelled when the goods turned_up .
neutral	i have bought things from this site before and been very happy .
positive	thank_you so much .
positive	still he never complained .
neutral	i booked next_day special delivery on the understanding that the order would be shipped on the thursday for friday delivery .
neutral	this would avoid credit_card checks being refused by your internal system even_though the credit_card company has authorized payment and approved name , address and good credit rating !
negative	she arranged and advised that i go to an ee store for a replacement sim .
positive	my daughter is now also a regular & loyal_customer & as she is computer_savvy , has signed me up for on - line shopping , regularly shops from tesco direct & has no problem picking_up or returning any of the products she has purchased .
negative	i had given up on ever receiving the item so ordered from another company and it arrived after 0 days and on the same day as the item from one click_pharmacy .
neutral	they would not listen to your problems and only asked you questions from a list if your problem was not on this list forget it no hope of a solution .
negative	i am still_waiting for the refund and have had to go through my credit_card company to try and get my money back do not give this company your business you will be disappointed !!
positive	i ' ve been using ebuyer for just over a year , and just bought another item , so out of curiousity , thought i ' d google them .
negative	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
positive	i have booked hostels in new_york , san_francisco , vegas , and rome without any regrets .
positive	best search_engine around and more , gmail is easy to use and so are the other services provided .
negative	rubbish company !
negative	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has been processed .
neutral	very good prices , delivery on the slow side , stated delivery 0 - 0 working_days , ordered am on tuesday phoned on friday they say delivery next monday , we shall see
negative	i ordered 0 items from them , on 0 . 0 . 00 .
positive	you can go onto the justeat website and talk to a rep via a chat window - i did this and got a full_refund every time .
negative	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my £_00 per week will go elsewhere .
negative	don_'_t trust them .
neutral	my computer is dell .
negative	they are very happy to take your money , but will abandon and leave you high and dry and the first sign of problems .
negative	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
positive	cant recommend cyberpower enough they sent me 0 free games for the inconvenience , with great service even after buying the product .
positive	fireplaces 0 life is the place to buy from .
neutral	i '_ve been to majorca many , many_times before and stayed in many types of hotels and would classify myself as a very experienced traveller .
negative	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i ' d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
neutral	this company is great - most of the time . courier failed to show up on friday so i contacted them with live help and gemma was very helpful and re - booked it for monday .
negative	i ordered them months in advance too .
positive	got screwed over on that part .
positive	i had not heard of the company before , but took the chance to order the headphones i wanted as they were the right price from a headphones company .
positive	i would definately use this company again and would recommend it to anyone who was thinking of selling their laptop !
positive	was a bit_sceptical_about getting my order right especially measuring pupillary distance .
neutral	ok , so i booked my flight from london to america in jan_0000 , flying out in aug using skyscanner . net , and realised it was booked with a company called travelup . never_heard of them before , so i proceded , but didnt get my eticket , or a confirmation straight_away like i had before ( used expedia then ) so i worried a little_bit , the confirmation and eticket arrived 0 days_later , unusual i thought , still , i was happy i had my flights booked , and the money had been taken from my account , i had a link to check my itinerary which i thought was good , then one day i couldnt log in to check so i panicked , i contacted travelup , but got no response , took 0 days before they got back to me , and advised there was just a schedule change , and i was then able to log in and check my itinerary .
negative	had to make alternative_arrangements to park our car .
positive	i ' m confident that this will be one of the greatest deal giving websites on the net , in the times to come .
negative	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don ' t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay .
positive	then , i spend some time looking at other_websites for their prices , to see if there are any lower .
negative	awfuly awful service .
positive	could i suggest that you offer a consultancy service to yodel for a substantial fee as they repeatedly fail to deliver on time .
negative	payment was taken at the time of order .
negative	second , their customer_service is the worst ever !
positive	they ' re great with advice too , and it feels_like a really personal service , a bit like having your_own style consultant .
neutral	despite putting my registration_number into the site found the tyres selected were a completely_different size to those on the car which i have owned since new .
negative	i have of course received an estimated_bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
negative	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
positive	as well as the competitive_prices the quality of the produce is always better_than the supermarket .
negative	viagogo receipt indicated row and seat numbers but no tickets in pack .
negative	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can ' t speak to anyone ".
neutral	don ' t really watch much tv but bbc 0 is good for comedy , especially family guy of a weekend !
neutral	it would not take much at this point to make me give them an opportunity to take my money on a weekly_basis .
negative	never known a company so bad , and look at the amount of neg reviews !
positive	also , there ’_s no toilet on the bus ( they do stops on requests though ).
neutral	over all though it could of been worse and i am not disappointed with my order .
neutral	get more for your money in the uk campared to ireland .
negative	hampstead road
negative	they really don ' t do good service , or to think of it , anything at all .
neutral	it seems that no matter how careful you are , they will always find something to trip you up .
positive	i haven ' t ordered off your site before but the process was very quick and simple .
neutral	the online management tool was really good .
positive	ps_: just waiting time could improve as for changing tyres i have been waiting for an_hour is quite a lot , but i know , you don ; t know when exactly i was comming in as when you book in , you have just option am or pm .
positive	thanks guys from officialiphoneunlock . co . uk and unlockboot . com , thanks to everyone in every corner of world , peace for our souls .
neutral	there is no phone number on the site , the phone number on the invoice doesn ’ t work and the live help they promote is difficult to find .
negative	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
neutral	they first assumed i have a stolen phone ( i bought it new ) but have since agreed to send me a refund .
neutral	for this reason i now tend to sell in local freeads or gumtree , as once you '_ve paid listing fees , selling fees , paypal fees - well you ' re hardly left with enough to stick in your ear so to speak .
positive	on many occasions we had tried to speak to someone
negative	it took 00 days to be despatched ( compare this to amazon and virtually every other online_retailer with same day or next_day despatch ).
positive	supplier of the same product .
negative	i had ordered a new galaxy_s0 three days ago , no phone as yet , i have e_mailed them on 0 occasions no reply , i tried_phoning the 0000 number , on hold for 00_minutes no reply .
negative	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
positive	i haven ' t had a problem with deliveries in the past and it gets fairly steady flow of customer reviews on each product .
positive	great website , someone always on the end of the phone and a pleasure to deal with .
negative	the engineer that they arranged to attend agreed that the tv lift mechanism was indeed faulty .
neutral	it didn_'_t appear on their tracking until 00_hours ( or more ) later .
negative	0 days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn ' t provide the tickets .
negative	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
negative	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
neutral	it has got much_better recently though and this hasn ' t happened for a while .
positive	from start to finish using tecnology at the front end and good service at point of delivery was very good indeed
neutral	i told them that he was 00 , 0 ' 0 " and played games on a pc and / or mac , a games console ( but i was blowed if i knew whether it was an xbox , ps0 or wii ) and that he hated " shootemups " but i did not not know what he had or did not have .
neutral	not impressed that they don ' t take security more seriously .
neutral	which i must_say is a bit much for something you are paying for !!
positive	working now in my laptop nicely , thank_you .
neutral	i purchased a scooter from careco for my husband in november_0000 , purchasing various add - ons for extra security and peace of mind , so that i didn_'_t have to worry_about him when he is out and about .
positive	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for the ' signed for ' delivery and this is way faster_than ordinary second class post , which can take up to a week .
neutral	only one minus , my order was stopped to a security check because i payed it with a foreign visa card .
negative	co . armagh
negative	argos you are crooks .
negative	a few emails soon sorted that - thanks trust_pilot !
negative	and now looking at others feedback , it looks_like this isn ' t the first time this has happened .
positive	having exchanged a few e_- mails and telephone_calls – to the point where my other half was getting slightly_concerned_about the bromance i was striking up with “ my main man in poland ” as i kept referring to him – phil had managed to sort our weekend out for us at a snip of the price they were trying to charge on said british based websites .
positive	i have used two so far and both are working well and i ' m happy with the quality of the printing .
negative	mine '_s not still ( 0 - 0 ).
negative	i closed my scottish_power account over 0 months_ago due to moving out of rented accommodation .
neutral	advised that it was a really bad first impression , i ' m unaware of the process , confused why they can ' t see what i can etc .
negative	blackpool
positive	service was excellent , customer_service was excellent , delivery time again excellent , quality you guessed it excellent
negative	trying to get my phone ' s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message confirming that they had my details checked .
negative	no wonder the harveys store where i live ( wsm ) has closed_down .

positive	nice to see more premier garages appearing too .
negative	sax concluded that “ the tourists think that they found something to complain and a probability to get refunded .”
negative	i am contacting bbc_watchdog and daily mail for help
neutral	when he eventually got back to me i was told that my claim had been denied because my name was not on the receipt .
negative	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
negative	!
negative	i ' m sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look_into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
negative	i ' ve had my van sign written for the new number , ha 0000 leaflets printed and had all out work wear printed with the new details that are now prob useless !
positive	!
negative	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform me that the order was on hold .
neutral	cheaper .
negative	parcel arrived in inverness on the 00th_april and still no sign of it so far today , the 00th .

negative	cowboys with no customer service care at all .
positive	having a single point of contact at chillisauce was very helpful and they helped organise a great weekend for 00 people .
negative	!
negative	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
negative	once anything gets sucked into it , it '_s nigh impossible to get it back out again ( that '_s the black_hole of course but you see the eerie similarity ).
negative	first and last ever order from a third rate outfit .

negative	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0 days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
negative	however , when i wrote to them explaining this fact , it was too late because their price guarantee only lasts 00 hour !
positive	i can only offer them for everyone .

neutral	i work full time and it was very difficult to book appointment where i could book without taking too much time off work .
negative	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!

positive	their website has a great database of places to stay all around the world .
negative	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn ' t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
negative	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven ' t dispatched the order for over one month !
negative	i sincerely say to future customers , don ' t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !

negative	is bent and split you cant lower the spare wheel it has been in a smash ,
negative	look at the website clearly - did you see the bit about the glasses taking 0 weeks ?
negative	he could not confirm if this included vat , which would bring the cost up to £_00 , and said he would investigate and call me back when the accounts team were in at 00am (!
negative	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
negative	yesterday i used curry '_s / pc_world web_site to reserve a tom tom 00 sat_nav for collection from my nearest curry '_s outlet where it was shown as in stock .

negative	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
positive	much_better_than viagogo and similar_sites , the price you see is the price you pay .
positive	came at a far lower price compared to other_retailers offering the same package
negative	no expertise on site but happy to take your money .
positive	we try to time our shopping to take_advantage of the reduced counters something that was totally foreign to us before arriving in the u . k . we have blessed this fantastic opportunityl so many_times as income has shrunk & prices have sky rocketed . we have great fun planning meals around our finds . everybody loves a bargain & we certainly do .
neutral	my estimated_delivery date is for tomorrow , and i ' ve just received an e_- mail telling_me it ' s been dispatched and it ' s on it ' s way .

negative	ouch !
neutral	i have bought items from yesstyle before .
neutral	the surgery in london was packed and it was one in one out .
negative	when i finally spoke to a person the product arrived soon after but still many days late .
negative	poor customer service negates discounted prices especially at £ 0 . 00 plus per phone_call to them stick to amazon , play or hmv all who have very good service , deal with you correctly ( and respectfully ) and have good prices too .
neutral	it fits and seems to work fine .
neutral	it just makes you feel small , and the guy asking the questions almost seemed accusing and judgmental .
negative	in the end they called me back as i put the phone down after 0 minutes on hold and told me that i couldn_'_t fly on the day i wanted because the flight was fully booked .
positive	christmas will now be complete happy holidays .
positive	i can ' t recommend you highly_enough , thanks .
neutral	they open in october , so there isn_'_t long to wait .
positive	outstanding , great service , good products , greta prices , very fast delivery .
neutral	if i hadn ' t been so busy with work , i think i would have done this myself and saved their admin_fee .
positive	these dune shoes are so comfortable .
neutral	shame really because just been emailed to say flowers for my mother tomorrow won_'_t have a mothers_day balloon although i had ordered it !
negative	worse though , stone audio have not responded to my emails chasing it up and when i call to enquire and they say they will call me back , they never have .
positive	would definately_recommend !
negative	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
neutral	but i did not receive what i was quoted even through all products where good quality and in perfect working order . or my goods where syphoned off at the warehouse . i lost a total of nearly_£ 0 . 00 , which i agree is not much .
neutral	good deals , love the club wowcher thing but what ' s the point in purchasing from somewhere that does not care about their customers !
negative	what they has found is that the processing of numbers in their office has terminated the wrong contract , instead of terminating the t mobile , they terminated the ee contract , they had told me that it would take a week for the processing office to respond to my request .
negative	i ' m £_00 out of pocket and they don ' t care about thier customers .
neutral	and i waited all day and finally the flowers were delivered after 0pm !
negative	the guy over the phone started to hesitate ,'' please hold on for a minute , let me check for you '' '' oh , i am sorry but your ticket is non_refundable '' then he started to tell me all these bullshit like '' oh , you have to accept this , its unfair but you have to .
positive	i read someone_else ' s complaint about returns , which hopefully will not happen to me .
positive	the whole_process was so easy , the only effort was walking to my local post_office .
neutral	product arrived late but it was in good order and cheaper_than anywhere_else .
neutral	i had previously checked they were in stock , after giving my postcode .
neutral	update_:
negative	we used two companies .
neutral	because that ' s too simple .
positive	very good , quick payment .
neutral	it hadn ' t !
negative	i did called the next morning . and i was on the phone from 0 . 00 until 00 . 00 . not aceptable at all !!!!!
negative	had a package delivered the other day and it was just chucked over my gate ( luckily not breakable ) however as we all no the weather is not the greatest in england at the best of times so yes the package got wet , really wish amazon would use a more reliable company who are not lazy .
negative	the final excuse on 00st january_0000 of darren losing his voice meant i asked for my money back to be told i should contact my card_issuer and get them to do a chargeback .
neutral	0 days_later no contact from anyone and on 0th day at 0pm order turned_up out of the blue .
positive	no , this company treated me fairly and had all done , cheque in hand ( just opened as the mazuma advert was on tv ) within three days , excellent !
neutral	i reviewed a protein drink in a constructive but critical manner .
neutral	just in case their 00_hours did not work over the weekend i waited until tuesday and then went to my bank for advice and found , luckily , they could cancel this dd .
negative	expense of making no end of calls to customer_service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
positive	if you got taken for a few tokens , rate the model down and move on . welcome to the real world .
negative	advertised as uk registered company by actually conducts business out of hong_kong .
positive	quick delivery and great packaging .!
positive	brilliant range of tyres too !
negative	other reviews say it all .
negative	we '_ve now ordered from running bare instead - i suggest you do the same .
positive	i just rescued an iphone 0 that was destined for the bin !
neutral	august_0000 .
negative	won ' t be going back for more tyres , will stick to the cheaper place that advertises 0 day delivery and free postage , as at_least you can plan things for sure then .
negative	customer_service is obviously low on their company values .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
negative	and there we have it , i now have to pay to get my items back , there is no refund for late delivery ( 00_hrs took 0 days ) and yodel are two different companies , with two tracking_numbers and probably too many chiefs and not enough indians .
negative	you then assured me that my box was to arrive in the uk on the 00th of august and i was then to allow up to two_weeks for customs .
neutral	( in some_cases )
positive	i flew from germany via heathrow to newcastle and had a stress - free flight .
positive	the ordering_process was quick , easy and painless .
positive	i am also dealing_with a very helpful team member - brittany - in organising another hen_weekend abroad next july .
neutral	i had not used maxi muscle products for a while and now started training again with my son
neutral	i live in a glasgow postcode so there wasn ' t a great distance for the item to travel from the glasgow store .
neutral	earned several hundreds of £ buying things i would anyway or on the risk free gambling sites .
positive	round supermarkets , three racing stables with cobbled yards , and he really would
positive	better_than amazon !
negative	i will not be renewing my contract when it comes up for renewal - an awful company to be contractually tied to . i strongly_recommend against them .
positive	people can ' t believe i only paid £ 0 for most of the things i ' ve got .
negative	and seems that the flowers were left outside in a public area .
positive	just thought i ' d point that out as most companies take an aeon and a half to reply emails ( if at all ) so i do really apprecieate the support staff getting back to me quickly and professionally .
positive	extremely good service .
neutral	oplever 00_% af tiden at den staller og ikke reagerer .
negative	please everyone , imagine those emotionless staff working at the customs at an airport , or someone who has depression working at a ticket office .
negative	i will never open an account with scottish_power again .
positive	this is probably the quickest and easiest_way to purchase btc in the uk .
neutral	good products and okay pricing but just try getting any sense if you need further information from them .
negative	i asked them if they could make a provisional date now rady for when the part comes in and they said their system does not allow them to rechedule in that way .
positive	we bought the perfect fit venetian blinds .
neutral	i have noticed in the past that the website closes for weeks at a time which seems strange .
positive	every time i found a place to stay i always checked this website before booking because it always the cheapest options .
negative	ordered the item on 0th_may , and it just got dispatched today , 00th_may , via_royal_mail letter post .
neutral	the ordering experience was good , easy to understand and make the order .
negative	second of all , the supplier company sent some overall 00 pounds cheaper caviar wd blue 0tb consumer class disks for replacements ( we will call this company the 0nd company for short ).
negative	0 days_later after i sent an_email_stating i wasn ' t going to be a customer anymore i recieved a call off someone called rob who wouldn ' t even tell me his full name and he was as useful as a choclolate tea pot .
positive	it wasn ’ t a problem – the large apartments are robust enough to cater for a bit of excess noise , they ’ re within easy walking_distance of the main square ( approx .
negative	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars .
negative	they were quite safe in making this offer as i had already told them that i had assembled it and was using it .
positive	to my surprise , the phone actually arrived on friday 00 september ( the release_date of the phone ).
neutral	anyway , apart_from this mystery , which knd of alarmed me , because i gave the precise information , this company seems efficient .
positive	no_problems with buying points or xbox memberships .
negative	pretty_much no one really cared !
neutral	boohoo does not offer exchanges so i had to return them .
neutral	it took a week for item to be despatched .
positive	the item arrived the day after i ordered it !
neutral	but alot of the time its used as tool for checking up on people and misused to a social advantage of the persons wills . e . g cyber bullying etc .
negative	i still have had no clear explanation as to my last queries regarding my non delivery .
positive	i tell everyone i know about myhermes .
positive	:)
positive	quick polite andhelpful xxwould reccomend to all x
positive	will_definitely use again !
negative	i have also e_mailed curry '_s direct to complain_about the poor service , surprisingly i have not received a reply .
neutral	we have received a parcel this morning consignment 0000000000 on a before 0pm service , the other 0 consignments are on the same delivery van but on a next_day service and unable to be delivered at the same time as the before 0pm parcel .
negative	then checked their website which had previously said " out for delivery " to see it had been amended to delivery attempted .
negative	update_:
negative	internet customer_services
neutral	they just shipped my order that i placed 0 days ago .
negative	i gave it 00_minutes but in the end had to get a cab which cost me another £_00 .
positive	thanks to sam the technician for a superb job well_done .
negative	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
negative	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
neutral	however , possibly due to christmas_rush , took a long time to send , so i emailed them to be told " whoops , forgot , will sned it now ".
negative	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
negative	not ideal , but said ok . got a call yesterday to say item had not arrived in warehouse , so delivery early july !
neutral	you get what you pay for sum thinks a great and sum are not it the luck of what you pick
positive	i always use auto_europe when i go to south_africa .
neutral	i tried it 0 or 0 times but stains are still there .
negative	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
neutral	cd_key warehouse is probably your best bet when it comes to cd_keys .
positive	he checked out my wheel and tyre thoroughly and told me my tyre was fine and no puncture .
positive	plus it is delivered in the quickest time .
neutral	it was pure look that my partner had finished work early and was home .
positive	i wasn ' t sure at first which one i wanted but the site provided me with all the information i required as well as many images of the products to help me with my decision .
neutral	hungry_house is just behind just_eat in terms of my spending spree . and put it another way .
neutral	i thought the points would come within the 00_minutes as stated in the website but have waited nearly an_hour and still_waiting :(
negative	and not to my house .
neutral	so one is no good to me as i measured them to fit frames to fitroom .
negative	not impressed .
negative	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here ' s my review of you
neutral	we purchased 0 items of furniture , and i have to say i was extremely impressed with the service we received in store , and the fast and efficient delivery of the items , however on receipt 0 of them were damaged .
negative	since then despite several emails to the person who responded to me and via their website i have heard_nothing from them at all .
negative	i cannot_believe those people that have had a ' happy ' result !
neutral	i ' m now a little_hesitant to keep using them in light of the review vetting
negative	subject : fw : [ aspect - vm ] feedback
positive	will_certainly be using lenstore for all my lenses in future .
negative	first surprise : the next available appointment was in march !
positive	actually , every manager should take this course and remember what managing projects and people is about .
neutral	i ordered a bunch of " lemon sorbet " flowers for mother ' s day and while the delivery was faultless , the bunch received was a " mum in a million ".
neutral	my mistake , i should have looked closely at the seal inside and out .
negative	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can ' t submit this without giving it one .
neutral	eventually i did tell him the bouquet was poor and sent him a photo of the dying flowers , warning him not to use the site again .
neutral	it has been easy to book , i got exactly_what i wanted for a very reasonable_price and everything_ran_smoothly .
neutral	haven_'_t heard back yet , but when i do i will rate the rest of the service on that .
neutral	the only email i received from you was to say my order had been received ( on 0 / 00 )
negative	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
neutral	had to pay for taxi to international terminal .
neutral	out of order .
negative	join this campaign on [_link ]
negative	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
positive	thanks very much , oli
positive	will use again . excellent service !
positive	good website , easy to use .
positive	recommended .
neutral	they reduced the price and upgraded our room .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	there weren_'_t even enough seats for everyone and not enough staff to cover .
neutral	still the cheapest flight company .
negative	i ' m trying to get hold of squires but will probably resort to getting it repaired locally .
positive	plus you can add tons of free items to your order , which is awesome !
neutral	i have received a confirmation , and viagogo was quick enough to withdraw the money from my account .
neutral	you need to consider continuity when choosing brands .
positive	fantastic price for a fantastic product .
negative	i left in march and have not looked back .
neutral	i waited , then gave up .
positive	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
positive	mange hinser
positive	easy website , sharp service and speedy_delivery .
negative	other than the colour of the homebase label , they were identical .
positive	saved four of us a commute to london from all over the country .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive .
negative	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i ' m sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
negative	000_pounds .
positive	if in doubt dont be , to me it was a weird concept but it worked out great !
negative	i received my itams and the batterie on one did not work and the atamizers were faulty i have emailed three or four times but did not get a reply and i even rang but waited 00 min but got no reply so very disapointed indeed i will wait and see if i get a reply to this email .
neutral	i was also informed that the website was misleading as the slot shown is only a ' request ' slot and in reality was always wrong and therefore the customer service team would always reschedule the appointment .
neutral	will wait to see what flowers are like and whether delivery is good before giving a full review though
positive	once i was on the website , the range of products nearly got me to change my mind but i stuck with my original choice .
negative	magento never worked due to server not being set_up correctly .
positive	would definitely_use them again .
negative	!
neutral	looks_like a manufacturing defect , not garden best buys fault , but the manufacturers quality_control . lets_see if i have a happy ending . or another week waiting for a replacement .
positive	very happy boy and dad .
positive	**********
neutral	at_least they told me there would be a delay .
neutral	but out of quality , fit , and customisation ( which i consider to be the three most_important things that make you consider a ' tailor - made ' garment instead of the standard off - the - rack stuff ), one out of three is just not good enough .
neutral	however they fly to the best european cities - and the prices are reasonable if you also play fair and book in_advance .
positive	but when it comes to anything released in the last 0 years though , their catalogue is very bare .
negative	better to buy in a good shop with good customer service .
neutral	i bought with 00_%_off which was probably passed onto the florist so less allowance for the flowers they had to supply .
positive	great software !
neutral	the first i realised was when a bill came through for nearly twice the amount & when i queried it they said we don_'_t tell people when contract ends if you were on a deal !
negative	so they appear happy to take your money but not dela with things when they go_wrong .
negative	0 items were different than pictured , and the other hand display was scratched with white spots , i opened an rma , but they said they can only refund usd 0 !
neutral	however , some of the shades displayed are very missleading , meaning i ended_up with several products i can ' t use , and fragrence direct refuse to refund without the items being returned .
positive	!
positive	interest_rates are more than acceptable - never the lowest of the low but you get what you pay for .
negative	the depots landline_number is actually a voicemail for a mobile number .
neutral	i ordered a game and paid for it only to find out it was no_longer available .
neutral	i know its only one person , s opinion but i think it is something worth thinking about because i know if you made your prices higher i would allways recycle with mazuma_mobile .
negative	i had just had my tyres checked at a tyre supplier garage and they said they will need renewing in the near_future but were ok for a while yet .
neutral	i ordered bed wedges so had to be home for their delivery so with no_idea of delivery spent pointless days home waiting for delivery .
negative	now i don_'_t know whether this is a direct result of me theatening legal_action ( appropriate complaint form was already filed with watford trading_standards 00th_march ) or the result of emails sent directly to persons i have been led to believe are directors of cex ( linkedin is a useful website ) whatever , one should not have to resort to such measures if a company wants to retain a loyal_customer base and for them to be successful , that requires a proffesionally run after care customer service dept .
neutral	i then got another e_- mail the day after it was supposed to arrive again , telling_me that their supplier still_hasn ' t delivered the guitar , and i will now have to wait another week .
neutral	but afterwards received a call from a rep who after a very pleasant chat then got me to sign up for what i thought was a bargain service deal .
neutral	took 0 months for my order to arrive , although communication from the owner was great !
neutral	ask you current provider to test your line first before moving .
neutral	originally ordered quite alot in march , all arrived in a tatty , smelly bag , items were fine but i couldn ' t keep them due to how they had arrived i was really offended .
neutral	my experience of first choice is one of value .
negative	i have researched this company and can only add to the hundreds of claims that they are thieving fraudsters !
positive	been buying from myprotein for a few_years now .
positive	i wanted to start cycling again after not having done so for a few_years now , and came to tredz on a online search .
neutral	i selected a basic pc model and customised it upwards to what i ' d like .
negative	i googled them and this appears to be a common pattern , people order goods , nothing arrives , they then try and fob you off .
neutral	!
positive	can always rely_on good value
negative	chris
neutral	this was refunded quickly but it was only picked_up via the bank_statement - i didn ' t receive further emails regarding the extra amount .
neutral	what upset me more was the fact that the network i was using was ' movistar '. a telefonica company ( o0 ' s owners ).
positive	at this point alarm_bells were ringing in my ears so i declined the power pack and after finishing the call went_onto the review site to check out customer reviews .
neutral	i placed my order and the money was taken immediately and the status of the order on their website changed to ordered .
negative	stay in all tuesday , the booked and agreed delivery date .
neutral	could you please help .
negative	" this is exactly_what i want can i pick it up tomorrow "
negative	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
negative	totally_unacceptable !
neutral	unfortunately after several_occasions where items were missing from my order , out of date or incorrect , i had to swap to tesco online .
neutral	last_year we unfortunately had to cancel our holiday to sarasota , as my mother died .
positive	excellent customer service .
positive	they ' re my courier agents of choice and i won ' t be using anybody_else .
positive	as usual , a very prompt and efficient service - posted the mobiles on a tuesday - cheque received on thursday !
neutral	but ultimately , it just makes me think that if i did place another order with you , i would end up receiving unwanted e_- mail and hassle .
neutral	this was actually a sales_pitch to try and get me to take out their insurance making 00 . yes 00 monthly_payments of £_00 per_month . are you kidding ??
neutral	i think the breathalyser is pretty reliable but not always functioning properly i . e .
neutral	i like the online process , but its the 00min phone call going through every detail of your spending and what you owe is the killer .
neutral	the product purchased is extremely good quality as expected after purchasing a high end trampoline .
neutral	i made a criticism of amount of water in chicken .
negative	on the day my new orange phone was due to be delivered , i get a phone from e0 !!!
negative	ordered my camera on 00th_april expecting a dispatch within 0 - 0 business days as stated on simply_electronics website .
positive	le site rassemble les offres d ’ emplois des grands sites d ’ emploi habituels , ce qui évite de devoir visiter les différents sites les uns après les autres ( pour , en fin de compte , souvent tomber sur les mêmes offres ).
neutral	i still owe them this outstanding amount ( which accumalated 0 years_ago ) and i am not going to pay this amount .
neutral	the first was the purchase of a brand_new mackie mixer .
negative	those frames are also discontinued .
negative	tried booking flights / hotel package online , saw a good deal , entered details for 0 people , names , dates of birth etc_etc , by the time i pressed confirm , the flights had gone .
neutral	the battery and charger both wore out very quickly and needed replacing , and dell ' s own replacements are outrageously priced .
negative	i ' m not sure i trust the positive_reviews on here .
negative	to : hester @ xxxxxxxxx
positive	excellent services
neutral	yeah the free_samples are ok but really i am not sure i get enough free_stuff to amount to what shipping_costs .
positive	plus i received notifications via text_telling_me what was happening with the delivery , when dispatched and when delivered etc .
positive	over the years i upgraded the graphics_cards , then i went sli ( twin graphics_cards for increased rendering performance ) and increased the amount of ram .
positive	done trust your health to high_street cowboys pedaling junk .
positive	i will be recommending it to all the students i know .
positive	this was my 0nd purchase from panamoz .
neutral	fingers_crossed !
neutral	cotswold emailed me the next_day to promise a new delivery date for a replacement but so far nothing has_been confirmed and no new item appears to be on the way .
positive	i am 0 foot two and normally standard jackets are too short but this was perfect .
neutral	i could have ordered elsewhere and got it within 00_hours , so the website should reflect the true stock_levels .
negative	i contacted the ceo or orange via an_email address i found online ( executive . office @ ee . co . uk ) and the responses i ' ve been getting since then are lesser quality than an infant the age of 00 months old .
neutral	so i '_ve decided to take my money where it will stretch further - aldi and lidl .
negative	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
neutral	however more disappoingting was that the item had been inadequately packaged and the tin that housed all the contents was dented in several places , including the front .
neutral	i wanted to get a new " help for heroes ", which is a charity , bracelet and found one on their site .
negative	i explained that i wanted to travel the day before and by the time ( 0 mins ) that i had got through to the payment screen the quoted price had increased by over 000_pounds .
neutral	on 0 / 0 i received an_email_stating that the delivery was made on 0 / 0 .
neutral	for this reason i reduced my score to 0 / 0 .
neutral	i dont understand_why they use that policy .
negative	?
neutral	good service , but for the small user , like me , it comes at quite a price ( 0 . 0 % + 00p_per transaction ).
negative	a week_later i get an_email_saying my tickets were unable to be issued with no explanation unless i phoned back by 0 the next_day .
positive	obviously having no booking_fees is also great and i personally like that i don ' t have to sign_up to the site to book things through it .

positive	i will deffinetly be shopping here for future_purchases .
positive	there is absolutely nothing to give me concern regarding a grey_import and at less_than 00_hours between placing the order on - line and receiving the goods the camera must have come from a uk address ( the senders address on the delivery label was in london ).
neutral	items were posted the next_day and delivered in very good condition .
negative	how would you feel ?
neutral	other delivery companies that myprotein uses are a pain - the depots are long miles_away and they don ' t let you to change the delivery address ( need to contact sender to do that ).

negative	there is no way i would recommend this shambles of a company .
negative	i tried to contact customer_service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
negative	i asked if they would give me one from their stock but that was not possible .
negative	also found that in trying to sort_out the problem , mattressman customer service is always busy and all calls are diverted to a third_party call_centre to take a message and then it takes several hours to receive a return phone_call from cs .
positive	best prices
neutral	how many two year_old mint_condition iphone_0s are out there ?
neutral	it is insulting to know that i have waited that long of time where if i had found out 0 days earlier , i still would have had enough time to order some clothing for a cheaper price and it was one of my prefered items which i felt i had to have .

negative	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
neutral	the website makes it difficult to find menus and special_offers .

negative	i explained i had phoned sky up about 0 hours prior and have all the quotes i need .
positive	excellent email communication notifying of each_stage of order process from when order taken to delivery .
negative	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
negative	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
neutral	so much for the anpr system , thats supposed to automate this !
neutral	it is quite vulnerable to hackers and could do with some sort of sorting system e . g .

negative	just by chance i looked into the tracking .
negative	i wish i ' d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
negative	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
neutral	they are not always the cheapest and their prices between online and actual shop are very misleading , to say the least .
negative	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
neutral	just interested in your money , not had any_problems with them , but the odds are not the best generally
positive	supplied next_day could not wish for a better service .
positive	so four beds bought by us all in all so i would say satisfaction is 000_% and you really can '_t beat the customer service either .
neutral	now i '_ve ordered one of your_own_brand shocks and there is at_least a two week wait for those .
positive	i have already identifies further work which i will be asking them to do .

negative	laura jones
positive	the suit was of outstanding quality , everything as_described the delivery was second to none ( 0days from ordering !!).
positive	i sometimes forget i ' m wearing them .
neutral	possibly the rudest anyone has ever been to me over the phone .
neutral	in summary , there were three main problems ,
neutral	the e_- mail from speciality drinks stressed that someone must be in to sign for the parcel and that it was my responsibility to track it .
positive	pricing was also very competitive and i am sure i will be purchasing from here again :)
negative	this company are the worst ever - do not go with them .
negative	we gave up .
positive	i cannot_praise pet_supermarket high enough .
neutral	i could have had my phone 0 days sooner if they ' d left me a message or sent an_email , and dispatched to the right address .
negative	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing .
neutral	better living were very prompt in coming out after my initial contact and the furniture didn_'_t take long to be made .
positive	so not only am i in the good books with my wife , i am also in the good books , ( for now ) with my mother in law .
positive	easy to use website , good price .
positive	keep up the great service and support .
negative	they don ' t even let you have any little perks !
neutral	warm orange roses and deep purple lisianthus cool the heat of this contemporary design .
neutral	i decided to use them again recently and again items have not been sent out for a while .
positive	i have used this company about 000 times now . and never had any_problems . local people pick my items up when stated . at a rough time to suit me . and not one has ever gone_missing yet . cheaper_than royal_mail costs .
negative	piad for but didnt arrive for a few_days ( fair_enough ) when they did arrive , they were in a jiffy envelope saying signed for but unfortunately they did not attempt to get a signature but instead rammed them through what is a tiny letterbox causing them to break .
positive	it was a pleasure to deal with indigo , the service from start to finish was fantastic and i am delighted with our items .
neutral	no effort made to leave a positive impression and i ended the call more wound up than when i dialled .
negative	it took them ages to respond and when they did , all they said was we had upgraded .
negative	offered an exchange as a gesture of good will !!
positive	we had requested a bespoke wedding_ring , a gold flat profile 00mm ring .
negative	i wasn_'_t happy .
negative	rang city_link who said only parcel0go could issue a refund ,
neutral	risky !!
neutral	i even got a text from the courier company telling_me when to expect them , to with an_hour , which they then honoured .
neutral	arrived 00_minutes early for our return_journey which extended the hanging_around at the airport .
negative	food , luggage etc .
negative	did send me new one and lasted 0 weeks . called again and i was informed that the new routter that arrived 0 weeks_ago had a faulty problem . so . they send me a new one . lasted 0 week . so . called again . i have lost the count of the hours that i have lost with talktalk services . the best was when speaking to inder ( faulty department manager ) ask me to wait and hanged_up on my face . not nice at all . this is the kind of service that you will receive from talktalk managers !!!!
neutral	the finished_product looks very professional ; however there are small white spots on some of the pages which are not on the original photographs .
negative	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
positive	appreciate it , thank_you .
negative	as one day , you may become the one who gets the luck to be deleted and all the cashback you accumulated will be vanished or i would say , transferred to their " topcashback " accounts .
negative	quand je leur explique qu ' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas récupérer le colis et qu ' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me répond : " on ne fait plus ça m ' dame " !
negative	0 out of 00 as this site and electrixworld . com are not trading !
neutral	the item i ordered came in reasonable time and was in suitable condition .
positive	i use parcel 0 go all the time , their prices are very competitive and great value for money !
neutral	( was given 0 sim_card to make it complicated !)
neutral	overdraft charges are a ripoff and their local branches are very very poor .
negative	i wrote to complain_about the misleading claims and suggest they change it as it would benefit everyone , no reply !
negative	numerous short positive_reviews all taken within the last few_days , all by members posting their first and only review ??
negative	as the pads have wear sensors i am left to wonder_if the sensors are faulty or the garage is once again lying to me .
positive	i can only say that my experience has_been excellent and i am totally_satisfied with price and service .
positive	the product was delivered on time , packaging was good .
neutral	i then rang back as he had not mentioned any price for the expedited delivery - verity answered and i gave my order number and she confirmed it was on fast order and that it was £ 0 . 00 .
negative	they never thought to look up the company on the internet , or contact me for instructions .
negative	they said ok but they went_ahead and sent what they had .
negative	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
positive	will_definitely be buying more from here in the future .
positive	their web_page was so easy to use and the quote was instant .
negative	data_protection act etc . was sick of vodafone had to write to there ceo and was released out of my contract .
negative	so we went into a 0 store .
positive	i am also a member of other adult cam sites , but this website is frankly a hundred times better_than the others .
positive	went to google_shopping to look for some spray paint and found ffx to be a really good price .
positive	its great that you can get everything you need all in one place .
negative	don ' t use this company .
positive	thanks .
neutral	i liked the appliances_online price and the tracking_system , it let you know where the item for delivery was at any given time .
neutral	this is not the attitude .
neutral	n . b .
neutral	turns_out they do not have a returns or refund policy !
neutral	as i was going on a 00 day driving holiday and had a big crack on my windscreen i was not happy .
positive	it arrived very quickly and in perfect well - packaged condition .
neutral	well the service is really not the best .
positive	i had two ipod touches to sell for my sons .
negative	so i went back to the store they happily sorted out the problem for me .
neutral	it would only be false_advertising if we didn_'_t give the customer their bonus .
negative	they really have lost complete touch with the customer experience .
negative	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
neutral	!
negative	i ' m just one customer they have tried to rip_off . how many vulnerable customers are out there who don ' t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
positive	i absolutely love this web_site .
neutral	on the whole i like aldi for some of their prices .
neutral	although once i opened it i found that the retail box was crushed and in tatters as if something hefty had driven over it .
neutral	the online_chat service is slow and they are very abrupt when dealing_with you .
negative	they ' ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags . items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
negative	i am yet another innocent customer who was drawn in by the false_advertising of this company .
negative	george
positive	i even buy and sell stamps to increase my collection .
negative	my order was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn ' t bother .
neutral	email received to confirm order and that delivery would be on 00th - i was sceptical with 00th being a bank_holiday but the webiste said next_day and the email confirmed it .
negative	les leech
neutral	complete chaos and awful experience .
neutral	however , this helicopter is not built as well as some and is all plastic with no metal subframe like some of the better ones i have flown .
negative	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
positive	for that special_occasion i would not consider anything_else
negative	that would be stealing , it ' s a joke !
neutral	each cash_generator store is run independently , meaning your level of service can vary dramatically depending_on which members of staff and managers deal with your order .
negative	i had never used this company before and first attempted booking my tickets online .
negative	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
positive	have dealt_with cartridge discount many_times , and would recommend them as
positive	so happy with a product in ages .
positive	!
negative	i purchased a pair of ray_ban wayfarer on 00 / 00 /_0000 and was really pleased when i received an_email the next_day saying that my purchase had been shipped .
neutral	also information about dispatch wich came to e_- mail dosent match to information on my account on site
neutral	so let ' s be fair to them - three stars : " so - so - acceptable experience but with some friction " just about nails it , although it is still pretty unacceptable to me : promising a customizable garment length then trying to backtrack on that , missed delivery time , unanswered customer query email regarding said delay , missing an item off my garment , trying to get away with not sending me the item and fobbing me off with more credit , and then changing their tune after i kicked up a fuss on trustpilot - not exactly_what i consider acceptable .
positive	then visit the site before you buy and earn a little mint .
positive	great service from double0tickets .
neutral	i have purchased example tickets for 0st march ( which is not long away ) and the money has not yet been taken out of my bank ?
negative	ok , so i can chat online with someone , that '_s good , really fast response ( although i suspect it '_s automated , strange replies to my questions ).
neutral	with a bit of tweaking very could be an excellent choice when shopping .
negative	this as affected my decoration that will have to be done again . kitchen window left hand top hinge faulty ( gap of 0 . 0mm towards the top ).
negative	i have paid them £_000 , have repeatedly phoned , begging them to give me my correct final reading and i will immediately pay the balance .
neutral	in my opinion : shipped items is the quickest , but sucks since your size might not be on the ready to ship list .
negative	no mention of a refund initially .
negative	went back to k & co , and complained . they said they would ' sort it out ', and asked ' when ' we would like it delivered . we said " anytime after 00am , any day of the week " . it turned_up , a couple of days_later , @ 00 . 00 !
negative	it took a further two times of me telling him what to say for him to repeat it verbatim .
positive	very good quality invitations - fast service , free printing of guest lists is excellent .
neutral	i would have given it more stars but for the constant checking that it `_s still working properly .
positive	it downloaded another 0 . 0 . 0 ipsw ( i installed an official 0 . 0 . 0 before btw .), installed it and then asked me to check for a carrier update .
neutral	there was so much plastic and bubble_wrap around each item .
positive	they are always on time and the delivery men / women are always very friendly and patient .
negative	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
neutral	the whole_experience was reasonably hassle_free , despite 0 trips to london .
negative	i clicked on bar sim only button , but giffgaffs system managed to bar my phone also arrhhh .
neutral	this was categorically not explained .
positive	very surprised how fast my order was delivered .
negative	the protein is completely unusable .
positive	woke_up in such a great mood , feel great , headache and everything else has gone !
negative	the results of that ?
negative	the item was not packaged properly , just thrown there as if it is not fragile .
negative	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
negative	their customer service to me was non - existent .
neutral	i asked is that date for sure and i was assured it was .
positive	everything was in stock and they shipped to me next_day !
positive	service from infrun was also top_notch , very prompt delivery and easy to use website .
negative	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
negative	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
neutral	there was no ' handle with care ' notice on the outer packaging on the first rads and indeed they were just sliding about on the floor of the couriers panel van .
negative	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
negative	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
neutral	a lot of netflix content are tv_shows from channel 0 ( such as the inbetweeners and shameless ) which are available to watch for free on channel 0 ' s steaming site , so not sure why you would need a paid for account on netflix to watch them .
positive	!
negative	a friend_recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
negative	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
positive	rating excellent because mazuma met all my expectations .
negative	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
negative	cancelled order and will not order from sainsbury online again .
negative	no email to advise of a delay .
positive	a ***** service !
negative	my lawyer friend drafted a letter for me giving them until 0st december before we place a claim in a london small_claims court for breach of contract , we sent it recorded delivery but " surprisingly " they could not find the letter so had to send proof of delivery plus a copy of the documentation via_email to them as well .
negative	telephones not being answered , online email messages not answered and the online_chat makes you wait a very long time between each interaction .
negative	when i phoned their credit control team to sort out i was told that they didn ' t have access to any notes from my previous calls regarding my account , and they demanded i pay nearly 0x what i think i owe to them .
neutral	he said i had been charged for next_day delivery instead , i was furious .
negative	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
neutral	the only response i have had from the unlock company was to a mail i sent on the 00th_january saying that if they cannot sort it out then to refund my money . all they could say was to give it a bit more time i do not think it is a problem with them but it looks more like softbank dragging their feet . luckily i have another phone otherwise i would be giving up and putting the 0s on e_- bay
neutral	items were reasonably_priced and delivery was free which is a bonus , although came a day later than_expected , had to make a journey to royal_mail sorting_office as they wouldn_'_t leave package as i wasn_'_t in . that was a pain so can '_t see why they ask you if you want them to leave in a safe_place then return it to sorting_office making it a 0 days_later .
positive	fast_shipping and love the 0 %_off the lowest competitor price you can find !
negative	my conclusion ?
neutral	having opted for a cheap car i still expected to get a car that was newer and with less body damage .
positive	and u can sometimes get a really good bargin when things go on sale !
negative	good luck with treating future customers this way .
negative	want to wait 0 months for simple complaints and queries to be replied to , to just be told your complaint has been declined !!
negative	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
positive	i saw that this website had the product i wanted for $ 0 more_than on amazon but amazon had very pricy shipping . this company actually fixed their price to lower_than $ 0 .
neutral	finding the inversion table was fine and ordering all quick and easy , delivery next_day was excellent .
neutral	it makes the whole_process take much much longer .
positive	not at all .
neutral	i ordered 0 items of the knightsbridge bedroom range .
positive	period .
negative	at this point i wasn ' t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
neutral	this came_across with the comment that any_problems would be dealt_with and if need be the freezer would be replaced free of charge and that ' you will never have to buy another freezer again '.
negative	i took the 0 receipts back to the shop , along with the packaging , explained the situation and asked for a refund for the difference in price .
negative	the employee couldn ' t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre ' s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
negative	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
positive	i have been liaising with ameer on a number of projects over the last six_months or so , every request was followed to the " t ".
negative	we placed an order last_week and ordered a meal from one of the express delivery guarantee takeaways , unfortunately , the meal didn ' t arrive within the 00_minutes guarantee but actually arrived in 00 - 00_minutes , while there was a missing item and the food and sauces were spilled throughout the bag .
neutral	i was sent a text to say thankyou and an accompanying photo of the bouquet which quite_frankly bore little resemblance to the one on seranatas web_site apart_from it being pink .
neutral	lets compare a flight from london to geneva using easyjet and british_airways ( leaving in 0 weeks time - a fair test i think ) with 0 bag to check in ( important as easyjet charge per bag )
positive	please don ; t worry your bank details are compleatly safe
positive	and i made money on it !
negative	background :
positive	it turned_out to be an excellent choice .
neutral	these are baoer , duke , picasso , jinhao , hero etc .
neutral	viagogo transaction_id 00000000 .
neutral	the knife arrived the next_day .
positive	product was as hoped for , exactly_what i expected .
neutral	i wanted to check a delivery so i called up and was on hold for 00_mins with only 0 people ahead of me then the adviser was rude but i was still very polite and i never got rude the entire call then she didn ' t listen to what i said and she told me the item had already been delivered then said bye and hung_up .
negative	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !

negative	when the first person , [_name ], picked_up , he picked_up on someone_elses phone ; " hello [_name ] phone , [_name ] speaking ", so was unable to deal with me and was rustling the phone around unprofessionally .

neutral	they did a reasonable job and the price was fairly competitive .
negative	!
neutral	good price but as with any online ordering it '_s fine if you a company or working on a site where there are people to sign for the delivery all day but if you are a diyer then you may end up having to stay in all day for your delivery ( 0 :_00am to 00 :_00pm ).

neutral	having said that , they were efficient in offering an_alternative and that arrived very quickly and well_packaged , plus zero hassle with the refund of the difference in price .
negative	another huge joke - the agreement states exchanges within 00days yet i was told a different tale when i asked about exchanging something saying i only had another 0 days for an exchange and they then only hold the credit for 0 weeks or i would lose it all , despite_being away on holiday and being disabled which is why we were going away while the bathroom was being fitted .

negative	still not receiving any personal communication , i contested the payment at which point it was handed_over to a debt_collection_agency .
positive	good luck guys !
neutral	sadly trustpilot doesn ' t discriminate between stores ( unless someone in the review has mentioned which store ) so whilst some stores are next to perfect the majority of the bad_reviews are probably for the minority of stores that are awful .

negative	purchased capella bedroom_furniture on 00 / 00 /_0000 home delivery .
negative	i '_ll go straight to the point .
negative	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .

neutral	after noticing a small chip on my windscreen i rang to arrange a repair as i was told this was free under my insurance_policy .

neutral	as it was , it took us over an_hour to drop_off our single bag - and we were the lucky ones .

neutral	my only niggles are that their range is not as good as cheapsmells and the website is more fiddly too .
neutral	the cover appears to do what it says although the claim process via the underwriter looks rather involved - many documents required in support of claim .
negative	i have subsequently asked for my money back which again has not had a reply .
positive	what better service could you ask for , thanks litecraft .
neutral	etc .
positive	customer_services gave precise measurements which meant that i knew_exactly how to place the printers which meant that i didn_'_t have the hassle of wondering whether the printer would fit on the bottom shelf .

negative	i find this quite impertinent as this company didn ' t even bother to notify me that the glasses are undeliverable !
positive	scope and mounts arrived bang on time , well_packaged and exactly as discribed .
negative	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
neutral	i am delighted because the ipod was very important to me , and although i won ' t be getting the exact_same ipod back , at_least i ' ll have something .
negative	0 .
neutral	you know we wont send the items back as the postage will probably cost more_than the item is worth . woo and a jumper i received the other say had a hole in it . the stitching was out so much the neckline was practically on my shoulder . very disappointing as ive had some really good items in the past .
positive	have a look at them for yourself .

neutral	i ordered a guitar which was marked as in a sale .
positive	i needed to book a ticket urgently due to a family emergency .

neutral	it may also be an idea to state on alpharooms info that it would be helpful if you are a fluent german speaker as paguera is geared up for german speakers .
negative	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot cheaper .
positive	free_stuff on every order too
neutral	can we push this product at you ?
neutral	also viagogo email you saying if you can '_t get there in so many days they will destroy your tickets people go on holiday you know and may miss this , this needs to change it would be devastating after paying all that money !

neutral	!
neutral	i have been with talk_talk two years and throughout this period i have had consistant problems with the router disconnecting from the internet .

positive	i can only recommend this company to others .
neutral	i ' m not the best tech head so i find their site quite difficult .
positive	i recently bought some of the lightweight towels and they are way less bulky and easier to manage than bath sheets at the pool ."
positive	website was easy to use and gave all the information i needed .
positive	i e_- mailed and asked to swap this and was told it was no trouble and just use the return label and choose another item .,
neutral	no other issues however , and very reasonable prices compared to other_retailers .
negative	if you have any further enquiries please raise an_email support ticket and our customer service team will swiftly assist you .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for better service really .
neutral	it is a shame that i had to go through all this in the first place , but all is well that ends well .
neutral	but if i book through holiday_autos web_site , i want my car from them and not hertz , olympic or someone i '_ve never_heard of .
negative	ongoing .
positive	i certainly would recommend .
positive	thanks so much !
negative	their only redeeming feature is that they refunded me promptly .
negative	lets spin a coin , heads it gets delivered tails it dont .
neutral	however there do appear to be some pretty major holes in their system which do need addressing .

positive	i ordered my spec '_s on monday_afternoon and they were with me by friday_morning and i got one pair free .
neutral	my wife liked the upgrade car but hadnt actually seen the one we booked .
negative	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste pipe and having to pay £_00 for another waste pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste pipe so they couldn ' t give me anymore . ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more_than £_00 i was told i had only paid £_00 . 00 for the shower tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for £_00 .
negative	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0 weeks .

positive	the substantial thickness , interesting designs , customer service , easy instructions and reliable delivery all make goodprint the best in my book .
neutral	collection was for the friday , and went as planned .
positive	the staff are like family , and make you feel_like part of that family .
neutral	this protects apple ( or whoever ) against being held to ransom and to ensure continuity of supply in the event of natural disasters or strikes .
neutral	in there favour though they did refund part of the cost .
negative	i do not live in a remote_area and have not been contacted about any_problems with the order so do not see why it is taking so long .
neutral	seems like they do not have as good a range of products as local b_& q oulets
negative	then when i finally got through a guy said he was unable to deal with my issue and put me through to someone_else .
neutral	i was a bit puzzled as to why it would take so long for them to pick them up ( and a bit annoyed to have to store them for so long ) but customer_services were very helpful .
neutral	a decent email i liked it before they changed it , the simple design was great .
positive	overall the experience was perfect from placing the order to being_able to play the guitar exceeded my expectations .
neutral	i don ' t have time to send it back , but i suggested to them that rather_than wrapping a piece of cardboard around their boxes which does barely anything to protect them , perhaps bubblewrap would be better .
negative	i brought some glasses from glasses_direct due to a web offer but am bitterly dissapointed by this company .
neutral	four man job to move it but no handles or lifting points are provided .
positive	i have generally dealt_with william who remembers me ( even when he spoke to my wife ) and always seems like an old friend .
negative	i ordered a dress on october 00th , it still has not arrived !
neutral	it seems the relationship between airlines and the people who sell their seats isn_'_t as harmonious as you ' d imagine !!

positive	service is fast and one is kept up to date by email .
positive	found any van on google and within actual minutes quotes came through and it was hard to decide which one to use .
positive	i was very happy with the service and notifications i got from tile empire and the metro black tiles i needed to fit with the deco .

negative	not acceptable , very angry .
negative	oh joy i thought so i contacted customer_services who said somebody should ring me .
negative	asked if i could speak to a manager and she would not put me through , asked if any body regulates them and raj refused to answer .
negative	the only similarity , they were both blue .
neutral	not only this , but i am told the item is no_longer made , yet it is still available for sale on your website today !
negative	" customer_service deal with this issue , but we can ' t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
neutral	vitabotics have an environmental responsibility to allow customers to opt out receiving these freebies !
positive	i had looked at other_sites , but simplyswim had the costumes i wanted and at a very good price .
neutral	this is my only dissapointment .
neutral	this year was the first time i used easy jet .
negative	i had the temerity to ask a simple question regarding an agent .
neutral	i declined asked for a return and ordered successfully elsewhere within a few_days .
neutral	easy to use website and like the facility to order more than one currency per order .

positive	would use again and recommend to anyone

negative	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
negative	my advice , dont go with them in the first place .
neutral	so not such a good deal after all - how ' sneaky '!
negative	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
negative	and i find it utterly wasteful an ridiculous that anyone upgrades with carphone_warehouse .
neutral	they instead sent me a guest pass key .
positive	delivery was great , i got a call an_hour before hand so i could go home to sign .
neutral	if tomorrowland release the tickets in the beginning of june why do you intend to withhold the tickets 0 - 0 days before the event ?
positive	michael bond
positive	i sticked with airvpn because their support was really great , they went out of their way to help me when i had a problem .
negative	they are not to be trusted .
negative	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue .
positive	arrived sat morning at no extra delivery cost .
neutral	if you like getting free_stuff through your letter_box this one is a good site i wouldnt give them 0_stars or recomend you sign_up to their email newsletter as they are proper spammers .

negative	within two days my front off side tyre decided to remove itself from the wheel rim on the m00 motorway .
positive	would definately use again and recommend to a friend .
negative	i told her it is friday_evening the sender must be close until monday .
positive	good customer_service too , they call you to confirm your booking if you book online , then they call half an_hour before they turn_up which is really useful .
positive	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
positive	decent prices and staff who know what they are talking_about .
positive	easy ordering / payment process - absolutely no glitches .
neutral	i will keep this brief with a list of for and against
positive	each time i fill in the on line sell form , the return envelope is on my doormat the day after .
neutral	but its a good reference .
negative	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
neutral	if they stated next to the item on their website that they were out of stock , i would have gone elsewhere .
negative	phone came back today ( not repaired ) via_royal_mail - thank_you for that .
negative	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money .!!!
neutral	unfortunately the free gift [ my order was well over their trigger point ] was for glucosamine gel [ which i buy ] was a 0 % gel whereas what i buy is a 0 % gel .
neutral	when you buy a code you are asked to verify your identity essentially with a phone number which can be either sent a text_message or called then entering a subsequent code into the website .
neutral	great . but their customer_service is beyond bad .
positive	all the other shops wanted to make a charge to change the cartridge over .
positive	fantastic .
positive	fantastic service , friendly / helpful communication and great prices . what more could you ask for ?
neutral	the service including delivery was slick .
neutral	overall , neither a good , nor a particularly bad_experience , but i wouldn ' t bother buying from them again .
positive	very pleased with the fast and very helpful feedback ( may i mention again that they searched the warehouse for it , instead of just giving me a " sorry no out of stock " like some other suppliers would ), i placed my order , and recieved it 0 days_later ( only chose basic delivery ).
negative	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
neutral	i did wait a long period of time for my text_message which did not arrive and thus would recommend accepting the phone call method instead which came instantly .
neutral	however my recent transaction has seen me waiting 0days for " next_day delivery " products .
neutral	a simple video explaining what is involved when you order from this company would go a long way . for example :
positive	i can say anymore , other than , i will_continue to use them !
negative	all i will add is that returns are not £ 0 . 00 .
negative	do yourselves a favour people pay a little extra for bt or sky .
negative	i orderes two items from here both sent out between the 00th of feb and the 0 march still havnt received any opened a dispute with paypal , god know how long it will take to get my money back thats if i do , all there saying is were looking in to it , what ever you do dont buy from here
positive	shame they didn ' t have the black saddle available .
negative	cant access ftp , then to top it off they have cancelled my package by mistake .
negative	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
positive	cannot recommend this company high enough !
negative	i took out van insurance , which i was told would mirror my no claims from the car .
neutral	i only had to wait a couple of days and it was on groupon so i quickly brought it .
negative	the contact centre said they never contact the sender if there is a problem but sit on it until either the sender or recipient contact them .
negative	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
positive	overall i do recommend slr_hut .
neutral	wij zijn dus helaas geen klant meer .
neutral	they may be cheap but it shows and if you ' ve got a flight over an_hour then i ' d recommend a better airline .
positive	very pleased with the service , quick delivery and when i realised i ' d ordered the wrong part the turn_around to swap was also very quick .
negative	sofa arrived as promised but really was not good value , cheap and nasty , grey plastic legs etc ( cost was over 000 gbp ).
neutral	unfortunately i have had a very laborious and frustrating experience with this company .
negative	i sent two emails but received no reply .
negative	the last four orders i ' ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
neutral	regards
negative	poor .
neutral	their email system never replayed for my request for a number for one of my packages . so i never got a list too write out on my package .
positive	yes , there is a shipping cost , but its simple to justify having to pay for shipping when i know that it doesn ' t compare to what i ' d be paying elsewhere to get my supplements .
neutral	what ' s the point of ordering something for an occasion if it doesn ' t get there ?
neutral	i was very happy to receive my full ultegra group set and pedals within 00_hours of ordering them .
negative	their communication is absolutely atrocious . the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up .
negative	trustpilot , if you want credibility then you have got to clamp down on these companies that report all their negative_reviews and post pr spun 0 line 0 star reviews .
negative	i wouldnt recommend this company .
neutral	i ordered a digital heatgun which tend to be cheapest across the net after a few search_engines i done , received the item in time but when i opened the pack every accessories for the heat gun itself was not in place and it was all over the box , i guess this could be because of original manufacture packaging and not the fxx or could be because of bad handling of the item from the fxx , however the item fully works and not damaged that ' s why i give 0 start for this my very first purchase from them .
positive	you are indeed the only supplier to deal with .
neutral	i use ebay a lot , it '_s great to buy , but hellish expensive to sell .
negative	it ' s now been over 0 week and yodel are still apparently investigating at to where my parcel is .
neutral	most are not immediately obvious , however one is over the eye of the guest and can be seen straight_away .
positive	this is going to be my place to get my monthly shop from now on , highly impressed !!
negative	last_week i tried to purchase salter knife sharpener , although it was in the old and new catalogue they were not able to supply it .
neutral	one with sms receiving capability , that ' s linked to your paypal account .
positive	used_shiply to find quotes for moving a car from london up to bedford .
negative	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
negative	then again it ' s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
neutral	viagogo , do yourself a great service and commit to posting a phone number and dealing personally with your customers because customers complain with their feet .
positive	i was away when the tickets for this concert went on sale , so by the time i checked my emails and went on line it was sold out . luckily i managed to get some good tickets from double0 and they arrived within a couple of days .
positive	great service , i won_'_t hesitate to recommend to friends and family .
negative	i then phoned carphonewarehouse back and explained what customer_service at tmobile had said , the lady in cpwh store asked me to come in so i agreed , hoping that there was going to be a solution to this problem , after all , it just seemed like a simple error that needed correcting ( how mistaken was i )!
negative	0 windows incorrectly measured by surveyor ( one too big and one too small ).
neutral	delivery was stated as next_day 0am - 0pm , but i did not receive news of dispatch until 0pm with the recipient finally getting the bouquet at around 00pm .
negative	anyone_wishing to purchase from this retailer , should contact all of those customers who '_s reviews have been removed - contact trust_pilot to ask for the list .
positive	only ordered this giant front fender on sunday_evening , and it
positive	they were in constant touch keeping me updated .
positive	and it ' s a co in the uk .
negative	after waiting over an_hour for the text , i got a text_saying that they couldn ' t have my age checked therefore they were unable to provide me with my adult content pin number .
negative	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn ' t honour the delivery ?
neutral	i rarely use play anymore which is a shame .
positive	the tracking service is excellent as you can follow you parcel from the moment it leaves you until it arrives as it '_s destination .
neutral	if you are not careful you could also unwittingly sign up to membership of some stupid scheme which will rob your credit_card on a monthly basis until you notice it .
negative	we have been told for two days now that the mattress is being delivered " today ".
positive	excellent customer service .
neutral	not so simple to get a courier pick_up , so not great if you don ' t drive or aren ' t close to a drop_off .
negative	they packed 0 whiskas containers with a case of bozita cat_food .
neutral	for other products a good service , just need to watch the sell by dates as some are short !.
neutral	i had my order from german amazon handled by dhl and forwarded to parcelforce in the uk .
neutral	( to their credit , they were priced better_than some of the other 00 hour companies - and over half of those failed to return any calls at all .)
positive	i took it off gumtree and went into a corner to sulk for a while .
positive	i recommend acer direct to any potential customer , this a customer friendly company who are only too glad to assist in any_problems you may incur
positive	they managed to fit me in the next_day as i was in a bit of a pickle with 0 illegal tyres as they were worn bald on the inside edges .
neutral	however , each order ( i get 0 boxes of well an every 00 weeks ) comes with 0 - 0 free ' gifts ' ranging_from coasters and pens , to scissors and tape measures .
positive	this made it for me .
negative	there was no double_bed , only a day bed with a pull out bed .
negative	please if you find yourself in the unfortunate position to be already dealing_with this company , take pics of everything , do not accept any thing verbally , get yourself a good lawyer , dont expect your deposit back and do not expect any kind of customer service .
positive	well pleased .
positive	i ordered online but had to call to sort a paypal issue - the service was prompt and friendly and i was kept_informed_throughout .
positive	the staff are lovely and very helpful .
positive	i recently_purchased a dell multifunction laser_printer from printerland . co . uk .
negative	i hope people can see you for who you really are , but i hope more so that you see the error of your ways and change and have a good life .
positive	often , i receive free extra jewellery with my order !
negative	they get one star purely because - 00 stars is not an option .
positive	from the first moment i got in touch with kraft i was provided with an outstanding service and this continued right the way through until the final product was with me !
negative	00 pounds service fee ???
positive	i was delighted with the tickets i recieved for the ellie goulding gig that i go too on sunday
neutral	not my favorite airline but better_than some .
neutral	but then , as the ipod was bought from hmv , no one ' s name was on the receipt .
positive	one very happy customers :) thank_you very much !
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	i accept that text in the email suggests calling the fitting_centre which i failed to spot , but when completing the online order i was given the impression that in selecting the am appointment option , there was nothing else to do but turn_up .
negative	anyone can give less for less money .
negative	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
negative	rubbish
positive	part well_packed and works well .
neutral	although their telephone operators are very helpful , we had a problem with incorrect billing which i hope has now been sorted_out .
positive	really impressed with ease of use of the shopping_cart .
negative	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
neutral	will we end up losing money if the travel company stops replying ?
negative	the store manager refused stating that the products were clearly different as they had different product codes .
neutral	worse is that this time they ' ve given me a credit note rather_than just refunding what i ' ve paid which means that now i ' ve got to go through the hassle of getting them to send me a cheque / cashing it .
positive	thanks ,
negative	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
positive	delivery day as per first contact , regular phone_call up - dates to specific delivery time really good customer experience , and of course excellent price !
negative	these arms were replacements for the same arms , ordered from easygates 0 ( ish ) years previously .
positive	transparant in the way they display fees and charges
negative	so to sum up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren ' t deals at all and cost more_than face_value .
positive	the package contained products exactly as_described and they were well_packaged .
positive	would not_hesitate to use the company in future
negative	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don ' t know when you ' ll receive it .
positive	quick , affordable , reliable !
negative	looks_like i ' ve had the same experience as most on this site .
neutral	otherwise happy with the product ( you get what you pay for ) and the price was decent .
positive	great products , i always really enjoy looking through the myprotein site and choosing different supplements !!
negative	pp disputes need to be raised withing 00 days so that is the path i took .
negative	yesterday the 00th of may 0000 i had another appointment with a optomerist who said nothing can be done but he will make an_appointment for me to see the surgeon who performed the operation he also said my eyesight had greatly improved which is a lie these_people fob you off with excuses and try to make you believe your imagining things .
neutral	i am slightly disappointed that apple don_'_t have their customer_services sorted though , its the only thing that keeps them from 0_stars .
neutral	on that day , the delivery men phoned saying they would be with us within 00mins so my boyfriend left work to go wait .
negative	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
negative	they had had my device for over two and half months and nothing has_been done !
positive	i have now just bought some fuel and a failsafe from them and i have no doubts about it coming .
positive	the piece that i ordered was exactly as stated , it came within 0 days of ordering and fitted_perfectly .
neutral	ofl eventually processed the refund on 0th_june .
negative	when it arrived there was a rip on the side of the cushion on the chair and a gap between the two sections of sofa as well as stitching out and loose staples underneath .
negative	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
negative	had to go to a lawyer for business stream to even respond ( which they did the next_day when they saw the lawyers letter ).
neutral	i ended_up dealing_with three different people .
positive	it was the cheapest one i could find that looked half way decent so i was very happily suprised to have the best costume of the party .
neutral	?
positive	the choice is amazing and i will_certainly use them again .
negative	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0 weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn ' t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
neutral	i paid for a quick delivery and it arrived when expected .
neutral	took a wile for the items to be process and was told the chequ was on way but when it arrived it had a date that was 0 weeks after i was told it had been printed
positive	delivery was much_faster_than_anticipated 00_hours_later & the courier company did not have me waiting home all day , tyres arrived at 0 . 00am .
positive	onlinekeystore offers games cheaper_than other services that i ' ve found , and i can definitely_recommend it to others .
negative	and when i contacted ggf '_s compliance manager i was told there was nothing they could do .
positive	this company is so easy to use , efficient , and most of all alot more economical than royal_mail . quite a lot_cheaper_than the untracked quote from post_office . we got parcel collected on a day convenient for us , email with tracking_number , delivered to netherlands within 0 days . door to door service , without leaving front room . will_definitely_use again . a must for ebayer '_s with lots of parcels to go . brilliant service . thanks
positive	they ' ll look after you
neutral	i am yet so see if they are to prove a lot of people wrong and deliver the flowers i ordered on the due date of delivery .
negative	i guarantee you , wae_+ will not exist in 0 months time .
positive	!
positive	after making a purchase the battery was delivered 0 days_later .
negative	i know they have cos i know loads of people who have had their tickets in hand for ages .
negative	this isn ' t the first time this has happened and it ' s very frustrating to say the least .
neutral	i would ' ve tried to return it if their had been time and if their had been any other stock available .
negative	but after that phone call - their customer_service is awful !
positive	sincerely ,
neutral	( always being kept waiting for an operator ).
positive	i am greatly impressed with the promptness of the service and the fact that people at slr_hut did talk to me and helped_me change some aspects of the order after_placing it .
neutral	my product arrived quickly albeit packaged in a box when a small jiffy would have done the trick .
positive	it didn_'_t really work for my purposes but there was nothing wrong with the product and the delivery was fast and efficient .
negative	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service – beware !!
negative	may we take this opportunity to wish you a very happy new year .
negative	i can '_t even send a secure message to them .
neutral	eventually told on 00 / 00 by a cs lady that my order was overlooked and that she would chase it and get item despatched , and would send me an_email to confirm this .
positive	very efficient and organised ebayer to deal with .
negative	now both rooms are finished i have two a0 pages of things which are wrong ranging from a top not being square on the chest of drawers to a shelf which was supposed to pull out being fixed as static .
positive	steve clarke .
negative	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
positive	i wanted to order a * surprise * gift for the hubby , he is a guitarist though long since retired , he still enjoys playing for his own amusement ( and mine at times ) he had always wanted something he could record himself on , then play around with whatever musicians play around with ,, i had no_idea what to order so emailed gear0music directly explaining my dilemma , adding that it was a * for fun * gift so didnt want to pay too much , i had an answer and great advice with 00_hours , and have ordered said item , i dont_bother with the * quick * delivery as , living in northern_ireland , i know from experience the dates given for delivery can be outside those dates , i feel gear0music are being wrongly maligned re delivery dates , its the courier service to blame not this company , have used gear0music in the past and have no doubts will do so again !!
positive	is impeccably reliable , so much so that i don ' t need to go to the store at all .
negative	an_email was suggested but then she advised me that she wouldn_'_t pick it up till monday .
negative	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer_service representative then books me an_appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
neutral	i ordered a few items online and there was a good selection of products .
positive	all i have to do is arrange to meet them at the property and i can leave the rest to openrent .
negative	this is an awful company , please do not use .
positive	she gained a lot of knowledge .
negative	ouch !
neutral	i was really annoyed about this , especially so close to christmas but i just bombarded them with messages ( theres no customer care number ) - its worth_noting i didn ' t just use their customer care help box , i emailed them directly at ' customerhelp @ missguided . co . uk ' they are only open monday - fridays , normal working hours so don ' t expect a reply very quickly but i did get a reply within a couple of days and the money was instantly refunded .
positive	the camera was delivered a good deal sooner_than_expected with good communication and no money being taken prior to delivery .
negative	the nextday , the delivery day , i still hadnt received any email or any response from superfi , so i called them .
neutral	good product and no hassle with ordering .
positive	item as descibed .
positive	thanks .
negative	hollow_promises about how they are ' on the seller ' s side '.
negative	i placed my order on 00rd august ( 00 days ago ) 0 day delivery option .
positive	and a bit more given a quote but advised not to bother , cheaper to replace ,
negative	if it doesn ' t work the first time . its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
positive	their listing functions provide practical and cheap options which is great for me because i hardly need a 0 - star treatment for a 0 - 0 night stay .
positive	one item that i received was wrong , so i emailed and this was rectified immediately , and i had a replacement item sent , which i again received really quickly .
negative	i cant_believe it has taken 0 weeks longer then the other company to check not even a third of the total the other company checked .
positive	these geezers are well cool , decent prices , fast delivery , constant communication ' til the order arrives .
negative	and their status kept changing untruthfully saying i said .
negative	fees are higher and i heard now ebay own gumtree so i better shop on amazon .
positive	overall i am completely_satisfied with the service i recieved from this company and will_certainly use them again .
neutral	these " fake " reviews seem to come in batches with several all being posted on the same day ( and then gaps of sometimes weeks in between until the next " batch " is posted again )!
negative	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
negative	?
neutral	needed a shower_tray urgently as plumber arriving and discovered old tray cracked .
negative	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .
positive	i would definitely_recommend them to everybody looking to sell their old phone .
positive	great value for top_notch product , what more can you say ?
positive	the customer_service given by mara rose was excellent .
positive	the ordering system was simple to use and the free delivery was much_appreciated .
positive	confirmation page pops up and email is sent out .
negative	i would rather have my money back then actually receive the products .
neutral	services are just okay with tesco .
positive	have used multiple_times now , always get great service from them and will_continue to use them well into the future !
negative	they couldn ' t tell me why .
negative	ideal world was in my opinion very good and i have shopped with them before , don_'_t know what '_s gone wrong but until its sorted they won_'_t be getting my money again .
neutral	the customer toilets are at_least more wholesome , although still not serviced enough in my view .
negative	all they did was cancel my order with them .
neutral	just buy mobile_phone covers and stuff that don_'_t break that easily .
neutral	also every time i went to the local click and collect the staff were clueless i had to wait around for someone to come and deal with it then they kept getting my name wrong and even came down with someone_else ' s parcel .
neutral	i don_'_t know if once weight is removed that the shelves will " pop " out of their seating place .
negative	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
neutral	if the items are in stock , they are sent very fast .
positive	i shall reccomend without_reservation .
negative	poor , poor business skills .
negative	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too_late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
neutral	thanks all i can really say
positive	!
positive	i was rather ambivalent about the company as i had never_heard of however i could not resist the price difference , i made my order for wow : mists of pandaria .
neutral	after 00 months of use the tv is fine !
negative	i did not make the call , i have no_idea or interest who is on the other end of 000000 , what a con , needless to say once my credit runs out with giffgaff i will be putting another networks simcard in my phone and they won ’ t con any more money out of me .
negative	so the companies concerned : 000rackets . co . uk ; racketsrus . co . uk & tvrackets0u . co . uk will_continue to scam the uk public with their underhanded ; shoddy ; un - principled ways .
neutral	i was horrified that the tickets were more than double than the price on the tickets but cant_fault the service
neutral	i place an order for a 000 ultra plus car battery paying a small_amount extra for as clearly_stated on the web_page as a 0 year_warranty , and so my 000 ultra plus battery order was confirmed by alpha_batteries .
negative	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
negative	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
negative	i will avoid post_office at any cost and i will pay extra for a different company
negative	to allow them to resolve their mistake .
neutral	disappointed in the clear disparity between pixmania . co . uk and pixmania . ie ( uk site is unilaterally cheaper , offers package deals , and free postage ).
positive	i have used the sewing_machine and sew far so good !
neutral	no alternative was offered or an_apology .
neutral	he was so blasé with his attitude , he was approaching rude .
negative	merci à l ' inconnu qui ne nous a pas abandonnés à 0h00 du matin dans un aéroport sur_le point de fermer ( aéroport de funchal à madère le 00 mars )
neutral	so yeah , make of this what you will .
negative	calling the office at 000 warranted no explanation ' i can ' t see his schedule '.
negative	i find it hard to believe that i ' m not being_lied to as none of what i '_ve been told adds up .
negative	bought 0 strip lights via_ebay , the photo showed 0 tubes inside the lights , the description referred to " tubes " plural , therefore its acceptable and perfectly reasonable for me to rely_on the phot & description - which i duly did .
neutral	now i am feeling let_down and should have bought elsewhere .
positive	great service .
negative	but when you visit yodel directs web_page you have no obvious contact ?
neutral	the lady was very helpful and told me that the full_amount would be refunded to my card within 0 days and they would come and pick_up the tables in about 0 weeks .
positive	just a great service .
neutral	returns are pot luck but overall easy to use
negative	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
negative	during friday we received an_apology for not getting back on thursday and told that a senior technician would be with us between noon and 0pm this thursday to finish installation and rectify issues .
positive	smart excellent product which suits my needs for a table that accommodates two large printers .
neutral	as a result i only ordered the condor kit - order no .
negative	anyways , i called him up again asking where it was and being obviously slightly frustrated and wondering_why did he not contact me back to let me know what is going on and keep me informed .
neutral	i would not use them again despite_being a loyal_customer for many_years now .
negative	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails
negative	their prices are ridiculous , and their sales staff don_'_t know or care about the things they ' re meant to be selling .
negative	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
negative	the advice i was given was to refuse the package which would then be immediately returned to laura ashley then i would be refunded .
positive	i ' ve been shopping in divine_trash for years the staff are always friendly , helpfull , and full of advice their products are bang on trend and very good value for money never disappointed x
negative	i couldn ' t believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
neutral	so i ordered about 00 days ago and received a couple of my items to day , already from 0 different delivery people and with products still to come .
neutral	i ' ve had to spend a bit of money replacing strings and damages to guitar .
negative	bear in mind i hadn ' t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
positive	will be using again , would recommend both company and product .
neutral	e
positive	once we had her draft plans she made the suggestion that we use one of the 0000mm cupboards with drawers rather_than the two 000mm units with shelves we had originally selected .
positive	), however , echo genuinely seems to be one of , if not the , website offering the best deals .
positive	surprisingly efficient , trustworthy and accurate info thank_you kathy !
positive	ashley provides a first_class service - helpful and proactive .
neutral	dpd not only failed to deliver on three seperate dates but went on to lie about leaving calling cards and managed to lose the first order and only finally admitted they did not attend on arranged dates after three_weeks .
negative	do not buy from this company as you will regret it .
positive	i found the online ordering simple and easy to use .
neutral	eastenders is utter trife on the other hand , how on earth this crap is still broadcast is beyond me .
negative	i had 0 phones on a business contract with them .
neutral	!
positive	on top of that , the delivery time was astonishing .
neutral	also , maybe i ' m getting old but i ' d rather buy the cd ' s .
neutral	the call_center i assume based in india is hard work with the language barrier , especially if you have any query outside the norm .
negative	0 / 0 has_been unoccupied for at_least 0 months and nobody_else in the apartment block has my parcel !
positive	i was really impressed with the customer service .
neutral	this is unacceptable .
neutral	unfortunately i think this is basic , the possibility of change my address ( for billing or delivery ) and i will not buy at this shop until they change it .
positive	easy to order , great service and very good prices for the high_quality chairs !
neutral	on the day the fitter is due to appear , i get my 00_minutes warning of their attendance , however , when they arrive they have the wrong_size tyres and i would have to wait another 0 days , only after speaking to central operations can a manager from another area resolve the issue .
neutral	i don_'_t find tesco an enjoyable shopping_experience - large hangar like store with a muddled layout .
negative	i said that it may have been helpful to be informed when i purchased it there would be a gap but was told it would be assumed i knew that ( the one i sat on in the shop didn_'_t have one but was not a three seater ).
negative	the only positive thing is that i ' m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
negative	0 days_later clients asking me where their goods are .
positive	its still early days - we are not sure what results to expect but they were affordable which means staying on the treatment will be easy .
positive	why go anywhere_else
neutral	i got a new job a year later where i had to use citylink quite regularly and they are fantastic .
negative	further follow_up : the owner of the company continues to object to factual feedback left for his company .
positive	tsohost ' s customer_service is nothing short of amazing and is the best customer_service experience i ' ve had from any company , ever .
negative	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
negative	first and last holiday with alpharooms .
neutral	and yes the phone ended_up being officially unlocked but do not expect it in the time frame identified .
positive	:)
negative	i '_ve repeatedly stated that i received no correspondance what so ever in relation to my initial order , strangely , in english , this means that i received no correspondance what so ever from superfi in relation to my initial order , what part of that superfi dont get is beyond me .
negative	i submitted my first email to iflorist to find out where the flowers were , as the live_chat feature was offline .
positive	and well_packaged so no damage to the bottles of product inside .
negative	dyson actually searched around the internet for a part for me , called me to say there was a part in stock at espares . co . uk , so i went to the website , checked that it was definitely in stock and placed the order with an expected delivery date of 0 to 0 days .
positive	the price was better_than other_companies and i got an extra hex driver as well .
negative	i will keep it short ?
positive	package arrived promptly and well_packaged .
negative	overnight the fridge heat up & the freezer defrosted all the contents .
positive	extremely happy with my canon lx0 and the excellent service provided .
negative	do not trust that the box seems okay so the goods must be !
negative	its a woman this time with no passion at all picked_up the phone .
neutral	i had to call to get the order speeded up .
neutral	i phone photoworld and their reaction was almost disbelieving of me , as though it was my fault .
neutral	on friday_evening i received a text about the forthcoming date to assemble today 00th to text yes if ok or ring if a problem .
positive	from the onset our site was set_up ready to use , no hassle and no issues .
negative	a time was made , i would have to travel 00 miles in order for us to be together to make this call .
positive	ao . com were first_class .
positive	they phoned me after only having the car for one hour and said my car had passed the mot apart_from the indicator bulb which was the wrong_colour but they used their common_sense and just changed it there and then .
positive	they make is hassle_free and there is always support there when you need help .
neutral	scares me as a friend has booked us a holiday for nearly_£_000 !
neutral	faulty parts were exchanged quickly ( without too much hassle ).
negative	i was not informed that it was the wrong_address , i was informed that there was a delivery hitch your end and you would retry the following_day . why would you state to do that ?
negative	the windscreen washer bottle was not replenished .
positive	free delivery !
neutral	although it arrived in one peace , and really it comes down to the individuals experience .
negative	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
negative	i would give lower if possible .
neutral	or teach yourself a modular system like joomla or drupal .
positive	i also own a head torch which in my opinion cannot be_beaten at the price point .
neutral	recently i noticed that my account had reached the sending limit in which i had to verify my account to continue to send and receive money but i couldn ' t register my bank_account because the details were in use by my old account that i deleted almost 0 years_ago !
positive	as i like to have lots of clothes i can_afford to do this by shopping at primark , just a shame norwich is always so messy , but now kings_lynn have a branch and thats lovely .
positive	i believe i am one of the first people in the country to get the g0 , and at a cracking price . very well_done bestcameras .
positive	absolutely_brilliant .
neutral	for a coat , it is laughably thin - i don ' t know which part of china the tailors are based in ( and it definitely is china according to my parcel and tracking_details ) but they clearly don ' t suffer winters there , this coat wouldn ' t keep you warm in the tropics .
negative	do not use this company . you pay for the goods get the voucher then nothing arrives . well and truly conned
positive	i will_definitely be shopping on this site again !
neutral	we have rcently returned from an all_inclusive holiday booked through travel_republic , and although everything_went_smoothly as far as organisation goes , we were not informed about the hotel being populated almost exclusively by aging spanish holidaymakers .
neutral	i had bought a shirt along with a £_00 camisole to go underneath .
positive	the other 0 %, supplement_warehouse wins the game with their 0 % price_match .
neutral	the 0 pint mugs they send you are amazing though , wouldn ' t be without one from now on !
neutral	on the day of delivery i was given a two hour_slot , but unfortunately the driver could not manage that and arrived 00_minutes late .
positive	will_definitely use again .
negative	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre . we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
positive	i ' ll take a private_room for the same price as a hostel dorm any day !
positive	however , the price was cheaper elsewhere .
positive	would thoroughly_recommend the kensington tea company for any loose - leaf tea related purchase in the future !
negative	basically , you get a sheet of settings and then you ' re on your_own .
neutral	i wished it stated the shelf_life before you order .
negative	i have ordered some after shave from this site , every time i called to ask where it has got to i got a different answer .
positive	!
neutral	=)
neutral	for - very fast broadband ( at a price )
positive	let ' s give them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0 weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
negative	i was sent all over the world to call_centres that i couldn_'_t understand and only seemed to be able to work from a set of rules in a robotic manner .
positive	two days after_placing my order it arrived and it is absolutely fantastic .
neutral	!
positive	animed_direct is a really good for any pet / animal owners / lovers to use .
negative	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone call stating they will be cancelling my items !
neutral	paula
positive	great , will use again for sure .
positive	great car advice
neutral	i no_longer buy anything from amazon that is delicate or fragile and is likely to get damaged in the post .
positive	however , i would say its well_designed and the sample player is really good , so if there was no beatport , i would happily use juno . its cheaper too !
positive	they have some good deals specially with ups .
neutral	i wrote to customer service but never got answer from them .
negative	the company are still selling vouchers
neutral	the tracking_number never arrived but my goods did eventually turn_up , a week after purchase was made .
neutral	ok so cw can offer deals you wont find direct from your network_provider .
neutral	their reply to what you said was that you gave me completely incorrect_information as they will keep manufacturing spare_parts for my specific machine until 0000 !
neutral	if not won ' t be using this company again and will instead source my products locally .
neutral	i bet that if i went through the process of returning it , their engineer would find no fault with it as i have read on other review_sites so i think i will just swallow my loss .
neutral	0 ) once you place an order for a gamekey , through paypal , a message is sent to your email which you then follow prompts through to their site .
positive	i '_ve used my hermes for sending birthday and christmas parcels to my family for some time now , ever_since royal_mail put their prices up to a ridiculous high .
negative	there are 0 cable hole covers missing , they have made an access hole in one unit to allow access to a power socket and have cut it with wavy sides just like an diy person might do , there is most of a large bar_code label still stuck onto the front of a cupboard , one screw has_been screwed in and split the veneer .
negative	neither day has it come .
negative	my gran ( age 00 ) lives in a multi - storey block of flats .
neutral	i glad i did that because they do briliant service and i cannot say about you .
neutral	the products are branded and worth money .
negative	the service has been terrible and i feel_like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
positive	i found lindy '_s online store and the product in no time .
positive	good vitamins at a sensible price , plus my delivery arrived in 0 days .
negative	i ordered product from easygates and the delivery was fine .
positive	i bought a pinocchio outfit for my daughter to wear for book day at school , was a bit_worried that it wouldn_'_t turn_up on time and may be too small but it arrived just in time and fitted_perfectly .
positive	i wasn_'_t sure about using an internet company i had not heard of but they had the model i wanted at a good price and feedback was good
positive	so pleased , we ordered 0 so wear one and wash one !
neutral	having done this , i had to chase them up again to get confirmation whether they ' d received them .
positive	always the first place i check when buying cosmetics / perfumes for myself or presents .
negative	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .
negative	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
neutral	a ' technician ' was sent out late in february - it is very difficult to get a response from the company - who declared irreparable .
negative	prices were to be lower that bt (£ 00 . 00 per_month with bt ) over £_00 . 00 per_month when we asked to cancel they wish to charge £_000 . 00 cancellation_fee and now they again say they offer better prices than bt .
neutral	i have tried almost every vacuum_cleaner . is dyson , kirby , siemens , the results after using the ram air is astounding to the point of embarrassment . without_doubt a 0 * product .
neutral	but the quality of delivery was awful .
positive	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
neutral	this was not to be on this occasion to my disappointment i was informed two days_later that the hotel was no_longer available for the dates booked and that my deposit was to be refunded .
negative	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	when the goods were not delivered i googled & saw all the bad feedback .
neutral	not sure what to do as this wasn_'_t cheap and i need this plan for servicing etc .
negative	absolutely_shocking .
negative	i struggle to find signal which is ever good enough to have a quality phone conversation or quick internet .
negative	it is already over 0 months now and i still did not receive the refund .
positive	i bought these mics from reidys music shop and wow they are just the job ,, i have a lot of trust with these_guys and this is why i plan on shopping with these for good . ive bought a gretsch country gent ,, tascam 0000 neo track recorder , and now these mics . all from reidys music . and they are always there to give you an hand with anything you want to know . thankyou guys
neutral	i guess for some the 0 %_off is a no - brainer .
negative	total £_000 .
negative	it was delivered broken .
negative	the domain is still off line while they are
negative	absolutely nothing so to hell with them .
positive	better_than any company i have dealt_with !
negative	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn ' t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
positive	their customer service is excellent - they actually call at the time you ask them to and know what they ' re talking_about !
negative	and it has been concluded that as of now , i have no contract , no rights to either my ee or t mobile contract .
negative	of course this was not a problem with the very latest releases , they were perfectly viewable in full screen but anything by an indie film studio or anything older than 0000 just did not work in full screen .
positive	the team was excellent the trainers martin .
neutral	both had been accidently offering items which were out of stock .
neutral	first_class delivery was stated my package was coming by but three days after dispatch my goods had still not arrived .
neutral	- ve - poor customer service , e_mailed 0 times after part went missing , only replied once
negative	lets_see how that goes then !
negative	why would i want one of those .
negative	they have assured me i will get my money and they will get it back fro se .
negative	i chose frames then had a fitting .
negative	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
negative	we '_ve fought with them for compensation since may and have finally had to admit defeat , accepting a miserly payment of £_000 for a holiday that cost us in excess of £ 0000 .
negative	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
negative	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance . now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
neutral	when you ring them they dont care .
negative	i think we can also guess at why there are so many reviews that have been deleted .
neutral	i purchased this one in particular as i preferred the gold over the yellow , if i ' d have known i could have got the same costume ten_pounds cheaper elsewhere online however it ' s not worth sending it back for a return over a tenner .
neutral	i was offered a very small compensation for the delay , however wasn ' t really enough to compensate for the huge inconvenience as i needed the calculators for when class started .
negative	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
negative	if you are starting on this exciting new hobby then i would strongly_advise going elsewhere if you are likely to need after_sales advice .
negative	no way would i use this company again
neutral	finger '_s crossed i never need to send it back for repair .
positive	hopefully they will soon expand their dog range and i will buy even more .
positive	that set_up the whole family and had a great day , for just £_00 .
positive	amazon review
positive	i had to try this website since i ' ve heard a lot of good things about it and the reviews look great :_d
negative	do not trust this company , 0 months waiting for a part , 0 email 0 weeks_ago to say part was " in transit " where from the far side of the bloody galaxy ?
neutral	i ordered these flowers for my nans birthday , i did order them over the easter_weekend so this may be why i had issues , however a well_established company should be able to anticipate and adapt during busy_periods of the year .
negative	0 .
positive	works like a dream , so fast , thanks mr_memory
positive	still , i will_continue to do_business with rfx .
neutral	expensive , but good service
negative	this is a cowboy firm what the quote on line is not the price at the airport you think you have paid all the access but it doubles at the airport
positive	v quick delivery .
neutral	like everything with screwfix just a shame i got to travel seventeen miles to a store
positive	i managed to insure a smart phone and iphone 0 and two tablets for much less_than the individual costs of insurance .
neutral	i emailed and did get a very quick reply stating they were waiting for the prescription and included the address where i should send it to .
positive	this had a real benefit to my wife who has limited movement in her knees and the advantages are being reaped now that the units have been installed .
negative	so how long would they have left it before calling me and offering to return my money ?
negative	firtsly , i realised i had made a mistake on the message , e_- mailed interfflora within minutes of the purchase to ask if the message could be rectified ( there was an extra letter at the end of a name ) and was told this wasn_'_t possible even_though the flowers and message were to be delivered in a week '_s time .
neutral	i ts a shame that the finish is rough because otherwise it would have been a great picture .
neutral	unfortunately , i took_advantage of the ' cheap ' car_hire promotion on the jet0 booking site - with excellent pricing - and the promise of fully comprehensive insurance .
neutral	well , the tracking states :
positive	sufficient instructions ( btw very easy to install ).
neutral	00 / 0 / 00 i am sending my third claim first_class today so i am expecting the money to be paid on the 00th of june .
neutral	it remains to be seen of course when / whether i will receive my replacement bedside table , but i am now feeling a little more confident than i was previously .
positive	well folks , there you have it .
positive	i made quite a number of calls to robin and steve .
negative	do not use .
neutral	one failed within the 0 year_guarantee period .
negative	i ' ll also make_sure to pass on to everyone i know to never use your services
neutral	however the goods were not dispatched for a week and no explanation was offered , i had to chase them using their premium_rate phone numbers sometimes being left on hold for over 0 minutes . i will not use them again if the goods are available elsewhere .
neutral	this equated to a further two days off work .
positive	parcel picked_up from north of scotland on the monday and arrived in cyprus on the friday .
neutral	autoglass need more technichans in london plus the online booking system is not live as i had looked at it and it had said there was appontments available in london but the call_centre people said that was not correct and a 0 week wait was typical .
positive	would highly_recommend them to anyone .
positive	thanks alot :_d
neutral	in the end i know its helped_me and yes i would use the service again .
positive	the price was the most competitive around , even cheaper_than amazon .
neutral	product is of excellent quality .
positive	easy searching , simple purchase process and you can collect nectar_points .
negative	i tried_contacting the merchant , and they were helpful enough to inform me that they have not received any call / email / contact whatsoever regarding this issue from wowcher .
negative	would never use again .
negative	the day before replacement tickets were sourced .
neutral	i also wanted my purchase to be a surprise , had the table been delivered at the same time this would have been a success however it was a complete fail and none of this was explained to me at the time of ordering or at the time of arranging delivery .
positive	the prices are very reasonable and the work is of a higher quality .
neutral	time to abandon ship ?
negative	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo . how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
neutral	in november , while we were in sarasota having re - booked , we received a refund for the original flights , one quarter of the actual cost after being told we would receive a full_refund .
neutral	its has now been 0 weeks since the dresses were supposedly delivered , i have still not received them or heard from anyone in the customer_services department .
neutral	when that gets sorted the other_networks will have a real fight on their hands .
neutral	offer a range of postage options which are more secure and reliable than royal_mail - you can_afford to do this if you are significantly_cheaper .
negative	the items were not sent through national post they were sent through a courier service , i assume because they were expedited through their 0 - 0 day shipping option ( but the cheaper shipping wasn ' t an option as my order was worth over $_00 ).
neutral	sometimes things come through bang on time but as it ' s a shared pot of keys if you ' re not fast you ' ll have to wait_until more are uploaded .
negative	nothing worked so i went back to simplyelectronics and reported the problem .
negative	be warned before you buy from this company .
neutral	very small amount of flowers and when they arrived a couple of them had the heads hanging off where they hadn ' t been handled correctly - disappointed after using this service before and getting a good quality present .
negative	secondly i have paid for voucher for a set of 0 swan saucepans with a 00 piece cutlery set but when i try to place my order they are trying to charge me another £_00 for the cutlery .
negative	i think they were trying to delay things until a paypal ' claim time ' expired .
positive	ill be ordering again soon .
negative	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
positive	items were sent out quickly and well_packed , no_complaints from me .
positive	my younger daughter has since bought one ( different firmness ) and is very , very happy with it .
neutral	).
negative	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
positive	it ' s very easy to make a booking here .
negative	the reviews are clearly fake and genuine customer won ' t rate company when the provide such a poor service .
positive	great service !
neutral	instant purchases : you might wait up to two days to purchase an item after putting in a ' demand '
neutral	good product though , fast delivery .
negative	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
negative	00km '_s north of hurghada on egypt '_s red sea .
positive	only small order but very quick in delivering .
neutral	i find the quality of the fresh produce not very good - fruit often rock hard or gently rotting .
neutral	the driver was eventually persuaded to continue after a twenty minute delay .
neutral	surely it should not be possible to leave any feedback for a seller until he / she has left it for the buyer . unless of course there is no payment from the buyer which should mean negative_feedback can be left by the seller after a week for exampl
neutral	i wish they would have told me that by the 00th and i would have looked around for another replacement .
neutral	but , you ' re there to have a ' good time ', and your friends are looking on , and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn ' t get a drink .
negative	late charges added when i was disputing the estimated bills .
neutral	great site , but was terribly let_down by quote i accepted , a no show !
neutral	today i found i was unable to login to trustpilot .
positive	i also used the next_day delivery service as i needed it for a train journey to scotland i left my house at about 00 :_00am and it arrived just as i had left , however it still fulfilled its agreement to get here before twelve , again i am happy with this service .
neutral	i paid over £_000 for my elderly_parents to stay at premier_inn , dover , as they were too tired to continue with their journey home .
negative	purchased a tablet online last_night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
neutral	but the price was the cheapest on the web which was a plus
positive	they even come with free greetings card and postage .
negative	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
neutral	however , when i opened a support ticket to find out about the release_date i had a default response with no date , only a note to tell me to look at the product page .
positive	great product just right for our need , we needed a trophy for our allotment flower and veg .
neutral	explaining this and the fact that packing up is a lengthy task , i asked whether there was any flexibility in the 00 . 00 checkout ( something which has not been a problem with previous holiday and hotel bookings ).
positive	the place smell and look like new , everything so clean and been taking care . its amazing !!
neutral	in this day and age this is simply unacceptable practice .
positive	i have a few friends who have used ebuyer for a number of years too , and i ' ve only heard good things about ebuyer from them too .
positive	we bought tickets for a second time from double 0 .
positive	can '_t say any better_than that .
negative	can you give me the telephone_number for xdp as there is none on their website ?"
positive	glasses0you are a great company , they have a great selection off glasses to choose from , something for everyone .
neutral	they took time to try and work out their mistakes but later on that day i received another phone call apologising profusely and promising that i would have the total original_quote in my account within a matter of days as the transaction had already been sent .
negative	fees everywhere even if you decide to end the item without a bid earlier
negative	i felt really weird as it never happened before .
neutral	i know that people who bought tickets on the official tml side will maybe offer their tickets here but how can we buy ticktes at the same time ?
neutral	i would give them another chance though .
negative	still_haven ' t received order .
positive	very easy to use website - makes the act of sinning with a dirty takeaway even more effortless .

positive	ordered a phase 00 on the thursday and by friday it was sitting comfortably next to my big muff .
neutral	personally i wouldn_'_t want to do_business with this type of deal which is very close to a scam .
neutral	disappointed with customer_care - maybe the tech team should add that you must add a land - line telephone_number when using the ' checkout ' service if you have used a ' free ' email account and ' mobile ' number .
positive	the order was placed , confirmation received and the money arrived a couple of days_later , thank_you .
negative	mp0 player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !

neutral	i know that the weather was bad in france over christmas but i feel that a delay of over a week is unacceptable .
neutral	the only problem is that the liner cannot stay in the same position against the rear of the seat when the seats are folded flat compared to when they are upright ( this is explained in the instructions ).
positive	i will_definitely_use parcel to go again and will recommend others to use it too .
neutral	the hour hand had extremely bad and noticeable scratches over it , im presuming from mishandling during a service - not what i was expecting to see after a £ 0000 + sale and after_reading on the site how their quality_control is so strict .

neutral	generally i really like the food and the professional service when i can get it and would recommend harvester to friends and family , however it is hit and miss if you can get these .
negative	then the next_day , no email confirmation for when the courier was picking the item from the depot .
neutral	one snapped whilst assembling it second broke a week_later whilst trying to put shoes on it so now down to one thankfully purchased with the 00_%_off otherwise would have been very annoyed if id payed the original price of £_00 . 00 each would not recommend to anyone .
neutral	overall , ok considering price but won ' t be using again , will pay the little extra for the local butchers .
positive	overall excellent service & prices .
positive	however , i made a tiny mistake when i made the booking so i had to call their customer_service up and i found out that their office is actually based in philippines .

negative	purchased a blu_ray on 00 october .
positive	i also find their prices are almost always cheaper_than hostelworld ' s .
neutral	i waited in all day for this .
negative	they waffled on in bad english about something , which did not make sense .
neutral	wern '_t told about any major road rules , but there didn_'_t appear to be any .
neutral	so a cautious warning to all that read , great prices , great drivers but the office policy could sour future customer_relations if the drivers don ' t get some basic tools back on the van to deal with situations like mine .
positive	they gave me the opportunity to see someone i have wanted to see for years .
positive	the seat is perfect for taking a break or even just for sitting in the garden after pulling out some weeds .
neutral	i reminded her that she should give me a refund because there is nothing more that can be done to rectify the problem .
positive	my husband and i ' ve been using supplements for quite some time , we kept pouring money into it until we found you guys .
positive	i tried bing for some time as i liked their picture change every day etc .
neutral	i explained that from my perspective i am your customer and you have chosen to use this courier not me !
positive	this isn ' t particularly_useful as you can ' t track recorded_delivery , you can only confirm delivery .
neutral	this doesn ' t make up for the fact that they choose to operate their general customer support call_centre overseas .
neutral	the tv , after many calls and being_fobbed_off and lied to by their delivery person , was over nighted by courier which originally they told me they did not want to do because equipment usually gets damaged by courier , arrived safe and sound .
neutral	the jeans i buy from here , stretch .
negative	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .
neutral	i found a telephone_number on this website in an old review .
neutral	price was good compared to other_places , and still a better experience than sitting around in a cold waiting room for an age .
negative	they don ' t seem to understand whats happened and apparently this is my fault .
neutral	i was getting ready to answer the call but the call never came .
neutral	there are far better online made - to - measure tailor companies out there i have used which make a far_superior product with no need for customer_service interaction at all .

neutral	something not quite right ?
negative	total_con !
positive	easy , no booking_fee , fast , and friendly - that ' s why i use hostelbookers for already more_than 0 years from now .
positive	sadly only 0 bags left .
neutral	it is a relatively good value for money but equipments are old and changing rooms need some update / frequent cleaning !
neutral	i also presumed that it would be like getting insurance quotes , put all the details in and it would pop up with the quotes and you would pick the one you wanted , so i guess i was disappointed that after putting my details in it just told me 0 companies would get back to me .
negative	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
negative	no safe , dirt all around , no en suit facilities - had to share communal bathroom .
neutral	was once told their system automatically sends these e_- mails when they do something on their end , regardless of whether the item is there or not .
positive	have used villaplus five or six times now and from booking , through documentation , through the holiday , to coming home , i would not entrust my holiday to any other company .
neutral	it can be buggy , a lot of the time .
positive	good products and service at a great price
neutral	my order kept on saying pending and suddenly one day it was delivered .
positive	when asked to call back in 0 months away , they did exactly that .
neutral	advertised my tickets for mrs browns boys and got them sold , great but still have not received payment for said tickets .
neutral	maybe . but would suggest asking any and all questions before sealing the deal .
negative	i presume that they dream up a number ranging from £_000 to who_knows what and that is how they price their jobs .
positive	delivered on time by a great delivery driver , very knowledgable and a nice guy too .
negative	monday 00th , 0 weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
negative	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
neutral	!
positive	!
neutral	the assistants don_'_t seem as well_trained as when tesco first started expanding , often continuing a conversation with a colleague whilst scanning .
neutral	unfortunately on our second visit to the beacon , the service was disgraceful , we had a different waitress who was very rude , literally ' slamming ' the plates down on our table when our food was brought out .
neutral	as an example , i collect fountain pens .
positive	i will order from boohoo for forever !
negative	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
negative	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
positive	and tracked through dpd giving an accurate eta .
negative	after the time_frame was exceeded and i had inquired why my phone was still locked the time_frame was extended to 0 - 0 days .
neutral	a shopping a shopping_experience
positive	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else for my white goods now .
negative	i am_currently awaiting some more information from the courier , unfortunately until i get this response i cannot advise any further .
negative	back to tesco for me - the quality may be lacking but at_least you get to eat !
neutral	it would seem their database is not maintained properly .
neutral	delivery was carefully planned and happened , as agreed .
neutral	goods delivered well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i imagine this is because trustpilot are leaders in a new market , and that the price will come down over time as new competitors emerge
neutral	the service offered is reliable and prompt .
negative	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
negative	they said they would email me details and send out the iphone .
neutral	plus points :
negative	therefore i '_ve canceled my subscription .
positive	my pans still look brand_new actually everything i have bought does .
neutral	we were suggested as liars on 0different times and my mother was basically called a thief !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	as there was no movement on the tracking since the 00th i was told after 00_hours of no movement it would be classed_as lost .
negative	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
negative	first off , they don ' t believe you .
negative	ths
negative	who would ?
negative	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
negative	i have used ryanair twice and on both_occasions i found the service to be unacceptable even for a bargain airline .
positive	i will_certainly be buying again from them again .
positive	thanks for some splendid mitts and faultless service
negative	i realised the mistake as soon as i received my confirmation emauil , not the tickets , just a confirmation of payment .
positive	they ' re that good .
neutral	upon pitching , i realised it had 0 holes in the groundsheet - i rang up the 0000 number and the women asked me to take photos and email them across .
positive	both times they offered a quality product , fast efficient srevice , easy to contact and were helpful .
neutral	although , i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything of a product that is hard to manufacture cheap because you would usually find that vitacost products range somewhere in between very low - high_quality .
positive	in summary product & service were second to none .
neutral	it took over two months but finally have an unlocked 0s today .
positive	really pleased with the excellent and prompt service .
negative	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
positive	cant_fault the price but if i am being a bit picky its a shame they didn_'_t knock off the vat which doesn_'_t apply to deliveries in the channel_islands .
negative	my wife and i bought a renault koleos from this company and had nothing but grief with it for 0 0 / 0 yrs .
positive	overall easy and efficient experience , would recommend .
positive	not like the generic emails most company ' s send out as a response .
neutral	so its a case of roulette as with most experiences .
neutral	they are alright but sometimes they take_advantage when grading the device .
negative	you suck !
negative	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
neutral	i am flying to belgium at the 00th of july and i really want to have the tickets than !!
positive	i use click fragrance for all my aftershave and eau_de toilette purchases , i can always find what i want at the best prices available anywhere and their delivery service is free and very fast .
neutral	it took until wednesday for a representative to get back to me regarding one of the items being out of stock , and that if i was willing to go for the alternative option i could have it within_00hours which was absolutely fine by me as that would be friday .
positive	this was great - i managed to get the new iphone , on the day of release , without having to queue for hours at the apple_store !
neutral	customer_service a bit of pain .
negative	also i would like to say that in my opinion alpharoom clients are given the inferior accomodation that hotels would not offer to guests paying the full price .
positive	he was professional and extremely friendly .
negative	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
negative	no sleep at this place . yes you can get your money back but i could have slept in the car and got more sleep
positive	ordered new boiler less_than 00_hrs ago . just been delivered !
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .
neutral	a decent place to introduce your taste buds to fiery indian fare .
negative	will_definitely not be using them again .
negative	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
neutral	even if the prices are low , it would be nice to have
neutral	down points .
negative	do not go near this company !
negative	stay_away at all costs !
negative	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
neutral	my order said there was an issue and it was undeliverable .
negative	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn ' t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
positive	very happy about my experience with them .
neutral	so i thought maybe order was not placed ( since didnt get any confirmation_email ), and i replaced another order .
negative	oh and if you ever need to phone them - be prepared to wait and wait and wait on hold - poor service
neutral	why offer this and then not send it .
positive	so when you click , make_sure the button says dealchecker - it '_s the best on the net !
negative	they dont reply to your emails either .
positive	the service was prompt , flexible and extremely professional .
positive	i just bought a product from them that was on sale to $ 0 . 00 , it was $_00 . 00 !
negative	i could understand a company not being_able to upgrade the masses early but would have thought a company like orange would have some insight_into the segmentation of their customer base and make concsious decisions which have been well thought out to protect their longer term customer base and profits rather_than short_term out lay cost of an upgrade .
positive	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
positive	excellent service and the vanilla_pods are better_than i have ever seen - lovely aroma & so moist not forgetting a brilliant price .
neutral	ryan_air is good if you follow the rules to the point and do all they require .
positive	thankyou very much !
neutral	you refused to accept this and i have to say as i ' m a new customer and this is my first purchase with you , it has made me think_twice about shopping with you in future .
positive	booking your hostel of choice is very simple and can be done in a few_clicks .
neutral	or why should i wat till 0 days before the festival ?
neutral	we did return for a third time but once we realised the same waitress was on duty again and appeared to be as sultry as when we had been in the previous time we just stayed for a drink , cancelled our table and ate elsewhere .
positive	good product , good price , quick delivery .
positive	got a fender stratocaster and a ibanez hollow body ( which i bought there ) set_up .
neutral	0 .- the guarantee terms are not clear or transparent , dont say nothing about some third_party software of comon use like malwarebytes free , and dont say nothing about the people who dont live on usa
neutral	very frustrating experience but credit where it is due , they are trying to put things right now .
positive	i set out to build a custom_pc , for simulations and extreme graphics performance .
negative	yes i got tablets for my poor cat mac , he is very nervous and eating himself and his fur , but sadly the tablets i purchased form this site just didn_'_t work in fact since taking them he has almost stopped eating ,
negative	so be warned the service charge is a levy applied for the privilege of receiving such a sterling ' customer service experience '.
negative	after 00_mins waiting in the line , which i expected already , i got to the line with another customer representative .
negative	i am still_waiting for something , anything , to happen .
negative	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
positive	this worked out much cheaper_than hiring a van ourselves and we wouldn ' t hesitate to use them again in the future .
neutral	unless you want to help the one man they send carry if from the van and upstairs by yourself .
positive	couldn ' t ask for anything more .
neutral	we '_ve been with seiretto for around 0 years but will be moving away soon .
negative	then , i used the " forgot password " link , also failed .
positive	:)
neutral	we have been with virgin for years because we just cannot get the same broadband service elsewhere but if i am being honest i find their tele vision packages really expensive when you compare their charges to everyone elses even after taking into account loyalty discounts .
neutral	judi
negative	i sent numerous_emails and tried_ringing but to no_avail this went on for a few_days eventually i got an answer from someone i told them i wanted my ipad back immediately he tried to say it wouldn_'_t be returned yet but i kicked off told him it was my property and wanted it back he then turned around and said i would have it back by two days time .
negative	so frustrating .
negative	all costs money , fees , taxes , queue jumping , luggage ( 00 £ for 00kg !!!)
neutral	i have just booked a week in magaluff in august hoping nothing go ' s wrong after seeing all the bad comments !
positive	however , more sceptical organisers may be uncomfortable doing this .
neutral	the second rads are fine and the e_- mail route to customer_services works well .
positive	the person i spoke to was most helpful and helped_me get the right setup .
negative	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
neutral	i will order from them again however .
negative	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
positive	good price on items and very fast delivery and great communication re despatch etc .
neutral	just before 0pm ( lee had said he would have done the whole job in one day if all the parts were available ) wally told me he had finished and i could take a look .
negative	this prompted them to then send an_email about delayed delivery .
negative	i found this strange , so they investigated further and they found that the number for ee has been terminated and my t - mobile has been active .
positive	how they manage to do it i don_'_t know !
negative	said item was not in stock , so he would refund the money straight_away .
positive	- thank_you .
negative	so far so good .
positive	opened the box , had a question . phoned the company
positive	i have flown with ba several_times and still have yet to be dissapointed
negative	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
positive	a +!
positive	awesome tour company !
positive	simply the best and better_than all the rest supplementwarehouse .
positive	i was quite impressed by this service and the quality of the goods once received .
negative	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
neutral	but try contacting these_guys !
neutral	fick idag ett mail som erbjöd mig 00_% rabatt och fraktfritt .
negative	i usually rely_on this months holiday to get my garden and paddocks in order for the autumn , but as the mower has_been unusable for the whole of august , i had no chance of doing it .
positive	ordered a selection of item and very pleased with stock available and how quickly items were dispatched and delivered .
neutral	tom was what customer_services should be across the board with the rest of the team - so . invest in training and use tom as an example of existing good practice !
neutral	will think_twice about using in the future as certainly expected better given the reviews .
positive	this is the third time i '_ve used this company and i will_continue to do so any time i want to send flowers .
neutral	you ' ll either strike it rich or wish you ' d never bothered .
negative	this is a terrible comany .
positive	only let_down is , it can take time for it to be delivered over however that cannot be helped due to the company being in guernsey & me being in london .
neutral	this is in two parts - yesterday '_s and today '_s experience - read on :
neutral	first_impressions - brilliant .
positive	i have been telling everyone about trophy_store .
negative	the worst company i have ever known !!!
neutral	!
positive	the shop has so much to choose from and the staff are very helpful , they give you all the information you need and an all_round well_mannered , great service from the whole team .
negative	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know_whats going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
negative	0 weeks before the event i started calling to be reassured that i was gonna get the tickets on time .
positive	from ringing up to enquire to the people who came to fit it i had excellent service .
negative	so i sent a message via their contact form on the website not realising i would have to wait 00_hours for a reply !
negative	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to £_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
positive	the whole wonderful experiencel starts with the brilliant , easy to follow website .
negative	talking to [_name_removed_] is a joke as she knows nothing .
negative	!
positive	i thoroughly_recommend concept blinds to anyone reading this review because you will get good service , quality goods at a very reasonable price .
positive	i would estimate there is a profit in there for the administrators but not as much as you might think .
positive	i willmost definitely use this service again .
positive	ok , not difficult but also not something which is so easily managed by most businesses today , it just needs that bit of personal care and attention which quatropi provided .
positive	delivery into account .
negative	they obviously do not need the business .
negative	!
positive	the delivery was almost instantaneous and it worked .
negative	on gumtree it '_s a free for all where there are no rules and potential buyers have a free reign .
positive	i also had to put my cat with allergies back onto a prescription diet this order was also received the following working day by city_link less_than 00_hours after the order was placed !
neutral	the deal is that flubit offers to set them up with you , the customer , on the condition that they beat the price you ' ve seen it for .

neutral	support can be long_winded and pricey .

positive	one of the best online experiences i have come_across with excellent communication to any questions .
neutral	received a phone_call to say my order had been processed but it seemed more about trying to sell me some toner than anything_else .

neutral	please do not use this company there products are awful .
neutral	it is unfair to the haulier who has problems pricing .

neutral	all in all ok but could do better .
neutral	as previously mentioned , my husband lost a day ’_s holiday from work which i understand you usually compensate with £_00 , i had to take an additional day ’_s leave so what do we get for the downright rudeness of your employee wally and the incompetence of your surveyor ?
positive	we have had several chairs from this company .
neutral	not sure if i will order from them again due to this .
neutral	but maybe that is expecting too much , maybe i have been spoiled by other_retailers .

neutral	took 0 days to pick & post & 0 days to deliver .
negative	so i said yes , and then i try to start the contract from scratch with some lady that had a very difficult to understand foreign accent , and she was so rude !
negative	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty_goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
positive	keep up the good work !
neutral	have sent several emails about the item i bought as_described in good condition but arrived in quite bad condition and have never had any response and ended_up sending item back and still have had no response .
neutral	i keep meaning to leave but keep forgetting :-(

negative	i received another phone call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked . and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
neutral	you could have earned all 0_stars if that was the case - sorry .
negative	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an_email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
negative	they said i must pay £_000 . 00 , but would not say why .
neutral	i love this website i have used it several_times and each time same great service .
negative	was the part really , truly , in stock when i ordered .
neutral	you also have to be careful of the caveats .
neutral	so kind of disappointed at the moment but the bands them are great and a nice price .
negative	same_thing happens .
negative	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer_service much_better .
positive	great to speak to someone who can recognize that someone may have individual requirements .& who can show they have all possible information on their product right from source of manufacture .
neutral	chased with calls but blown off .
neutral	me - ( somewhat stunned ) ' ok , thanks '.

negative	ohhhh nooooo - not with these_guys .
negative	he is unable to organise , or expedite anything .
neutral	luckily i had kept the old ram and returned it but if i hadn ' t i would have paid for their mistake !
neutral	i opted to go for you guys because i could choose the day i wanted it on and luckily i already had a day booked off work so i could wait in for it , however it would have been nice if the driver could have just called on the day of delivery to give an eta - it ' s not that hard , plenty of other_companies do it , and so should you to make your company better .
negative	stay well away from them !
negative	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
positive	great prices and fast_shipping .
positive	i can '_t say enough how good this person was in helping me not only to find the right product , but when i found something that suited me even better , they changed my order and refunded the difference .
neutral	website was easy to use and my items arrived quickly .
positive	very pleased with the service .
negative	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .

positive	all together easy experience .
neutral	still bad phone line but managed to explain my problem and got an_appointment booked to go into clinic not where i had my procedure .
neutral	my partner and i had one each , but couldn_'_t face the third , so asked if we could either have a cold one , or return it for a partial_refund .
negative	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
positive	when it comes in shopping online there is no better place than amazon , they have all the products that you need from supplements , foods , etc .
neutral	our need for storage has grown and despite tumbling storage costs in that period , the disk space included in our package has not increased , neither has the cost of additional storage reduced .
neutral	one bag of braeburns in tesco £ 0 : 00 , same_thing in morrisons was £ 0 : 00
negative	i would like to add that these people have now emailed me stating they refuse for their staff to be named and have edited it and furthermore find the word i used to describe the organisation , " coarse ".
positive	pleasure to deal with a company who understand and meet their customers ' needs .
negative	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
positive	000000
negative	but the service is not good as i expected .
negative	do we have time for this ?
negative	the containers for the whiskas items are very thin & weak & therefore should not be packed with an item weighing 0 . 0kg ( weight of a bozita cat_food case ), as anybody with common_sense would know that the whiskas containers would break & damage the contents .
negative	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today ' s booking hasn ' t turned_up .
negative	0 weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
negative	disappointed !

negative	i explained that i had not cancelled the order and she said she would check up and get back to me .
positive	i ' m only on their shared hosting_package , but the quality of their hosting in my experience cannot be beat .
neutral	too long to wait in these days of ' instant ' everyting on the net
positive	very quick and easy service , just put in your details , put in your phone details and a few_days_later you ' ll get an_email_confirming the unlock is complete with easy to follow_instructions on how to complete the process :) thank_you :)
negative	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
positive	they are also very competitively_priced , usually beating the other major online_retailers .
positive	one of my favourite things about this website is that all the places are reviewed by travellers just like me so i am more likely to stay some place that has a better review rather then just an attractive price .
positive	great sevice they helped_me to use the computer and load my photos .
positive	it was very easy to follow the on - line form to pay and print out an address slip .
positive	given a delivery date when i i ordered .

negative	even_though they are part of the same organisation i have reluctantly reverted back to e_- bay .
neutral	last_year they offered a lower payment cause i never upgraded to another phone when contract ended .
negative	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer_service !

negative	do not sign a contract with them you will regret !!
positive	would definitely_recommend them !
negative	nearly another week past and i recieved the rest of my order , still no tap .
neutral	it should have been noted about my issue also being a second time customer and i did give my number_plate over the phone .
neutral	so .
neutral	and this will cost them . at_least my future business unless they post a phone number on the homepage of their website and answer calls promptly and courteously , respecting their high - paying customers .
positive	one thing that was important for me when i was purchasing the pc was future proofing it for as long as possible .
positive	good services !
neutral	having said that , when it did arrive it was extremely well_packaged and the delivery man was happy to lift it over my threshold whereby i could slide it into the house .
neutral	all in all a good time was had by everyone but more off our own merits in fairness .
negative	and you certainly should .
neutral	after that i heard_nothing more , so i waited in on the allotted date in case collection had been arranged , it hadn_'_t .
neutral	i was also told that the coffee_table could be sanded down and would look like new , who has ever paid for a new item to be told that it could be sanded down to look like a new one , i bought a new one !!!

negative	as i say if it works then leave well alone but if you expect them to help you with anything technical like porting your number over or anything other than simply grabbing a sim with new number and topping it up then be prepare for a mountain of wasted hours trying to re explain the same problem to the technicians who seem to work from canned scripts , most_likely from india .
neutral	on the bkk - lhr return we were separated .
positive	there is not a lot more you can say following a header like the above .
positive	i know i am gushing on , and so may sound false , but if you have a bit of money spare , buy some creatine from myprotein . com and from a more_expensive online_retailer , test them both out , and you will understand fully .

neutral	the fitting garage contacted black_circles who in turn contacted me to suggest that i need a v rated tyre as the speed rating includes a load rating also and there may be implications with my insurer should i be involved in an accident .
negative	it seems to me that the accepted rules of the gumtree jungle if you ' re a buyer is that you ignore what people put down in terms of price and frankly people don_'_t read what you write .
neutral	they did have the shirts i required though .
positive	keep_up the fab work .
negative	the matter has_been reported to ebay who are passing the matter onto their security team and also to derbyshire trading_standards .

positive	thoroughly_recommended .
positive	great products and plenty of special_offers with very helpful communications , very fast service and i would recommend to anyone , the best value i have seen anywhere including asda .
neutral	the confusion is mainly because i know that a set of 00 rollers is retails between £_00 to £_00 and the hairspray and brush are not worth that much .
negative	i think i must have been charged what i consider to be an excessive amount for this , because of the total that i was required to pay before i could have the car back .

neutral	most time '_s i use it cards arrive on time but last 0 were a day late .

neutral	i have been buying from ds for a while now .
negative	they said they would email me a break - down on what had happened to the parcel , but never did .

neutral	to top it off they are sending a cheque , resulting in a trip to the bank .

negative	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."

neutral	the graphics was not secure on the back panel either because there were no screws - bolts in place to keep the graphics_card from moving which is exactly_what they are designed to do so i assume who ever built the pc didn ' t bother as there were no screws lying inside either .

negative	fortunately , that is not too expensive .
negative	it '_s seriously restricted at peak periods , and never achieves the speeds they claim at any time .
negative	in my opinion they have purchased a consignment of brackets , a00blk which they are unable to sell due to the inherent design faults of only having 0 hole wall - fixings , vertically spaced , with a narrow seating area .

negative	i ' ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .

positive	exchanged them for a more_expensive pair based on reviews i ' d read .
neutral	. a lot of the cheap offers are hedged around with odd qualifiers - you have to send in copies of some of your invoices for a rebate , usually within a very tight time - window .

neutral	now i booked a week in boston and didn_'_t choose a sat_nav or additional driver insurance so quite straight_forward , even choose the full_tank on return option and eliminate any unforeseen charges , the small_print says maybe some local taxs due at time of hire .

neutral	they dont treat valued customers well .
negative	if my payment didnt go through , why do they need my confirmation for cancellation ?
positive	the questions i had about the product before ordering was answered_quickly by their customer_services .
positive	really polite and gave all the information i needed .
neutral	product variety , prices and timeliness are pretty good but advisors should be more assertive rather_than authoritative when asking customer '_s personal details - also return address for items was not enclosed in delivery paperwork ( had to call to find out )
negative	truly awful customer service
neutral	hey , where '_s the free shipping .
negative	tried to book through aviva extras but the holiday_autos site had a fault on it which made it impossible to book online .
positive	more orders on the way !
negative	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
neutral	there wasn_'_t space to put anything .
negative	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
positive	never once have i been disappointed with this site .
negative	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
positive	co - op had the best price for the the bosch washer i wanted and with a free 0 hour time_slot delivery .
positive	download speed not to bad at 0 . 00 mbps , but upload speed onlt 0 . 00 mbsp
negative	and by the way , sometimes these offers are not really good deals - so it is quite misleading !
neutral	so i ' m happy to have an unlocked iphone , and i would recommend this company to anyone who_wants to use their services , just don_'_t believe the times they say they '_ll deliver , and expect to wait considerably longer .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 billing information received
neutral	i found the service i had with them to be great , but the amount of junk_mail you get after is unreal , i ended_up putting it in the junk_mail box , now meaning all there emails go in there , so in effect it has backfired on them , as i now see no advertising from them at all .
negative	0000hrs monday no sign of fitter or furniture , rang customer_services who rang paul and informed me that paul had not been told of my job and that there had been a communications breakdown and they would look into it .
positive	it only cost me to post back the original jacket .
negative	- yes yodel , yes you do .
negative	!
positive	as soon as payment was received - item was dispatched and received next_day .
neutral	generally great service , but information of necessity of having a printer before or during ordering_process would of save me a lot !
negative	further installation problems – still not fixed despite many email – we contacted cab and trading_standards who have documented details of the issues .
positive	found a super cheap place to stay , no issues at all .
negative	i had called one of the nos about 0 days before , and he had told me to call him about 00_mins before i get to the airport and they will pick_up the car .
positive	i would use fashion eyewear again and certainly recommend them to my friends .
negative	i ordered 0 items at the same time , 0 of these items i waited weeks for to be despatched but they said they couldn_'_t take the money from my card , so i went online and hit resolve , entered my security details and all went through ok .
negative	been trying to get my refund ever since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
positive	i have only had to claim once and i didn_'_t have any_problems and was paid out promptly .

neutral	coverage - wise i ' ve always loved vodafone .
positive	also got the drinks flavouring which is very nice
neutral	after dropping my daughters off i called customer_services again from wembley .
negative	the lenses were with the frames when i left the shop .
neutral	being a sole traveler , the whole_experience did not inspire confidence in any future bookings i may wish to make .
neutral	also , quite_often i find the prices are made for foreigners and not so much the real price the hotel charges .
positive	easy to pay , love it !
neutral	firstly , dhgate is an internet portal bringing together sellers ( predominantly chinese ) and buyers like me and you from all over the world .
positive	i will_definitely be using the site in the future and recommending it to friends .

positive	i have been using this company now for a few_years .
neutral	no safe banking
neutral	recently though i purchased an item which wasn_'_t as_described .
positive	when time is of the essence a company offering fast delivery when i ordered was key .
negative	short_dated produce .
positive	it was easy to book with this site .
neutral	then i noted they had a website so i went on - line and after going through trying to make contact found they had a complaints on - line form .
negative	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
neutral	some of their appointed couriers ( esp .
negative	i was trying to connect them .
negative	otherwise , expect being at the receiving end of any miscommunication between the two companies you end up dealing_with .
negative	walked_into the local carphone_warehouse to take back a faulty phone charger !
positive	staff at my local_depot are beyond excellent and importantly they are reachable on a direct line and always answer within a couple of rings .
positive	for any other website , i would have stopped visiting it if this had happened , so it ' s a testament to how good this site is that i have chosen to overlook these occasions .
negative	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .
neutral	i bought some tesco storage crates which are moulded plastic and the quality_control just isn ' t there - on the shelf 0 or 0 were broken already and having brought mine home they have suffered the same fate .
neutral	good , my phone was unlocked but it had delayed too much !

negative	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
negative	i used british_gas over 0 years and they always sent me estimate which i paid in trust that i was paying correct amount , never i was sent meter read request , eventually when i found out that i paid them thousands in over charges they refused any refund , didn ' t even both explaining is to why estimates were sent instead of meter read requests .
neutral	the free game is a way of playing when you havent any cash and the big game at the end of the month is great , the slots are my favorite as there are not many bingo rooms the way you could improve is chat in the slot rooms and chat_games .
positive	they came the next_day delivery , and i couldn_'_t be more delighted .
neutral	eventually i called the phone , spoke to the proprietor and he couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
neutral	so by not all sitting in the same rows and such it did really kill the mood a little_bit as we were all really up for the match before hand .
positive	- i have never personally encountered a poor juddery connection over the past 0 years of using this service but then i guess this is subjective to the models connection , server location and its upstream providers to your isp .
neutral	0 january_0000
positive	the chair is as expected , very nice .
positive	i discovered viovet over a year_ago when murphy my cocker_spaniel was started on medication for epilepsy .
negative	the damn taps arrived at 0 :_00am this morning , and i have handed them straight back to the driver to be returned to this trueshopping !!
neutral	the driver was however very apologetic i will therefore use there services again .
neutral	immediate download .
negative	very annoying .
negative	i then had to fill out a refund form to get the money back ( within " up to 00 days ") that they shouldn_'_t have taken in the first place .
neutral	i have had some bad buffering experiences in the past and a few_times when ' lovefilm instant is not available right now ' which did really annoy me at the time as obviously if you are paying for something you should be able to use it .
neutral	it seems that when i use a vrn to search for tyres it doesn_'_t offer me the uprated 00y instead of 00w baurum tyres .
negative	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .

positive	booking my hostel was very easy and fast .
positive	i bought a rudy project stirling helmet on their tbyb scheme and i must_say that the helmet is an excellent fit and good quality , although the finish could be slightly neater .
negative	not long after , i received an_email informing_me that my flight was cancelled by the airline which is air france .
neutral	good price for jacket with delivery a week from dispatch however wanted to return an item and e_- mailed to receive a return order number received an_automated_response to say i would receive a return order number before i could proceed , and 0 week_later still no response despite e_- mailing again
neutral	the cabin layout is odd when compared to other_airlines so staying together is essential .
positive	i decided to purchase the upgraded power pack .
neutral	i don ' t think it is too much to ask for a replacement gear cable having just spent £_000_+ or even maybe offering me a set of cables at a reduced cost ?
negative	no response when phoning to drop of car .
negative	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has been delivered .
negative	i would stay_clear of this company and will never use them again .
neutral	now , they seem like every quarter of an_hour , which does ruin the continuity of the program .
positive	plugged it in ( 0 mins ) put a disc in and within 0 minutes total i was watching a movie in fantastic 0000p hdmi wow !!
positive	turns_out it ' s actually legit .
negative	avoid .
neutral	at_least to a more reasonable payout price so i could be happy with parting with my phone knowing that i have been given a fair price .
positive	arrived in 0 days , sent first_class .
positive	this is my third order front blinds 0 go , each time the quality of service , delivery and product has_been exceptional .
positive	the machine takes a large load for it size .
neutral	sup dawg , hotel bookers is okay , although it ' s pretty frustrating when you ' re trying to book something and the prices change while you browse .
negative	thanks for the internet you can get all the information you need but you shouldt have to do that .
neutral	booked the water wheel apartment in charlestown through blue_chip on the recommendation of a friend .
neutral	good arrived on time and price was good .
negative	after contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline ' s contact " and i even got an_email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
negative	it makes it almost_impossible to sort_out their mistakes and from my experience i would imagine that happens a lot .
negative	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
negative	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
negative	they sold two_pairs of vary focal glasses to me and i paid them £_000 . 00 .

negative	and i am still_waiting for viagogo '_s response !
negative	i have called emailed and filled in a contact form on the website and still nothing has happened .

neutral	order process and delivery handled very efficiently .
positive	would recommend .
neutral	came home and found it in my neigbours place .
neutral	this last few_months i hadn_'_t been happy .
neutral	the radio was shown as ' in stock ' ( in two places on the website ) and it was stated that it would be dispatched via courier if the order was placed before 00 . 00 .
positive	excellent service .
negative	it is my intention as soon as is humanly and contractually possible to leave both orange home and mobile , and i have been a customer for over 0 years as i feel totally let_down by this supposedly " blue_chip " company
positive	i found the system easy to use and liked the way your work was saved to your_own files giving confidence that the time_consuming work ( they all take time ) wouldn_'_t be lost .
neutral	i then insisted they give me a prescription and got 0 pairs for half the price elsewhere .
neutral	i do not always receive my lenses quickly but they do arrive !
positive	in all , well it ' s prety awesome really and i ' ve been using it for years when i ' ve needed it .
negative	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
negative	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
neutral	more options such as wanting to display where you live should be a basic ' button click '.
neutral	so much for a quick response .
positive	it pays you significantly more_than any other company , and it ' s simple , easy , and free to post your old_phones .
positive	very good delivered on time and installed then when we had a problem a couple of weeks_later i phoned them saturday_morning and they were out sunday morning fixed problem brilliant service
positive	would recommend their services to anyone .
negative	the lady i spoke to said that my order had been cancelled !
neutral	for example the royal_albert_hall , westminster abbey , not been able to take photos of this internal splendider but the brakes on my partners enthusiasm .
neutral	seems it can only hold 0 . 0kg of clothes but it doesn_'_t tell you that when you buy it .
positive	there ' s a great service called flubit which gets better deals on products , which are already at competitive_prices .
negative	on further discussion , he then offered to take a deposit of 00 %, it seems that this was the new policy that he had made up on the spot .
positive	was really happy with the service from prezzybox .
positive	the only time i have had reason to return an item the customer_service was fine .
neutral	when using the voucher , the website locked on checkout .
positive	unpacked all the shopping and was happy that all the fresh items had at_least 0 days until expiry .
positive	i ' d recommend to anyone !
neutral	it means no one else has to pay for anyone_else , which is good .
neutral	you won ' t find better prices on the internet especially with their 0 % price_match guarantee .
positive	i quickly learned that even for name brands , supplementwarehouse will outcompete other_websites ' off brands in price .
negative	it didn ' t arrive so i called again .
positive	after spending hours putting_together a spec on various different websites and it being way too overpriced dino_pc was by_far cheaper and extremely reasonably_priced .

negative	mattressman order : mm000000
neutral	the bad you never get the films from your list you want its always the ones you pick to make up the numbers , some of the films will skip making them unwatchable , i got defiance from them and i swear i got so fed_up with the jumps i must of missed 00_mins of the film .
negative	i posted the motor back to them on [_name_removed_] instruction and was expecting a refund .
neutral	how to explain this company .
negative	so twice me going to the web_site to say leave with a neighbor , and still i am parcel - less .
negative	avoid this company like the plague and use a reputable one or the [_external_reference_removed ].
negative	their website is designed to trick you into signing_up with some sort of wholly unnecessary subscription
positive	i tried envirofone first who offered me less_than 00_% of what mazuma did and took 00x longer in doing so .
positive	the perfumes were not watered down , as i previously found with some other_sites , the packaging was very good , they arrived when they said they would , and i got both perfumes for half the price .
neutral	when i asked to see the car i had booked it was perfectly adequate with a good sized boot that would have taken our cases .
negative	there are lots of reputable florists on line ; serenata are not in the running & they should be_ashamed of their service !!
neutral	also when i have any_problems with delivery or wrong products being sent and i contact very to complain , i ' m always promised an enquiry and a return phone_call within 00_hours to inform me of the outcome , it never happens .
negative	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
positive	i have used the online site a few_times .
negative	actually the guys said it was an easy fix but it required the two bt companies supplying us talking to each other .
negative	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
positive	they should make it clear that polarised lenses cannot be put into semi - rimless or rimless style frames ( this is because the edge of the lens is not tinted so will look very odd as will be visible with semi - rimless or rimless frames ).
neutral	i wanted to know if they could swap it for the correct product . if they even stock it .
negative	i constantly wonder_how these_guys are in business at all .
neutral	flight , hotel were fine .

positive	very easy to liaise with the bidders .
positive	there no site like bingocams !

neutral	when ordering i used the description of the bottle left with us to check the images shown on the kac web_site and they were identical .
positive	only thing i ' m not happy about is it doesn ' t have a mobile site , i can ' t see my website fully from my iphone_0s .
neutral	i never_heard back from either of them .
negative	sure , their prices were $ 0 - 0 $ dollars cheaper , but let '_s think about this - they sell supplements , items we want to improve our health - how is it healthy to not have your product for two_weeks ?!?!
negative	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
negative	paid extra for fitting .
negative	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
positive	the postage was resonable and were delivered very quickly , they are lifesavers to me !

neutral	having not received product within a week at ' ship to ' address i called helpline only to discover the above facts .

neutral	if this is the case , i will gladly upgrade my " average " rating to a " good " rating .
negative	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .

positive	i have discovered that i like direct contact and showing them over my house and i get instant feedback from them .
positive	all the flexy pipes included .
positive	i ' ve got 00 staff and this will save us a whole heap of time .
positive	however , searching the internet i found that although sites were advertising a price - they didn_'_t appear have any stock as the phone has_been discontinued .
neutral	they provide a wide_range , low_cost and legitimate selection .
neutral	this delta is too large and should be addressed .
negative	delivery date is thursday 0th .
negative	and that was all - very much a ' tough_luck , like it or lump it attitude '.
negative	i think my dog ' s ears need a bit of a cleaning ; this would be a far more productive thing to do with your time than waste it with harveys .
negative	if you ever have to return a faulty item as i did in this case a cheap electric planer with a clear design flaw .
positive	just search for what you want select and pay for it and thet do the rest .
neutral	we hebben elders de fauteuils gekocht .
neutral	you ' d think it will go the other way .
negative	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
negative	faulty device - wrote for advise - did not here a word - oh - device was for a friend .
positive	they ship fast and often add free_gifts to regular customers , all in all an a0 company !
positive	strongly_recommend using hostelbookers to everyone .
positive	quick delivery and good quality products .
negative	a different_story every time and not one promise kept .
negative	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
negative	what a lot of hassle trying to reedeem voucher for £_00 . 00 which was posted recorded delvery to their e_- commerce dept .
neutral	i rang up to tell them that the corners of the picture frame were damaged , as i felt i couldn ' t give someone a damaged gift !
neutral	ebay and sedo are the safer option !
positive	used collectmyparcel . com a couple of times and had no_problems .
negative	i recently sent flowers to friends in south_africa .
negative	once the funds have been accepted by your bank server you will receive a second email from our finance team .
neutral	they do tell you that the budget range of glasses ship from hong_kong but they do not tell you you have to pay vat on anything over £_00 .

negative	and cannot get through via phone .
negative	i don ' t recommend this company what so ever !
neutral	they found a match to my name , confirmed having accepted a parcel from germany and having taken it to the local post_office ( which i asked for , after all ).
negative	i used to use them as an_emergency supplier for the small_quantities of particular values of components i need for development work .
positive	the canvas artwork i bought was even more pretty in the flesh although the picture on the site was a good likeness of the actual canvas too .
positive	then i can use my card to pay , or pay on delivery . and it '_s brought to my door . simplzz :)
positive	this kind of customer_service is unheard of in australia and i have recommended pretavoir to a number of friends and colleagues for its good prices and exceptional service .
positive	i ' ve bought a few things from this website and i ' m definitely going to be a regular buyer for my make up , skin care and hair care products .
neutral	he will only do this if he can sell for a premium price ( apple , armani ; etc_.)
positive	making free calls from mobiles is amazing when it is truly free .
neutral	however they are virtually impossible to contact if you have a problem .
neutral	i must_say i ' ve had a lot of ups and downs with ebay .
negative	they even lie to us by saying that they won ' t be doing it .
negative	shame on u dpd liars . hope u get destroyed by the sheer numbers of customers u have pissed_off !
negative	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
negative	this is a fake site .
negative	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
positive	god blesses !!
negative	not happy .
positive	they give 0 hour slots and 00_% of the time arrive within this time - in the event they are a few_minutes late they have given me a " late voucher " to use online - to the value of £_00 . 00 !

neutral	i wonder , has any other customer here been able to purchase an electrical item that works ?
positive	goods were delivered promptly as promised .
negative	today i have guests and decided to try ordering again after many months of not trusting just eat .
negative	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
negative	com which netflights lead you to , my flight status reverted to ' not operating ' indicating that unbeknownst to me i had been relegated to standby on a ticket i paid for .

neutral	secondly the touch has areas where the chrome had actually completely come off .
negative	they lure you in with a low price then make you view add on after add on until the price is 00 times what you expect .
neutral	will i never learn . that '_s the power of pricing . get em ' in on the initial number £ 0 . 00 then cross sell / upsell / power sell / tea sell / everything costs sell !
neutral	i decided to get the loss insurance as an added extra , despite my being a student and therefore unbelievably poor .
negative	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
positive	your site is amazing i will be back
neutral	had to go their local_depot , which itself was not particularly well sign posted .
positive	the least expensive i could find on the internet and still phenomenal service .
negative	i am pretty sure this is in breach of fsa regulations .
positive	paul byers
negative	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
positive	of course we would come back to them for another holiday , no question !
neutral	first order was delayed and then finally arrived but to find the box had been open and hardware tampered with .
negative	another problem we encountered was the penalty for congestion charges in london .
positive	easy website to use and the items ordered were here next_day and also extremely cheap prices .
positive	i think lightbulbs direst is fab .
neutral	when the items did arrive there was severe damage to the boarding to the back of the 0 drawer chest .
positive	i ' d recommend to anyone .
neutral	ordering experience was simple as would be expected .
neutral	will not order again .
negative	the person can only deal with sales enquiries , not technical , goodbye , thanks for calling .
positive	this was the easiest tyre_fitting service i have ever had it was so quick and easy from booking on line to the service from the garage they where so helpful and free coffee also half price next mot
neutral	i then had an early beer , opened my emails & saw the following sent to me at 00 . 00 on 00 / 00 / 00 - ' reference your order no 00000 placed on the 00 / 00 / 00 at 0 . 00 . 00 ( i didn_'_t place this ) your item has_been dispatched .'
neutral	no one from sarpedon travel firm twigged this would be at the domestic arrivals .
negative	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
positive	the speed of delivery is amazing .
positive	regards
positive	awesome .
negative	don ' t buy here .
negative	no mention of other emails sent to them or any kind of definitive answer to the ongoing saga !
positive	i was told about this site from a friend and i thought he was using something untrustworthy .
neutral	i am hoping for a positive result and will keep you all posted .
positive	one week in total from contacting mazuma on their website to receiving my cheque for £_000 !!
neutral	0 emails sent around 0th / 0th_december to chase up - no response .
neutral	after a couple of messages i was told i could return it for a full_refund including the postage_costs both ways which was good , the money for the card and original postage came through nice and fast but in the end it took over 0 months and multiple messages ( and being told several_times it have been done ) to get a refund for the cost of posting it back to them .
neutral	i really wanted those flowers to get to her in time .
positive	all in all from the original viewing of the car , test_drive and finance meeting to picking it up it only took three days , would of been less if i had been able to get to the dealers earlier on in the days instead of 0 hour before closure .
negative	i ordered a bag from website that implied it was in stock .
neutral	if you go on live_chat they don_'_t seem to have a clue what they are doing and take an_absolute age to answer every time you ask a question .
negative	returned shorts at my expense and had to wait another week before my order was finally completed .
neutral	the products you receive as well as the service are basically they same for sometimes even a bit higher total cost because the shipping is so over priced .
positive	this is the first time i used e_- careers , but definitely won ' t be my last .
positive	anyhow , thanks again .
neutral	so where then did it all go_wrong ?
negative	i presummed this was a genuine website ( so have thousands of others it appears ) it was only by not recieving any response to my e_- mails after 0 days and being met by a never ending engaged tone or ringing tone on the customer service contact number that i suspected fraudulent activity .
negative	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
negative	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
neutral	i have called the company at_least once a day since last monday and have been referred to the showroom as we made the purchase in person rather_than on - line .
negative	!
positive	thanks again
negative	000pm arrives .
positive	i highly_recommend libertyflights for all your vaping needs .
neutral	è scrivendo qui che mi ridanno 0 euri e mezzo ?
positive	definately a company that listens to it '_s customers via the survey they ask you to fill in .
neutral	we booked a private transfer to and from tenerife south airport .
neutral	item finally turned_up the following_day .
negative	they don ' t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
positive	i ordered 0 dsw chairs which were backordered the day i made the order , but arrived few_days after their availability , well_packaged ( in 0 packs )!
neutral	the item arrived in the uk from germany in 0 days , so can ' t fault the delivery speed .
negative	i do not recommend mobilephonexchange , nor do i approve them having trading
negative	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
neutral	after the weekend , i decided to look at the tracking - and the p0g site did not help , all i could see was that it had been collected .
neutral	we received the blind bent , the black out does not go all the way to the edge , slightly to long and slightly not wide enough .
negative	wont recommend
positive	i haven_'_t compared exactly the same deal on both to see if there is a difference in value but guess it would be very small if so .
neutral	in the meantime , t - mobile have just brought out a ' truly unlimited ' data package .
neutral	assumed it had sort itself out as had no further contact from them until around 0 and half months later where they had passed on my ' debt ' and charged me over 000_% of the original value .
positive	excellent service and mega quick delivery
neutral	0 - 00 days can suddenly turn into 00 days and 00 days might not even be in stock .
positive	fast delivery and excellent communication .
neutral	also had issues with receiving items not as_described and damaged .
negative	atrocious customer_service & incompetence .
neutral	have to say i was really disappointed with the delivery from myprotein this time around .
neutral	in 0000 i visited the ' new ' salford quays harvester during the christmas_period and the whole experience was 000_% outstanding , very courteous and professional .
negative	as a seller you have little , if any , recourse to complain unlike with e_- bay '_s feedback system .
negative	well see why .
negative	all other car_rental companies at geneva clearly mark their cars and paperwork - but not sixt !
neutral	saving or no saving !
neutral	i am about to email them and ask for a refund or the item because i know they will do whats best for a valued customer .
negative	!
positive	a great place to shop because not only do you get great deals on products you can also find things that arent available anywhere_else .
negative	customer service just isnt there in relation to their on - line sales , retail sales staff are of course a different breed and do actually give a damn , which is unfortunate as sorry guys , but its now a company thing for me , i '_ll avoid you all .
negative	the customer service experience was the double shotgun to both feet again .
neutral	every time i have chosen this route i ' ve had trouble getting my items delivered .
negative	a disgraceful representation of a company and i have a feeling from the reviews i ' ve seen below an all to regular view of this company .
positive	great price , delivered next_day using a decent courier ( ups ), well_packaged , rang to confirm company name ( delivered to work ), was very polite and friendly on phone .
negative	after nearly 00 phone_calls they still carnt tell me weather or not to travel to london as it may be a wast of time .
positive	also there is a " pencyclopedia ," a section devoted to everything about pens and pencils , all the fancy technical do - das and what pen is best for what purpose .
negative	never answered the phone to respond to query .
positive	i just left a vitamin shop and thought i would look online first and quickly found this amazing site !
neutral	i didnt authorise this but on checking small_print - they state they automatically renew the policy unless you tell them otherwise .
negative	it is now the 00nd march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
positive	i ' d bought a climbing harness from someone_else , it took_ages to come , and when i tried to change it they didn_'_t tell me the size i wanted was not in stock so i waited but nothing happened .
neutral	i threw them out !
neutral	märkligt beteende .
neutral	i was surprised to see so many really bad_reviews .
positive	very quick delivery time , glasses well_packed , much_better price than high_street opticians .
neutral	thank_you stephen for your reply .
positive	fantastic service from these_guys , recomend them highly
positive	as a general rule i do a lot of research on each product i buy , and the cheapest i found in the high_street was £_000 and slrhut was £_000 inc tax .
positive	i would recommend this car_hire company without_hesitation .
positive	spellbound perfume , fantastic price .
negative	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
neutral	hey_ho iwill have to go without .
neutral	decent enough products and prices but always want to upsell you into something extra , then when you have had you order bombard you with e_- mails .
neutral	the transaction was always stated as " pending " and they did notify me straight_away about my account being accessed yet it could not be resolved as the case number did not exist ?
positive	prices very competitive , and 000_% satisfied with my order - worming_tablets and flea_treatment for my dog .
negative	after over 000 transactions i '_ve stopped using ebay .
positive	this is one of my favourite websites to shop at , particularly for video_games , but it ' s nice to see that they have branched out recently with music / films .
neutral	could have been better !
neutral	this was reported to the duty manager who was apologetic , however the apology should have come from the waitress .
neutral	i found the site easy to use and access the best rate of mexican peso '_s .
negative	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
negative	so i gave up .
negative	called talktalk customer_service . spend hours on the phone with them . no one is abble to help . and when requested to speak to themanager of the faulty department he told me that the routter had stopped workinf . fair_enough . equipments to tend to brake .
neutral	they do have the perks for ebay and such but omg !
positive	always has the lowest_prices and if i can find a cheaper price not only will they match it , they will beat plus they have a huge_selection to choose from .
negative	you are unable to contact them as a recipient and have to make endless_calls to suppliers to sort things out
neutral	i am not paying to skype any more , will be using only their free services and for paying services will go to other provider .
positive	a good experience - would use again
neutral	update - i received an_email very quickly offering to replace the flowers on a date of my choosing .
positive	i bought the snoore pillow wow it really works .
positive	perfect service as always will be back and would recomend to anyone .
neutral	however its a post_code test and doesn_'_t use your logon so its never going to be the best test .
neutral	but to be fair the customer_service was friendly and helpful .
neutral	i hope they sort out their e_- mail department , or else they will begin to see a steady stream of people with minor complaints and unanswered questions , simply take their business elsewhere .
negative	i spent 00_minutes speaking to automated_messages before trying my luck with a different team that i found on the website .
negative	beggars_belief .
positive	order delivered promptly by yodel and now all i have to do is make the curtains this week before_christmas .
neutral	the whole reason i joined topcashback rather_than [_external reference_] was their promise to pay cashback quickly .
positive	we ' d lost our exit ticket but that wasn_'_t a problem .
negative	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn ' t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
neutral	no real promotions for its players .
negative	me : " so when is it being delivered ?"
neutral	yes it works .
neutral	i ordered a new lichfield sandwood 0 + 0 tent .
negative	i have been waiting ever_since and twice queried where my tickets are .
neutral	you have what i wanted but .
negative	nothing more to say .
negative	i have flagged this with aspects customer_service last december but have yet to hear back from them after this initial reply :
neutral	the photo was very difficult to upload to fit he photo frame
neutral	i was very pleasantly_suprised when the car turned_out to be a 0 door audi_a0 with 0000km on the clock .
negative	both units were picked_up off the same pile which was clearly_marked £_00 . 00 .
positive	when i had my shop re fitted is was a pleasure to deal with metric , as every thing i needed was completed by them to a high_standard . i have had lovely comments from my customers on how lovely the shop looks .
neutral	i called my grandma and she was delighted w her plant that she received !!
positive	i give them all my business and tell others to as well .
negative	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	have used crucial before to order ram for my machine as theirs is one of the best rated .
negative	had relply from conrad at cex webuy . com today 00th of march at 0 . 00am
positive	very useful product info , videos and reviews .
negative	don ' t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
negative	any domain registrar should know how to renew domains without losing them , and in any case of a renewal failing they should at_least detect this so that action can be taken .
negative	we bought tachodisc software and installed it on a pc which unfortunately died ,
neutral	when i opened the loose panels every one had some form of damage , some of the damage was worse_than the others .
positive	i recently_purchased my daughter a vetech inotab from the funky_rabbit online store late on a sunday_evening and was able to reserve and pick_up in store first thing in the monday_morning !
positive	would use again & recommend
positive	being based in the uk it is understandable for consumers to feel a little_concerned about dealing_with overseas organisations but , in this case , i have faith restored and am pleased to convey to any readers that .
neutral	otherwise , i ' ve enjoyed their excellent service , brilliant catalogue , maintenance and security - none of these as detrimental to a fun overall subscription to them .
negative	not only did rentalcars . com not apologise for not bringing to our attention all the documentation that we would need , but they refused to give us our money back .
negative	do not use this company if you want anything on time and and don ' t want to be messed about .
neutral	i then arranged for a re - delivery on another day and was told 0am - 0pm , but yet again it came very early on in the morning around 0am but luckily someone was in to sign for the parcel .
negative	what a joke .
neutral	i can ' t believe it takes a huge online_retailer this long when it takes someone off ebay normally a day to post a game and that ' s not even their job .
positive	i checked their website and the green ones were now showing backorder , so i really can '_t complain , i actually got what i wanted .
negative	they were very rude and unhelpful except for one guy that was nice at_least .
neutral	a third set of lenses were ordered , this time the tailor - made ones .
positive	went to several providers for a round the world trip .
neutral	- no response
neutral	the second time , it was far less of an issue , they sent me a different " freebie " to the one they had offered on their site .
negative	does that look like 00 days notice prior to suspension to anyone ?
negative	so i now have a flight i cannot cancel and was more_expensive than other_websites .
positive	the prices are lower_than anyone elses and to purchase on line is very safe and easy and delivery is very quick .
positive	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
negative	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn ' t paid for my product and this is why i hadn ' t yet received it .
positive	they have the full range of products and are the same price that i paid in the supermarket .
neutral	most of my items were a bit see through . and don ' t fit me quite the way they should .
positive	what '_s not to like x
positive	nowhere else you get keys such cheap .
negative	they just skirt around the issues , unless you email the same questions more concisely three of four times .
negative	!
negative	i am happy to give you a 0 * rating now !
negative	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across_europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
negative	so after around 0 months , numerous phone_calls ( all made from us to them ) i am still left with a fridge_freezer that doesn ' t work !
negative	coffee_table arrived prompt with order update saying other table will be delayed by supplier .
neutral	had it done so i would probably have bought one .
positive	excellent service from the first contact to delivery .
positive	the estimate on amazon was quite long but one of the staff_members send me an e_- mail saying to ignore it and they ' ll send it via_royal_mail 00 , and it arrived two days_later .
positive	it was delivered quickly .
positive	if every company ran as efficiently as mazumba , the country would be alot better !!!!
negative	you are now chatting with yodel direct
positive	i am most certainly going to be a return customer .
neutral	over 000 people claimed this deal - that is a lot of £ 0 '_s and i am beginning to wonder_if it was just a big scam .
neutral	it took a week to get a response from them ( their published policy on the website is 00 hour response ) when they finally admitted liability and accepted a return .
positive	website is easy to understand and has very quick loading times .
negative	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
negative	sent my phone on the 0th_june special delivery recieved by them on the 00th_june still no payment i called on friday 0th_july as i think i have given them more then enough time now to pay up , they told me the money would be in my account in the enxt 00hours .
positive	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (£ 00 for £_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
neutral	to be fair to park_cameras , i have now had a call from them and they have explained the situation .
negative	transaction_id 0000000
negative	normally you would get full network when your in a open space but on the other handy my network_coverage is always being cut_off .
positive	i found the whole trip very relaxing .
positive	very patient and detailed service .
neutral	talk about chivalry .
neutral	to be quite honest if pageant fancy_dress in newbury had been open on mondays i would have simply gone in there , had a browse and and picked something up .
neutral	do not respond to e_- mails or telephone_calls .
positive	!
negative	i can ' t really afford £_00 extra ontop of what i already pay and all i kept getting told by your customer_service was ' theres nothing we can do sir ' later when i phoned back to ask if they could match a price i have found they told me a load of bs about how theres are a little more_expensive due to the customer_service they offer and putting their money in to that .
positive	very prompt delivery and super cheap prices !
neutral	a single company dealing_with stock , orders , dispatch and returns / warranty issues
negative	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about £_000 -£_000 to correct .
positive	to my surprise , i discovered that such feature is not available .
positive	my product arrived the next_day .
neutral	i think they have stopped using trustpilot as the site they point their website to for testimonials due to some recent critical reviews .
neutral	which is wrong , if you are buying from a seller then they are meant to leave_feedback for you first and then once your item has came then you leave_feedback for them .
negative	shame there isn_'_t a zero star_rating !
positive	will use again if the price is right , top_class .
positive	i was a little_worried_about having an expensive bottle shipped to my home address but needn_'_t having worried at all .
positive	unfortunately due to rough handed couriers the box has exploded on one side and had a hole in one corner where it had been scraped across the floor .
positive	i had an anxious wait but my camera was delivered before expected and well_packaged .
neutral	always used mazuma , great company so far .
neutral	consequently , there was a sprawling , disorganised queue , and tempers were frayed .
neutral	update_: hmm have had a dodgy experience with them since this review .
neutral	we bought a rack to fit inside the tin too , and this seemed to mark the non - stick - even_though it was sold alongside the dish .
positive	i have been using just vitamins for years .
positive	within 0 weeks it stopped_working .
negative	he gave me a rm tracking_number and for some reason it got returned to sender .
neutral	amazon and other_companies can cope easily with this but fragrance_direct can '_t .
neutral	purchased item recieved email to say will be delivered by dpd on certain date with a tracking_number waited in all day checked with local dpd depot to be told not collected by us yet so no delivery today when did not arrive late_afternoon phoned ffx to be told " oh_dear " should be delivered by uk mail tommorrow sorry will phone in the morning with time no phone_call from ffx item arrived mid_morning not the best of experiences
negative	the phone was reconnected .
neutral	ordered a tent on 00 / 00 / 00 & was told by email at 00 . 00 the next_day it had been dispatched , even_though when trying to track the parcel i couldn_'_t as the royal_mail said ' enter your 00 digit tracking_number ' which was not included in the email .
neutral	they didn ' t respond to me until 0 days_later saying it was too_late , 0 hours_later they sent me a tracking_number .
neutral	bought a brand_new antara 0x0 from grantham branch , so pleased with it but i paid for a maintenance plan , have requested it every week for 0 weeks still_haven_'_t got it .
neutral	goods did not arrive , called world_stores same day , the story was the courier was running_late , he never arrived .
neutral	delivery itself is average , bordering on slow .
positive	easy to order , great range of products and really quick delivery .
negative	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
negative	they then inform me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
positive	very happy .
positive	just hope they are recycled properly :)
positive	i would definitely_use again .
positive	the price , quality and super_fast delivery make them by far one of the finest online suppliers i have ever used .
negative	thank_you for your recent communication .
positive	in every instance the order has arrived promptly without_any errors .
negative	arrived two days_later from order .
negative	close this company down .
negative	and still they show as i ' m writing this as being in stock .
positive	made a regular customer out of me y ' did :)
negative	so many late deliveries and surly customer service , but because it '_s not me that uses them directly that my only option is not to use amazon .
positive	super_fast delivery , great range of quality products .
neutral	i am still_waiting for these to come as promised .
negative	i would like to comment on the quality of the goods if only my basket were to arrive .
neutral	the order just stayed at processing .
negative	i ' m sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
neutral	although i do still search through ebay now and then , i won ' t be using it half as much as i used to .
neutral	good luck !!
negative	0 of which i got told promised by ' bhal ' if that ' s how you spell his name - that i would get a call back from a manager within the next 00_hours . that was 00_hours ago and i ' m still_waiting !
neutral	har lige været i london og paris via esbjerg - harwich , kahytter ombord er alletiders . personalet gør det bedste de kan .
neutral	there ' s apparently no way to sort by the price of , say , a private double room across all hostels that provide it .
positive	product well described and exactly as required .
negative	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
positive	superb company , well_priced , great customer_service and the ability to pre_- book a courier to pick your lens back up , so you know exactly how much you ' ll be paying before you order is excellent !
neutral	companies selling on amazon also continuously slow .
neutral	when trying to order something i needed to get the item delivered to a different address ( work ) than my billing_address as no - one would be there to accept it at home .
positive	this company has never let me down .
neutral	the delivery company yodel left them on top of my rubbish bin in fill view of passers by not my idea of good service on their part .
neutral	serenata service definitely has lots of room for improvement .
neutral	thanks petr z .
negative	" no they won ' t "
neutral	i can '_t buy the replacement item from another ( reliable ) company till next week .
negative	and if i want it returned it would cost £_00 !!
neutral	further inspection showed a scratched / scuffed crystal , dust and lint on the dial and a gouged caseback .
neutral	headline price is great , but includes next to no insurance_cover .
negative	i ' ve been with tmobile for years now and had several contracts .
positive	usually much_faster_than stated .
negative	0 days on you still havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .
positive	i always have my tyres_fitted and mot '_s done by national_tyres , with great online prices and the friendly , speedy service is second to none
neutral	i think they phoned the couriers and gave them a well_deserved bollocking - this time the couriers bothered phoning and got instructions to find the house - so that ' s good .
neutral	then as i got to the door less_than 00 seconds after she knocked she was walking away .
negative	onceagaion , we would like to seek your extended patience on this matter as we look_forward having your case resolved ."
neutral	wouldn ' t of bought it if i had known this before hand .
neutral	avoid .

neutral	our representatives will be more_than glad to assist you .
positive	i went into specsavers and the range of glasses available was woeful .
negative	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !
positive	i have had many deliveries from dpd and to be honest i wish every company was dpd style .
positive	up to now we have only gone on city sight seeing buses when away .
negative	travelling alone which was a problem for their website as it seems you can only book in pairs , but to be fair their office in london go it sorted .
negative	paid by debit_card but the restaurant is too_busy .
neutral	speedy and accurate as usual but 0 pence worth of plastic turned into 0 pounds per knob plus the addition of vat and then carriage
negative	i ordered flowers with eflorist to send to my wife ’_s work place as we both had to work on valentines_day .
negative	bad layout , bad company , bad seller , bad products , i will never use ebay again as long as i live .
neutral	business class heathrow to bangkok .
neutral	after a broadly positive experience noted above i ordered several small mounted film cells .
neutral	the guitar sounds nice although i ' m now weary of using gear for music again .
negative	they would appear to offer no benefit over some of the high_street opticians and i would advise everyone to give they a wide_berth .
negative	still in shock about it .
neutral	just leave it as it is !!
positive	called the freephone_number , got straight through to a lovely_lady who sorted it all out for us and amended the number of bags .
neutral	response to nabrus feedback :
positive	pleasantly_surprised at what i got for my old phone and the process was pain - free .
neutral	they have taken that away and replaced it with 0 family day passes a year at national trust .
neutral	i have a clubcard loyalty card , and they send me extra points or money off vouchers for items they don_'_t sell at my local_store !
neutral	it ' s so hard to buy things from made . com .
negative	the next_day i receive a text_saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn ' t arrived .

negative	email arrived saying 0 - 0 days for delivery .
positive	just returned from really deep powder in austria .
neutral	i '_ve has all the bother others have mentioned including customer service refusing to cancel my sim only with 00 days notice , staff from india whose english is as much use as my hindi , people with no_idea what they ' re on about .
negative	can i recommend bullguard online backup as a service then the answer has to be " no ".
positive	good were easy to select online and pay for .
negative	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant documentation and t &_c ' s , but were advised ' don ' t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any_questions that she may have '.
positive	i got exactly_what i wanted how i wanted it for a great price and quality to match .
negative	i ' d sooner not deal with a company using them rather_than have all the hassle !!!
negative	they also rightly deleted the ad .
negative	not a good price .
positive	highly_recommend .
positive	shipping is a little_steep to my area , but still by_far the cheapest site .
negative	*_cough * *_cough *.
positive	all this i promptly put in the freezer , very pleased with my decision .
positive	they collected my laptop on a friday and i had a call on the monday to tell me that they had received my laptop and would like to pay me the amount that they had quoted .

negative	€ 00 . 00 for " out of hours " at 0000 !!!!

positive	dpd notify you your parcel is scheduled for delivery before the actual supplier and in which you already know what time it ' s going to be in your home and the delivery drivers name .
negative	this has to be the worst courier ever and i urge_everyone who is thinking of using them to think again and go back to a reliable service like royal_mail .
negative	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court

positive	ordered the same day and recieved the 0 bulbs after the weekend .
negative	i was then told it would be this week .
neutral	both of these items were gifts from my mother , and i treasure them as there is no way i could afford them myself , hence getting insurance .

neutral	transaction_id :_0000000
positive	thanks oliver for the advice !!

neutral	an entry made on ukmail '_s web_site , hours after i had called them to cover their tracks to say it was delayed , my suspicions are that the delay was due to a champions league football match , but i can '_t prove that .

neutral	the tracking site shows a " signature ", but it '_s not mine .
neutral	why invent a fictitious order for 00 / 0 / 00 at a time when i was at work & never emailed an order ?
neutral	subsequent friendly email exchange with gameseek , in which they confirmed that the device had been posted " unregistered , unsigned for " ( odd for a piece of kit costing_£_00 : 00 ).
positive	it may have looked nice during web 0 . 0 era but this is 0000 and time for a change .
negative	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .

negative	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
neutral	the only difference is hostelworld charge a booking_fee and normally i would recommend hostelbookers over but only if you have no need to contact hostelbookers for anything , the booking was really easy and simple , but it ' s just ridiculous that you cant write a review for the hostel without writing a review for hostelbookers first !
neutral	meanwhile i had checked the tracking and sent off emails to yodel and ps asking where it was .
positive	if you ' re looking for a friendly place to buy good quality hair accessories which you can '_t find on the high_street give stonebridge a try .

neutral	the tracking updates are more_than useless and when it did finally arrive it was chucked over my back gate into a puddle :(!
neutral	after about two_weeks i had received nothing and looked on the website for a phone number but there isn_'_t one which worried me .

neutral	this sounds ok but the reason i wanted it earlier was to add things to it .
negative	they signed me up for an annual service and never tell you it is a two year contract .
negative	i ' m amazed at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
neutral	two parcels were collected from the same address for delivery but got split up , only one delivered to me on the 0th_oct .
neutral	will stick to interflora next time
positive	nicely_packaged , quick delivery .
neutral	i ' m pretty sure this is illegal by the uk ' s distance_selling regulation .
positive	was fully fitted for my new r00 0 wood and was given some invaluable swing tips to boot .
neutral	there ' s not regalation and an unsafe website / domain sale environment .
positive	ook retouren worden snel afgehandeld en geld teruggeboekt .
negative	have emailed them and recieved no response .
neutral	she wasn ' t impressed that i couldn ' t get his info but when i told her i had set a password on my account so that she could ring and enquire wasn ' t interested .
neutral	the temperature gauge was also damaged on the motherboard which definitely scared me for sure given the temperature restrictions on the amd processor inside !
neutral	would i use better living again or recommend them probably not !
negative	as a payg user i always found it difficult to find easy resolutions to problems , whether by telephone , on - line ' chat ', or via the website .
neutral	the problem was that they needed to match and i needed two of them !
positive	thank_you ebay
positive	what more could you ask ?
negative	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don ' t offer compensation .
positive	i '_ve just exchanged £_00 woth of clubcard_points for £_00 worth of wrist bands for fantasy island .
neutral	all i can say is , once i built them i had problems simply seating the shelves and was cursing the shelf dimensions , which appeared oversize .
neutral	my goods arrived in a thin ' jiffy_bag ' and i discovered they had been quite badly knocked about by royal_mail and one of them was actually damaged .
positive	great service at an amazing price !
negative	o0 own this company and think its a great business plan to provide a service hiding_behind a new name " giffgaff " where they get the actual customer to provide all the support .
negative	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
negative	i can only hope so !!!!
neutral	generally a good service but transfers out of the airport can take a hour or more to load up a full coach , returns generally on time
positive	very good sevice and i would recommend .
negative	.
negative	they took my money immediately of course .
negative	a good company would have sent an_email to unfullfilled customers warning them of any delays .
positive	search_filters made choosing a lot_easier .
neutral	i like the company , although i can ' t stand to watch them on tv , just browse on the web .
neutral	the items i purchased were ok , although the t - shirt would have been better a size bigger .
negative	used the easy webpage to chose , book and pay .
positive	bought a bosch axt 00tc garden shredder from the homebase web_site - excellent value for money .
positive	obviously it lacks shops , and a phone line , but these are two of the things that i have hated about previous network_providers .
negative	are you mad !!!!!!!!
negative	this badly creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn ' t have been able to match his expertise .
negative	help !
neutral	i got an_email to say delivery would be on wednesday , on tuesday i get a text saying delivery would be tuesday and giving a time .
negative	i booked a spa overnight stay at carden park for may 0000 .
neutral	the " hold " time for customer_services is generally 0 - 00_mins and the individual at the other end of the phone can be hit or miss .
positive	outstanding support - excellent website design - fantastic system - perfect .
negative	i am absolutely_furious , this has caused me stress , i have spent so much money ringing them up and being on hold , one time for 00_minutes !!!
neutral	is the fault with topcashback or sky ?

positive	thanks for the website to unlock the iphone .
negative	now lets_see what happens : (
negative	goods didn_'_t arrive so emailed them to be told delivery now 0st march .
neutral	we never received this text_message , and when we called up we were told that the system was temporarily unavailable .
positive	the goods arrive well - packed and separated into different bags for individual products so that the frozen foods are together and meat products etc .
neutral	didn ' t arrive in the 0 hours as stated .
positive	the hardback photobooks feel and look very profesional .
positive	i doubt my ipad will be breaking again any time soon with this case !
neutral	so far only ordered the tyres and tracking .
neutral	i left early because :
negative	please beware .
neutral	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
negative	i took time off work to wait in for them and of course after waiting all day from 0am ( in retrospect just a little bit optimistic i admit ) no one showed up .
neutral	in my experience , the duty managers i have encountered are inneffective individuals who are way out of their depth .
neutral	mower has performed fine so far , the delivery was supposed to be thursday with advance notification as to morning or afternoon , none was received , then came a message that due to circumstances beyond their control , the delivery would be the following_day .
positive	just had to contact them re non collection of a parcel .
negative	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
positive	they are cheap yet very reliable .
positive	peter , belfast

negative	not impressed at all .
positive	once you try them , im_sure you wont be using anyone_else .
negative	we ordered a kitchen_sink and monobloc tap .
negative	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
positive	they always arrived when expected , their work was carried_out efficiently and neatly and to a very high_standard , and they were both a pleasure to work with .
positive	fantastic !
neutral	and apparently this is what customers wanted .
neutral	the worst £_000 i ' ve ever spent and certainly will not be buying large items from them again .
positive	thanks uk water_features ; o )
neutral	that really shouldn ' t be my problem .
negative	waiting for item for a week and asked for a review in between so here it is .
positive	the website is esy to use , and their communication is excellent from start to finish .
neutral	i no_longer do my big shop at tesco , just a quick pop in and out asap if i have to .
negative	why take the order if you feel you cannot deliver ?
neutral	however , the return transfer , supplied by urbis , torremolinos , was marred by the confirmation fax having the incorrect flight time of the return flight .
neutral	but when the order turned_up the wrong glasses on the one pair were delivered i called customer_services who immediately sent a return label and within a week i had the correct pair in my hands
positive	!
neutral	the number to call from the us doesn ' t ring .
neutral	you said you would update me within 0 working_days and you didn_'_t - that '_s when i went looking for answers .
negative	as with all the other comments , avoid this company at all costs .

neutral	i ' ve had lovefilm for roughly 00 months now and originally got it as we had to get_rid of sky and free - view really doesn ' t have much choice .
positive	it has_been a pleasure to do_business with parcels to go .
neutral	postage is dearer if you are just buying 0 item but you save if you are buying several things .
positive	really like the option to print off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
neutral	about what can be quite basic issues in printing generally .
positive	was going to get flight down and drive back ( not a good idea in october ).
positive	just recieved our invitations today and i cant stop looking at them they look elegant , very professional and expensive . although they werent that expensive compared to other_sites !!!
positive	no issues arose and there was no need to ever contact them .
negative	clearly nobody at repairs0 actually cares_about their customers and tries to sort_out the issues .
neutral	if they had given a date for the order as well as the number , i might have checked .
neutral	so far , so good .
neutral	the premier version was cooked to order so you never actually got to pick and mix what appealed to you and the continental version was limited .
positive	if you want to see how a top quality , no - fuss customer_service team works , look no further than the team from snugg !
positive	the site is clear , easy to navigate , and offers free or discounted items with every purchase .
positive	super smooth_transaction and a great price for my phone
positive	would recommend to everyone , just wish i had found this sooner .
negative	i hate o0 , the customer_service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
negative	emailed hannants requesting return and refund , and was completely_ignored .
neutral	very bad customer_service he just wanted the bigger sale .
negative	guess_what ?
neutral	then my phone_call was met with " there is nobody to answer your questions as they are all being trained " hopefully in how to provide better customer service .
neutral	bearing in mind that the account is paid in advance and there is very little security in paying by debit_card i was becoming increasingly worried_about my delivery .
neutral	so far that is a 00_% failure rate !
neutral	brush up on this & you ' d be 0 star .
neutral	that would be o . k .
positive	very friendly service and all the tickets arrived within 00_hours .
neutral	i send photos on the morning of the 00rd , but they say they ' ve got no notes of me contacting them until the 00th !
positive	he was honest about what we could and couldn ' t afford , to enable us to have the luxurious honeymoon we wanted .

positive	fast delivery .
negative	the 0 games i ordered value £_00 . 00 for which my visa_card was debited for on 00th of feb duely arrived over 0 days 00 , 00 & 00th of feb impressive !

negative	this is the worst service i ever came_across - please [_external_reference_removed ], stick to [_external_reference_removed_] or [_external_reference_removed_]
negative	im speechless at such incompetence after they took a hefty deposit and " ran " ater taking my money .
neutral	i tracked the delivery most of the day and it said the order was out for delivery it got to about 0pm and this changed to delivery changed by recipient !
positive	will_definitely_use this company again .
positive	pimlico_plumbers have been dealing_with a leak that was discovered under our living_room .
neutral	probably the fault of the supplier rather_than discountedheating , but better communication between all parties may have helped .
neutral	since then i have sent several further messages , finally receiving a reply apologising for the delay in replying and asking for another date , which i gave .
neutral	honest enough for you ebuyer ?
negative	now it seems to be only indian restaurants offering deals .
neutral	you know the odds are chiefly in your favour , but they do put the doubts on you ?
positive	thanks for the pfaff 0000 sewing_machine .
neutral	recently flew with ryanair and to be on the safe side opted for a baggage_allowance so not to be stung with added fees at the airport .
negative	four days_later i received an_email_saying the item had been despatched .
negative	as i hadn_'_t heard_anything by 00th_december i contacted darren reay and was informed he had a throat infection .
negative	they have indian based customer support and their level of customer support is 0 .
neutral	in the last_year , some of there products were swapped out for " new and improved " but actually were cheap unmixable and tasted yuck and in bags instead of tubs .
neutral	however my buyer used their solicitors and i must_say it was stressful , they needed constant chasing up by the buyer and my solicitors .
negative	i ordered 0x 0 - seater samara sofas on the 00th or 00th_december .
neutral	i was shocked to find they were so unhelpful , rude and unwilling to help .
positive	in the afternoon we did a pub treasure_hunt , this was great fun and set the rest of the days drinking up well !
negative	useless bunch of cowboys , avoid at all costs .

neutral	and suggested that i have my mother send over her bank_statements proving that the ipod was purchased by her , 0 days after my birthday .
positive	i recently transferred some eur and exchanged into gbp .
negative	virgin_media , the company that suddenly offeres cheap deals to people when i used to pay thru the roof for half bit 0mb bb service with no sky_tv channels .
neutral	shame the sellers fees are soooo expensive and not being_able to leave non paying / rubbish buyers negative_feedback is really poor
negative	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
positive	as it arrived very quick the chilly powder a super hot just how the family like it order gluten_free flour made great bread with my bread maker
neutral	i received delivery the next_day which was great !
negative	i had ordered a car vent mount for a blackberry 0000 ( 0000 ).
negative	i searched the internet and read some of the reviews and thought they are a good company to go with to sell my ipad they quoted me a good price , then i sent it via_royal_mail special delivery costing_£_00 i then received an_email_saying it had been requoted when i checked it was for half the amount of the original quote !!
negative	i have contacted them 0 times and have yet to receive a reply , have also tried to ring them without_success .
negative	i asked them to send them out by recorded_delivery instead .
negative	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
neutral	i much prefer amazon .
positive	you have never failed to deliver a car battery next_day for battery megastore .
negative	yodel : im_afraid this has_been delivered david .
negative	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
negative	and of course , we all lost out completely so i am eu000 out of pocket ( including viagogo '_s admin_fee ).
neutral	they were exclusive to debenhams .
neutral	i always like giving unknown companies a chance , well , you blew it .
neutral	i just love aldi shops .
negative	i will never ever buy again from you
neutral	the service was good the only thing that could have been better is : i sent a number of mobile_phones in an on the contract it stated i would receve the money owed to me within 00_hrs , i kept looking at mybank to see ifthe money had been paid in this went on for one week , finaly i contacted mazumamobile an i was told ther was a problem with my order as i had not stated one of the phones had a damaged screen admitedly that was a fault on my part but an_email or phone call to explain the hold up would be nice other than this i was completely happy wiv the service .
negative	emailed the hotel back and was told there is no booking for you , contacted alpha_rooms again kept on hold for over 00_minutes there is not a problem the booking is confirmed , emailed the hotel still no booking showing for us , i have rang alpha_rooms again on hold for over 00_minutes at premium_rate , i asked for a call back to confirm everything was in order sorry i have 0 customers in a queue cant call you back well sorry is not good enough i am stressed enough without all this , customer service is appalling , unable to understand the indian service advisor very broken accent , stuck as have paid money and leave in 0 weeks we just wanted a break with our family before my husbands surgery , sort your act out , you should be_ashamed of your total_lack of service , i have contacted hotel to see if we have a booking or not i am disgusted with you
neutral	this was okay but the price went up from that quoted online .
positive	originally it was out of stock on the website , so i enquired when it will be back in stock .
positive	turn_around was excellent although post service was slow , especially when we were so keen to get the book .
neutral	it '_s not worth the £ 0 extra for the ' over night ' delivery service as the company they have a deal with don_'_t deliver on saturdays where as good old snail_mail do .
negative	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
positive	excellent service
positive	!
positive	0 hour eta .
negative	again i am sorry you feel so strongly about your aspect experience .
positive	not only is myprotein . co . uk considerably_cheaper then the high_street , it tastes a lot better and feels_like a lot better quality than the high_street brands .
positive	have tried the gravy today and must_say its yummy i love loads though so used all the pouch lol xx
neutral	when i rang , the girl said that we owed less_than what i said , it appeared that their site was not updated , so no its not the best , that '_s why they ' re cheap !
neutral	dicebay on the other hand could only be bothered to send me an automatic refund notice through paypal two days_later with no apology or explanation .
neutral	well what do you know , i received not one , but two tripods on 0th_october a month after my order .
negative	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
neutral	so ao had not cancelled anything but passed this on to an outside insurance company .
neutral	had multiple instances where i ' ve requested a refund or explanation regarding an item and being ignored until i got paypal to intervene .
positive	great price , secure shipping and on time !!!!!!!
positive	!
negative	!
neutral	everytime i have phoned customer_services i have usually had a bad_experience , either they mess an order up or they are just generally crap and they stick me on hold for 00 + minutes .
positive	they have the skills to build a wide_variety of website solutions and have a firm hold on cutting - edge technologies .
neutral	they are always beyond the specified delivery date , and not just a couple of days either .
negative	i thought i would use their price_match promise , quoting another sites product .
positive	i couldn_'_t believe they were selling the tyres that i wanted for £_00 !
neutral	he looked at his schedule and gave us the times .
positive	sent back using free - post provided then received correct item very next_day .
negative	they just making me wait longer and now i dont think i will get anything back

positive	heidi nordsell
negative	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer_service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look_into the problem and get back to you .
negative	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
neutral	we only discovered where they had been left by_accident .
negative	very disappointed :(
negative	i waited , listening to the same looped music for 00_minutes to be told nothing had been logged from my previous call .
neutral	?
positive	nice experience .
negative	no problem with that , these things happen .
neutral	the fact that prices are quoted on a monthly_basis , but then billing is quarterly ( and manual ) is very odd .
negative	it is almost_impossible to get through on the phones , i have been hung_up on twice , and each member of customer_service told me a different thing each time .
negative	they told me they will call back , no one called so rang again now the 0th time .
neutral	they do have some bargains .
positive	i can thoroughly_recommend them .
negative	i have now rung them again and have given the info again i have also contacted my credit_card company and they are going to launch there own investigation now .
neutral	i have just ordered from this company ; the ordering was simple ( big deal - would you expect it to be difficult ?
positive	chuffed to bits that i found these_guys and will_defiantly use them again .
neutral	when placing an order remeber their warranty service is just as likely to give you a partial_refund as a fixed or replacment item and they will try and get one over on you for as little as £ 0 .
neutral	ordered an iphone0 from them a friday_evening and received it the next thursday .
positive	i would recommend zavvi to anybody .
neutral	which is great for you .
negative	avoid !
neutral	*
positive	i would seriously advise_anyone of my friends and family to purchase a car from them in the future as i know i will be .

positive	good company , good honests and hard working people , and extremely_helpful .
negative	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
positive	we have been in the pc business for over 00 years & appreciate what we can rely_on !
positive	big up urban_industry
negative	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
neutral	only thing that confuses me if submitting passport details do you still need to do this if i paid for tickets to be sent out by post ?
neutral	they should definitely implement a system where notes are made about previous cars they have fitted such as a wheel_nut cap or access restrictions .
negative	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
positive	was a little_worried because i only got confirmation of payment from paypal and not from bedworld , so i wasn_'_t 000_% sure they were going to deliver on the day i chose but they did .
neutral	i have tried to order several things from next on the " order before 0 . 00 p . m . - receive next_day " service as advertised on tv .
negative	they start charging for their call package even before your line is switched to them !
negative	theres no beginning to their talents - just years of endless errors - even sold my data - was fine when it was abbey - have now moved to another bank - poorly trained staff , even they themselves finally admitted they had expanded too quickly have messed_up big time - and its in every possible . they even get a rare red flag - avoid !
negative	thanks for reading .
negative	i also have a contract for a phone i got for my mum which is due for renewal , they phoned me today to try to sell me a new contract but obviously i will be looking elsewhere , so that '_s 0 customers they have lost ( husband won_'_t use them again either ).
positive	wow amazing delivery time .
neutral	i think yodel seem to be improving as there are more positives here these days and , i have to say that , i have had a series of no - problem deliveries by yodel .
neutral	i spent 0 calls each over an_hour trying to achieve this simple objective and yet they still managed to mess it up and didn ' t deliver the booster kit on the first attempt .

positive	amazing !
positive	will 000_% be using them from now on .
positive	as above ordered on the monday_morning and had the game by tuesday tea time ( i just used the royal_mail free service ) hitman for 00 pounds bargain as its 00 everywhere_else .
negative	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt_like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn ' t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
neutral	if vodafone sort the signal problems out especially in my area i ' d be happy to give them a 0 star .
positive	fair car were the cheapest car_rental by_far and we were very happy with the service .

negative	slow dispatch time .
negative	!
neutral	this weekend ), but today the hotel informed me they have no record of my booking .
neutral	but their meat is usually excellent - so even if you can match the price you need to be sure that you are also matching the quality .

neutral	so i will not be using stressfree parking again .
positive	well_done

positive	good products with great service
positive	ordered frontline for my cats late_afternoon and the goods arrived by 00 . 00 a . m the next_morning .
neutral	i don ' t mind if an item is out of stock , but a quick email_stating that , and an estimated_delivery date would have been great .
negative	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
negative	i was furious . why would i want credits i haven ' t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
negative	the phone was on airplane mode for the whole holiday , bare in mind this is an iphone_0s .
positive	with out any problem , after following the instructions , i had got my iphone immediately .
positive	helpful and polite conversation .
neutral	will think_twice before using this service again .
neutral	i ordered a pair of headphones on 00th_april_0000 .

neutral	but if it says " 00_% of orders shipped within 0 days !
positive	whilst he was still outside my house , his office phoned to confirm this and off he went .
neutral	goods usually turn_up early .
negative	they claim then to have delivered the package to a local post_office , who themselves have refused the delivery !
neutral	so don_'_t be a seller on ebay - be a buyer :)
negative	when i visited her on saturday i saw the flowers and was so annoyed , angry and sad to know that the money i had paid had only given such a low quality of flowers .
neutral	they probably need to sort this out if they wish to be the " premier provider of cd_keys ".
neutral	only a decent price will bring me back , and only if i ' m in no hurry to receive it .
neutral	i recived them today .
positive	aktuell bin ich auf arbeitssuche und habe verschiedene suchmaschinen ausprobiert , um die passende zu finden .
neutral	* sigh *
neutral	it '_s a very slow service at times , maybe because of the security but it should be faster_than it is especially as they have so much money to spend on technical staff !
neutral	you can pretty_much get stationery at the same price or cheaper from online and offiline retail_stores including poundland !
negative	however you booked the order with yodeldirect and we have not been contacted to ask for the item to be returned .
neutral	the only true benefit of going to halfords is if there ' s one near you and your are desperate for a particular item same day , otherwise it ' s always best to shop around either to independents or online stores .
positive	purchased some linctus which comes in a bottle - could easily be broken if not packaged properly .
positive	can '_t fault them

positive	great service fast delivery bought for my self but the dog thinks it a great bed to .
negative	the company doesn ' t respect the warranty_period , doesn ' t answer complaints , lies .
neutral	good communication but if you want it asap keep an eye on your emails after you place order so that you can send a copy of utility_bill and avoid adding to lead time .
positive	this is how i knew about ebookers for the first time .
positive	great customer service .

neutral	had not been fitted , had to return the item to have this mistake rectified .
positive	i have encountered some problems with other_sites like keys that have not been sent for few_days or similar .
negative	every little hurts as this monster forces smaller shops off the high_street and makes other_supermarkets drag their values and quality down to compete with tesco '_s base levels .
negative	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
negative	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
neutral	by the time ebay take their cut , paypal take their cut you ' ve lost a massive chunk out of the end price .
positive	support is amazing as well .
positive	order confirmations , despatch notifications , everything on time , delivery within 0 mins of estimate , emails clear and well_laid_out and a timely follow_up for feedback .
neutral	unless you buy with one of their deals it ' s not worthwhile , way too expensive !
neutral	det_er bare en meget træls oplevelse , hvis ikke det_er til at finde på forsiden !
negative	pathetic .
neutral	however customer_services were great and i returned the product with no hassle .
negative	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .

negative	i called numerious times and the customer_service was hard to go through .
neutral	i had filled my trolly with all the bits i wanted and decided i had enough , while unloading onto the conveyor i notice that some of the food was passed it sell by date , and passed it by like a week .
neutral	while they haven ' t been a dodgy ticket reseller like viagogo and seatwave , it does make you wonder_how much effort ticketmaster put in to stopping such companies bulk buying tickets from them .
positive	it ' s very rare i ' d buy from a site without reading a review about them first , but i made an exception with cult_pens within 00_minutes of browsing and wasn ' t dissapointed .
positive	i have no hesitations about recommending holidays_please and using them again for ourselves !
neutral	i ordered a cabinet and although it looks good and sturdy the melamine cover is thin and the chipboard beneath is not dense enough to purvey a sense of quality .
negative	wander how they would try and cover that up .
neutral	i have stayed there once before and could not have been happier , i have since consistently thought of it as the best b_& b in the world .
positive	standard delivery chosen , item arrived next_day !
negative	in the meantime i ordered the same camera at a cheaper price from a uk supplier and received it within two days .
neutral	the airline gets to from a to b ( usually via a train into the city ) but it ' s value for money . cheaper_than the rest for what i wanted .
neutral	added to this , there was no flower feed included .
positive	everything went smooth !
negative	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
neutral	after another couple of days , the first parcel had been delivered , but the second had now gone back to paris , back to london , back to paris , and then to holland , and might be delivered the next_day .
neutral	really annoying when i spent 0 hours doing online shopping and their clubcard service went down .
positive	everything was really quick .

positive	he took the trouble to get to know us , our circumstances , our needs and the plans that we had for the future .
positive	does as it says !
negative	it took many minutes for there to be any reply and eventually she spoke to a man who could find no trace of our order . after some time he decided to transfer us to the branch .
neutral	i would definitely go back as a customer .
positive	but i can say now - it has well exceeded my expectations .
positive	got me in touch with the right supplier who provided the part i needed at a great price and delivered it in super quick time !
positive	simply excellent service .
negative	it clearly says that the brake fluid should be changed at 0 years or 00000 miles , but apparently the garage did not consult the manufacturer ’_s servicing schedule .
positive	[_name ] gave great service with a friendly and helpful attitude
positive	worktops do require complete oiling , but worth doing to pick your own finish .
positive	:)
neutral	this will need to be replaced with something that is actually clear since it imparts its frosted texture to the film cells - basically buggering up the look of the whole_thing .

negative	whilst there are genuine sellers i saw one locally which looked to be good to be true .
positive	:) the methods of payments you have a choice of , and with in a couple of hours of them receiving my laptop , and assessing it , they then made the payment the same day .
neutral	this had been overlooked and it was duly processed and we received a refund for this part of the bill within a few_days .
positive	all in all i think this company and product was a brilliant find .
neutral	if the page was headed with the cost and reason for it that would not be so bad .
neutral	it is ok if you have a light and small parcel that is easy to carry some distance , but not for heavier parcels .
negative	i told them i want the full_amount , and we kept sending messages ( no clear or fast action has been taken ).
positive	saved my life from the constant moaning especially as my daughter can wear them to school as they are black ha_ha_ha
neutral	good communication until the delivery was despatched , then i think they were let_down by yodel .
neutral	british telecom don_'_t make me laugh , call_center in some foreign country cannot understand the operatives .

neutral	shipping was very slow .
neutral	i remember buying a bag and it took_ages to arrive !
neutral	it had taken 00 working_days to deliver to nz .
negative	it would appear that when my cousin unwrapped her flowers , she was , to say the least very disappointed - i had up graded the order too - so i am very , very upset and since she has tried to contact serenata , she has_been met with unacceptable communication and very unhelpful customer service personnel - she has tried to complain on my behalf , but has_been met with insolent and rude_conduct on the part of their staff .
positive	saved in buying a new pc for at_least a year or more .
negative	the website did not tell me a credit_card would be required .
neutral	i have installed wordpress on other_sites hosted on other_companies using fantastico etc and found that very easy .

negative	they advertised that it would take two days to process an order , and three or four days to deliver .
neutral	i am happy with my purchase just not happy with the fact that because i forgot to use planet rock sound savers as i ' m new to their site , both myself and planet rock sound savers contacted you to see if you would still agree to me getting my 0 . 0 % commission back through them .
neutral	when a customer writes or emails a company and demonstrates that they are probably ready to spend money if the company is able to supply the appropriate item , only a foolish company fails to respond .

neutral	the good thing about the site is that all available options are shown , so . there will always be options of every kind for everybody ' s needs .
positive	i have always loved domino ' s pizza prob my favourite food !
negative	they also suggest me to ask the agency to contact klm because the trade department of klm would only deal with agencies instead of individuals .
positive	i found the website easy to navigate .
positive	then cocktail_making , will definatly book again with the girls , wished i ' d known about this years_ago , the fun nights we could of had there !!
negative	the fitter then ask us to sing some paper_work tell us that it was the delivery note for the windows that needed signing on 0 form as there was no carbon copy 0 form was placed over the first with just the signature line showing .
negative	now they have written demanding the £_00 they say i owe them , threatening me with debt_collectors and damaging my credit rating .
negative	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren ' t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too_late to order elsewhere saying they couldn ' t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran out of stock ).
positive	half our later i got the comfirmation saying it was shipped .

negative	fine .
neutral	brooking was easy and we got all the info in time checking in was easy too as we could skip the queues as we had reserved tickets the only issue i had was that i found the way the pricing was worded a little_confusing as it split the cost of the hotel and the flights but the pricing was reflected in a minus on the confirmation i called the helpline which they had given as part of the info and the chap on the end of the phone was really helpful so it was sorted no problem .
neutral	got the gate 00 min before we flew out and spent a few mins waiting for the bus to take us to the plane .
positive	when i ' ve used the next_day service the goods have always arrived on time .
negative	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
neutral	i ' d advise you to improve that - either by changing this address to customer_service or adding clear feedback from your mail server that email has not been delivered .

negative	anyway to cut along story short , today ( 00th janaury ) they have finally admitted they have no stock and are cancelling the order and refunding my money .
neutral	i realise that these latches aren_'_t the dearest in the world but they should all operate properly - in my opinion ironmongery_direct have a fairly serious quality_control issue with the latch manufacturer that needs urgent attention .
negative	talktalk just not being honest to its customers and do not really care about them .
negative	carphone warheouse under the auspices of mobile . co . uk automatically set_up a subscription to a gadget helpline which is deducted from your bank_account every six_months to the tune of £_00 . 00 just enough not to notice but a nice little_earner .

negative	will never use this company again !
neutral	makes it hard to keep_track of all your tabs , ya know ?
neutral	the mac edition backup software does not work with the mac lion x operating software as it turns_out , with no solution according to iomega .

negative	multiple holes on top where the carpenter had forgotten to fill the holes .
negative	it is an_absolute joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
negative	there was no card or message on the flowers .
positive	blackcircles . com provided the tyres i required and were the cheapest price along with tesco club card points , it was a no_brainer .
negative	maybe they have not in stock items bought and make the customer wait .
negative	groupon then refused to compensate use for their error and even accept any responsibility - it took use almost a month to get our money back .
positive	i was able to contact the friendly staff by telephone and have it amended .
neutral	and before you think my idea of ' average ' is impossibly high , i just want to say that my expectations for a somewhat hefty price - tag in the region of £_000 was that it would at_least be as good as similarly - priced off - the - rack stuff from the department stores .
positive	a real_life_saver when it comes to purchasing books for university .
negative	phone british_gas . i didn ' t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .

positive	my tickets are already here and they tell me what area and row i will be sitting in , so camera at the ready .
neutral	and i would guess they got bad quality devices
neutral	cheapest by far , but needed the items in a hurry and there was nothing to indicate that there would be a hold up .
negative	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer_service and incorrect bills .
negative	give information to trace the parcel , notable thing is i sent 0 parcels which was quite heavy big boxes so how they lost ???
negative	!
neutral	i just cant understand_why every electrical item ive ordered , doesnt work !
positive	they don ' t charge any commision ( not sure how they make their money ) but its truly simple to do , and i think it ' s only 00_% u have to pay and then u can cancel within 00_hours or something like that .
negative	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
negative	limited hotels etc too !
negative	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .
negative	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
positive	paypal to pay was very useful as well .
neutral	the price was reasonable but had cheaper flights with more leg_room !
negative	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
neutral	they do not reqard loyalty .
negative	still , looking at other reviews , at_least it wasn ' t left inside a bin or with thieves in the neighbourhood .
negative	.
neutral	could be quite a fun way to get your own back on people you don ' t like .
neutral	i received a reply to state they appreciate my frustration but as only the back of the unit was damaged a replacement part has_been ordered .
positive	myself and 0 other ladies were picked_up at_faro_airport by a meet and greet gentleman , taken promptly and picked_up a few_days from the same spot .
neutral	they ' ve just come out and asked me to reassess my review on trustpilot as well , so i think it ' s pretty clear their motivation for good customer_service isn ' t to ensure i get what i paid for , but protecting their reputation .
negative	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
positive	diy would be my first , and probably only , port of call if i have another kitchen to refit .
negative	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus .
positive	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
positive	my delivery came next_day , for a little extra charge , i was worried as a few reviews said delivery was slow , but it depends if you pay extra or not which i happily did !
positive	many_thanks for the speedy turn - around on my order .
positive	will_definitely_recommend to all my friends and family .
neutral	definitely would use them again , but perhaps research the destination venues a bit better next time .
positive	secure , warm , comfortable , plenty of hot_water , well located and good value .
positive	got my glasses this morning and love them !
neutral	no response to emails sent regarding the above , was going to order around 00 but glad i got just a sample few now .
negative	avoid them they are hyping all their prices .
neutral	the staff are a very mixed bunch .
positive	exceptionally helpful in getting the delivery made on time by delaying the postal van specifically for my order , good / quick customer support so far in dealing_with a query_regarding the item i bought - a marantz pmd000 .
negative	yes i made a genuine error in assuming basin and bath_taps are one and the same , but this companies entire attitude and lack of due dilligence and care is appalling !
negative	. i ' ve never been given that back . all as i ' ve been given is the meter wiped .
neutral	thanks for taking the time to read this comment mazuma team and i hope you have a very nice day .
negative	i have stopped shopping there even_though sainsburys is right on my door_step , i perfer to walk a mile to [_link_removed_] as it means my shopping bill is alot cheeper .
negative	well , my gf and i were looking into buying a car with cash but decided to take a look at stebbings with a view to finance on a car .
positive	order more as they let you see out but also give privacy
positive	in the future , when i can ' t find any telephone_numbers or email addresses for the hostels i want to book , i will book through your website once again .
neutral	just what i needed .
negative	they are then contacting me asking to lt them fulfill the order ; have it by the end of the week etc .
neutral	so generally missguided is super cheap and has a massive_range of clothes .
neutral	two_weeks_later , i am yet to receive product .
positive	was given constant_updates on progress and most impressive were the actual dispatch and delivery details that were spot on .
positive	not only do they seem to have the cheapest prices , but the website actually informs you of other cheaper products you may wish to consider .
negative	i sent them on june 00rd .
neutral	i waited about 00 days and then sent an_email to the company to chase up the order .
positive	this site is awesome !
neutral	the trustpilot system has worked well to improve customer conversions , however , the automated email generation system leaves a lot to be desired .
positive	the plumber and carpenter who undertook the work , manolo leon - roman and david braidford , were highly skilled and worked very quickly to locate the leak and to fix it .
positive	also it '_s really easy to amend your profile .
negative	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
negative	waaaayyyyyyy down , buried in the faq - it states that you must make a phone order , to get " express "- yeah - they tell you , but of course you are only reading the faq on shipping , when you are looking for you product , hmmm " sketchy "- a little late to see that htey are just using the name ups / fedex to fool their clients - into thinking they are quick .
negative	i knocked at the door and i got no answer .
negative	two hours_later i have still not received a phone call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
neutral	it was too small - about 00 ".
negative	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
neutral	that was not a problem but their lack of communication was and no apologies for the poor communication either .
negative	never using them again and also reporting them to watchdog .
negative	!
positive	excellent products at very good prices .
positive	super service .
negative	i have yet to receive notification and had to ask my friends if they had received the flowers .
neutral	i haven ' t research about this company until i ordered the fuji finepix s000exr camera .
neutral	i raise a ticket and they do reply very quickly ( queried my delivery today , got a reply within 0 minutes ) - so maybe those complaining that they never hear back should check their junk_mail folder first .
positive	this company to me is the best and easiest holiday insurance company to deal with online and i have never even had to speak to them .
positive	castlegate have some lovely designs that you don_'_t see on other sights , and having bought quite a few on my last order i can say that they are very high_quality in the flesh .
negative	i tried the [_private data ] phone number mentioned below , but it has_been deactivated now . hardly surprising .
negative	nothing arrived .
negative	so .
negative	i telephoned the number on there website which they state " if you require a mac_code please telephone .", to be told we do not deal or issue mac codes so just tell your new provider that you do not need one .
neutral	so overall , good fast service , poor courier
negative	i have given them all the information they have asked for but they seem to be incapable of imputing numbers into a computer correctly .
neutral	arrived 00th_january - better late than never .
positive	most places i looked on google had mention of snugg and good reviews so i decided o try one of there cases .
negative	resten var allerede udsolgt .
positive	we purchased our new dishwasher from appliance planet after_reading great reviews on both the appliance and the supplier ’_s website .
positive	sicuramente acquisterò ancora su sunglasses_shop !
positive	the parcel arrived on time and in perfect_condition
neutral	iphone sbloccato tramite imei e funzionante con ogni scheda !
positive	and my product was absolutly fine .
neutral	delivery driver was pleasant , and i made sure i didn ' t miss it this time by being at the door before he even got out the van .
negative	amazingly , on requesting a refund last_night , my wife gets a call today from amazon , confirming they have located our missing box ( after saying there was only one box ) and would arrange a second delivery ( another day of work for my wife ).
neutral	but low on leg_room now and again but who can complain ?
negative	!
positive	new laptop arrived exactly when advised and the communication from the delivery company was very organised .
positive	the best supp source online .
positive	they replied to all my emails within a day - once i realised this was the case keeping_track of the order was great , as they could tell me exactly_what was going on , and they even install linux on the pc for me for a very reasonable additional_cost .
negative	it appears that interlink who has a legal contract with my business , are more than happy to employ staff who blatantly break the terms of this contract and then lie through their back teeth to protect themselves .
neutral	when it arrived .
negative	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
negative	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i ' m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
neutral	my appointment had already been booked , but there were others who were going for their first consultation who appeared to be treated with more priority .
neutral	i ' ve often taken returns back to store for a refund or even an exchange but it has always been a hassle .
neutral	but everyone_knows that just_eat takes half an_hour over the stated delivery time . all my friends have said the same_thing .
positive	but it '_s arrived , in perfect_condition , and i ' m really happy !
positive	danke !
neutral	two and a half weeks to deliver a shower_mixer .
positive	would definitely use again and recommend .
neutral	ie no liability on ourselves if we did not make the connection with the other flight ( uk to spain ), due to no fault of our own .
positive	she showed us everything we wanted to see and gave us time and space to make a decision .
positive	i was being charged a lot more_than i was told .
negative	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
positive	i am very impressed with the ease with which i could make an informed_decision on my hostel booking .
neutral	someone from the company taking me seriously and wanting to respond because they were concerned about customer_relations .
positive	great company :-)
neutral	when i did get the returns number , the process was smooth and easy .
positive	very happy with urban_industry and will_continue to order from them in the future !
neutral	even world of warcraft uses two factor authentication now !!!!
negative	the customer experience is everything and as businesses like comet and countless others discovered deliver this or go out of business .
positive	brilliant service at very competitive_prices .
negative	i sent 0 - 0 emails asking where the product was .
negative	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
positive	pc_specialist would contact me an_email at each_stage of the order , whether for it having been built , in its testing phase and when it was ready to dispatch , which was also a lot quicker then i thought it would be , meaning i could get back to gaming faster the i thought !
neutral	used the live_chat service to ask the question but no one replied :(
neutral	if you ' re considering getting the wifiplug in order to do some " serious " home automation , look_elsewhere .
positive	the merchant had since stopped trading so i was slightly distressed , contacting flubit to hopefully rectify the issue .
negative	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
positive	shannon rao
negative	pc_world - if you take_note of these review_sites .
positive	a good range of products but the dispatch and delivery were impressive .
negative	and they promised me to call me back either within 00_minutes , or phone me back in the very next morning .
positive	very easy to use , lovely choice and free delivery to my mothers ( fairly out of the way , rural ) address .
negative	if i come to a house and fix the boiler and ask for £_000 but i am not going to tell the customer what it is for , would they pay me ?
neutral	i was initially impressed with the free help and then the subsequent improvements to my cv but was always annoyed that they never seemed to truly listen to what i needed .
positive	i received a text_message reminding me of the order arrival and the delivery guys were really helpful and very accommodating on quite a tough delivery .
positive	she understood what i wanted from my trip and got me the best possible deal .
negative	you would think that with the amount of money we spend with them , we would be treated as a priority and they would do their best to keep us however when i expressed my dissatisfaction and the fact we will be looking to leave , the response i got from the manager there was " ok ".
positive	i was surprised to see such negative_reviews for them on this site .
positive	we used looking0parking to book bournemouth airport_parking and found them to give good reliable service .
neutral	was only emailed a response late in the afternoon going onto evening .
neutral	when i rebooked collection for the second attempt , i asked for the courier to be given my mobile number in case of any_problems .
positive	i think their prices may be lower too .
negative	comments please .
negative	on a recent_purchase , back in april i found the edt had no smell , when i asked if its poss its old stock or fake i was assured all items sold are brand_new and genuine , i sent the product to the manufacturer for examination and was told it was 00 years old and been discontinued many_years_ago !
neutral	the items were satisfactory and were delivered quickly .
negative	now these socks were supposed to be a well_known brand but are the poorest quality socks i have ever purchased and the inside if full of dangling threads which i imagine would get caught in your toes when putting on .
neutral	delivered on time however forgot the logo on the arm so had to return to be completed
neutral	had been with them for many_years , but now they are beyond a joke , always increasing there prices , what for ? more repeats & tell them your leaving well in advance & they try all ways to hit you with extra billing , but thank heaven for good solicitors , for if i get another letter requsting payment for something_else , that is who will be handling it so sky subscribers bewar of what could happen to you if you decide to leave , my advice is always copy any correspondence from day 0 & always keep a diary of who you spoke to , time & date ,& what coversation was about so watch this space over the next couple of weeks ?
negative	i had posted a review for a company i ' ve been using for quite some time .
positive	very helpful when my web connection misbehaved .
neutral	one last thought , if this is a duplicate order & i happen to end up with two tents , how exactly are you going to pick_up the duplicate considering i live on an island 00 miles offshore ?
positive	great company to deal with .
neutral	i '_ve been looking for my new ski boots .
neutral	it should be more balanced .
positive	study material that has been provided is good .
positive	both products excellent , delivered within two days and have been a fantastic upgrade to my ailing netgear homeplug kit .
positive	firstly , the whole circle of brie , super - creamy , delicious and by far the best ever eaten !!!
neutral	oh well i guess £_00 is better_than nothing !
negative	i contacted sp via_email to ask for a full_refund of my credit balance and to check that they had received my final meter_readings .
positive	great site .
positive	thank_you mysupermarket !
negative	one call . to someone_else , more like !
positive	00 / 00
negative	so obviously customers requirements are immediately disregarded .
negative	when i called the customer_service department the operator made me feel_like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .
positive	do i need a new lamy biro , some turquoise ink , beautiful scandinavian dotted paper - i so do !
neutral	however i ordered during xmas_period and it was only after three working_days had elapsed after xmas that i was notified despatch was occurring , by this time i had received delivery of another item from another supplier that i placed at exactly the same time so i was quite concerned when on checking with po track and trace the po indicated that they had not received my item from the small independent castleberg people !
neutral	did email and attempt to call to chase up my item , but not response was obtained .
negative	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
positive	i placed my order at 0000 one evening and it was with me before lunchtime the next_day .
negative	orange refuse to upgrade me wihtout a charge - would be happy to allow me to buy out remainding terms of my contract .
neutral	the different hirers also have different bureaucracy and some are very old_fashioned and it takes_ages , and you have to repeat information you have already provided .
neutral	the service was very good considering the flight was full .
negative	you have been well warned as with other reviews .
neutral	ordered from this site a lot , generally they are quite good with getting stuff to you quick but i ordered a game from them that i really wanted and it was only in stock here but it wouldn ' t let me , they just kept cancelling my order which led me to believe that it wasn ' t actually in stock so there you go .
positive	good communication .
negative	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
neutral	at the time of writing the second account has still not been sorted .
positive	so far , so good . now all i have to do is start travelling with the knowledge that everything that might happen can be sorted out !
positive	day to day delivery .
neutral	empty to empty or full to full is much fairer .)
neutral	quite fast and easy way to book but experience some difficulties while using the payment_method via credit_card
negative	that said , none of these issues are my personal concern , however , can be understandable to an extent .
neutral	are studio re - sending out returned items by mistake ?
neutral	goods very good , price a bit high when you add up the bits in the end solution , but their contracted dpd driver misdelivered resulting in a three day extra delay and if i had not tracked the item it might still be out there .
neutral	i think next time i ' d book with p_& o , the extra £_00 is worth it .
neutral	the delivery was quick and the price was slightly_cheaper_than what i pay from my opticians
negative	i couldn ' t even start .
positive	large database of places around the world .
positive	so i thought i would give it a go , and with in 0mins after registration and telephone verification i had 00 months ps plus instantly .
negative	achica owe me £_000 which i still have not received .
positive	i bought the earphones as a present for my husband .
negative	truly unbelievable , and atrocious , ' so
neutral	i cannot possibly tell the sender how awful the flowers were .
neutral	was given a delivery date so made sure i was home , waited all day nothing delivered .
negative	i took it back and they wanted another £_000 plus to fix .
negative	them : " no we don ' t have one ."
positive	- track your ip_address , you bet .
positive	!
neutral	get your stock_levels sorted !
negative	£_00 for overnight delivery and it will now be 00 days .
positive	both arrived in less_than 00_hours which was very impressive considering the time of year .
positive	the service was outstanding - the game arrived quickly and in perfect_condition .
positive	since then , my daughter has bought the same one and loves it .
negative	hdnl ' s customer_service is ridiculous as they have no quality_control and the delivery drivers do not seem accountable to anyone .
negative	today 00 feb_0000 i rang this company to see why my order had not been delivered .
neutral	wowcher have arranged to refund my credit_card with the £_00 i paid for the deal but i have lost out on the £ 0 postage i had to pay to miss amazing to fulfill the order .
neutral	it took a week for them to even start the shipping process and then another week for delivery , if your in a rush don ' t use this site but if your not in a rush then you couldn ' t do any better prices are great and 0 %_off your first order ,
positive	hostelbookers is a great website for travelling .
negative	i shall e_mail your site again to say that this must be escalated to senior level as it is beyond a joke .
negative	telephone support is only available on weekdays and ends at 00 : 00 .
negative	i ordered a nikon l000 and case on 00 july_0000 , they said it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days , it wasn ' t .
positive	i '_ve used por00 in the past so i knew it would work as it should , i '_ll be more than happy to use frost '_s again no_fuss no bother job_done .
positive	i would highly_recommend ebuyer . com for its quick shipping of products and prices are better_than the high_street stores and you can also shop until 00pm and get the products the next_day
neutral	slow to give out amazon vouchers , when i have opted for that claim method .
negative	i ordered a completely standard pair of glasses on 00th .
negative	i order an ipad retina 000gb wifi and cellular on 00th_december via pay and collect ( not reserve and collect ).
negative	the simple point the " expert " roy still can '_t grasp is that a thermostat that has_been working_perfectly for 0 months has to have something more than the setting wrong if it suddenly stops working .
negative	disgusting customer care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
positive	very patient and understanding sales_team .
neutral	overall not the worst place to buy a pre_owned watch , but check your purchase on arrival . after paying out at the higher end of my budget i didnt expect to have extra work ontop to get the watch upto standard .
positive	sh0t happens !.
positive	they deliver usually within their own deadlines which is very impressive and i have never been anything other than 000_% delighted .
positive	i consequently bid and won the sink and it was delivered 000_miles undamaged within a few_days .
negative	this email will confirm your bank server has accepted the refund transaction .
neutral	very good value overall .
neutral	the asda site is easy to use - however unlike rival sites it doesn_'_t store your instore shopping .
positive	abloomnova offers all the best products at wonderful prices . but the most impressive thing about this business is the excellent customer service .
neutral	what you get :
positive	would definitely recommend .
positive	each time that i have used these_people the service has_been excellent .
negative	this email will confirm your bank server has accepted the refund transaction .
neutral	the man then sent us to a different coach who obviously wasn ' t expecting us .
positive	it ' s by_far the best !
positive	the ease at booking a night is so good .
positive	it ' s very easy to use the website and information is good .
neutral	i have been on live_chat trying to resolve things for up to 0 hours at a time ( probably because you wait around 00_minutes in between each question before you get an answer !!
negative	i have not received the perfume , and it cost me £_00 . 00 i am very disapointed in this company and want a refund of my money .
negative	explain_why your system took the order & didnt tell me that you were out of stock ?
positive	brilliant service - almost too quick !
negative	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
neutral	ebay is fine when the sun shines , but when it rains they will take your umbrella off you .
negative	there was no double_bed , only a day bed with a pull out bed .
neutral	one month on the beds wheels are falling_off and the bed_frame is wobbly .
positive	i love all of the zaggora products !
positive	excellent value for money , no hassle_free delivery .
positive	easy ordering on line though you need to plan a few_days ahead to make an_appointment with a fitter and to be sure the tyres are in stock with your name on them .
negative	at about 0pm i decided to look at the tracking_info and it had been returned to the service centre after a failed 0rd attempt !!
neutral	no replies no responce !
positive	very happy with my product and the cheap deal i got .
neutral	extremely pleased with the price and simplicity of the system however the configuration of my phones was causing one not to register , the tech files did not explain the connection of more than one phone in a network , despite soho00 being designed for businesses .
negative	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
negative	i have had the gate arms 00 months and have a major problem , in that the arm casing has broken ( 0yr warrantry ).
positive	with little knowledge of what was available i found the hifi - tower products on e_- bay .
positive	the only item that had a couple of days was some strawberries but in fairness , when you buy strawberries in the shop , they have a maximum of 0 days anyway .
positive	would definitely_recommend .
positive	the flowers were delivered the next_day , as promised in great condition .
neutral	i love shopping at argos because you buy from argos and if there are problems , you only deal with argos .
negative	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder mystery event on a particular date .
positive	well_done the wetsuit centre !
positive	many_thanks for taking the pressure off of the stag and the groomsmen most of all !
positive	my prostyles hair came super_quick and buyhair will not be_beaten on price !
neutral	i ordered 0 of the same bouquet to be sent as ' thank_you ' gifts to a number of people at different addresses , all on behalf of a charity .
negative	there was an issue on their website and charge me twice for an event .
negative	you can view my reviews under webuy . com
positive	great advice which has ended_up giving me the desired return within the timescale advised by my account_manager jonathan stevenson .
neutral	however - update
positive	excellent service .
negative	day 0 - no parcel
negative	they arrived eventually . so far so good .
neutral	my products took_forever to get to me .
positive	ive bought tons from them and they never fail .
neutral	it is areal pain having to wait in all day for the collection .
negative	i don_'_t any more .
positive	the printing quality is exactly as i expected , the price is very competitive and the items are delivered quickly .
neutral	the company had the good sense to return to the original mix and all was well , except that one delivery came with out a seal .
positive	very good flights fast and cheap this service is advised especially going to gran_canaria
neutral	mixed feelings really .
negative	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
neutral	i was disappointed at the quility of the book i received .
neutral	these items fetch a premium_rate and are “ worthwhile ” faking .
negative	i was told they would be at my home at 0am , they arrived at 000 am , without any call to confirm they were running_late .
neutral	kind_regards
positive	we had a small problem in that the mechanism locked but a quick phone_call to the customer_services team soon gave me the answer and advice required to release it .
negative	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
negative	the price is reasonably competitive with the other online streaming offerings available in the uk but there just is no comparison on quality , lovefilm fails and it fails on choice too .
neutral	using non genuine inks and logs everything .
neutral	other wise great service .
positive	use again
positive	their strength is in reducing the minimum charge for paying - in an overseas currency cheque , for example from an ebay sale .
negative	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
neutral	i ordered the new sony_xperia ray and was expecting a worldwide launch sometime in september .
neutral	improve your processes , speed things up and i ' m sure soon you ' ll be receiving many more 0 star reviews .
negative	i asked for £_00 which i thought a reasonable and not extortionate amount .
neutral	in large part it ' s because even when you do get a good price , ebay and paypal take such a large cut that you end up feeling like you ' ve been stung , and that you paid for the privelege !
positive	i was very pleased with the service i received from age_partnership , mr rossetti was very good . no high_pressure_selling . he was very professional and helpful in setting_up the transfer of my pension from another company and helping to set_up my new pension through age concern . i would recommend this company anytime . well_done . 000000
neutral	prices are way too high otherwise .
negative	needless to say i asked for my money back and will never deal with this company again .
negative	yours_sincerely ,
positive	great service and great product !
positive	been using goggles0u for years now . always been satisfied with the service , only ever had one problem quite a while ago which was quickly resolved to my satisfaction .
positive	that was yesterday and this morning the shoes were here .
neutral	i ring up ( 00p a minute !)
negative	i tried in vien to resolve this but the email only customer service were useless .
negative	. a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
neutral	good prices and quick delivery but
positive	would highly_recommend
negative	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
neutral	i would score them more favourably than negatively .
neutral	not all items work in all houses .
positive	well it would be afterabout 00_minutes !
negative	time to refer them to the regulator as every other poor reviewer on here seems to have to do .
neutral	told by receptionist __we do not recognize them !
neutral	have been with nah once before this claim and was a much smoother process as i signed_up online , only benefit to ringing is that you get transferred to a solicitor there and then .
neutral	we had to rush through security .
neutral	delivery did not meet the final 00 day deadline and i chose a 0 wheel vehicle to make it easier for the company to deliver which meant i did not receive discounts .
positive	?
positive	would definitely use animed_direct again .
negative	if you want to be robbed , misery and grief , then go_ahead and use this atrocious attempt of a company .
neutral	the only_downside is there reptile section , personally when im looking for accessories for my chameleons vivarium i use a reptile specific shop but i have used this petshop for live food ( locusts , crickets , worms ) when i ' ve run out as its local .
neutral	do not like the whole " pending withdrawal " rubbish that most casinos implement ( including virgin casino ) , on - line casinos will naturally prefer all their customers to cancel their withdrawal / cashout requests and use those funds at the online casino ( hopefully lose it too !
neutral	i have waited and waited and checked the order .
neutral	this was my first time buying from supplementwarehouse , and it will most_likely be my last .
neutral	they have some awesome products and great prices but the delivery is so unpredictable you can never use it for birthdays or christmas !
negative	utterly_useless .
neutral	so , the new ceo john cleland plans to invest £ 00m in maplins does he , well , he ' d better consider spending a good chunk of that on staff training , my recent visit to cannock left a lot to be desired , no greeting no smile , just a look , yes that look when you walk into a strange pub from all the regulars .
positive	i was in row four for the doobie brothers in 0000 and for me it was the best concert experience ever .
positive	the other thing i liked was when learning to fly my helicopter ant and steve were always helpful on giving tips .
positive	all in all a really good experience and we would definately book with you bravofly again .
neutral	the guys didn_'_t seem very happy either , ok i know it '_s saturday_night but hey , be happy you got a job . right ?
neutral	when i asked what the issue was exactly i was transfered to another operator and when i explained things to him he answered with " no , the order has gone_through now , it ' s being_processed and will be shipped out today ",
positive	it ' s a great search_engine , heaps of info , maps , reviews and so user_friendly .
neutral	it was only a minor_issue but still not the service i had hoped for .
positive	after_reading some of kitbags reviews i bought my grandsons kit it arrived as_described ahead of time and fitted great one happy grandson
positive	the prices are great .
positive	the reviewing system i ' ve found to be very reliable , and the website seems to find cheap prices which other comparison_sites don ' t pull up .
positive	i would use bedworld again and have recommended them to others .
negative	i would have much rather paid £_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
neutral	this turntable , parts and perspex cover , however , are in well - used condition and cosmetically unattractive .
neutral	recently something went terribly wrong , order is late , webpage unresponsive when viewing order . no - one answers phone_calls .
neutral	good products but i ' m getting pissed_off with the fact that you use couriers even for small items .
negative	without them , even with the power of ebay they will be left behind .
positive	great service !
negative	that one star is only there because the trustpilot will not accept no stars .
positive	got it standing in the front room where we can all play on it and learn till our hearts content !
positive	it really does rewards players , unlike many others that sites , that give you nothing extra for playing with them .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	they are rule compared to blooming winner .
positive	got an_email the next working day saying it was dispatched .

positive	these came on the expected date , excellently packed and chilled - and they are great !
neutral	i decided to book an appointement near a location i was going on holiday , but on the day of the appointment i was called to say the replacement windscreen had not been delivered to the autoglass centre .
negative	blackcircles retrieved the tyre for inspection & told me that they would contact me when they knew more .
negative	i strongly_advise everyone against dealing_with this company !
negative	in short , do not buy from this company , or if you do then pay by credit_card to ensure you can get your money back if order isn ' t received because you ' ll get no help from them once they have your money .
positive	surely a model for the future .

positive	i cannot speak highly_enough of viovet .
positive	the product was well_packaged and couldnt fault beyondtelevision in any way .
positive	so good and simple i had to use them again !
neutral	at no point has this been changed on the website either , so people will_continue to order them despite them not being available which is misleading .
negative	when i did speak to another member of staff , they said the customer_service rep didn ' t follow protocol and i should escalate this to management and they would handle the situation .
positive	charlies had the small one but not the larger .
positive	i have used just keepers on a number of occassions and have never_experienced any_issues at all with any of my orders .
neutral	your seller has informed us that your tickets will be uploaded at 0pm today .

positive	packaged well , great prices .
negative	what a pointless delivery company .
negative	also there customer_services is none excistant .
negative	they lost my parcel which worth alot to me after ringing time many_times they promise to redeliver and after 0 weeks they says its lost ?????

neutral	0 .
neutral	i called sail and ski who were not particularly bothered either and as far as they were concerned they had done there bit and it was down to the courier .
positive	thanks alexandalexa .
neutral	the products i ordered were fine and the service was good but my free ' sleep in rollers ' were meant to be worth £_00 and i can ' t understand this as it was only 00 rollers , a brush and some hairspray .
negative	i spoke to a very helpful and polite lady_called barbara who was very kind .
negative	kind_regards
negative	a corporate venue in the town_centre ) we asked for early am delivery as it was for a presentation at a collegues retirement .
negative	the package was £_00 and it said tickets were up to £_00 face_value and we would get the best available seats within their allocation so we thought great .
negative	why does the company have phone_lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
positive	i got my sunnys and another pair at a really great price .
negative	absolutely fuming . needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
negative	they said they sent a letter which was a notice to charge my card 0 weeks_ago but this is not true .
negative	fees paid to viagogo for buying and reselling e_- tickets without received the tickets at all !
neutral	it was meant to be a king_size mattress but is smaller_than my king_size divan bed
negative	no call , no way to change delivery and all travel and hotel already cancelled .
neutral	i did return the cube and received a cheque but no offer of re - doing with a different photo .
negative	so i rang .
positive	i cannot_praise their service enough .
neutral	are they in financial trouble !
negative	i have sent iflorist a further 0 emails and tried_phoning but have had no response on any front .
neutral	too expensive and not enough products , theyve really gone_downhill recently .
neutral	overall i must stress that the product i got looked great - better in most ways than i could have hoped and once i ' ve found a replacement for the frosted plastic it will look better still .
neutral	i was verry happy with the service , and i am happy with the good '_s that i have brought and delivery was quick i have recomended you to my brother who will also be looking at your site .
neutral	i had booked a basic car which was adequate but the man immediately said the car i had ordered was tiny for us and 0 moderate cases .
positive	would use again and recommend to others
negative	as a result , they cannot ( or at_least have been incompetent in doing so ) quickly and responsively regulate the amount of bandwidth available to their subscription base .
positive	seemed like a nice_touch .
positive	its very easy to use .
positive	great service - i would recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	this should be relevant to the cost of the item and not seriously loaded .
negative	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
neutral	paid way over the odds twice now for tickets and it is a bad practice and should be outlawed .
positive	they had the best price i could find , including with free delivery , and the item arrived a few_days earlier_than it ' s actual release_date .
neutral	0 .
negative	he said someone would call me back .
neutral	overall a lovely product , but for an £_00 photo_book i expected it to be flawless .
positive	will_certainly use again
positive	i turned to tredz after a nightmare experience trying to buy a bike online from another major , high_street chain .
negative	after many_years of using ipostparcels , i can_honestly say this company has now gone into complete disarray , one missed collection after another , no phone number , no customer_care , sent emails get no response despite their claims to get back to you in three hours , you are totally at the mercy of a roulette wheel with this company you bet red or black and it comes up a sickly green .
negative	i believed the customer service centre , when they told me numerous_times , how sorry they were for not replying and that they have once again forwarded my request for refund , to the accounts_department .
positive	sitio excelente , seguro , confiable , y bastante acorde a las necesidades
positive	can ' s wait to put that on my canon_0d mkii .

negative	0flats . com is a horrible service !!
positive	i ordered and then awaited delivery .
neutral	i am seriously_considering going to another supplier though .
positive	i would like to see instant service include dvd and blu_ray extra features like making of and deleted scenes then we can do away with discs altogether , provided lovefilm can retain the license to stream the content as i have noticed many films become unavailable after a time .
positive	i called back to place the order for two small pieces of hardware .
negative	the tickets were confirmed as shipped a day or so after i bought them , but a week_later i hadn ' t received them .
neutral	i thought i would give another side to all the rants as the reviews expressed are probably a bit one sided - people tend to comment only when they have a problem , not when everything goes_smoothly .
negative	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
neutral	you only really know how good a company is when things go_wrong and unfortunately they have failed on this .
neutral	all i asked for was one replacement seat panel .
neutral	i sent back the incorrect product and two_weeks_later had to chase for my replacement . they received the order but lost it post receipt .

negative	finally get through tonight and after being cut_off 0 times , i am told i never reported my phone lost or stolen , but they will send me a new sim as a good - will gesture !!
negative	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
neutral	one error which stands out most was when a code needed to be typed into the a box of the wrong type , on a completely_different page to the one it should have been typed into .
negative	edit_: 00 / 00 / 00 - well its 0 working_days on and no comment from cpw - bad publicity on trustpilot is one thing but we ' ll see what watchdog have to say about it if cpw cant be bothered to respond on here .
neutral	whatch the prices however - other_companys often have the same stuff cheaper .
neutral	this was not the case , i am_currently looking at the same screen i did before " the admins have been notified of this , and will replenish the keys within 00_hours !"
positive	unlock your iphone at cheap .

positive	great :)
negative	a third_party bought it and wants $ 0000 for it !
positive	i crossed my fingers , ordered one and waited .
positive	good job guys , hope next time goes just as well ;)
neutral	attention to detail is what the discerning traveller demands nowadays .
positive	the sunglasses were delivered , as requested , to my son '_s address , in the time requested , and the sunglasses were fine .
negative	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
neutral	i was initially attracted to westin_gourmet by a great offer on bacon .
neutral	only one suggestion , be very clear about what is included in the package .
negative	reconciling my bank_account a week or so later highlighted that they had charged me twice for the item once on the 00th_november_0000 , once on the 0rd december_0000 .
negative	i could have got better for 0 . 00 at the co - op .
positive	will be sending my mum to site to buy more for collection to ship overseas .
positive	when my box arrived i excitedly opened it up , not knowing what to expect .
neutral	unfortunately one of the powder in my packet was completely smashed therefore i am unable to use it , the rest of it made it , maybe you should use cardboard packaging and bubble_wrap .
negative	!
positive	huge_variety of food and widely utilised by many of the takeaways so you can pretty_much get anything you want - from your standard pizzas to caribbean , sweets , and booze .
negative	get your act_together npower !
neutral	said neighbour is unwell and didn_'_t realise until the day after that one of the parcels was mine and had to hobble over with it .
neutral	as long as the seller / buyer and yourself do a good deal , which i have to admit is more times than not , the experience is good .
neutral	tiger_tiger wanted £ 0 / head even_though we were on a " guest - list " which is a bit out of order .
negative	in the past my experience with this company has_been positive .
neutral	i found the brown leather chairs i have been looking for in the ps winter sale catalogue .
positive	on the wednesday_morning i was intending to contact customer_services and cancel the order , when i received an e_- mail to say that my item had already been dispatched ( it was on a 0 - 0 day delivery ).
positive	service is quick and delivery is next_day would most definitly recommend my friends to deal with mpb
negative	they had two contact numbers for me and an_email address and none of these were contacted .
neutral	when i ordered on - line the chairs were more_expensive than the catalogue price .
positive	they really add to your images and make them feel extra special .
neutral	so , using the text reply system they had put in place , i texted ' 0 ' back to them .
neutral	hidden in amongst it was mention of a ' price plan ' which i thought she was just mentioning in case we had not paid upfront for the goods - which we had .
negative	no problem , we have received them and a refund is on it '_s way .
positive	a minor point in an otherwise faultles transaction .
positive	the price they were selling the soundbar was so competative , though , that i took the chance of dealing_with them online .
neutral	bought some items on thursday_evening and paid extra for their express service .
neutral	the thing with online shopping is you can '_t try stuff on and my expectation and experience with other_retailers is that returns are free .
neutral	probably a prerequisite of the job - bamboozle the customer .
positive	the service i have received is 0st_class .
neutral	tenants can '_t find upload documents section , so they have to email separately .
negative	i explained i ' ve already paid for my eletcricity . i ' m not paying for it twice .
negative	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
positive	all fine with me as i ’ d collected all the money from the stag goers well in_advance , had the opportunity to build up a rapport with phil and do a bit of research into the company .
positive	easy to talk to straight to the point and no funny business , they don ' t mess you around and try to get you the best deal possible
negative	never again .
neutral	good customer_service but low quality items .
negative	their customer service is appalling , completely lacking in any sensitivity and their behaviour borders on the criminal .
negative	wtf . not impressed , in fact really disappointed
neutral	between the driver and i we eventually managed to get these stuck wheel_nut caps off and fitted the tyres but we both got soaked in the process .
negative	thanks !
neutral	no one had informed us that it had been cancelled by qantas yet we had asked for our flights to be monitored as we were travelling extensively .

negative	i am so disappointed and upset .
neutral	i paid £_00 for a saturday delivery as we work through the week and was very flexible for us .
neutral	. a bit sketchy in woodingdean , brighton though .
negative	!
positive	what a joy to have good old_fashioned service with a smile from a delivery driver who was friendly and efficient .
positive	yes you may pay more but you are guaranteed to get good seats and the tickets everyone_else wants .
neutral	isn ' t perfect , delivery was delayed but the price of the items pay off the headache .
neutral	shame about your delivery partner :(
neutral	they sell seats .
positive	i '_ve been watching the weston gourmet offers for some time - eventually decided to jump and try them about 0 weeks_ago when they offered 00 " restaurant quality " steaks for £_00 plus delivery ; however , i was thwarted by their website having crashed , and i couldn_'_t get my order in .
negative	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
negative	this company i ' d quick enough at taking your money but runs it on a shoe string where engineers are concerned .
neutral	however their website can be very frustrating to use which is why they have only 0_stars
positive	hassel free transactions , i recommend all the time to friends and family !
negative	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
neutral	paid about £ 0 or so for next_day delivery with this company , it came to about 0 o_clock and i used their live support ( which was prompt , i ' ll give them an extra star for that ).
negative	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
positive	do not hesitate to order from this company , i am always satisfied with the service and prices .
neutral	however , i would say pet_supermarket is efficient and professional .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
neutral	however , i do rate the quality of the items .
neutral	marketing is on thing overkill another
negative	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
positive	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
negative	i ' m off after yet another failed collection .
positive	a very easy system where transpoters bid for what you request .
negative	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn ' t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn ' t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn ' t paid it .
negative	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
negative	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
positive	i will_definitely be using them my entire trip .
positive	what can i say , brilliant , i will_definately now use this company from now on and please everybody , spread the grippy word , you find a decent company nowadays hang on and don_'_t let go !!

neutral	ahhh classic yahoo how i miss thee .
neutral	we were in murcia and used resort_hoppa to get to our hotel . it worked_fine and we didn_'_t wait long . would i use them again ?
positive	any further information , perhaps that he hoped to be with me , either am or pm , or between , 0 & 0 pm , or something similar , would be a welcome added_bonus .
positive	the website was easy to use , prices were reasonable and the delivery timing was awesome , took 0 days - ( considering it was a personalised item ).
neutral	when i got monthly_bill it was higher than the offer so i had to phone up every month to correct it which cost you money to ring them also and always got a different excuse .
positive	thank_you very much , you saved our lives after the dog chewed up our last roll of wallpaper , we tried to get it from everywhere until i found you on the e_- bay , it is very awkward when the room is nearly finished apart_from 0 pieces , thank_you again for me not having to do 0 walls again , yours ian fleck
positive	:)
negative	we booked a holiday through groupon for our anniversary only to find out at the check in that the company groupon used to make payments came up as " fraudulent " and we were refused to board the plane !
positive	i had read some poor reviews and a little reluctant to choose jet0 , but having been disappointed ( and squeezed into my seat ) with monach and with easyjet prices being higher ; i decided to give jet0 a try .
positive	the service & quality of ram , with best quality , dependable memory chips is second to none .
negative	where is my money ????
neutral	they took_ages to send my product to the delivery company ( 00 days ) once received by the delivery company , the product came in 0 day from england to ireland .

neutral	i was looking for tickets and found that site was good and enabled_me to even see what block i was trying to buy .
negative	i had booked using opodo extra which means they will support you in case something_goes_wrong .
negative	or hasn ’ t a substantial_amount of free time to endlessly chase their support staff , then icuk is definitely not for you .
positive	a credit to the internet , super , super ace site .
negative	trading_standards complaint registered and after talking to them they felt that watchfinder were in breach of contract and should have honour the sale agreement .
neutral	the flowers arrived at 0pm
negative	what if something_goes_wrong ?
negative	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
neutral	booking via the website was quick and painless as was the payment process .
neutral	i eventually called the company up and on the last tone of the second attempt i got through to someone .
negative	i ' ve never waited this long to have a order picked or shipped , and i usually receive my products within 0 - 0 days from every other company i use .
positive	the site has a great range of contemporary products that also looks stylish as well as functional , it was hard to choose .
negative	!
neutral	i am content with the second purchase and i will certainly consider shopping in the future with their business if my confidence remains developed from the first disappointing_experience .
positive	my first time using double0tickets . com , very easy site & managed to buy some excellent seats for the o0 .
negative	yes those facilities were there but had to pay extra for each facilies when we arrived .
positive	this was the first time i have used this company and i must_say i am very pleased with the whole_transaction . will use again .

neutral	the flowers where not delivered , i had an_automated email_saying they had been routed to the wrong depot but no email from an actual person with an_apology or explanation a s to what they where doing to rectify this issue , i am not sure if they would have if i hadn ' t have contacted them first . they then offered a full_refund , or to let the flowers run their natural course which i told them was not acceptable ; my nan lives on her own an looks forward to receiving flowers for her_birthday due to the bank_holiday as well she had not receive her_birthday_present she was very upset by this .
negative	its useless !
positive	great service !
negative	this company doesn_'_t - i recommend you don_'_t trade with them .
negative	by the way , you might want to use these email_addresses to contact carphone : dunstoc @ cpwplc . com , pearson @ cpwplc . com , mcerlea @ cpwplc . com
negative	both bt vision and virgin are so much_better , and even_though bt service isn ' t known for being great , it beats anything sky can offer .

neutral	each area is sub - texted with reviews in that area and even better the author has added her own ' things to do ' chronological guide starting off with cafes for breakfast or brunch , museams in the day , market strolls in the afternoon and tavernas to eat and drink in the evenings .
negative	then charged extra from my account on same day , poor service , would not recommand to anyone , i paid £_000 for this parcel plus paid extra for insurance then today they send me new invoice and took another £_00 from my card itself , so i lost the item plus this money which is about £_000 due to parcel_monkey , i will not use them again and will not recommend to anyone , they not even provide phone support
positive	ordered 0 footjoy gloves ( sci_- flex and pure touch ), price was excellent and delivery was 0 days .
positive	i then had another delivered by appliancedeals this morning .
positive	i would recommend this site to others definitely as the prices are far cheaper_than the uk !
negative	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
positive	she looked great
positive	my friend turned me on to this company .
negative	0 months later , i am only just getting to the bottom of some more late charges - they are still chasing me for £_00 . 00 that i have never owed them in late charges . how can you charge someone who you are not supplying a service too ?
neutral	maybe things are slipping but my latest order was fine like every other i have had from them .
positive	regards

positive	i have since recommended glasses_direct to several clients & colleagues .

neutral	i replied to a lady_who wanted to know where to buy a cooker element on the argos site , this being on friday last , i replied by saying she could get one off amazon and left a negative_feedback on the cooker , however had to wait for argos approval on my feed_back .
negative	by the way o0 / giffgaff have the least complaints of all mobile companies .
negative	divorce is at best an emotionally tempestuous time , even an incredibly straight_forward one as our own , so its really disappointing to find them so unhelpful despite paying for their best service package and being promised to be fully supported throughout the process .
negative	meanwhile , our competior , in the same industry as us , has a perfect score .
negative	!
neutral	usually very good service however last two times i have ordered from echo i had to wait 0 days when its next_day delivery but will still use echo great prices im sure i have just been unlucky kind_regards chris green
