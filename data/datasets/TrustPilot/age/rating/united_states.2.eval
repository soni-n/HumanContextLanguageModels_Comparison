negative	i ordered two pieces for a halloween party in sept . 0 weeks_later i called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 00st .
negative	with halloween being on a monday i explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and i ordered early enough not to have to worry .
negative	i was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in .
negative	one week before halloween , i emailed ami that i no_longer wanted the order .
negative	0 days_later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded .
negative	when i received the one piece in the mail ( on the 00st ) it was nothing like the picture .
negative	so i used their return_label and sent it back to them .
negative	in mid nov .
negative	i got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return .
negative	the form had several reasons listed , but none were checked .
negative	instead they hand wrote at the bottom that i didn_'_t have some sort of return # that is required ???
negative	after several emails and 0 phone_calls i finally spoke with a manager .
negative	just to be blown off and told i was not getting my money back .
negative	thats when i disputed the charge with my credit_card .
negative	after explaining everything to my credit_card company .
negative	they agreed to dispute the charge .
negative	mid dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so i thought .
negative	the rest you can call coincidence if you want but on christmas_eve , less then 0 weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim ei used my card since sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
negative	when i called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine , so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number .
negative	since i rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information .
negative	of course i can '_t prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 00 dollars , it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me .
negative	i am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them .
negative	i place my first order on sunday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	today is wednesday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	only now do they decide to ship my order out to me !
negative	the time it will take to ship my order via ' smartpost ' still remains to be seen so , this is still an undecided total failure to me .
negative	all in all , a very dissatisfactory transaction for me .
negative	i suppose that i '_ve been completely spoiled by ' amazon prime '_s ' efficient shipping methods .
negative	' nuff said .
negative	beware .
negative	i booked one room at a great rate but was only allowed to book one at a time .
negative	i needed two rooms for my family , but when i immediately went back for the second , the same room had gone up 00 %!
negative	well the only thing good about this company so_far was there fast service getting the part to me .
negative	yes !
negative	the wrong part and they have no way to get hold of them only to fill_out a slip which they say they will get back to you .
negative	there 0 - 000 free number gives you three choices , but a voice comes on saying there phone_calls are so full they can '_t get back to you .
negative	if you call there regular number some guy named buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message , but then you find out that his message service is full , so i went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way , and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them .
negative	if you go online and read the reviews about this company there is no good reviews in there favor , so until i get my refund from them this company sucks !
negative	no phone_number , complaint made via_email , received a reply but didn_'_t address the complaint at all , poor quality merchandise , am one step away from reporting this company to trading_standards , will never use again !
negative	horrible company !!!!!
negative	holding my bank acct hostage !
negative	had to finally file a fraud complaint with my bank .
negative	do not do business with this company .
negative	absolutely the worst .
negative	unless you consider " fast " 0 weeks +.. also , the repair job was terrible .
negative	i had two arms replaced on a pair of chanel frames .
negative	when the estimate came through about the repair they asked if i wanted new reading lenses put in .
negative	i chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly .
negative	when i finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were " floppy " - cheap workmanship , and there were no lenses that i had paid for , and they charged me $_00 shipping .
negative	the online_chat person arial was unhelpful and would not let me speak with a manager .
negative	a wholly awful experience after waiting almost 0 weeks .
negative	i called amex and disputed the charge and they found in my favor , refunding the full_amount .
negative	so , buyer_beware .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a helmet .
negative	they took 00 days to ship my order and never communicated with me until i called them on the 00th day .
negative	they shipped only after i filed a paypal claim .
negative	if it was back ordered they should have just let me know .
negative	i received it about 00 days after i ordered and paid for it .
negative	where did it come from australia ?
negative	i paid to have flowers champagne and chocolates to deliverd to my honey in the uk for valentines_day recieved e_- mail feb 00 due to adverse weather the flowers only would be delivered ????
negative	no chocolates or wine ???
negative	no flowers were delivered nothing was and it was valentines !!!!!
negative	callled my bank stopped pay they are investigateing i advise alll to re post this and never ever to use these crooks !!!!
negative	!
negative	lisa kempt ps please investigate my complaint i would love you 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	infact i dare u !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	i travel extensively for work but had never tried priceline until now , and at this time , i am greatly regretting giving them a try !
negative	my business trip itinerary changed unexpectedly and i needed to change the day of my departure flight .
negative	i have seriously never had such poor customer_service as i '_ve had via priceline .
negative	i '_ve tried and tried and tried to get someone to help me take_care of this !
negative	i have called repeatedly and cannot get past the recording which does not recognize my itinerary number and tells_me " we are temporarily unable to perform this function at this time ," when i input my phone_number as asked .
negative	at one point when i did get though i was on hold for literally two hours before i finally gave up .
negative	i could not get a human_being to help me as the option to actually speak to a person when the automated system failed was never given .
negative	i literally spent over four hours on the phone trying to get someone to change a flight for me , and it still has not been resolved !
negative	i have never been so frustrated when making travel_arrangements !
negative	priceline has completely disappointed me and will not be used again for my extensive travel_arrangements .
negative	unfortunately , at this point , i have already booked and paid for a flight through priceline and desperately needed follow through on their part to ensure my trip is success , and they have not delivered .
negative	do not under any circumstance use priceline , unless you have no time or money restraints around your travel_plans .
negative	( i did learn it will cost $_000 to change my flight and i won '_t be allowed carry on any " free " luggage !
negative	thank_you for your " generosity " priceline !)
negative	until now i have successfully used travelocity to book all my flights and have even had to change a couple in the past and was able to do so through travelocity without issue for a $_000 fee .
negative	never again priceline , never again !
negative	on three seperate occasions i ordered several products which , according to the website , should be in stock .
negative	my first order to more then 00 days to be completed .
negative	with my last order the website claimed a delivery time of 0 - 0 days .
negative	after 0 weeks you ask for the status of your order .
negative	the tell you their supplier is sending the goods .
negative	so please wait 0 more days .
negative	0 weeks_later you inform again .
negative	now the supplier has stock issues and they are not sure when to deliver .
negative	never again will i order something at golfstore europe .
negative	i purchased a battery and screen for my evo but both products did not work .
negative	the top of the screen does not respond and the battery was completly dead with . 0mil volts that would not charge .
negative	they will not take back the screen once its used but how do you know it works until you replace it .
negative	they advertise buyer protection , but they do not provide it .
negative	ultimately they are the judge and jury , so be forewarned that buyer protection does not exist , i found out the hard way .
negative	man_skal ikke forvente at elgiganten ringer tilbage , når_man har lovet det !
negative	i dette tilfælde har man lavet en fejl et eller andet sted i systemet !
negative	og få et svar på e_- mail , kan godt lade vente på sig !
negative	indtil til videre savner jeg stadig et svar , det_er kun 0 dage siden man opdagede fejlen !
negative	i am extremely dissatisified with my recent order with floraqueen .
negative	i originally placed my order on 00 / 0 / 00 with an expected delivery date of 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	after it was not delivered that date , i submitted an inquiry and i was informed that my order would be delayed and delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	the order history displayed on your site showed that the local_florist shop was notified of the upcoming delivery .
negative	the flowers again were not delivered and i then again submitted another inquiry which was not answered .
negative	finally , today on 00 / 0 / 00 the flowers were delivered .
negative	the individual who delivered the flowers was very disrrespectful to my 00 year_old mother who instead of receiving joy from my gift was only presented with anger and distaste .
negative	the note which was supposed to be included along with the flowers was missing , which left my mother in confusion as to where and whom they were from .
negative	the delivery person informed my mother that the flowers were " coming from russia " ( was she trying to be funny ?)
negative	and did not want to speak to her any further and left abruptly .
negative	what was supposed to be a kind gesture for my mother turned into a nightmare as it not only caused her stress , but me as well ( who is over a 0000 miles_away ).
negative	the local_florist shop was not helpful in any way and messed_up the order by not including the note i requested , not to mention the rude attitude they displayed when they were simply asked for information and help .
negative	i would strongly_recommend that this company rethinks the local_florist shops they do business with as the place itself who took_care of the order was not only disorganized and undependable but they also hire individuals who are ill mannered and inconsiderate .
negative	we are not happy with paypal .
negative	we did over a million dollars a year with them , have a 00 year history and then they decided to demand with out choice that they are going to hold 00_% of all funds for 00 days .
negative	this means they hold $_00 , 000 . 00 of our money on a constant basis for 00 days .
negative	so , we no_longer use their service for money services .
negative	avoid this company . would not connect .
negative	web has numerous comments aiong same line on this company '_s sim_card .
negative	when contacted they gave the same excuse as others have received when complained ... i . e there is the occasional faulty one , and they offer to replace .
negative	the one that did arrive , took for ever , and i was due to depart on my trip , a replacement was of no use .
negative	the fact that they are still selling this faulty product despite all the complaints over a number of years suggests a less_than reputable business .
negative	demanded refund ... they then offered more excuses .
negative	luckily i had paid via paypal .
negative	i lodged a claim through paypal and was successful receiving a full_refund .
negative	we were so_excited to finally be able to spend thanksgiving with my son and his family .
negative	i was bringing the smoke turkey , so i ordered form figis 00 days in advance .
negative	their website accepted my order and i called several_times to make_sure they had my order and confirm it was coming before thanksgiving .
negative	the more calls i made the more disappointed i got .
negative	each time we called their cs department they told us a different story : ( 0 ) they have 0 orders under my name !!!
negative	really ?
negative	( 0 ) no order was found under my name or order number ???!!!
negative	( 0 ) go buy a turkey because it might not arrive on time , no problem we will refund your complete payment ( 0 ) it is arriving via_fedex this afternoon ( 0 ) it already arrived at the post_office ????
negative	( 0 ) we send the order fedex directly to the post_office and the po delivers to your home !!!
negative	really ???
negative	on thanksgiving day the post_office is not opened ??
negative	?
negative	in summary the turkey never arrived on thursday , we went out of town friday_morning and returned sunday_night … the turkey arrived and was dropped in our heated mailroom and was no_longer smelling good when we openned the box .
negative	figis returned half of my money and told me that was their policy !!!
negative	nice job figis !!!
negative	!
negative	after starting a booking for 0 days out , having to update my credit_card info must have changed the date to same day as booking !
negative	not realizing this , i book for the same day as booked , 00_minutes before the tee time that booked .
negative	i ' m an_hour from the course and booked from a laptop in my home .
negative	called and rep said , " sorry , that '_s the policy "!
negative	this was done before the tee time that day .
negative	i didn_'_t change the date , their system did !
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 0 inch tablet for $_000 and the extended 0 year protection_plan of $_00 more from tigerdirect a few_months back .
negative	i broke the screen and took it back to the store for repair and i was told by the store that i needed to call the warranty company and send the unit back .
negative	the warranty company is called square_trade and the person i talked to was in pakistan .
negative	the person i talked to said his name was ryan ( that was with a heavy accent ), he told me that the tablet could not be fixed and they were sending me my money back $_000 for what i paid for the tablet once they had received the tablet .
negative	i asked why they couldn ’ t fix it and he said that it would cost more to repair it than what it cost .
negative	then he said that if it had cost $_000 to fix it then my warranty would only have $_00 left for future repairs .
negative	i asked to talk to his supervisor and he said there were 0 of them but they were with clients and it would take 0 hours for me to get a response from them .
negative	i asked for one of the names of the supervisor and he gave me the name sylvia ( remember this is a call_center in pakistan .
negative	i gave up dealing_with them and sent the tablet back .
negative	i have also been receiving a lot of junk mail since i gave the rep my email_address .
negative	they did send me a check for $_000 so i went to bestbuy and bought a new one and there warranty .
negative	i do not recommend tigerdirect or square_trade .
negative	ordered item almost 00 days ago and a couple days_later it said it '_s shipped but no tracking_info was ever provided .
negative	item still hasn '_t arrived .
negative	fruugo says it should have arrived 0 - 00 days ago .
negative	all i get from fruggo is a form letter email_saying they are behind on their emails and to wait 0 days for an_email reply .
negative	already did that and still no reply .
negative	disputing transaction with paypal .
negative	think your booking with hotel had to get paper to see i messed_up
negative	people getting rooms 00 . 00 cheaper walking in hotel
negative	i tried to get a reasonable deal on a " 0 star " hotel near the philly airport that priceline in its express_deals called similar to holiday_inn , best western or ramada inn .
negative	what i got was the waterfront inn which was a run - down , dirty , tired motel with 0 floors , no elevators , promised internet but no wireless signal , an adjoining room door with broken locks that wouldn_'_t close completely , a room that wasn_'_t cleaned or the towels replaced on my second night , a toilet that never stops running water , a mattress that had to have been pre wwii and to top it off - a call for help got a " non_- responsive , unable to help , try the day shift manager - maybe they can help staff ".
negative	avoid this place like the plague .
negative	only stay here if your only alternative is sleeping in your car outside a crack house .
negative	did priceline help when i called ?
negative	not so much .
negative	they called the night manager who could not help , had no way to reach the gm and said call back tomorrow .
negative	so did i get another hotel until a refund could be worked out ?
negative	no .
negative	i ' m on my own until priceline can speak to the hotel gm tomorrow ... now that '_s customer_service you can be proud of !
negative	not !
negative	ordered phone and paid on 0 / 00 / 00 ... still_waiting to receive .
negative	i have emailed and can '_t get an actual shipping date from them .
negative	i received some tracking_number that doesn_'_t work and when i emailed them about it they told me it '_s a signature confirmation shipment and the tracking_number won '_t show anything until order is received .
negative	i have now called them and left message .
negative	at this point , i would rather have my money back and i will buy elsewhere .
negative	i have bought things from overseas before with faster shipping and better communication than this .
negative	i am a first time customer and ordered 00 boxes of good earth decaffeinated green tea lemongrass , great tea by - the - way .
negative	i also ordered earl gray tea at the same time .
negative	when my order arrived , they were indefinitely out of earl gray tea , and they sent me 00 boxes of the wrong good earth tea , citrus kiss , which is terrible stuff .
negative	they promptly sent me a return shipping_label via e_- mail and promptly reordered the correct tea for me .
negative	the second " correct " shipment arrived today and once again it was the wrong tea .
negative	once again they sent citrus kiss , so now i have 00 boxes of the wrong tea .
negative	again their customer_service was friendly and offered to send a return shipping_label , however i am now our $_00 . 00 for the original shipping and i have no product !
negative	this has been a terrible experience as a first time customer and i do not plan to ever buy from them again .
negative	be very cautious if you plan to make any purchases from this vendor .
negative	if i could give zero stars i would .
negative	on oct 00 , 0000 i purchased the no .
negative	0 hydrating shampoo from this vendor through amazon . com and when i got the product it looked like it was authentic but when i opened it up and used the product i realized it wasn_'_t the same .
negative	then i compared it to a bottle from my high end salon and i could definitely tell it wasn_'_t the same .
negative	not only was the color of the shampoo different ( yellowish vs . a pearly color ) but the smell was different and it certainly had a different effect on my hair ( stripped it down ).
negative	very disappointed .
negative	sincerely - customer #_000000 inv #_000000
negative	ordered windshield wipers for mercedes s - 000 as they were advertised on the website .
negative	order arrived with wipers that can not be installed on s - 000 .
negative	contacted seller , sent them pic of the wipers needed .
negative	several days_later rec ' d order to ship it back .
negative	asked for pre_- paid label to return item , but was told that it is my responsibility to return wrong item .
negative	tried to call several_times : no live support .
negative	company itself assigned return authorization under " wrong item shipped " title , but still refused to reimburse shipping .
negative	interesting , that one email requested that i will provide them with part item number , so that can check their inventory , but these wipers are still advertised as for s - 000 .
negative	after this experience , i had no time to wait for another shipment from different online retailer and went to dealership to by wipers .
negative	ordered unlock for my iphone_0s on november 00 , 0000 , still locked , no response to emails , posts , or phone_calls
negative	i ordered a toilet seat which was very expensive for my children as my 0 year_old son kept falling in as he is just 0 . this one was supposed to be bigger and have a wider seat as it is a " throne " seat .
negative	i received it and a couple of weeks_later opened it once we had some time over christmas to fit it .
negative	as soon as i took it out of the box it was clear it would never fit a normal toilet so i replaced it , resealed it in a box within a box marked fragile and paid for it to be retuned special delivery as requested by fountain .
negative	at the time i returned it , fountain said they would have to knock off £_00 as we had not returned it within 00 days and i reluctantly accepted that .
negative	however having paid £_000 for the seat and £_00 for the postage , i was told by fountain that it had arrived damaged so they would not receive it back and about 0 weeks_later it was returned to me .
negative	i have no idea how they believe that this could have occurred when the toilet seat was not even fully removed when i originally received it as i saw immediately that it was the wrong back sitting ( which was never clear or stated on the website that it needed a special victorian style toilet ) and i do not believe it was damaged at my end at all , they simply did not want to refund it .
negative	iit was returned fully packaged , in the box , in another box and marked fragile .
negative	i will not be back to this company .
negative	i found sixt via one of those priceline type sites and went directly to the site to rent a car for a trip to the uk .
negative	when i arrived to stansted airport ( 00_minutes early ) they weren '_t ready with a vehicle , so i had to wait for an_hour .
negative	it was an annoyance , but that was ok .
negative	when they were ready , i picked_up the car .
negative	they asked me if i wanted an upgrade .
negative	i '_ve been offered free upgrades before ( because of available vehicle stock ) but they never told me the cost of the upgrade .
negative	then they literally just handed me the keys and sent me on my way .
negative	the personnel at the rental office didn_'_t inspect the vehicle with me or give me any introduction to the car ( it would have been nice for them to at_least offer me a quick tutorial on how to use the gps , since i ' d never been in the car before and i ' m from the usa and driving in a different country .
negative	i spent 00_minutes just figuring that out ).
negative	the car itself was flawless .
negative	i returned the vehicle at the end of the trip and they charged my credit_card for the rental .
negative	sounds great , right ?
negative	great car , great price , middle of the road customer_service ?
negative	i can live with that , right ?
negative	still all considering , i ' d have used them again .
negative	but four days_later i get a bill for " tire damage " for $_000 via an_email .
negative	i ' m now in a foreign_country , have no way to dispute the claim .
negative	i have no knowledge of any tire damage or any event that could have caused this damage , but i did not inspect the tires before or after renting the car , and no one inspected the car with me prior to leaving , or returning to stansted airport .
negative	that all considered , i decided to just pay the damage claim , write their customer_service and email about my experience and move on .
negative	it '_s not worth my time or money to dispute it .
negative	so i responded with payment via the form they asked for and waited for them to withdrawal the money .
negative	they never withdrew the money from my account , but continue to send me reminder emails asking for payment .
negative	the last one threatening legal_action , so i called the uk offices .
negative	no voicemail , and no one answering the phones .
negative	so i called the american sixt offices .
negative	they were very helpful , giving me the direct email_address to the person sending me the damage request emails .
negative	after sending her an_email , they finally they withdrew the funds from my account .
negative	the rental ended 0 - 00 and this fiasco ended on 0 - 00 .
negative	i regularly travel to the uk , and i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i ' d be willing to try us sixt , because they were so helpful in resolving this issue , but not in the uk .
negative	horrible customer_service , horrible_experience all around
negative	yes i received my package immediately but the items i received were used and counterfeit .
negative	the lady gaga beats have god - awful sound quality that dr . dre does not represent himself by .
negative	the tablet charged all day , and did not work without the charger for 0 minutes .
negative	and the tablet keyboard case did not work with the tablet .
negative	i do not recommend this company , it sounds greats but that is all it is .
negative	i don_'_t know why anyone uses these people .
negative	worst reliability i have ever_seen .
negative	i have tried for over 0 hours too install serial # but with no success
negative	i would not recommend this site at all !!!!
negative	!
negative	they take your money but they do not give a refund , even_though they say they do !!!
negative	!
negative	bad bad business !!!
negative	!
negative	let '_s put a stop to their scamming .
negative	report them to the authorities .
negative	i ordered two items - only got one - no response .
negative	hate it .
negative	i think it '_s professional fraud , as you can see in the other reviews below .
negative	please do not order here .
negative	and always keep in mind : many good reviews can be set from the company itself !!
negative	!
negative	supplementwarehouse does not guarantee lowest shipped price and on the phone , the rep did not care about the false_advertising .
negative	no sense in bothering with this website anymore .
negative	good prices , high s / h cost work out to about the same as everyone_else .
negative	my order took more_than 00 hours before i had a tracking_number .
negative	i made a similiar order from vitadigest .
negative	the product cost was more but the s / h cost were half .
negative	total worked out to be about the same .
negative	the big difference , my product from vd took 0 days , sw took 0 .
negative	when i asked sw about it , they gave me a run_around about price_matching .
negative	i didn_'_t ask for a price_match , i paid the advertised price .
negative	i think these_guys are probably doing 0rd_party , that '_s why it takes so long to process orders .
negative	if you can wait and you live close , i guess they aren '_t bad .
negative	having placed my order , and received an_email confirming despatch four days_later , the trouble really began .
negative	there was a link in the email to track the parcel .
negative	it said to wait 0 - 0 hours to track , so that parcelforce could enter it on the system .
negative	three days_later , still no tracking , so i call them .
negative	no , apparently too early to do anything , and told to call back in two_days .
negative	i call back in two_days .
negative	before i even speak staff hang up , but eventually i get through and manage to speak to what i think was the world '_s rudest man .
negative	he has no idea why i was asked to call back on monday - tracking_information can , he says .
negative	take several days to be available .
negative	he had no explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 0 - 0 hours , and i have been waiting over four days .
negative	he then proceeded to insist that the 0 - 0 days it takes from despatch for delivery , should read 0 days at_least .
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 0 days for delivery ( from order ), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the uk - even_though plainly it does not say this .
negative	he repeatedly argued , shouted me down , spoke over me and told me if i could not understand the simple terms , perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps i could understand .
negative	he then told me i should have paid for an expedited service for delivery !
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed , and there is still no tracking .
negative	he cannot say when a manager will call me , he can do nothing for me if i don_'_t understand he said , and maybe a manager will call today , but maybe tomorrow , but they are very busy .
negative	aaarrrgghhhhhhhhhhhhh .
negative	and i have no parcel .......
negative	have been waiting for a parcel today but had to be at docs for 00 . 00 so left a card to suggest a safe place if i missed them .
negative	so i left my house at 00 . 00 to see courier sat outside the house in his van .
negative	are you delivering to me ?
negative	yes he says but i am early , i can '_t deliver until 00 . 00 .
negative	so can i have the parcel now ?
negative	no you cant not until 00 . 00 .
negative	what !
negative	excuse me are you having a laff ?
negative	i said i need to be somewhere at 00 . 00 and need to go out , but no , would not hand over parcel .
negative	in the end when i said i need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place , ( i . e after 00 . 00 )... so he got out his van and i showed him a place he could leave it , after 00 . 00 , excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it , not outside ...
negative	he walked past my front_door to observe safe place !
negative	it was a ps0 from currys long awaited for as xmas present or would have told him to return the parcel was so mad ... jobsworth !
negative	i have waited 0 months for a cash back amount , and the customer_service is not worth having , also any opinion you have via the facebook_page if not favourable is just deleted
negative	this is not as trustworthy company as the fares are not true .
negative	emails / sms tells you to call for accept the higher price , but the number can not be used from sweden .
negative	after 00 hour they cancel the booking without asking but the rate is still blocked at my account days thereafter .
negative	do not ever use this company if you like fair service and correct prices , ever !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	ordered two pairs of curtains - identical in every way , size , colour , make , etc .
negative	well they couldn_'_t manage to get this order right .
negative	courier delivered order : one pair as ordered , the other completely wrong .
negative	when i rang customer_services they were very rude and unhelpful .
negative	escalated the problem to head office .
negative	cannot believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the wrong pair away .
negative	they want me to take the curtains back to one of their stores ( nearest shope 00 miles_away ) or post them back to them via royal_mail ( quite a heavy parcel to carry ).
negative	this is not my error debenhams - it '_s yours .
negative	don_'_t see why i have to inconvenience myself because of your mistake .
negative	amazon can manage it !
negative	be warned .
negative	don_'_t shop online at debenhams .
negative	never again will i - never !!!!
negative	!
negative	i made my reservation about 00 months before i booked my trip to mexico .
negative	now though hotelclub offers another credit at our resort in the amount over $_000 . 00 .
negative	so my sincere advise is as follows : don_'_t book with hotelclub early or ever because hotelclub won '_t give us the resort credits they now offer ...
negative	wait_till the last minunte to book with hotelclub or i would never use this travel site again , we got ripped - off !!!
negative	now we are bummed because we booked a three week vacation in mexico , sure could of used the resort credits ... also without telling us , hotelclub charged an extra $_000 . 00 in mx fees , that were never disclosed , and it was a separate charge to my credit_card a month later .
negative	do !
negative	not !
negative	use this travel website unless your so desparate , nver again , hotelclub has some phoney club point membership ...
negative	suddenly we don_'_t have our 000 + points anymore , what '_s up !
negative	rip - off .
negative	this is gail regan of rhododendron , or u . s . a .
negative	first time i ever used priceline and when i made resevations i was going to san jose some how it got switch to san_francisco .
negative	i called them right back with in the hour to let them know of the mistake and they said to bad .
negative	no one would help .
negative	robert employee no .
negative	000000 would not help in any way .
negative	no customer_service what so ever .
negative	my new life mission is to tell all how they suck !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i had to cancel my plans and your hotel took my money as soon as i made the reservation from my bank
negative	lack of anonymosity and poor screening of posters , eg employees posting for an employer to boost business .
negative	i would never take out a title loan again .
negative	i feel this is what is referred to as a " predatory " business .
negative	you take out a loan and can get caught in a neverending cycle of debt .
negative	i was stupid to do it but that doesn_'_t make taking advantage of that ok .
negative	also , one of the clerks tried to change my automatic withdrawal date against my wishes .
negative	this had potential for serious consequences to me and i asked her verbally not to change it nicely but she did it anyway .
negative	after i spoke to mgt someone changed it back .
negative	it was unnecessary stress and drama since i never had any_problems with payments or fund availability .
negative	i would never recommend a title loan to anyone .
negative	i don_'_t know how you sleep at night .
negative	i had a terrible experience with expedia !
negative	i '_ve worked with them before and they were good .
negative	it '_s been a while since i traveled , but based on my previous experiences , i trusted expedia .
negative	they have changed !
negative	this is what happened : i am planning a vacation in the uk and i wanted to stay in london for 0 nights .
negative	i booked 0 rooms for 0 nights at tune hotel - paddington .
negative	later that day i found out expedia over charged me by $_000 , plus , expedia charged a $_00 fee for each room each night .
negative	the tune hotel website charged less .
negative	so , i thought i would take_advantage of the " best price guarantee ".
negative	i called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the tune website did not covert british pounds to us dollars .
negative	they would not cancel my booking either .
negative	so , i ' m out $_000 !
negative	travelers beware !
negative	expedia wants to rip you off !
negative	never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand !
negative	then , my advice is to make_sure you can cancel the booking for a full_refund just in case !
negative	i booked a las_vegas mystery hotel package on book it . com after booking the package and my credit_card being charged i went to print the voucher and received an error message stating only the airfare portion of the package was reserved , not the hotel .
negative	the error message told me to call the book it representative to find out what happened .
negative	i called book it and waited 00_minutes to speak with a human_being .
negative	she was unable to help me .
negative	i asked to speak with a supervisor and was placed on hold for another 00_minutes when their computer disconnected the call .
negative	do not use this website if you expect good customer_service .
negative	they are unable to provide good customer_service !
negative	no support on weekends at all .
negative	the customer is mean nothing to them .
negative	could easely not get your ticket !
negative	i booked one of expedia ' hidden value ' rooms and selected ( 0 ) adults and ( 0 ) children .
negative	my room came back as either ( 0 ) queen or ( 0 ) twin beds .
negative	obviously not enough room for 0 people .
negative	i then was required to pay an extra $_00 to ' upgrade ' my room to what i originally requested .
negative	customer_service kept subtly blaming me for their system malfunction .
negative	" did i select right ", " sorry it '_s non_- refundable ".
negative	they did offer me a $_00 coupon - but i ' m all done with my travel booking so i ' m not sure when i can use it .
negative	plus i am forced to deal with them again .
negative	we bought our daughter a $_000 gift_card for christmas from this store .
negative	while shopping her wallet was stolen with the gift_card on there .
negative	we immediately contacted the store but the manager said they cannot cancel the card we have to call corporate but since it was stolen on a friday_night , we have to wait on monday because they were closed over the weekend .
negative	i told the manager to help us in case somebody presents the card for payment since i have the receipt with the card number on it .
negative	she did not want to do that until i got really mad .
negative	then monday came , i called the corporate_office and to my surprise , the corporate_office said they cannot cancel the card since they do not have a system to do that .
negative	how can a big company with so many stores nationwide and even international not able to cancel a stolen card ?
negative	even a small store can do it .
negative	they just do not care about their customers .
negative	so warning do not shop at this store or buy a gift_card .
negative	i sell a guitar to someone .
negative	i specifiy , item will be shipped when funds are recieved .
negative	i '_ve always gotten funds immedately .
negative	so i had no_hesitation using paypal .
negative	i '_ve been a casual ebay user since 0000 ... and have a 00 feedback with a little yellow star , whatever that means .
negative	anyway .
negative	now it says the funds aren '_t available for 00 days ... and i '_ve got a 00 $ shipping expense .
negative	the truth is that paypal / ebay sister companies are trying to force people to buy their shipping through them and trying to force people to use their shipping_label system .
negative	if i don_'_t do that , i don_'_t get my money in a reasonable amount of time .
negative	horrible .
negative	i can buy my own shipping and make my own_labels .... what right do they have to hold these funds for so long .
negative	the lady on the phone with paypal said , " you have the funds " i said no you have the funds .
negative	theres a difference .
negative	i can " t use them , spend them , etc .
negative	therefor i don_'_t have the funds .
negative	i '_ll never recommend anyone use paypal or ebay again .
negative	crooks .
negative	i got a cell_phone that the back cover won ; t fit on it , wrote to complain , but get no response , out $_00 for nothing ,
negative	as for the guy who give 0_stars here , he is either blind , or idiot , or associated with dhgate .
negative	i was about to book a car and pay for it , but i was careful enough to check what it said on the website before i pay for it .
negative	i was trying is to reserve a hyundai i00 in las america airport .
neutral	i ordered on april 00 and finally received my order today , may 00 .
neutral	i understand the " dr oz " show took them by surprise , but that response is only good for the first few_days , then it becomes an excuse .
neutral	i understand the frustration folks are going thru , as i filed a complaint with paypal two_days before receiving my order .
neutral	the product came to me as discribed and as shown , but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative comments which could easily be avoided .
neutral	update_: ok so after holding for another hour ... finally got this very nice man in india who spoke great english .. negotiated to give me a credit 00_% of my costs good for a flight anywhere with same carrier , a cost of $_000 change plane fee to pay to the carrier ... so i rebooked to go see grandpa .
neutral	not my first choice but at_least they tried .
neutral	this took way to long , was a complete hassle when through 0 people to finally get someone to help me but ... cost me a couple of hundred dollars more and at_least i wasn_'_t totally out of pocket on this flight .
neutral	history :
neutral	so you go online , you buy your ticket , you buy trip cancellation insurance and all looks good .
neutral	then you get an_email every 0 hours trying to sell you more tickets ... haven_'_t gotten them to turn that off yet .
neutral	now my trip was cancelled .
neutral	yesterday i spent 0 hours on hold , then an asian - sounding agent i could barely understand came on the phone and after about 00_minutes of futzing around said he couldn_'_t help me and transferred me to the " concerned dept " .
neutral	this chap futz around for a few_minutes only to tell me he didnt cover cheapoair problems and that i had to call 000 - 000 - 0000 ... which turns_out to be the same number i had before ... today i am on hold for 00_minutes and still now response .
neutral	this travel company doesn_'_t seem to care .
neutral	if you buy a ticket ... dont bother to buy the insurance , it isn_'_t good for anything and of course you will never get these_guys on the phone .
neutral	i am calling the airline to see if they can help me .... # cheapoairsucks
neutral	i paid for next_day postage but received the item on the st nod day .
neutral	called ckear chemist and was told that a refund would be applied . item condition arrived intact , friendly customer_service .
neutral	the cas was perfect .
neutral	it felt a bit funny that rentalcars . com did not publish a phone_number .
neutral	the one i found was not working .
neutral	i simply wanted to know where they process their credit_cards from .
neutral	i now know they do it from uk - causing extra fees for me .
neutral	not mentioned anywhere .
neutral	i received an_email confirming that my mum had received her flowers , yet a phone_call revealed that she had not received any flowers .
neutral	a reply to the confirmation email resulted in a reply that stated the flowers were left on the front porch .
neutral	although mother '_s sunday may be a very busy day , a simple ring of the doorbell or a card through the mail slot would have alerted mum that she had received flowers .
neutral	poor mum spent the day thinking we had forgotten her !
neutral	very disappointing ...
neutral	i have never been more pleased with my purchase thanks so much and i will make another order soon .
neutral	i applied , and was turned down , but it was quick and easy .
neutral	priceline . com provides great deals .
neutral	i would like priceline . com to allow a bid on a hotel to be changeable solely by changing the price and not as they have it set_up now , which requires changing the price and star_rating when one re - bids after one '_s initial bid is rejected .
neutral	this is to say that priceline requires the bidder to bid the same amount for a lower - starred hotel as they had just bid for a higher - starred hotel .
neutral	... and never contacted me .
neutral	my bank had to notify me , which was not a fun experience .
neutral	could have ended worse , but i wish zappos would have taken this hacking issue a little more seriously .
neutral	when people describe someone_else as " peaked " just think of how popular myspace was , and how quickly it died by allowing people to make their own pages look like crap .
neutral	great example of not thinking smart , and giving people everything they want without long_term planning .
neutral	i used to love blogger .
neutral	now : eh , or meh .
neutral	horror stories abound on how blogspot can drop your blog , and you lose access to it .
neutral	my experience is mixed , but mostly positive .
neutral	there are some quirks to it , like all the time , but all in all , it is user_friendly and easy to use .
neutral	it '_s a great way to start blogging .
neutral	just cross your fingers that you don_'_t need trouble shooting help - as i '_ve never encountered any help from them .
neutral	that said , i have several blogs on blogger and while i seasonally consider moving over to wordpress , i stay with blogspot .
neutral	perhaps some odd sense of loyalty , or laziness , i ' m not sure .
neutral	my advice : newbie ?
neutral	start on blogger .
neutral	it '_s not that bad .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i purchase a personalized card on this site .
neutral	i like the insurance of delivery and the time of the first one .
neutral	well the second time was not a pleasure ... don_'_t like the way they handled rejecting my pic on the card ...
neutral	inundated with emails till you don_'_t know which way is up or down .
neutral	got me for a $_00 .. core .
neutral	paid more_than it would have costed me to buy local , and the unit failed year later .
neutral	this was the worst online shopping_experience i have ever had .
neutral	total partsgeek took me for 0 core charges $_000 .
neutral	restocking_fee $_00 . 00 they sent the wrong part my cost to return wrong part $_00 . 00 . and core return $_00 . 00 my loss was $_000 . 00 and as a added_bonus a poor product .. support your local small business , it seems these_guys are out to get you !..
neutral	oh and i had problems with their tracking numbers .
neutral	it '_s a good service , once the automated booking had been transferred to the local repair company they contacted me promptly , offered to come a day earlier and the bulgarian engineer was punctual , polite , knowledgeable and very helpful .
neutral	he fixed the dishwasher without any new parts and it worked for three more days before i had to call them back .
neutral	i ' d still use the company again .
neutral	often olotels has the cheapest price on comparison sites - but the actual price they display for your purchase will vary according to the links you click to get to them .
neutral	through cashback sites like quidco , for example , olotels will automatically inflate the price of the room so you pay more and the cashback discount is effectively worthless .
neutral	also , always check with the hotel you ' re booking that they '_ve received the olotels reservation in their own system , saves disappointment .
neutral	well_packaged item which arrived on time - shower was installled by my plumber who said ' it was easy to plumb ' and on testing said ' it was a nice powerful shower '.
neutral	the price on what i wanted was the lowest i found .
neutral	i have received my glasses and they are top quality .
neutral	my only complaint was the customer_service .
neutral	my order was not processed in the time frame they gave me and communication was minimal from their side .
neutral	i have a delongi coffee machine and the capsules keep slipping through , i have to get them just in the right spot then push down the handle , unlike nespresso ones that just slot in .
neutral	the coffee however is comparable to nespresso .
neutral	price competitive shame about delivery driver who said " he hadnt got time to piss about " when delivering my garden furniture and left it wedged in my gateway promptly got back in his lorry and did indeed " piss off "!
neutral	nice service not !
neutral	i had to try and unwrap the large bundle and get it off the pallet on my own whlst it was stuck in my gateway .
neutral	i was very satisfied with the part ordered .
neutral	the email received indicated that the part was shipped with fedex , the tracking_number which could not be found on fedex .
neutral	an_email was sent back to partsgeeks and was informed the fedex tracking_number was valid and shipping was just running behind orders .
neutral	checking with fedex the tracking_number could not be found .
neutral	the part was sent using us mail ( usps ) not fedex
neutral	i long for the days when skype had a simple user_interface .
neutral	now it '_s trying to be another facebook .
neutral	it '_s a phone book dammit !
neutral	the reservation was not complete ... i reserved a non_- smoking room , but the reservation was not transmitted to the motel correctly .
neutral	check the prices and add 00_%
neutral	i would like to see ebay become more involved in the process
neutral	competative prices .
neutral	long dated products .
neutral	below par packaging - size of jiffy bag was clearly too small for the goods ordered and opened in royal_mail carriage .
neutral	either someone is lazy or cost - cutting .
neutral	that said i would use again based on price .
neutral	the prices are good but , i wanted to edit the amount to order more after i entered the payment information and i didn_'_t see an option .
neutral	i had to re - submit all of my information all over again .
neutral	i had a chat session with one of the cashnet associates .
neutral	she explained_everything to me .
neutral	i was pleased with the information given .
neutral	thank_you cashnet .
neutral	iphone verizon 0s unlock took 00 days on a virgin 0 . 0 . 0 system .
neutral	there is always a number to call with a problem
neutral	this site is great in many ways , except for oversea trips .
neutral	they booked me in this decent hotel , but i could not speak a single word .
neutral	kudos to the hotel , but language barrier .
neutral	i bought a brand_new vocal screen , which appears the last available , only to recieve in excellent time , but obviously flawed .
neutral	tell tale signs of use , and one bent componant marred what otherwise would have been an excellent experience .
neutral	coupled with the lack of response from cs when emailed , they probably won '_t see my money again .
neutral	shame .
neutral	avis gave me a car where the brakes jerked and when i told them about it they said they already knew of the problem but had issued the car anyway .
neutral	otherwise , the car was comparable to other cars on the island .
neutral	as for using rentalcars , i did not realize that my credit_card would be charged immediately upon making my reservation even_though my trip was not for several weeks .
neutral	i ' m sure it was in the fine_print somewhere but i didn_'_t see it .
neutral	also , the taxes were not included in the quoted price which did not make the final price a great deal like it initially appeared .
neutral	price was excellent , love the product .
neutral	however , it is apparent that the " new " unit i purchased was in fact a " used " and returned one .
neutral	there were scratches and chipped paint , and all bolts , washers and other hardware were missing .
neutral	i was able to replace the bolts and washers at my local ace hardware , but at a cost of over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the unit installed very easily , and i am satisfied with it .
neutral	i am not satisfied with partsgeek . com for selling me a " used " unit without all the parts included .
neutral	buyer_beware on that one .
neutral	got us to spain without any delays .
neutral	booking process was frustrating and they added extra tax at the last_minute .
neutral	i still prefer easyjet .
neutral	there is nothing to be said about ordering and delivering , everything just works like a charm .
neutral	but in my opinion the store need to describe the products better in terms of battery life on the e_- cigs and online usermanuals , since the manual in the pakage " stinks " and is downright worthless for a first time user of the product .
neutral	also i think it would be a good idea to recommend compatible products under each items page .
neutral	you take to long to pay out
neutral	one shirt no button on sleave you had a jock on me will not come_back rip_off 00 waist was 00
neutral	after i received the bulbs i ordered , i noticed that the r00 bulbs didnt have the same lumen spec .
neutral	on the packaging as specified on the website .
neutral	i sent them the following message and never_heard back :
neutral	" i just received my shipment .
neutral	i am a little confused in that your website specification for the satco s0000 indicates the initial lumens to be 000 yet the package they come in shows the lumens rating at 000 .
neutral	i purchased these in part because of the higher lumen rating .
neutral	can you help me understand the difference ?"
neutral	i admit i opted for smartbuyglasses for 0 reasons .
neutral	firstly was the cost which was competetive , and scondly as the pair i wanted were marked on the site as available for fast delivery which was what i needed as i was going on holiday .
neutral	i read their promises on delivery times carefully to see if it would arrive in time .
neutral	only after i paid did i get an_email to say they were waiting for stock .
neutral	so despite what the site had said when i ordered the raybans that they were available for fast delivery , this proved to be incorrect .
neutral	when i replied to their email they did offer me a different pair at a reduced price , but i did not take them up on the offer as i wanted what i had originally ordered .
neutral	i did get my glasses just in time , and they are the real product and i am very happy with them .
neutral	but if it is important that you get your glasses quicly , do not trust the fast delivery claim as it may not be accurate .
neutral	i , ve been with this travel_agent since the past few_months .
neutral	my first visit to krabi thailand was wonderful . the hotel offered was spacy and comfortable and cheap as well
neutral	booked hotel and transfers with alpharooms .
neutral	hotel fantastic and no problem with transfer from airport to hotel however for the return_journey i was told to reconfirm the booking the night before we were to leave .
neutral	i went to reception but there was no number on the printed booking form i had , i had to pay to go on the internet ( this took 00_minutes , did not work first time , crashed 0nd time ) and there was no number on manage my booking .
neutral	back to reception to ring alpharooms but office was closed .
neutral	tried again the following_morning but no success however the very helpful receptionist rang some travel agency and they confimed we would be colllected .
neutral	over an_hour of my holiday time was spent trying to sort out de transfer and it stressed me and my travellers .
neutral	booked flights , hotel , and taxi transfers with alpharooms and all went well .
neutral	decided subsequently to cancel the taxi transfers and booked a car instead .
neutral	this was no problem and for safety reasons decided to take out the additional " total damage_excess waiver " insurance at a cost of £_00 on top of the regular insurance .
neutral	to my surprise when i went to collect the car in portugal i was asked if i wanted the excess insurance .
neutral	i replied that i had the tdew but was informed that this was irrelevent and unless i took out their excess insurance at a cost of 000euros that i would be liable for an excess of up to 0000euros !
neutral	!
neutral	well that was a no brainer , so the moral of the story is forget the total damage_excess waiver insurance supplied by alpharooms and get it at resort .
neutral	i contacted alpharooms and unfortunately they didn_'_t want to know .
neutral	shame .
neutral	dont ever answer emails ...!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	having now read other reviews .... i realise i ' m not alone by not having emails replied to and money being taken yet no delivery .
neutral	will be taking legal_action if i dont receive a response in the next 00 hours and will never buy again despite having spent £_000 '_s previously ....
neutral	then .... got an answer after posting the above review only to be fobbed off for another month .
neutral	still got my money ..... still no goods ..... still no email reply or phone_call apology .
neutral	only one option left from here .....
neutral	waiting for glutenflam for months now .
neutral	checked again last night , out f stock .
neutral	i was on a waiting list .
neutral	checked with chat line and wasn_'_t really happy with the customer_service girl .
neutral	she could care less if i went to another site for this .
neutral	finally found what i wanted and ordered it elsewhere .
neutral	not sure if i will come_back .
neutral	i use priceline in order to attempt to bid prices at hotels , and on rental_cars .
neutral	i was able to get a loaded mid - size fuel efficient gmc suv for $_00 a day on priceline .
neutral	the only thing i don_'_t like is that sometimes the descriptions provided by the hotels and reviews by readers is not accurate .
neutral	on a july 0000 trip the hotel claimed free parking , but the parking was on the street parking which would have been more accurate in new_orleans .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	fortunately my stay was during the week and off - season thus being handicapped it would have been a challenge .
neutral	you cannot get a refund when you bid and the vendor accepts .
neutral	i have saved on airline flights on priceline .
neutral	so the best advice is to either stay in 0 - 0 star hotels or pick an area that has only one hotel of the star_level you want , by reviewing hotel websites so that you don_'_t get ripped_off .
neutral	overall priceline is an amazing tool that is only as good as the user .
neutral	the la cumbre store in santa barbara seriously lacks in customer_service , and choice in latest trends and fashions .
neutral	i was very dissapointed to see that the sales person had absolutely no idea what the store is carrying and to find out that they didn ; t carry long skirts at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	long skirts are the trend this year , and they have none .
neutral	from the order and each day got updates on how the shipment was coming .
neutral	all was great .
neutral	the item upon receipt was inspected and the warranty covered everything except the grommets .
neutral	i unpackaged the cover and the grommets were less_than satisfactory .
neutral	some were crushed ( folded and could not run line through ) others were not placed on the cover properly ( the grommets were not completely on the fabric ).
neutral	this appears to be a second rate pool cover and i have to cover my pool now .
neutral	i feel those should have been inspected before shipping .
neutral	i am not willing to pay for shipping and take the chance of getting a second faulty cover .
neutral	i appreciate your updates on shipping but the quality of the product is not what i expected .
neutral	i will not order products again through this site .
neutral	the one drawback is that once you purchase on " name your_own price ," you are no_longer a customer and are not welcomed .
neutral	priceline would benefit greatly if they examined their model and provided for travelers to either see a review of the hotels they are about to purchase unseen , or give the customer 0 " refund " per 00 purchases or something .
neutral	had to put my details on card in five times as kept sticking , had to add address details twie as removed them !
neutral	frustrating ,
neutral	i have used zazzle for years .
neutral	the products are generally great and the service is good ( production / shipping ) but awful if there is a problem .
neutral	the are too many changes to the design progress that are just changes and not improvements .
neutral	often it seems there is little trouble shooting of design changes , and zazzle denies a problems exists .
neutral	several months_ago they eliminated their volumes bonus program but started calling referral bonuses volume bonuses ( which they are not ).
neutral	this means a loss of hundreds of dollars a year for a designer with large stores .
neutral	small stores never qualified for volumes bonuses anyway .
neutral	it is kinda like leaving the price of a bag of sugar at $ 0 . 00 and then changing the size of the bag from 0lb to 0lb .
neutral	if you are eliminating the volume bonuses , be honest about it .
neutral	some of us are smart enough to know the difference .
neutral	arrived at sea mist resort on thursday , may 00 , 0000 , around 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	the front_desk personal was very friendly and efficient .
neutral	i call the front_desk two times , and both times i was greeted very professionally , and they did not mind answering my questions .
neutral	a big plus was the welcome call , once i checked in .
neutral	i was suppose to have a ocean view room , what looked out towards another building , which was disappointing .
neutral	the room was clean , which was a plus .
neutral	the elevator was not the best , it almost stuck between floors .
neutral	i was in one of the older buildings and they were celebrating 00 years ....
neutral	the downside of my stay was the very poor internet service .
neutral	the wifi would connect , but that is all you could do .
neutral	you could not get online .
neutral	for that reason , i would not stay there again , but for the money , it was clean .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	get your money back .
neutral	we called at 0 : 00_pm the day before a night walking tour through chinatown , and by my calculations , it was 00 hours before the trip , but by viators calculations it was not .
neutral	i was on vacation and i didn_'_t want to fight , but i have to tell you , it left a sour taste in my mouth , considering we had booked 0 trips through viator .
neutral	we are now going to los_angeles in august , and i ' m not totally sure that i will book through viator .
neutral	i actually sent an_email with a question about pick - up at my hotel .
neutral	i received a confirmation and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	no one did .
neutral	so , as you can see , i ' m having my doubts as to whether i want to give my money to them , when there '_s plenty of other tour companies .
neutral	lige et_par tanker i punktform :
neutral	- jeres telefonkø er uacceptabel .
neutral	fortæl i det mindste folk , hvad nummer de er i køen !
neutral	- det_er fint at i er flittige til at svare folk her i trustpilots forum , men_det virker useriøst , når det bare er en sludder for en sladder .
neutral	lad være med at svare , medmindre i har noget vigtigt at tilføje , en decideret undskyldning fx .
neutral	- jeg finder jeres netforbindelse tilfredsstillende for det meste , men i perioder er den ustabil , men så er i søde til at hjælpe med en løsning .
neutral	- jeg synes i skulle tilbyde en løsning så man_kan bruge googles chromecast .
neutral	vær med på moden !
neutral	i ordered a case for my ipad mini .
neutral	i ordered it before i preordered the mini ( one week before mini released ).
neutral	the ipad came last friday .
neutral	it '_s monday , and snugg is asking for a review .
neutral	the cover won '_t be here until wednesday .
neutral	i can '_t review the case , but i ' m already disappointed that my ipad has no case , yet .
neutral	honestly , if i had known it would take so long , i would have just waited and ordered a different case from somewhere_else .
neutral	this snugg was only offered in black , but i accepted that because i thought it would be here at the same time as my ipad .
neutral	i probably would have ordered a different color ... but too_late now .
neutral	update_: the case did arrive later on monday .
neutral	it '_s actually pretty nice .
neutral	however , there is a letter stating that apple moved the magnets at the last_minute , so the ' smart cover ' aspect doesn_'_t work at this time .
neutral	they promise to send a revised ( fully functioning ) version in the next 00 days , this case , so_far , is for protection ... and i won '_t have to return it when the new one arrives .
neutral	nice_touch & the rating is getting better .
neutral	the black is alright .
neutral	i do wish it came in other colors , but this will do .
neutral	we '_ll see if / when the 0nd case arrives .
neutral	update 0 : the replacement case arrived today .
neutral	it was a little more_than 00 days , but the new case is just the same , but now the smart cover feature works .
neutral	regardless of whatever timing issues i had , the case is a good quality and feels nice .
neutral	okay so i hit the button and watch the speedo go up and down and up and down - then again for the upload speed ( getting boring .
neutral	.
neutral	. )
neutral	and it '_s done .
neutral	i get two numbers and a list of providers and contracts .
neutral	my download is 00 mbps and the upload ( does it matter for ebay ) is lower .
neutral	is that good or bad ( even ugly ) or just average .
neutral	we men are in that state of questioning from puberty so you just added to my angsts .
neutral	relief please !
neutral	tell me wtf it means !!
neutral	otherwise yada yada yada it seemed to work fine !
neutral	you kept me entertained in the time it took for me to reach 00 mbps .
neutral	how was it for you ?
neutral	there are a lot of issues with google .
neutral	i used them & then i get lots of unwanted interruption in searches .
neutral	would like this to stop & would like to be able to choose what i want to see on my screen .
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes .
neutral	i tried on my medusa costume and when my husband was zipping it up it was a little tight and then it ripped !
neutral	now , i have a party in 0 days have to figure_out a way to alter it .
neutral	not real happy !
neutral	it was a size l and i where a 00 in ladies so that should be fine .
neutral	i purchased an olympic a barbell set which arrived yesterday .
neutral	the product itself looks like good quality so no complaint there .
neutral	however my experience was soured by the attitude of customer_service staff and the carrier they employ when my order didn_'_t arrive between the time they said it would .
neutral	it wasn_'_t too_late when it arrived but the point was when i rang the carrier told me he had delivery down as being 0pm as opposed to before 00pm , so my initial reaction was half my day had been wasted and my time , like theirs , is money and when i pointed this out to the customer_service team the reaction i got sounded quite aggressive and the call back from someone higher up i was told i would get never came .
neutral	the attitude of the carrier company was also arrogant and disinterested , like he was doing me the favour !
neutral	the customer_service team and the carrier service need to remind themselves that it '_s the customer that keeps them in jobs .
neutral	goods website and booking went fine my only problem was that i booked a twin room and ended_up with a double .
neutral	alpharooms told the hotel double .
neutral	i have been in touch with alpharooms and to be far they have been very helpful .
neutral	however they have tried to say that i thought i was going to get two rooms , but i didn_'_t expect this i expected two beds in one room ( a twin room ?!)
neutral	but alpharooms say that " a twin room is a double occupancy room which is what you received ."
neutral	yes got a double occupancy room but it was a double bed which i had to share with a friend and although we know each other very well , and are good friends we didn_'_t particularly want to sleep in the same bed !
neutral	although it has been the source of much merriment to our fellow travelling companions .
neutral	so beware if you book a twin room with alpharooms you could end up in a double bed ....
neutral	i loved the finished canvas and would recommend the company highly for this .
neutral	however , i was away for a week when it was delivered .
neutral	instead of posting a card through my door to arrange redelivery , the canvas was just left there .
neutral	luckily my neighbour took it in but this is most unsatisfactory and for this reason i will never use the company again sadly
neutral	pictires of hotel very deceiving .
neutral	could have booked the room cheaper thru travelocity .
neutral	however i did not really have a bad experience using hotels one . com .
neutral	would consider using them again .
neutral	have used holiday autos on many occassions and they have always been really good , however this time they sub contracted to firefly which is located in the car_park ( not an easy trek with suitcases etc ) only to discover we had to take a number and we waited in it for over an_hour , really not good enough to have only two people to serve at_least two incoming flights .
neutral	i looked up one company , with whom i had what must be a common bad experience , and saw mostly 0_stars or 0 star .
neutral	the 0 star reviews were often short and generic , came during a relatively short_period of time following bad_reviews , and the reviewer had only one review here .
neutral	what would motivate those 0 star individual ( s )?
neutral	my question : do you screen these types of reviews , whereby a company might polish their image ?
neutral	if so , how ?
neutral	do you look at the ip address ?
neutral	we need to trust your data , please .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	please explain your deals with businesses : 0 ) take control of your online image .
neutral	generate a regular flow of reviews from genuine customers automatically with trustpilot business .
neutral	it requires no special software , just a single email .
neutral	0 ) display independent reviews and create trust 00_% of online shoppers use customer reviews in their decision making process ( yougov 0000 ).
neutral	by displaying positive_reviews on your site through trustpilot , you give them the reassurance they need to complete their purchase .
neutral	ordered a taillight .. ok
neutral	i have traded on ebay since it started .
neutral	at the beginning it was a much_better resource where people connected with one another to sell their stuff .
neutral	it was a great way to sell things that you no_longer needed ( or wanted ) or to find components you could not find locally .
neutral	things once sold at garage sales were suddenly available through ebay .
neutral	the prices were really decent .
neutral	there was a nice community of folks , too .
neutral	still is .
neutral	unfortunately ebay has evolved into a place where prices have gone way up and scalping is not unusual .
neutral	i have seen items selling for more_than msrp ( sometimes double or even triple , depending on how scarce the item is ).
neutral	usually it is something kids want with parents who do not know the value of teaching delayed gratification .
neutral	as in waiting until something is available at a reasonable price .
neutral	when a new video_game system is released , demand is usually much higher_than supply ; and , to some , no price is too high .
neutral	the same goes for some popular video_games .
neutral	some will say this is a good thing .
neutral	i ' m not sure that greed is ever good .
neutral	when i say greed , i am not strictly speaking about sellers .
neutral	it is on the part of the buyers who must have something no_matter how much they pay .
neutral	that was bound to happen .
neutral	ebay is no_longer the small community it once was .
neutral	it is still a darned good place to find things you cannot find anywhere_else .
neutral	vinyl albums ... older games , movies , etc .
neutral	that is what made ebay a good thing in the beginning and that has not changed .
neutral	just make_sure you know your prices .
neutral	and use paypal to protect yourself .
neutral	ordered the bike on a sunday but it took over 0 weeks to deliver it , which in this day and age is unacceptable .
neutral	price is good delivery sucks
neutral	travelocity was one of the best , with the lowest service fees of any .
neutral	not any more .
neutral	their site looks just like expedia , who i presume bought them out .
neutral	priceline is now the best .
neutral	too bad , i used travelocity all the time , until now .
neutral	for at starte med det gode .
neutral	maden var virkelig god , om end stegt flæsk med persillesovs ikke_kan kaldes gourmetmad , men_det_var vi heller_ikke blevet lovet !!
neutral	betjeningen var_meget ung , men god , dog ventede vi næsten 0 kvarter på forretten den første aften - i en " set menu " både vin og vand var absolut i den dyre ende .
neutral	værelserne var pæne - ikke for rene , vi fandt vores del af spindelvæv , men der_er_meget trafikstøj , jeg forstår ikke , at man_ikke investerer i støjdæmpende glas , larmen begyndte allerede ved 0 - tiden om morgenen !
neutral	!
neutral	ikke det billigste selskab , men jeg_har kun fået god service .
neutral	good prices on products but paying more_than 00_% of the product price for shipping and still having to wait 0 - 00 days for delivery seems to be a bit of a rip_off !
neutral	hi . nice compact glasses but fragile . also the case is huge for small glasses . i won '_t be using the case .
neutral	waited in all day and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	still heard_nothing two_days_later .
neutral	had to ring pine solutions and they gave a £_00 . 00 refund for the problems we had received .
neutral	not too impressed ..... our first order .... and the drawers are not flush on the unit .....
neutral	it '_s great to be able to personalize a card , but why does it cost over $ 0 to send just a basic card ?
neutral	also curious why credit . com shows my experian credit score of 000 while identity_guard shows 000 .
neutral	that '_s a helluva difference and credit . com referred me to identity_guard .
neutral	what am i to do now ... pay a 0rd_party for a 0rd opinion ?
neutral	and these scores do not correlate to those seen by mortgage companies , banks and auto finance people .
neutral	just placed my first order .
neutral	so will rate when order received .
neutral	ordering was easy
neutral	the resources available at ancestry are pretty_much second to none , but i feel that their pricing is extremely high
neutral	i was really excited to see the layout of the program .... very user_friendly .
neutral	then i got to the id vault section that is included with the subscription .
neutral	that is when i realized it requires windows xp , vista or windows 0 .
neutral	i am an apple mac user all the way and shocked they didn_'_t allow for those not on microsoft .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	still_waiting for my order . i ' m sure i will be happy with it .
neutral	i have been a member for a few years but have gotten nothing from it , also a few contacts of mine have dropped it , so i probably will also .
neutral	excellent as far as arrangements for collection of cd '_s disappointed that no reason was given on why payment was made .
neutral	this not to much of a problem with a 00 p cd however with a £ 0 cd and nothing given i would have preffered to have the cd back but i was not given the option .
neutral	i will try somewhere_else next time
neutral	website has poor search options , but the real killer here is the shipping , which added 00_% to the cost .
neutral	i would never buy a liquid supplement here , as the shipping surcharge would kill you !
neutral	in general , goldstar has offered tickets for many events that i ' m interested in at a good price , but there have been a few problems .
neutral	on 0 may , 0000 , we took the blue and gold alcatraz boat cruise .
neutral	the address listed to pick_up tickets was 000 beach st . , which was wrong - the actual address was the blue and gold ticket window on jefferson st , 0 blocks away .
neutral	as my husband is physically disabled , this was a hardship for him .
neutral	the cruise itself was very interesting , and the goldstar price was very reasonable .
neutral	there have been other problems as well - a couple of times , i '_ve paid for tickets for 0st balcony or mezzanine performances and when i go to the box office , they give me 0nd balcony tickets .
neutral	when i explain that i bought better tickets , the box office says that we have to resolve it with goldstar , which of course , i can '_t on the night of the performance .
neutral	i think this is more the box office '_s fault than goldstar , but it '_s still annoying .
neutral	after installing the new screen ( which was really not very difficult ) and turning on the laptop , i noticed in the upper left hand corner a very short red vertical mark that was present regardless of what was being displayed .
neutral	apparently the screens undergo no test prior to shipping .
neutral	i asked my daughter , for whom i had install the new screen , if the mark bothered her and she thought " she could live with it ."
neutral	were it mine , i would be annoyed .
neutral	however , she was simply happy to have her laptop operational again .
neutral	but as we '_ve heard before high shipping_costs .
neutral	even so the bottom_line is still good .
neutral	lets see more shipping options with cheaper rates .
neutral	it should have been so easy , but it took me two phone_calls and a lot of time to make hotel reservations for four rooms .
neutral	i thought it would be easier to call the hotel reservation line directly and get the best price .
neutral	the associate was very nice and tried to be helpful , but i had to ask for the discounted price i had seen on line .
neutral	i don_'_t know why , but it took her a very long time to make the reservation ; unfortunately , she had not noted that we preferred to be on the same floor either , so she had to go back into the computer to add the request ; we need to double - check at the desk when we arrive to see if the hotel can accommodate this request .
neutral	all the rooms had to be put in my name .
neutral	i received the confirmation by email within_seconds , which was good , because it was wrong .
neutral	she had booked us for only one night !
neutral	so i called back to correct the reservation .
neutral	the person i talked to insisted that i do a separate booking because the first reservation is " non_- refundable ."
neutral	no changes can be made .
neutral	then the associate told me that it was going to cost the full price per room on saturday ; that the promotion was only on friday .
neutral	i didn_'_t think that was right based on my previous conversation , so i kept challenging that until he admitted he was looking at the " wrong date ."
neutral	i then asked him to note that we do not want to have four rooms on one night and then have to move again on saturday with the second reservation .
neutral	he said it shouldn '_t be a problem , but that he would make a note , and that we should confirm at the desk when we check in .
neutral	we now have two confirmation numbers , one for each night .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	next time i '_ll do it on line with expedia .
neutral	difficult to fill in order form .
neutral	i kept having to refill rejected information .
neutral	took four tries to complete .
neutral	price was right for item i wanted but bad forms can be a tie breaker for future orders .
neutral	first time buyer here .
neutral	thought i ' d try it before committing and glad i did .
neutral	good service and choices .
neutral	however , the prices for fancy feast were higher_than most and the box of minced turkey had mostly dented cans .
neutral	disappointed in that .
neutral	i used to buy monthly from another site but they did away with the fancy feast .
neutral	if it weren '_t for the ' target practice ' on the case of cat_food , i would likely buy again but still looking for lowest_prices and best quality .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	( i did not throw the cans out because they weren '_t bubbled tops and can '_t afford to buy more so i thank god they seem to be ok . lower prices , would help .
neutral	my biggest complaint about paypal is that you can '_t add a note to the transactions to describe what you bought .
neutral	a bis hassle for keeping track of what items have been received , etc .
neutral	the bib sizing by height ( only ) is confusing .
positive	used this site many_times .
positive	i always start mysearch here .
positive	prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites , i have found cheaper cars elsewhere .
positive	however , if you don_'_t have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e . g ., cheapest ) of the ten sites i use to reserve a car .
positive	used ebay for sales and purchases for the past 00 years and it has worked out for me overall .
positive	only one issue in that time and they took_care of it to my satisfaction .
positive	a good source for information and a good way to " window shop " when your stuck indoors on a bad_weather day .
positive	used paypal for my buying and selling for the past 0 years and never had an issue they didn_'_t resolve to my satisfaction .

positive	also , the online reviews were helpful during the decision making process .
positive	first off i usually never get extended_warranties but when i purchased a hisense tv from tiger direct something told me to get the warranty and would you believe one month after the warranty expired the tv started to act up shuting off and on , i called square_trade and spoke to a fine gentleman who seemed to know the problem right off , he over nighted the parts and set_up a tv repair man in my area to come to my house to fix it , which he did in about an_hour and so_far i ' m a happy man . square_trade rules

positive	" when i met my last rescue pet , dixie , approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , she was a real mess -- both externally and internally .
positive	she exhibited a nervous condition ( g . e . r . d .)
positive	that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
positive	she was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood - work was all over the place .
positive	so , after a round of iv fluids and 0 small bags of the ' science diet ' chow , dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home .
positive	the first thing i did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition ; i knew that i didn_'_t want to keep her on the ' science diet ' regimen -- it '_s too full of ingredients which i feel don_'_t belong in a proper diet for dogs .
positive	lo ' and behold , i stumbled_upon the " blue_buffalo wilderness " formula for dogs .
positive	it seemed_like a good fit , due to all of the proper ratios ( protein / fat ) and is totally " grain - free ".
positive	viola !

positive	the first suit was a little small , mike made sure that the size / suit got taken_care of .
positive	the replacement suit fits great , works great , looks great .
positive	i couldn_'_t be more pleased with dris and mike .
positive	he must enjoy what he does because he sure is good at it .﻿
positive	i was very impressed by your prompt and efficient delivery service , i received text messages informing_me what time to within an_hour my delivery would arrive , loved the items when they arrived , reasonable shipping rates , all in all , top_class .
positive	fast , easy and reliable .
positive	i know i '_ll get what i need when i need it .
positive	i am not one to buy merchandise warranties but because some of the items i '_ve purchsed over the last few years are hand held devices , used by our kids , i thought the likelihood of these devices getting damaged was very high ; square_trade offers accidental coverage of the warranties i '_ve purchased , i '_ve had to file a few claims and they have either fixed the item right_away , or paid for it without any hassles and right_away .
positive	their prices are totally worth it , especially if you can find a coupon .
positive	i '_ll keep using them for my electronic_purchases , especially with christmas right around the corner .
positive	i have used double 0 and always have amazing seats .
positive	tickets always arrive in good time .
positive	i love this place .
positive	if they don_'_t have the best price , they will meet and beat the competitors price .
positive	i only deal with supplement_warehouse .
positive	i have placed 0 orders with memoryc in the past 0 months .
positive	one is always somewhat skeptical when dealing_with a new vendor , especially over the internet .
positive	i can '_t say_enough about the exemplary customer_service i received from memoryc .
positive	the first order : i was given a tracking_number and an approximate delivery date , while following the orders progress i noticed it seemed to be not making any progress , i emailed memoryc ...' hoping ' to get a response ... i received an immediate reply , through the course of several emails it was found out that my order and several others had been lost by shipper .
positive	memoryc immediately sent out a replacement shipment ... as it turned_out the shipper found the missing items , memoryc contacted me again and let me know that the quickest delivery would be with the original shipment .... the order was delivered within a day of the original delivery date ..... memoryc contacted me after i signed for the package and asked if everything was as it should be ... then gave me a credit for the freight i had paid on the order .... unbelievable !
positive	second order : no difference than the first order i was given a tracking_# and delivery date ... this time on time - actually ahead of time .
positive	the issue this time was my fault ... i had ordered the wrong memory for my laptop .... i emailed memoryc - they immediately gave me a rga and helped_me verify that i was ordering the right part #.
positive	as it turns_out , i sent the memory back in a us postal envelope .. somehow the envelope opened during transit and the memory was lost .... memoryc notified me and sent me a picture of the envelope when they received it .... what could i say at that point .... they said a lot .... they first offered me a voucher for a discount on my next order ... then turned around a few_days_later and give me the credit for the memory .... again unbelievable !
positive	giving me the credit was far and beyond there responsibility ... but very much appreciated !
positive	in this day and age of ' numbers ' - it is nice to find a company who cares , and one you can actually contact and get immediate answers and help .
positive	thank_you memoryc ....
positive	snelle levering , goeie service en niet duur .

positive	we bought two cars in the past twelve months both times using carsdirect . com .
positive	in both cases they were extremely_helpful in locating the vehicles in a timely_manner .
positive	the visit to the dealership the first time was less_than 00_minutes , totally painless .
positive	the second purchase , no so much .
positive	the finance manager was a total jerk and screwed up the paperwork .
positive	he was making us travel all the way back to accomodate his mistake ( it was easily an_hour drive , round_trip ).
positive	rather_than dong this , we simply called our contact at carsdirect . com and he set the dealership straight and made them mail us the corrected documents to sign .
positive	i will always use carsdirect . com , the amount i could save negotiating on my own is not worth the countless headaches it would require .
positive	i bought 0 different pairs .
positive	i wear 0 at work while driving and reading tickets .
positive	the other pair i keep in my lake bag to wear on the boat and read while on the water .

positive	i ' d asked dozens of people about how to deal with working for a un organization and meeting my obligations as a us citizen with regard to paying taxes .
positive	no two people ever gave me the same answer .
positive	i don_'_t remember how i found taxes for expats , but when i did , i thought , " what have i got to lose ?
positive	they can '_t be any worse than the last guy i hired .
positive	at the very least , maybe they '_ll actually respond to my questions ."
positive	taxes for expats ' customer_service is excellent !
positive	their website is comprehensive and user - friendly .
positive	their services are thorough .
positive	when i had questions , i ' d send my tax accountant an_email and she would respond within 00 hours .

positive	all - in - all , taxes for expats is outstanding and worth_every penny .
positive	i '_ll definitely be engaging them again for my 0000 taxes .

positive	i normanly don ‘ purchase extended_warranties .
positive	i am so glad i did purchase the square_trade accident coverage .
positive	i dropped my $_000 camera and broke the lcd .
negative	the price quoted for me is $_000 which include t tax , liablility insurance , unlimited mileage .
negative	the website site and many review said there is not hidden fee .
negative	this is what i found out after a conversation with an agent of the company ;
negative	0 .
negative	i need to pay for a full tank of gas when i pick_up the car which they can charge me at any price they see fit .
negative	0 .
negative	i need to pay 00_% extra at the airport , why was ' nt that included in the quote .
negative	don_'_t be fooled by the lower price that they quoted .
negative	you will end up more_than other company .
negative	then the agent said he will find me a car that i don_'_t have to pay for # 0 and 0 , but the price is over $ 0000 .
negative	what a joke !
negative	cuation : be very careful , you never know what else you will get suck into when you are at the airport and needed a car .
negative	good_luck my friends .
negative	# 0 .
negative	they will not answer there phone .
negative	( if you can find the number !!!)
negative	then it will put you on hold until it hangs up # 0 .
negative	on line . they say ; you will be contacted within 00 to 00 hours ??????
negative	for there reply .. ( haven " nt hear from them yet .
negative	( but i did revived this review ?).
negative	what this is all about ??
negative	# 0 . they sent the wrong part !!!!
negative	at this point i will take the lost and hope they will use the $$$$ to get better employers . not employees .
negative	thanks for " nutin " we will be spreading the word . jrh they should read there reviews .
negative	if i had known that you would be charging my card * at the time of booking * and i could not cancel for free -- i would not have booked this room !
negative	that information needs to made available to customers before they book the room !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	i recently got back into model railroading and have been buying most of my supplies on the internet .
negative	i found hobby linc and noted they have good prices so over the past 0 months i have spent well over $ 0 , 000 .
negative	on their site without a problem .
negative	on my most recent order i received my shipment and 0 item was noted to be broken in the package and another one was not in a package but loose in the box with the package opened and left in the box ... there were also parts missing .
negative	i contacted the company and i was told since i did not pay for insurance i could return the items , but i would have to pay for shipping ?
negative	i told them the box the items arrived in was not damaged and therefore insurance would not have covered it ... the items were shipped in a damaged state .
negative	i was told that if you did not pay for insurance then they did not pay for the return even if it is their fault .
negative	i questioned them about this and i was told i would have to deal with the manufacturer for the item that was received damaged in the box .
negative	i asked why it was my responsibility to deal with the manufacturer if hobby linc sent out damaged goods to begin with ?
negative	i was told that was their policy .
negative	i pointed_out that their " policy " allowed them to put items they had on hand that were damaged in their warehouse into a box going to a customer and them have the customer deal with their damaged items !
negative	when i emailed them about the missing parts and asked that if theyt could at_least send the missing parts !
negative	i never received and answer to that email .
negative	buyer_beware !!!
negative	the prices are good but if anything is damaged when received good_luck getting it taken_care of .
negative	it appears that hobby lincs has 0 star reviews from everyone that orders from them provided they do not have any damage to their order .
negative	however , everyone that has had problems with their order gives them a one star review ....
negative	isn_'_t that interesting .
negative	i told them their policy needs some rethinking and told them they just lost a good customer
negative	very unhealthy food .
negative	would never eat here .
negative	i am recent customer of onlineticketexpress and i can say only bad and very bad things about this company .
negative	i really don_'_t believe that any of the positive_reviews listed here are true .
negative	here is the mail i have send to them after finalizing whole deal ( tickets for the first game euro 0000 poland - greece )
negative	" ok you want me to give my comments about deal through you company than here you have .
negative	first i didn ’ t received tickets i ordered . i ordered 0 tickets so called vip gold which of course were most expensive with information that they would be best avalaible seats on the side tribunes .
negative	i havent ’ t got those i received instead 0 tickets of 0 category nominal value of 0 ticket 000 zł approx 000_euro ( i paid 000_euro ).
negative	so i feel cheated by you with no word explanation .
negative	if you consider yourself fair , professional and service minded company i should get some kind of compensation .
negative	secondly the way you handled whole deal was disaster .
negative	in the order confirmation you wrote that tickets should be delivered 0 - 0 days before the event .
negative	in fact i haven ’ t got any information earlier_than just one day before .
negative	i tried to to get info by phone but this was impossible neither of your phone numbers answered .
negative	i should get my tickets delivered to my private address instead i got info that i must collect them myself at the airport on the specific time actually very late just 0 hours before the event .
negative	luckily i live in warsaw what if i didn ’ t ’?
negative	i was at the airport earlier_than you recommended namely 0 . 00_pm and it was another lucky case not only for me but also for other people who decided to buy tickets through you .
negative	at tnt nobody was aware of shipment under the number i got from you because it was not in the system .
negative	but there was guy who tried to communicate with tnt personel who hardly spoke english .
negative	i help them and it turned_out that he was private courier who brought tickets from you among them also mine .
negative	i asked people from tnt to call all other people and inform them also about their tickets .
negative	i hope that they got them on time .
negative	summarizing my experience from working with you was very bad even more as i explained in the beginning i feel cheated .
negative	i am waiting for you prompt reaction before i place my comments on all avalaible review websites .
negative	robert pelka
negative	this company is the worst on the net .
negative	their service is terrible .
negative	they expect you to pay for their mistakes .
negative	lots of stupid caring messages from names that keep changing .
negative	seriously - buy glasses from anyone_else .
negative	even main street shops are better .
negative	i will never use priceline again .
negative	i booked a room with their " lowest_price guarantee ".
negative	i paid almost $_00 more_than the hotel would have charged me if i had just walked in off the street .
negative	priceline is a joke !
negative	!
negative	crap !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i would give you a lower number if possible !
negative	i place an order 000000000 . was told items were in stock and available .
negative	kept checking back - to find out today ( the day i should be getting it ) it is back ordered .
negative	it stills says processing never has said back ordered !
negative	i would have cancelled my order and ordered someone_else .
negative	which is probably why it doesnt say that it is not available !!!
negative	terrible and deceitful service
negative	wish i had read these reviews prior to ordering from digitlook .
negative	company took my christmas order , charged my credit_card , and than sent me an_email canceling the order a few_days_later .
negative	no explanation , no customer_service - voice messages unanswered .
negative	am now battling w_/ cc company to reverse charges
negative	stay_away from these scumbags !!!
negative	!
negative	to anybody thinking of using the services of this company ....
negative	please don_'_t !
negative	i placed an order online on 00 july , paying in advance via sagepay .
negative	an_email confirmation was received immediately and that was the first and only contact i have managed to achieve with this company .
negative	the telephone_number supplied in the confirmation rings incessantly , with no scope for leaving a message .
negative	emails receive no response and although sagepay inform me that they contacted the company , i am not aware that they received any answer , either .
negative	the address supplied in herne bay , kent is a private house , which i have seen for myself as i live not far away .
negative	i did not call in at the address as i was waiting for the " reasonable time " ( 00 days ) to elapse before cancelling the order .
negative	a recorded delivery letter to the address , informing the company of my intention to cancel the order under the sale of goods_act and the distance selling regulations , has received no response , but has not been returned by the post_office , so was presumably signed for .
negative	to add to the mystery , the company has not actually taken the payment via sagepay and will not now be able to do so .
negative	i have now cancelled the order , am obviously without the goods ordered and have paid for a recorded delivery letter with no means of recouping the cost .
negative	i shall now try to persuade sagepay to kick this company into touch as one of their merchants and am enlisting my local citizens ' advice bureau '_s help .
negative	they intend to ask kent county council '_s trading_standards department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide . com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations .
negative	in the meantime , please avoid this company like the plague !
negative	ps to trustpilot : what is the point of insisting on a minimum number of stars in a case like this ?
negative	one star out of five is a score of 00 %: quite ludicrous !
negative	just installed a rebuilt 0rzfe engine in a 00 toyota tacoma for my son .
negative	for those of you that need 0 they are hard to find and $ 0000 . 00 plus core charge .
negative	once complete it would not run properly , we started trouble shooting to find that 0 of the 0 injectors were badly corroded .
negative	so i ordered replacements from buyautoparts . com .
negative	after installing the engine ran slightly better but still on not all 0 cylinders .
negative	while starting a noid test to see if the injectors are getting the proper fire , on the second injector the engine made a loud knocking sound that concerned the mechanic i was working with .
negative	we pulled the plugs out to see that # 0 plug was drenched in fuel and had not been firing .
negative	the new injector had filled the cylinder with fuel causing hydrolock ( bent cylinder rod ).
negative	after contacting buyautoparts . com about the defective part they wanted to speak to the mechanic and they would get back to me shortly .
negative	my mechanic called them then called me back , after 0 hours waiting for buyauto to call me then i finally called them back .
negative	the customer_service person was to send a replacement injector at no charge but refuses to give me any assistance in repairing the damaged caused_by the faulty part .
negative	she even stated that the part is probably not bad but i had other issued causing the injector to dump fuel and the same problem would happen with the replacement .
negative	i took the injectors and had them tested to find that 0 were operating properly spraying 00cc '_s of fuel yet the 0th was spraying 00cc '_s which filled the cylinder with fuel and caused this problem .
negative	i then contacted buyautoparts . com again , i sent them paperwork indicating the test results along with a video of the test , i again asked about liability and how they are going to assist me in the additional repairs .
negative	they stated that their warranty does not cover labor replacing a defective part yet i kept stating i was not looking for labor on the part , i needed parts and labor to repair other issued caused_by the part .
negative	they sent me a copy of the warranty and the last line is " we expressly disclaim liability for incidental and consequential damages caused_by the auto part sold ".
negative	here it is , i ' m screwed !
negative	i with i could expressly disclaim liability in my business and get away with it .
negative	them i realized that this company is a google trusted store so i contacted google for assistance with my issued .
negative	google was able to get me a full_refund of the original cost of my order but they were not able to get buyautoparts . com to take responsibility for the problems they caused me .
negative	now thanks to this faulty part i have to spend another $_000 . 00 in additional parts along with the labor cost to repair a perfectly good engine that has never ran before !
negative	i am owed money for 0 phones which i up graded last summer .
negative	0 htc phones and was told i would get £_00 . 00 .
negative	but i never got a penny .
negative	it '_s a shame all of us who were ripped_off can '_t track these ars × holes down and do something about it .
negative	if they are not paying us they should at_least send phones back .
negative	they can be traced by imei numbers .
negative	i am gutted i am sick and unable to work for sometime now due to heart and kidney problems , i needed that money .
negative	it ’_s not true .
negative	i took them up on their offer of “ guaranteed booking or your money back ”, i paid £_000 . 00 in march 0000 .
negative	after a year with them i have not had any bookings , so i emailed several_times asking for my money back and got no response .
negative	i even posted a message on their facebook_page , which has now mysteriously disappeared and some one responded saying that they had been trying , unsuccessfully , to contact me .
negative	huh !
negative	my email_address and phone_number is on all my messages and on the owners rentals website .
negative	i doubt i will ever see my money !
negative	they are crooks !
negative	great concept , horrible company .
negative	what you need to know :
negative	the quotes are not " free " in as much as you have to pay to act on them .
negative	shiply calls it a " deposit " but it '_s actually a non_- returnable fee for getting the contact details of the shipping company .
negative	if for whatever reason the shipping company is unable to fulfil , shiply keep your money , no ifs no buts .
negative	in my case i never_heard from the shipping company , they didn_'_t contact me to complete and they never replied to emails , and shiply kept my money and were dismissive in the process .
negative	i think that breaches uk consumer_protection laws and have reported them to trading_standards .
negative	i have seen lots of other people with similar complaints who have had to try and recover their money from their credit_card or paypal .
negative	i think when the service works it '_s great , but if something goes_wrong you are screwed .
negative	i had an item to be collected for return , they did not collect .
negative	rescheduled , they did not collect .
negative	i phoned and waited 00_mins ( at my expense ) i was informed the wait time would be 00_minutes .
negative	i was told that <_private data_removed_> from complaints would return my call in a minute , after 0 hours i went out .
negative	i e_- mailed a complaint , no reply .
negative	i phoned again , was told by <_private data_removed_> that the item would be collected by 0pm that night , it was collected at 0pm , i was also told that <_private data_removed_> would contact me the next_morning to confirm collection .
negative	that was00 days ago and yet again no phone_call , i do not hold out much hope .
negative	absolutely usless !!
negative	and all at my time and expense
negative	service ?
negative	what service !!!!!
negative	oh and i was told that they do not give compensation for phone_calls made at my expense even_though the problem was caused_by yodel .
negative	i '_ve never dealt_with a less ethical company then paypal .
negative	i will never use their service under any circumstance .
negative	they should not be trusted for their poor customer_service and total_lack of ethics .
negative	the worst .
negative	i would not use again .
negative	i booked an expensive room in nyc , planning to spend the night with two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel informed me that no more_than two people could be permitted in the room , and that only priceline customer_service could fix the problem ( by allowing their " king room " with sofa bed ).
negative	the other alternative of course was that i pay for an extra room at their exhorbitant price .
negative	i called priceline customer_service , which sounded like a call_center in india , and after a long wait , they would do nothing more_than read a passage to me saying that all rooms are nonrefundable .
negative	no service at all , just delay and unpleasantness .
negative	it is not okay when traveling to arrive at the hotel with tired children and find that you can not actually be permitted to stay in the room you already paid for .
negative	( fortunately , we found out before actually leaving home , but feel cheated of quite a lot of money .)
negative	bought a groupon to take a balloon flight with this company .
negative	i lost count of how many_times i called and left a message with no return call .
negative	then when i finally talked with someone , there were no weekend dates available in this century .
negative	then when i finally scheduled a date to go , and after i woke up at 0 :_00am and drove over an_hour to make it to temecula in time for a sunrise flight , i arrived to find out the flight was cancelled due to weather .
negative	strange ...
negative	i saw at_least eight other balloons flying in what could only be described as perfect conditions .
negative	fought with both sunrise balloons and groupon to get a refund , in a frustrating but eventually successful battle .
negative	but did i get refunded for all the time i spent including the trip to and from temecula , or the gas i used ?
negative	nope .
negative	it cost me a lot of time and money to learn what i ' m about to tell you : don_'_t use this company .
negative	got a groupon for a hot air balloon ride with sunrise balloons in temecula .
negative	first off , the deal claimed the value was $_000 and the groupon was for $_00 .
negative	but later i discover that several other_companies in the area - all of which have way higher yelp ratings ( strike one ) - all charge about $_000 to $_000 .
negative	so the " value " was substantially inflated .
negative	strike two .
negative	called the company to try to redeem and no one answered so left a message .
negative	no response after two_days .
negative	strike thee .
negative	called again .
negative	voicemail again .
negative	called again , and again , and again .
negative	strike four , five , etc .
negative	finally got a hold of someone , who helped_me schedule a flight for a date over a month away because none of the many dates i wanted were available .
negative	another strike .
negative	when the fateful date arrives , i wake up at 0 :_00am and show up at the launch site at 0 - something in the morning after driving over an_hour to temecula , no sunrise balloons .
negative	so i call and - surprise - no answer .
negative	when i finally talk to someone , they say they had to cancel due to weather .
negative	what ?
negative	i saw at_least 0 other balloons floating through the early morning sky on what could only be described as a perfect day .
negative	were they in different weather ?
negative	when i contacted groupon for a refund , they told me that it is the nature of ballooning that sometimes flights cancel due to weather , and i needed to try to reschedule and only if i was not able to reschedule would i get a refund .
negative	what about a refund for the frustration , and the gas i used to drive to temecula ?
negative	groupon needs to do a better job of a ) choosing the companies they work with b ) stating the actual value of the product or service and c ) not ripping people off .
negative	there is no rating this company .
negative	rating of 0
negative	i don_'_t care how long they have been in service
negative	web_site is a blanket cover
negative	shouldn '_t be allowed to do business
negative	our booking stated 0 hour 00_minutes approximately , for our transfer to agios nikalaos from heraklion .
negative	from boarding the coach to arriving at the resort it was 0 hours .
negative	the person meeting us at our accommodation had given us up and gone home .
negative	we had been travelling since 0 . pm the previous day with 0 children age 0 and 0 years .
negative	our confirmation of booking states ' they will be responsible for your smooth and efficient transportation from and to the airport ; we guarantee you will be arriving at your destination on time ' we did not risk the transfer back , and took the local bus instead .
negative	however | know of others who took the transfer back to the airport , the journey again took longer than_expected and they had to rush at the airport .
negative	we contacted resorthoppa only to be told the time quoted was only and estimate .
negative	i contacted them further , several_times , requesting their abta number , but never received a reply .
negative	i have since contacted abta who tell me the company are not a member .
negative	i have taken advise from trading_standards and have written to resorthoppa again requesting a reply within 00 days .
negative	we will never use this company again .
negative	i bought a men '_s thigh length compression garment following my hip revision surgery with removal of a seroma .
negative	the zipper on the garment broke after about two months .
negative	i emailed and called customer_service on several_occasions leaving a contact telephone_number and an_email_address .
negative	no one ever responded !
negative	i would advise people in need of compression garments to look for other vendors because once lymphedema products has your money they don_'_t know you .
negative	i will not use this service again .
negative	i had to cancel due to a death of a close friend and was charged $_00 . 00 just to cancel a hotel for a couple of nights .
negative	next time i will just call and book the hotel directly .
negative	they only charge if you cancel 00 hours in advance .
negative	i canceled over 0 week in advance .
negative	a delivery arranged for my work address , made months in advance of the delivery , was completely botched .
negative	at great inconvenience to me and my co - workers , disrupting multiple plans , i am forced to work at home tomorrow .
negative	this is something basic that should go right the first time .
negative	since this is my first time using viagogo , i can report a 000_% disappointing experience .
negative	my transaction id is 0000000 .
negative	also worth pointing out after a fairly fruitless conversation with customer_service -- don_'_t call them , they '_ll call you , as all you '_ll get is an automated phone_number with no " real_person " option -- i got the customer_service rep to promise a call back from a manager to explain the cock - up .
negative	no call yet .
negative	i ' m waiting .

negative	ladies , i have posted product code a0s000000 , size 00r , back to you
negative	today asking for your consideration to exchange for the same product
negative	( still in khaki ) in a size 00r .
negative	i noticed this product is back on sale again for £_000 . 00 and you
negative	still show a size 00r available in the khaki .
negative	would you please put aside a size 00r in the khaki for product code
negative	a0s000000 for me and hold it pending arrival of the returned product
negative	for exchange ?
negative	i would hate to miss out on your wonderful product due to a lack of
negative	size availability and wish you and yours " happy holidays !
negative	".
negative	thanking you in advance for your expeditious attention to this matter , i remain
negative	very truly yours ,

negative	my experience was very disappointing .
negative	i had a reservation to park and shuttle to the airport unfortunately when i arrived at the hotel i was told i could not park in the lot because i did not stay at the hotel , subsequently i had to park at the airport and incur an outrageous fee !!
negative	i reported the incident to customer_service at global parking and was told by two individuals , carolyn and amanda that unfortunately there was nothing that could be done about the expense that was incurred .
negative	as an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important .
negative	when there is a break in communication with the hotel and the parking service the customer should be compensated for the inconvenience .
negative	the " little " inconvenience cost me a late arrival to the airport and a $_000 . 00 to park at the airport .
negative	definitely a horrible_experience and poor customer_service !
negative	i order a 0000 volvo 000 cornering light body which in fact did not fit my 0000 volvo 000 .
negative	i am very disappointed that it cost me $ 0 . 00 to ship and $ 0 . 00 to return the wrong_size part through no fault of my own .
negative	i did receive credit for the cost of the part .
negative	partsgeek . com advertised that this was the correct_part but it did not fit my auto .
negative	i hope this will help someone_else in the future in knowing the complete partsgeek . com return_policy .
negative	i don_'_t get it
negative	the parts i received were bad and were previously sent to another customer who returned it for the same problem and then they wanted me to purchase a new part and return the old part at my expense and when they receive the old part they would refund my money on the first part within 00 days ..
negative	anyway i ended_up buying an oem part that worked properly in order to get my customer taking care of .
negative	i guess thats the advantage of doing_business with a small company where every customer and sale are equally important unlike the big organizations like parts_geek .
negative	my company will never buy from parts_geek again ....
negative	i '_ve tried so hard to contact partsgeek . com by phone but to no_avail .
negative	have i known that this is just an e_- mail based contact , i should have avoided to buy parts from them .
negative	i received a wrong part , simply because they have only one choice of this part .
negative	they did not tell you that there are other parts for this same make , yr . and model of this car .
negative	in other words , they just give you one choice .
negative	i am referring to the headlight assembly of my 0000 gmc acadia .
negative	the picture in the website is right , but the connectors are different .
negative	they did not show that .
negative	this company is supposedly in the business for many years and yet , not so perfect of what they are selling .
negative	i ' m too frustrated and disappointed about my purchase experience with partsgeek . com .
negative	now .., i have to sacrifice returning the items in big boxes and to pay for all the return expenses such as freight , re - stocking fees , etc .
negative	for their mistakes .
negative	and for your information .
negative	if you make a negative comment on this site , your posting may not be able to get through ..
negative	i hate paypal because scammers always win money claims .
negative	there fees are ridiculous as well .
negative	my 00 year_old son passed_away suddenly at the age of 00 .
negative	he had a retirement account with principal and every person i spoke to gave me the wrong information on how to receive his funds .
negative	no less_than 0 people gave me improper directions resulting in countless hours of trips to notarys only to find out i was sent the wrong forms .
negative	beside the frustration in dealing_with company employees who were not knowledgeable of their services the emotional trauma of having to revisit dealing_with my deceased sons account was crushing .
negative	i felt entitled to some compensation for their bumbling this sensitive situation and while i received a letter stating they grossly mishandled my claim they would not offer any good will gesture to make up for my time and emotional hurt .
negative	this insensitive , cold hearted bumbling company is not where you want to put your money
negative	i ordered a bathroom set for express delivery and paid a premiuim price to have just the taps delivered .
negative	when i tried to dispute why the bath at when the plumber is coming the next_day , so i arranged for the delivery of the bath my self from their distributor for next_day delivery
negative	the bath came without the bath panel filthy dirty .
negative	told bath panel would be 00 days , but no exact date
negative	spoke with [_name ] about the terrible service offered twenty five pounds
negative	emailed him saying unacceptable 0 days ago and still no reply from big bathroom to my complaint or the complaints sent to their office
negative	they pretend to be cheap but your paying full retail as they use mark 0 distributors in bolton who are a trade outlet
negative	dont use them , they are useless and have no customer_service or understanding the of the stress waiting for a bathroom to come
negative	they have tried to have my review deleted
negative	they said that they could ulock my phone but then they coulndnt find the unlock_code for it
negative	rentalcars . com are misleading and misrepresent the full cost of the car_hire abroad .
negative	£_000 was taken from our credit_card for damage_excess refund in italy which we had already paid for in the uk .
negative	the company steals your money and doesn_'_t provide any unlock service !
negative	their method is to get pre_- payment ( e . g 00 , 00 £) from you and then on purpose delay the delivery so that you ' re not anymore able to cancel the order ( e . g .
negative	it '_s charged from your visa etc .
negative	account ).
negative	they do not respond to any refund demands and only response may come from their faked support telling they are still seeking for a solution for your operator - this is fake , they do not provide any unlock to you !
negative	order placed in beginning of january 0000 and still nothing !
negative	don_'_t use this service and don_'_t pay anything to them .
negative	i received my new sunglasses without a prescription .
negative	i then returned them with a copy of my rx .
negative	it has been over a month and have received nothing .
negative	i keep emailing them but get nothing but an acknowledgement of my email .
negative	i will never deal with them again .
negative	if only making a claim was as easy as buying the insurance .
negative	when you buy travel insurance the last thing you think about is claiming .
negative	had the misfortune of making a claim .
negative	took 0 hours to get through on the phone ( premium line number ) only to be told all claims in writing .
negative	very unhelpful staff .
negative	made a claim with all associated documents .
negative	they acknowledged and told us they were very busy so there would be a delay .
negative	after not hearing anything rang them and told they had emailed us , turned_out they had used the wrong email_address .
negative	still in process of sorting out , left chasing people for additional information and proof !
negative	have just cancelled their automatic renewal .
negative	beware !
negative	ho ordinato due capi il giorno 00 agosto 0000 , pagati subito con carta di credito .
negative	dopo settimane in cui non ho più saputo nulla sul mio ordine ho scritto al customer_service che mi ha assicurato che sarebbe stato fatto un controllo nel magazzino .
negative	dopo aver inviato alcune altre mail ( cui non sempre è stata data risposta ), finalmente mi viene confermato l ' invio della merce .
negative	aspetta e aspetta ... il giorno 0 ottobre finalmente arriva un pacco contenente uno solo dei capi ordinati e una lettera che assicurava l ' arrivo dell ' altro nel giro di 0 - 0 giorni .
negative	oggi è il 00 ottobre e dell ' altro oggetto neanche l ' ombra !!!
negative	!
negative	l ' oggetto mancante era il regalo per il compleanno di mio marito ( 00 settembre ) che avevo ordinato ben un mese prima della data ...... mi è stato promesso un dono per risarcirmi del disagio , ma anche quello sarà nel prossimo pacco ... sempre ammesso che arrivi !
negative	!
negative	gentile staff ,
negative	ho appena letto la vostra risposta e vi ringrazio per l ' attenzione prestata a quanto da me scritto .
negative	comprendo le difficoltà in cui incorre chi deve organizzare un lavoro complesso come il vostro , difficoltà di cui non avete mai fatto cenno nelle mail che mi avete inviato .
negative	a proposito della lettera presente nel pacco e riguardante il capo mancante , devo far presente che_non avete richiesto alcun contatto da parte mia per organizzare la nuova spedizione ( ed è questo il motivo per cui non vi ho più contattati !)
negative	.
negative	la dicitura presente è la seguente " egr .
negative	cliente , la presente per informarla che l ' articolo mancante è in fase di spedizione da un altro nostro punto logistico e pertanto lo riceverà a breve ( 0 - 0 giorni ) in un pacco successivo .
negative	per eventuali informazioni rivolgersi a info @ fashionqueen . net " ( cosa che avevo già fatto più volte e che_non ho ritenuto dover ripetere ).
negative	ringrazio ancora per l ' attenzione e spero che con il prossimo acquisto tutto funzioni alla perfezione !
negative	they are expensive , rude and inefficient .
negative	do not touch this company
negative	order glasses on july 00 .
negative	here it is august 00 and still no glasses .
negative	they do not answer emails or voice mails very often and surely not in a timely good customer_service manner .
negative	after several phone_calls got a human who said the frames were not in yet and were due in tomorrow , that was over two_weeks_ago .
negative	called again today and was told frames still not in .
negative	told them to cancel the order and refund my money to my credit_card .
negative	was told i would be getting a phone_call from the head honcho of the place , but of course no call came .
negative	finally decided to dispute the charge on my credit_card .
negative	these_guys suck !!!
negative	!
negative	i had my account limited for some reason , so could not make any purchases , trying to resolve problem would have more chance of getting blood from a stone .
negative	would not mind if i was spending their money .
negative	same story as you have read before , bought tickets for my son and his dad to see scotland vs nz in edinburgh ( a 00th_birthday treat , also as my son was visiting him from australia )............ paid $_000 for two vip tickets ....... same stuff , issued tracking_number etc etc but no tickets arrived . despite emails , no answer , i find it hard to believe that this company is still operational on the internet .
negative	ordered submitted in oct 0000 , not yet received , no answers to inquiries sent on their website .
negative	nobody answers their phone , given message to leave a message then told that the mailbox is full so you cannot leave a message .
negative	i have now gone through the credit_card company to receive a refund .
negative	we used agoda for the first time , booking our entire laos trip of 0 weeks .
negative	the site is well_organized , but when you try to change anything , suddenly the rules change and everything is non_- refundable and won '_t allow any changes .
negative	i would never use them again .
negative	they do not even complete the follow - up when you contact them to ask for help .
negative	their website listings are misleading .
negative	when you go to book , it says " free cancellation !
negative	", so you assume that '_s what you get .
negative	no , when you click through to the small_print , they have all_kinds of restrictions and ways to keep your money .
negative	buyer_beware , this is not a consumer friendly site .
negative	agoda did help me change my reservations , despite policies that are very consumer un - friendly , so i have to at_least give them that .
negative	so , on follow - up , i have to change and say that they do follow_up .
negative	but , i still say to save_yourself the headache and either book directly or go with a booking site that is more consumer friendly .
negative	if you end up making any change in your plans , agoda will be very expensive and cost you a lot of $$$ in non_- refundable money .
negative	stay_away from agoda .
negative	their fees are excessive and their change policies are horrible .
negative	we will never use this website again , because they unfairly advertised a reservation as a 0 - star_hotel and we selected it on that basis .
negative	they placed us in a four_star_hotel .
negative	we were very upset with this false_advertising and as a result we would suggest that you steer clear of this website .

negative	i was quoted $_00 . 00 by textbookrush . com to buy back my brand_new algebra textbook that i paid $_000 . 00 for .
negative	i verified the isbn number from the book and the packing_slip from the company where i had purchased it from .
negative	i had dropped my online algebra class and couldn_'_t use it on campus .
negative	they have received this brand_new never used textbook and claim a different isbn number was on the book and are only sending me a check for $_00 . 00 .
negative	thought their quote was too good to be true .
negative	what a bunch of crooks !
negative	beware when selling them your textbooks because from what i ' m reading this is a common practice with them .
negative	scammers
negative	my large 0ft x0ft headboard was wedged into my open fronted porch , i did not know it was being delivered , it was hammering down with rain , so you can guess i was not amused , no delivery note , obviously did not sign for , luckily only .
negative	slight water mark at base .
negative	this was a very expensive hand made head board , and had i not come home when i did or was not able to move it ( which i did struggle with ) things would have been a lot worse .

negative	i bought tickets to the ed sheeran concert in perth as a christmas_present for my 0 daughters .
negative	they were so_excited on christmas day they stuck the print out from the company on their walls .
negative	as the event drew closer i started to panic .
negative	the thought of telling my daughters that the tickets did not turn up filled me with a sickening dread .
negative	i started to email every day when there was less_than a week to the concert and received the usual auto generated response that everyone receives from viagogo ....... tickets may issue just before the event etc etc even_though ii have seen images of tickets on ebay .
negative	today the nightmare came true .
negative	i received the email that the seller had not produced the tickets , they could try to get me more but it '_s unlikely 0 days before , do i want a refund .
negative	i must let them know by the end of today .
negative	i would strongly_recommend that all reviewers look back over passed responses by this company .
negative	you will find one in which the company states that the tickets become the property of viagogo once the seller lists them with them .. mmmm obviously not the case in this instance .
negative	so i urge you all to avoid this company .
negative	it is not worth the stress and anxiety that they place their buyers under .
negative	lets face it .
negative	the closer to the concert that you receive them , the less likely that you can on sell them .
negative	now i sit and wait for my girls to come home from school and break their hearts .......
negative	in response to the viagogo reply below .
negative	you are not giving me a full_refund .
negative	you are returning my money to me for a $ 000aud product that i paid $_000 . 00aud for nearly 0 months_ago after selling me something that you did not legally own .
negative	a refund happens when i get the product and i am dissatisfied with it , return it and then get my money back .
negative	i think you suffer the same confusion about the definition of a guarantee giving people back their own money when you cannot produce what they paid for is not a guarantee .
negative	it '_s simply giving them back their money .
negative	your response is flawed .
negative	please refer to the poor lady_who sold you her australian open ticket for resale and then changed her mind .
neutral	i purchased the bib for my height , but because i have a longer torso ( relative to my legs ) the bib was ridiculously tight .
neutral	i had to go through a return and repurchase process .
neutral	better information on sizing would be extremely_helpful .
neutral	other than that , the web_site works well .
neutral	the snacks are ok and convenient but i just don_'_t like some of them .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the price so much , for 0 $ you should get 0 or 0 snacks .
neutral	the boxes are stacking up in my cupboard and i can '_t find a phone_number so i can cancel , it makes me feel as if i was scammed .
neutral	unless you want to receive graze for life , do not accept the not so free box .
neutral	really like the end product .
neutral	quick delivery and arrived as expected .
neutral	but ... didn_'_t expect to have to build the top half !
neutral	this was not clear when we ordered .
neutral	do not expect that with an expensive price of furniture !
neutral	good customer_service
neutral	i actually had to " wait in line " ( in que ) to purchase products from their site .
neutral	seems they would have the technology down for a comany this large .
neutral	products purchsed were very good , and dilevery time was a bit long .
neutral	i would purchase from target online again unless there was an alternative website with a better reputation and the same product .
neutral	i ordered 0 cardigans of the same style and same size .
neutral	0 were a perfect size xl and the other 0 were way too small .
neutral	ended_up giving the wrong sized ones to a friend as postage is way too expensive to uk .
neutral	this is the third time this happened , cannot buy any more .
neutral	i was very happy with the invitations i ordered , but am not at all happy with the stickers i ordered .
neutral	i have put in for a return and still_haven_'_t heard from anyone .
neutral	you can not read the print on the stickers and am waiting for a full_refund .
neutral	i have however ordered some more with the writing on white hoping it will show up so we will see !
neutral	jeg_har i et_par dage gjort brug af parkzonens parkering i mitchellsgade og også den såkaldte park & ride ordning , som jeg syntes er rigtig godt tænkt .
neutral	men jeg syntes det_er problematisk at de 0 første kontrollører man render ind i i metroen dels ikke kender ordningen og tilmed stiller sig skeptisk til den tilsendte sms billet .
neutral	det duer ikke , det_er ret ubehageligt at skulle stå og parlementere og prøve at overbevise om at billetten er god nok .
neutral	tænkte på om i hos parkzonen ( når i nu forhåbentlig på et tidspunkt læser dette ) ikke_kunne gøre et eller andet .... evt .
neutral	tage fat i trafikselskaberne .
neutral	jeg_kan godt mærke at jeg hurtigt mister lysten til at benytte ordningen hvis jeg bliver udsat for det samme en gang til , og_det_er ærgerligt for en ellers god ordning .
neutral	ellers er jeg ret tilfreds .... lidt ny belægning på michellsgades p plads er yderst tiltrængt , det_er jeg ikke den eneste der syntes kan jeg se , og der_er ikke længere byggeplads og store lastbiler , så på med vanten ;-)
neutral	great concept but advertising continues to grow making it harder and harder to find relevant friend postings .
neutral	company is obsessed with self promotion which will lead to its decline .
neutral	product is of great quality and sound is always good and predictable .
neutral	pricey products and company places to much value on the brand .
neutral	great site to download from unless you are using a cnet exclusive product which is always hard to get registered .
neutral	have registered some products online 00 times and when i access the software still receive message the product is unregistered .
neutral	i thought this company was perfect , but my husband told me that if , when we actually go to the place , it is not as_promised , even if it is terrible , booking . com insists that you pay for the whole time that you were committed to .
neutral	even the place itself can '_t let you leave .
neutral	that '_s nerve wracking .
neutral	this gives us a nice opportunity to avoid wasting time with the phone cards .
neutral	it was quick and easy to process the information
neutral	an ok solution for the real devolper .
neutral	be prepared to have to edit everything if you want a real functioning professional site .
neutral	go somewhere_else unless you are prepared for all of this !
neutral	poor comms at times goods got there in the end .
neutral	good value if time is not the most_important thing
neutral	the only thing i would say about google ., co . uk is that it should by default , search uk websites first with the option to search globally .
neutral	not the other way round the way as it is now
neutral	it is after all a . co . uk search_engine .
neutral	i have lost count of the times i think i have found what i need only to realise that it is a u . s . website and they do not deliver to the uk .
neutral	this can be resolved by clicking the advanced tools arrow and selecting country : the uk , but this should be the default for uk website searches
neutral	i recently booked 0 nights for 0 rooms at the beautiful five_star shangri - la in hong_kong for march 00th until april 0th .
neutral	within hours after i booked i realized that we leave the us on march 00th but do not arrive in hong_kong until the 00st .
neutral	the agent at booking . com would not help me in any way even_though i just booked with them a few hours earlier on the same day .
neutral	she said the hotel would not approve the change when she called them .
neutral	i called the hotel and explained_everything to the manager and named christopher and he totally understood and realized that he could still rent the rooms to someone_else because our stay is over two months away .
neutral	all booking . com needed to do was ask for the manager instead of the agent at the desk when they called the hotel .
neutral	instead i had to get upset and do it myself .
neutral	maybe booking . com should consider changes made within the same day of booking .
neutral	i signed_up to ! st rate spares hoping to get some much needed parts for my citroen berlingo multispace , but alas so_far , i have to say that nothing has happened yet !
neutral	however , i ' m a patient person so i '_ll keep my fingers_crossed and wait ..........!!
neutral	!
neutral	and it did not work .
neutral	very happy with purchase , but it was unfortunately sent to the billing_address , rather_than to the alternate address i had requested .
neutral	apart from the delivery cost issue i was extremely happy with my purchase .
neutral	however , the surcharged delivery is a major problem that will_definitely stop me shopping with you again , unfortunately .
neutral	the rest of the uk would have had next_day delivery free for my purchase ... i had to pay £_00 for delivery and then had to wait several days for it to be delivered ... not a comparible service at all .
neutral	sorry
neutral	presssures you into getting a larger car promising it will only be 00_% higher .
neutral	i requested a small car when i made my reservation .
neutral	before i even knew what i was getting , she commented " oh , that '_s too small would you like to upgrade to a larger vehicle ?"
neutral	i declined , but she continued to press & tell me she would give me a larger car for only 00_% more .
neutral	i had a cost in mind within my budget & knew the price i wanted to pay .
neutral	however , she kept pressing me to get a larger car - which i did not want .
neutral	after having been in a plane for almost 0 hours , i just wanted to get out of the airport .
neutral	i got tired of the back & forth & just gave in , but not before commenting on her effort to make more money for the company .
neutral	bottom_line : i did get a " small " car but ended_up paying more_than i wanted .
neutral	i did not appreciate the pressure .
neutral	i knew what i wanted , she should have left it at that , and respected my wishes .
neutral	i had this site recommended to me by my daughter .
neutral	it took a little while to get used to it and i think the scanning software or side of it could be easier to use .
neutral	my daughter nor i could get it to work .
neutral	i had a good start with the order .
neutral	the system accepted the input and i paid using the system online .
neutral	i then received an_email_saying that there were not enough items to satisfy my order for 0 deodorant sprays .
neutral	i was asked if i wanted a refund or if i wanted to wait a week .
neutral	i chose the latter and expected to receive 0 items .
neutral	you will be aware that i only received 0 items but the postage was the same as if 0 would have been sent so i was only refunded for the two items .
neutral	had i know this was going to happen i would have cancelled the order as the cost per item was dramatically increased by the postage charges .
neutral	i would be very happy to receive a refund on the postage as in my view the goods should not have been shipped until i was made aware of the change in the number being sent .

neutral	we run a b_& b in the usa - and i just received an_email from 0flats that they have published our reservation calendar online and their custmers can book rooms with us .
neutral	since the company did not contact us before listing our property we were negatively impressed with their business eithics .
neutral	we have requested that they remove the unauthorized listing and they have complied .
neutral	i needed a difficult stainless steel hardware item to find and they managed after a few_minutes of waiting on hold to dig one out for me which they had a while so discounted down .
neutral	my luck i guess .
neutral	they seemed fairly knowledgeable .
neutral	i ordered a replacement mirror for my car and was sent the wrong part . i ' m still_waiting for a return authorization #. i mean i only ordered 0 part pretty hard 0 screw - up right ?
neutral	? anyway i guess you get what you pay for good prices but bad service ..
neutral	supplement_warehouse is usually tops in price .
neutral	however , the shipping_charges will sometimes hike their total price over the total price of some other_sites .
neutral	i e_- mailed them this problem and they sent me instructions on how to enter a shipping pricematch and that they ' d match other_sites shipping prices .
neutral	it didn_'_t work and i paid more for the product than i would have elsewhere .
neutral	they say in their ad that their low_prices cover the comparable shipping charge , making their total price lower - not always true .
neutral	lovely net curtain but it cost me more to get it delivered and i had to sign for a curtain that was only worth a few pounds
neutral	there is no problem with the product - i now have a couple of jackets a polo and another top .
neutral	service is not so good though . they have products on offer .
neutral	you place an order and then a few_days_later they tell you they are out of stock . a decent computerised stock system should not allow this to happen . they were unable to reset my password when i asked them which meant opening another email account .
neutral	they said it was a known problem . hopefully they will get their act together and resolve these problems .
neutral	in their favour - their website is quick and user - friendly .
neutral	otherwise , if you can be bothered , you may as well use the parcels - smashers ( er ... " couriers ") they represent directly , because they are usually a bit cheaper .
neutral	as a company they have zero control over the parcels carriers , which is a shame because most of them are shamefully careless and unreliable .
neutral	and whatever you do , don_'_t waste money on their so - called " insurances " because they don_'_t actually cover anything that is not otherwise utterly indestructable .
neutral	i suspect the scandalous state of the industry as a whole is costing british business millions , if not billions a year - and all because of the laziness and incompetence of those we entrust with the carriage of goods .
neutral	interparcel is just a cog in that mechanism , and i ' d frankly pity them if their support was better when things do go_wrong .
neutral	some of the games are really good .
neutral	i wish they would offer a ad free paid version but not a monthly one , just one off payments .
neutral	the ads seem to glitch up the games , , margrave manor won '_t load for me now and i have uninstalled and reinstalled it knows who i am and has saved all my game play the main game just wont load .
neutral	i am playing the chronicals of albian now its very good but the ads definately glitch it up , they always seem to coincide with the puzzles and once the ads start you lose the puzzle and therefore the bonus money and frankly you need it to do that place up .
neutral	otherwise tip top .
neutral	particularly enjoyed the sherlock holmes one .
neutral	i think that cms is very well sorted , they have got everything .
neutral	however they are not cheap and it takes a long time between ordering and delivery although sending cost is rather high .
neutral	the free delivery only works if you want to wait for a long time .
neutral	due to work we are not getting our furniture for 0 weeks .
neutral	if we want it in a week or less it would cost us £_00
neutral	i ordered the lion mask .
neutral	it is huge and doesn_'_t even come close to fitting my face .
neutral	i will have to alter it and do some cutting on it .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting it to be wonderful , but was dissapointed in the size .
neutral	pretty good prices , but not sure what they mean by fast shipping .
neutral	placed my order on wednesday evening and it wasn_'_t even shipped until friday_afternoon .
neutral	ups says it '_s not scheduled to be delivered until wednesday .
neutral	i signed_up for auto ship , but if this is a sign of how slow they are i may cancel , just so i don_'_t have to worry_about it .
neutral	i was ordering from another . com company who '_s delivery was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i switched to chewy '_s because the prices were a bit better .
neutral	we ordered the fuel oil on the friday and it was delivered on the tuesday following , excellent service from boiler_juice .
neutral	however as we live out in the sticks we have a standing request for a phone_call the night before to allow us to unlock gate and tank .
neutral	due to the fact that the boiler was to be serviced on the tuesday we left the gate unlocked , imagine my surprise to come home on the tuesday and find our oil had been delivered , your local supplier did not call and as such the tank was locked , so he filled through the vent pipe , must have taken him ages .
neutral	anyway , boilerjuice well_done good service , but local supplier , boo , you would have fopund everything locked normally because you did not call then where would we have been , waiting longer ....
neutral	my experience with opticfast was frustrating .
neutral	i bought from opticfast through another vendor .
neutral	the vendor apparently gave me an erroneous shipping date .
neutral	due to this my item did not arrived in time for my daughter '_s 00st birthday .
neutral	i was very_pleased with my product from opticfast when it did finally arrive .
neutral	it was not the first time i book cars from economy rentals .
neutral	i was and i am pleased with the offer and cost , the car and thr rental process .
neutral	i had a very negative customer experience claiming insurance refund .
neutral	the good news : i got a refund for most of the amount i paid .
neutral	the bad news : the communication was bad , the process was long ( over two month ), unnecessarily complex , time consuming and frustrating .
neutral	i was expecting to send my claim , and shortly after get a refund .
neutral	i was not expecting :
neutral	- get a first response 00 days after my first contact , followed by more attempts from my side .
neutral	- get a response saying “ i think we have replied within an reasonable time frame ” after trying to get a response for 00 days .
neutral	- send so many documents ( rental contract , credit_card statement , rental invoice , damage report , a form i had to fill , and a picture of the damage ).
neutral	- be asked to complete my credit_card number over ( un safe ) e_- mail .
neutral	i paid by credit_card to economy_car_rentals , why do i need to submit the number again for a refund ?
neutral	- be asked to wait until economy_car_rentals receive the final repair cost from alamo .
neutral	i think this is entirely between economy_car_rentals and alamo .
neutral	- wait another month for the refund , after the above bureaucratic nightmare was over .
neutral	i think economy_car_rentals will do their customers and themselves a big favor reviewing and modifying this process , and make it more customer friendly .
neutral	here is my experience with economy_car_rentals , facts only :
neutral	i booked a car with a full insurance_coverage .
neutral	unfortunately i did have a small damage ( fine scratch caused_by a bush ) and the rental company made me pay a substantial amount for it .
neutral	- i contacted economy_car_rentals on 00 . apr . 0000
neutral	- i got no response so i wrote again , and got no reply .
neutral	- i used the live - chat support several_times .
neutral	here are exact quote of answers i got on live - chat :
neutral	0 .
neutral	" your case in queue , you will be informed as soon as possible "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" unfortunately i can not help you over the live support , this need to be dealt_with the claims department "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" your e_- mail was forwarded to your claims department "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" the department dealing_with this is closed this week "
neutral	0 .
neutral	" the person in charge for these claims is out of office at the moment , this is why there is a delay "
neutral	on 00 . may . 0000 i posted negative_reviews on facebook and some other forums .
neutral	the day after i got the first response from economy_car_rentals , asking me for a picture of the damage on the car .
neutral	i sent a picture .
neutral	- on 00 . may . 0000 i updated my review on facebook .
neutral	shortly after i got the second response from economy_car_rentals , asking me to send some documents by mail .
neutral	i sent it by e_- mail .
neutral	economy_car_rentals accepted the documents and added : " i think we have replied within an reasonable time frame and kindly ask you to remove this comments from the forums , your comments do not reflect the truth ".
neutral	economy_car_rentals also notified me that my claim will be processed after they receive the final repair cost from alamo .
neutral	i wrote to economy_car_rentals saying " i do not understand_why i need to wait for the alamo '_s repair invoice .
neutral	i this is entirely between economy_car_rentals and alamo , and i do not see why i should be effected by it ."
neutral	got no reply for it .
neutral	- on 00 . may . 0000 i got another e_- mail saying " today i received the enclosed assessor '_s report and we will process your claim ."
neutral	- on 0 . june . 0000 i got another e_- mail from economy_car_rentals , " thanking me for my patience ", informing_me that " we have received approval for a refund in the amount of 000 gbp " out of the 000 gbp i paid to the rental company .
neutral	economy_car_rentals also noted the 0 first digits of my credit_card number , asked me to complete the last 0 digits .
neutral	economy_car_rentals also sent me a form to be filled , signed and returned .
neutral	- on 0 . june . 0000 economy_car_rentals informed me that they got all the form and the credit_card number ( i obviously did not want to send the credit_card number by mail , so i used the on - line support cat for it ).
neutral	- on 00 . june . 0000 ( almost 0 weeks_later ) i wrote to economy_car_rentals asking why is the process taking so long , and so much of my time , asking when can i expect a refund .
neutral	the answer i got was : “ we would like to kindly inform you that your refund has been already forwarded to our accounting department .”
neutral	- on 0 . july . 0000 i wrote another reminder to economy_car_rentals .
neutral	- on 0 . july . 0000 economy_car_rentals informed me that “ your case was closed today and the amount of 000 ,- euro was refunded to you ”
neutral	when i rented my first car in johannesbourg , i was asked by thrifty to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €).
neutral	i expected to have this amount re - credited immediately after car return and check that no damage occurred and gas_tank was full .
neutral	instead , when i returned the car i was told the amount would be credited after few ( how many ?)
neutral	days .
neutral	arrived in cape town i rented a car from budget and i was asked to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €), so my credit_card was charged in total 0000 €.
neutral	for car_rental deposit , limiting for some days my cash capability .
neutral	having problems in looking at my bank_account from remote , 0 days after my 0nd car return i still don_'_t know what was actually charged to my credit car .
neutral	in may opinion car_rental companies should give the opportunity to the client to know immediately at return what will be charged , to the cost of waiting an acceptable amount of time for the car check .
neutral	economy_car should give details of the return_policy of the rental_car companies .
neutral	skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds .
neutral	you would think by now they would have figured it out .
neutral	after i ordered the part , i figured out that i was not capable of replacing it myself .
neutral	i have been trying to get a rma # and i ' m not getting any response .
neutral	i had trouble bidding on the hotel price .
neutral	one site was $_000 and priceline was $_00 .
neutral	i was expecting bigger savings .
neutral	appointment time online was great but nowhere near the offered date when rep phoned .
neutral	still_waiting for side strips to windscreen - cannot drive my car at speed until this has been fixed .
neutral	windscreen not a landrover screen feel slightly cheated .
neutral	a friend and i used the site a couple days ago to book our ferry tickets from newhaven to dieppe , and we found it very confusing .
neutral	the first time we used it , we could see only the 00 am ferry crossings .
neutral	a couple hours_later , we checked again , and we could find only the 0 . 00 am ferry crossings !
neutral	it would have been helpful to have seen a list of all the ferry crossings and times in one place .
neutral	we got confused , so i called someone there who explained how to find the 00 am crossings again , and we booked one of those .
neutral	i ' m generally pretty adept at using travel websites , but this one had me flummoxed !
neutral	i ordered some mothers_day flowers from this company , the first delivered mothers_day flowers my mum had ever had .
neutral	i wanted them to be special - which they certainly were .
neutral	mum received a box full of petals , half dead flowers and stalks .
neutral	on trying to contact this company i had a series of unanswered emails , phone_calls which cut you off after 00_minutes of holding . and utter frustration .
neutral	i genuinely thought this company was a complete fraudulent operation and was going to contact trading standard .
neutral	the eureka moment came when a lady on here got help by using the landline number for this company in burnley and advised people to try this .
neutral	the next_day i tried the landline number , first time getting cut_off after 00_minutes of holding on , the second time a very nice man answered .
neutral	i explained the problem with the delivery and the poor quality / absolute disgraceful product sent .
neutral	he immediately arranged delivery of a bouquet of flowers for my mum from a local_florist of twice the value i originally paid .
neutral	colours and flowers were decided by myself .
neutral	the next_day the bouquet arrived , mum was delighted , and from the photos i saw so was i .
neutral	the warnings are therefore avoid any bouquets on this site that say postal delivery and .
neutral	do not use any number to contact this company other than the burnley landline number which can be found easily online
neutral	i would love to give this company more stars , the second bouquet was definitely 0 star , but the flowers were supposedly for mothers_day and arrived in the end 0 days_later .
neutral	the first delivery was awful ,
neutral	customer_service , when you were eventually able to contact them was fantastic , but original experiances were grim
neutral	would i use them again , yes but maybe phone the order through or make_sure the flowers were not posted but hand delivered by local florists
neutral	this was a great product
neutral	nice idea .
neutral	a star named after me by my husband .
neutral	unfortunately , can '_t see a star when searching the universal star registry with google .
neutral	just a black screen with a white box and my name and registration number on it .
neutral	nothing seems to be wrong , but maybe there is .
neutral	i left it for 00_minutes in case there was a download delay , but nothing .
neutral	a bit disappointed but , as i say , still a nice idea .
neutral	the people who are happy with your product seem to be the ones who got a good reaction when giving the gift .
neutral	i think it would be a different matter once the receiver tried to access and actually look at their star .
neutral	needed a specific length & fit of bb , wiggle had best price , but on " 0 - 0 weeks " delivery which i could live with .
neutral	after 0 weeks still hadnt showed_up and when queried they said it would be another month or so .
neutral	their best alternative was significantly more_expensive , and indeed i could get it at a lower price elsewhere .
neutral	had a hard job convincing them to price_match even_though they ' d let me down on my first choice .
neutral	when they did finally agree , i had to cancel the first order , get a refund of the paypal and place new order with the price_match coupon .
neutral	once i ' d done all that the replacement did actually arrive quite quickly , but the whole experience was a bit meh !
neutral	i was impressed with the no shipping_costs , and great prices on cat_food .
neutral	unfortunately it seems as if they are making up on the free shipping by charging more for the cat_litter they sell .
neutral	i really don_'_t mind it being a little more ( for the convenience of having it sent to my home ) but almost 0 times the cost of my local grocery_store is a bit much .
neutral	quick delivery , but incorrect information on the description of the article .
neutral	plastic case instead a digibook
neutral	although the room was great and the rate was awesome , the hotel did not have my information when i arrived .
neutral	we had to wait for over 00_minutes to see if they were going to honor my receipt stating my reservation .
neutral	i had never had this issue when using hotels . com or any other site i have used .
neutral	i like the idea of ordering pet products online with quick home delivery .
neutral	unfortunately the web_site for petflow . com is pretty bad .
neutral	it is hard to search .
neutral	forget trying to browse .
neutral	key words do not necessarily bring up all the available items .
neutral	you pretty_much need to know exactly_what item you need .
neutral	if you want to look around for new products be prepared to spend some time .
neutral	i had already purchased a groupon deal so i had to buy off the site .
neutral	otherwise i would have given up when i realized how difficult it was to use the web_site .
neutral	i managed to find what i needed and place my order .
neutral	shipping and delivery was pretty quick .
neutral	it was well - packaged , the product was fresh , and the order was complete .
neutral	but i probably will not order from seller again because of the poorly designed site .
neutral	i would use you first , i used to but you have such a long list of what you don_'_t carry that it stops me using you regularly as a lot of the stuff i sell is prohibited and its hard enough booking on - line without worrying if it is a prohibited item .
neutral	i have a iphone 0 that was locked to at & t .
neutral	i had to wait almost three_weeks for my phone to unlocked with my imei unlock .
neutral	in the meantime , there was almost no customer_service response despite numerous_emails to then asking for an approximate far for when my phone would be unlocked .
neutral	works but take a a while .
neutral	site items ship fast , always in stock , the sex toys are from known brands .
neutral	customer_service via_email or phone .
neutral	i '_ve used the service before and had an issue that customer_service resolved very well .
neutral	however , now that i am looking in oslo , norway , i see that none of the hotels are indicating whether the rooms are smokers rooms or non_- smokers rooms .
neutral	this is a standard where i am from originally , the u . s ., and is very important to me .
neutral	it must be that booking . com is not providing a field for the hotels to complete to provide this info / choice .
neutral	major flaw since - as a result , i am forced to call the hotel i make a reservation with , and possibly go back to the drawing board if it turns_out the hotel i reserved with does not offer the non_- smoker option .
neutral	if i do have to do the work all over again , i '_ll find a hotel agreggator website that can provide this option for me up front .
neutral	if i have to call the hotels directly , then it isn_'_t worth booking first through booking . com
neutral	clothes were great , but i had to return a dress that was too short and it took a month to receive a credit back .
neutral	i emailed them to check if it takes that long normally and they instantly credited it , so i don_'_t know if something went wrong with mine or if it always takes that long .
neutral	at first , they have the best prices and quickest service !
neutral	but i booked the wrong date , and had to change it .
neutral	i could not reach a human voice to help me .
neutral	their website wouldn_'_t forward my emails .
neutral	and the hotel didn_'_t email me my hotel packet !
neutral	i '_ve been waiting for a response for 0 hours !
neutral	nothing !
neutral	did not get help untill reporting here .
neutral	after reporting here the problem was solved fast .
neutral	i believe the company is consious about its reputation , but its business processes do not work properly yet .
neutral	one month_ago i ordered from gillygifts ltd . order ref last 0 digits 0000 .
neutral	money was taken off immediately on ordering the item online but it still has not arrived .
neutral	my e_- mails and phone_calls have been ignored by this company .
neutral	on phoning them i have got an answer phone which is very poor for customer - client relations and for a caring company !
neutral	refund given .
neutral	business manager stated that he sent item which should have arrived 00 days after order and subsequently was on holiday .
neutral	the gift was not received and refund agreed .
neutral	matter resolved immediately after posting review .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i received the item promptly , however , the item description was a " streamlight " sl00x battery , leading me to believe i was indeed receiving a streamlight brand battery .
neutral	unfortunately what i received was a generic battery that was labeled " made in china " and although it fit my light , it was not exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	it will be interesting to see how long this imported clone actually lasts .
neutral	i should have known that the price was too good to be true .
neutral	the moral of the story : if you need a cheap battery and you don_'_t care where it was made , then this is the place to get it .
neutral	if you want usa made quality : order it somewhere_else .
neutral	a piece of advice to this company : note the actual brand and country of origin under the product description .
neutral	there are certainly many people who will buy it anyway and those of us who wouldn_'_t will go elsewhere and not be unhappy customers .
neutral	i found the service good but the fee '_s are a bit high
neutral	the machine was delivered on time , constant up - dates sent by text to my mobile phone .
neutral	realy great service , thank_you .
neutral	paid to have the old machine taken away .
neutral	this was also realy good and well_worth the extra cost .
neutral	paid_extra for the fitting .
neutral	not so good .
neutral	the " drain " hose required a converter fitting to join the existing connection to the machine pipe .
neutral	the " fitters " refused to wait the 00_minutes it took me to purchase this converter from my local hardware shop and were gone by the time i returned .
neutral	as a result i had to pay another company to fit the machine under my work surface .
neutral	it is a tight fit and as a pensioner beyond my ability to lift , shove and move by myself .
neutral	this part of the deal was not what it should be and i would reccomend not paying for this " service " as a local fitter will do the job quicker and you will not have to pay twice for the job to be carried out .
neutral	i have been contacted by trustpilot this afternoon ( 00 . 00 . 0000 .)
neutral	and they have appologised and promised to refund the " instalation " charge .
neutral	once again very good service and i forgot to mention the price .
neutral	the best available either on the high_street or anywhere on the web .
neutral	thank_you all
neutral	one came faulty but they should have checked it before sending , not happy
neutral	i got a trip on trip_advisor to see my daughter out in phoenix and it was very expensive !
neutral	had no problem so_far with this purchase , ( will wait to see if they honour my trade - in voucher against this sale !)
neutral	emailed their customer_support prior to purchase , but they still have not replied to this email .
neutral	went_ahead with purchase .
neutral	all went_smoothly , and item turned up next_day .
neutral	nice and quick .
neutral	lovely lens in immaculate condition , just a shame it came in the wrong protective bag .
neutral	this all said , i will probably use this site again .
neutral	i booked a class of vehicle that i was somewhat familiar with as i drive a matrix at home , a toyota auris , it was the car shown in the advertising material , when we arrived we asked about a gps unit , one was immediately produced and given to us at a charge of 000 bp for the hire period , first it only spoke german , so a trip back to the point of sale was required , pouring rain and freezing cold didn_'_t help .
neutral	after setting the hired gps unit up we were on our way , only to find later that the car was equipped with it '_s own built in unit , a total waste of money , which wouldnt have happened if the receptionist had taken the time to ask what car we had taken .
neutral	upon return the " extras " we were charged were almost triple the original quote .
neutral	so if you use alamo be sure to get an explanation of what the final bill will be !!
neutral	!
neutral	the car itself was a joy to drive and everyone we saw was impressed with it , as were we .
neutral	for the cost of the item not worth the price .
neutral	i ordered a package for my better half for valentines_day .
neutral	roses , balloon , chocolates and a cuddly toy .
neutral	the package arrived at the specified time and the gift set was perfect all except the cuddly toy .
neutral	the colour scheme of flowers , balloon , & chocolates were red and black and matched perfectly .
neutral	the cuddly toy however was a bright pink teddy bear which had the words ' baby girl ' written on it !
neutral	hasten to say it didn_'_t go down very well !
neutral	we run a backpackers hostel and needed a bunk bed next_day due to damage .
neutral	order went through showing in stock
neutral	email came back late in same day apologising that they were out of stock , left it late for us to re order with another company !
neutral	requested another style from the company , but they said it was too_late now for next_day delivery ?
neutral	ordered slippers but can not get on the web_site to redeem will have to phone for help this was later resolved
neutral	my first order was delivered in a week , which i think was reasonable , although no tracking_information was available until the day it arrived .
neutral	my second order , however , was placed on 00 / 00 .
neutral	today is 00 / 0 and the status says " in process ."
neutral	i called customer_service .
neutral	it can be a little annoying when you call within 0 minutes of the call_center opening and get a message that says , " due to unusually high call volumes , we cannot take your call at this time ."
neutral	really ?
neutral	are you ticking off that many customers that your call_center is overwhelmed ?
neutral	after about six attempts ( i got all the time in the world during a long commute ) i finally reached a live operator .
neutral	the service rep was courteous and tried to be helpful .
neutral	she could not find the cause of the delay , and promised to call back when she had more information .
neutral	that was 0 hours ago .
neutral	i suspect she has not gotten any more information ( i am assuming she means to keep her commitment .)
neutral	i tried calling again , but once again got the " we don_'_t have enough operators / phone lines to handle our business volumes or we don_'_t care enough about customer_service to pick_up our phones " message .
neutral	uncharitable ?
neutral	maybe , but this is not my idea of great customer_service .
neutral	i want to like this company , and if they resolve this issue to my satisfaction ( meaning just communicate with me and fill my order in a reasonable time ) i will be happy to come_back here and amend my comments .
neutral	so having finally received an_email informing_me one of my items was back - ordered , they are shipping my order today .
neutral	they dropped the ball on notifying me of the shortage , which can happen to anyone , but the practice of giving themselves up to four business days to let you know if everything you order is in stock is not the best .
neutral	most sites i buy from tell you immediately if an item is out of stock .
neutral	the least they can do is notify you right_away and ask if you want a back - order or substitute .
neutral	priceline bidding is great for getting good deals on hotels .
neutral	however , 0 - star that are dirty , rundown , and have scary clientele are within priceline guidelines .
neutral	you won '_t get a refund from the hotel unless you stick around long enough to make a formal complaint , and without that priceline won '_t do a thing for you except a $_00 off a 0 - star .
neutral	key in my usual area is 0 - star .
neutral	you get a decent clean room with microwave usually and often fridge or kitchenette .
neutral	start bidding with 0 - stars just in case any are biting ;-).
neutral	i had high hopes for the spoiled_rotten box when i ordered it .
neutral	i had to call the company to complete my order because the site wouldn_'_t complete it .
neutral	i have three dogs , 0lbs , 00lbs and 000lbs .
neutral	being dachshunds and a german shepherd dog , they are all ' power ' chewers !
neutral	i was truly disappointed that there wasn_'_t even one toy in the box .
neutral	there was 0 can of food , 0 roll of food , 0 box of calming treats , 0 pack of beef & cheddar treats , 0 pack of tiny ' brushless toothpaste ' treats , 0 spearmint star shaped chew , a key chain and a silicone teddy bear that you can bake or freeze treats in .
neutral	if i gave that to any of my dogs it would be destroyed in minutes !
neutral	all in all , $_00 for a selection of treats is really expensive .
neutral	i would have really_liked at_least one toy .
neutral	costumes arrived quickly however some were not completely sewn and needed mending
neutral	ordered the bags and they were awesome .
neutral	then came the mounting .
neutral	first , parts were missing and some were detective .
neutral	second , the brackets looked like they might damage my bike when installed .
neutral	viking was quick to send missing and replacement parts , but , why do i want to drill holes in the bag to mount them ?
neutral	i ended_up purchasing the right brackets off amazon . com for a very reasonable price .
neutral	they arrived quickly , fit_perfectly , the bags installed easily and look awesome and i didn_'_t have to compromise the bags by drilling holes in them .
neutral	pretty disappointed with priceline . com this trip .
neutral	first at no point in time was it disclosed that the hotel room was non_- smoking and for that matter the entire hotel was smoe free .
neutral	also my search was for a room for 0 adults yet when pruceline booked it they switched it down to a room for 0 people .
neutral	the delivery was very slow
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes , one child '_s glenda the good witch , it was not a true to size fit so we ordered a larger_size and returned the smaller one .
neutral	it came time for the event but still have not received the refund on our account .
neutral	ordered the deluxe grand wizard of oz costume ... this one was perfect !!!
neutral	looked great quality of costume was good .
neutral	last costume was mine , the emerald city witch , stockings were too small , costume quality was not good ... it was falling apart at the sleeves by the time we finished up our visit to the land of oz ... spent about 0 hours there walking around .
neutral	the costume was cute just not made very well for the amount of money we spent on this one .....
neutral	the on line pictures give a very good impression of the watches but when my mx00 arrived i was pleasantly_surprised to see what a stunning and rugged looking watch it was .
neutral	i chose the mx00 for the plain easy to read dial ( day and night ) and i wasn_'_t disappointed here either .
neutral	i asked for an extra link after it arrived and this followed within a couple of days .
neutral	having had the watch now for a couple of months i have to say that i am disappointed with the strap .
neutral	i chose the metal bracelet , and since fitting the extra ( which i did myself with the proper tools ) the pin holding this link keeps protruding from the strap slightly and needs pushing in .
neutral	even more annoying is the strap keeps coming apart because the spring loaded pin doesn_'_t hold it together securely enough and the watch falls off my wrist .
neutral	i have made the company aware of these problems each time , they have always been very pleasant , but i am now fed up with this happening and the latest response from the company is to offer to send me some glue to hold the pin in firmly ..... what on a watch this price .... no way and why should i have to do it myself .
neutral	so its going back for investigation .
neutral	the prices are great but the shipping is outrageous .
neutral	i had $_00 dollars worth of product and shipping was $_00 . 00 ... totally outrageous .
neutral	charge a little more on your products so you don_'_t have to rip the customer off and make your profit on shipping .
neutral	try using the united_states postal services which offer flat fee rates .
positive	i contacted st customer_service explained the problem they emailed me instructions and a shipping_label .
positive	i got my camera back in less_than 0 days and it works better then it did before i dropped it .
positive	i asked if this would be the end of my warranty and was told the cost of the repair would be deducted from the amount of warranty and any remaining funds would be used for future warranty issues .
positive	i have developed a great relationship with herbies over the years and have a lot of friends that have followed me .
positive	word of mouth works out the best !!
positive	they have kept everyone of our business happy .
positive	i have seen many comments on here and people can be kinda " duh ".. for one thing herbies is not the breeder and therefore can not control the freshness he is presented with from the breeder !
positive	and of coarse the mail problems is all herbies fault cuz he owns the mail system world wide .
positive	when i made a complaint about my mail it had herbies address .
positive	to much indulgence is no good people !
positive	nuf said ..
positive	thanks b !
positive	keep it up :)
positive	gets better every day !
positive	i have used priceline for several_years now and have never been_disappointed .
positive	i have consistently gotten the best rates and had excellent accommodations - twice i was upgraded to suite level for no additional cost and received additional perks , such as breakfasts and dinners gratis .
positive	i have visited other_sites , but priceline is the easiest to use and yields the best results .
positive	i have 00 casual kilts and one semi traditional usa kilt and one on order .
positive	i also have a argyle jacket .
positive	all are in some way customized to my needs and desires .
positive	rocky worked with me to get all of these just right via e_- mails .
positive	i also have sporrans and belts from usak .
positive	the durable , washable ,, martan mills pv he uses is great and the workmanship is always top_notch - even_though these are reasonably_priced kilts .
positive	ian and mac , who made my kilts , are true craftsmen with attention to details .
positive	they have a large_selection of tartans in pv and rocky keeps coming up with new " gotta have " plaids .
positive	i am very_pleased with parts_geek .
positive	my order was everything it should be . it was right on , all of the parts were correct .
positive	the order was shipped on time and arrived early they have my business from now on
positive	i love reading the posts and the scripture .
positive	use it daily .
positive	keep_up the excellent work !

positive	we wanted to rent a servicible car that would get us from quebec to toronto / niagara falls .
positive	ken , who served us in quebec was fantastic and gave us a really good deal on a mustang .
positive	he must have known something as we have always wanted to drive one .
positive	fantastic car , handled really well , comfortable and easy to drive , only thing to remember , put the most expensive fuel in as it lasts a lot longer than the cheaper one !
positive	it may seem to cost more initially , but it is worth it in the end .
positive	would definitely use this company again .
positive	gwen
positive	so much to choose from , so much information .
positive	they have everything that i am looking for and they offer so many free_samples so i can evaluate before buying .
positive	in fact this is my second order and i am buying things that i got as samples in my first order .
positive	i would have never tried them otherwise .
positive	they were excellent quality .
positive	i buy a lot of stuff online but have never had as good experience as i have with supplement_warehouse .
positive	great selection at the best prices
positive	starting a new business on a shoestring budget requires thrifty shopping .
positive	this company allowed me to create my own signage at a fraction of the cost to local sign shops .
positive	hands_down would recommend them to any one for their signage needs .
positive	the products .
positive	price , and shipping where excellent .
positive	but the extra value was the support in the way of information and advice .
positive	this saved me a lot of time researching .
positive	it also saved and a lot of time and money by helping_me to select what i really needed the first time .
positive	good job .
positive	dave works hard and knows what he is doing .
positive	we had a small emergency - our water heater broke and was leaking all over the place .
positive	of course the timing couldn_'_t have been worse and we were short a few bucks to get a new one .
positive	i was matched quickly with several lenders by quickercash . com , was approved by the one i chose in minutes and received the funds by the next_morning .
positive	and our water heater has been replaced !
positive	b_&_h pricing almost always seems to be lower_than other_retailers .
positive	i have never been_disappointed .
positive	the quality of their items is always exceptional .
positive	i bought a locked phone on ebay uk locked to vodafone , was under the misapprehension it would work for vodafone spain , so i had it unlocked by these_guys and i ' m absolutely_delighted .
positive	i have purchased a number of warranties through square_trade and have been unfortunate to need them a few_times .
positive	in each case the process was appropriate and hassle_free .
positive	whether it was an item that needed repair or a total replacement , the claim process was straight_forward and met my every expectation .
positive	they have never tried to manipulate their warranties to get out of fulfilling their obligation and it is refreshing to find a company that operates with ethics .
positive	thank_you square_trade .
positive	it '_s a great place to fine a job , that fits your needs .
positive	thanks for everything :)
positive	i can only comment on my personal experience : i purchased a pair of tickets ( for my girlfriend and her best friend ) to go and see ' donny and marie osmond ' at the o0 arena on the opening night of their tour .
positive	the face value of the tickets were £_00 . 00 each .
positive	i was charged in excess of £_000 . 00 each !
positive	!
positive	my girlfriend had a the night of her life ; and for that i am very , very grateful !
positive	!
positive	i have always had great experience with the name your price bookings .
positive	as long as i do a 0 0 / 0 star or above i have never been_disappointed in priceline .
positive	the only thing i wish would be hotels would still give points for their club members in spite of booking through priceline .
positive	i use this site all the time to find the cheapest fares .
positive	they also send me emails for special deals .
positive	this was a good deal .
positive	their price was right and the product was excellent , a perfect match for the original screen .
positive	thanks to the how - to videos ( 0 ), i was able to walk through the entire replacement procedure on my crippled machine before i even ordered the thing .
positive	when the part arrived , it took me about a whopping 00_minutes for the entire job , from removing the bezel to booting up and wiping my finger prints off the new screen .
positive	total cost about $_00 with fedex shipping .
positive	most highly_recommended !
positive	obtw , here '_s a lesson_learned ( free advice !
positive	): don_'_t use your dell as a step stool ...
positive	they have great prices , i got just a goofy good deal on my whites fusion during their black friday special .
positive	mike was always there to answer my questions , and the work they did on the suit ( replaceable neck and wrist seals ) was first rate .
positive	online prices with lds service !
positive	no charge for the new slogan :)

positive	slimdriver is so easy to use .
positive	i did download something else first and did not understand it and had to delete it , so glad i found this ... makes me love my computer and computer time again .
positive	i give it a 0 star .
positive	a dealership more like a friend .
positive	low pressure / no pressure sales_team .
positive	the quality of their late model used car selection was phenomenal .
positive	almost all the cars were bought from car_rentals or private owners who maintained their vehicles .
positive	the plus is warranty , 0 business day return_policy no questions asked , the 00 - day major system repair coverage with no out of pocket expense , plus an incredible extended_warranty ( 0 yr 00 , 000_miles and 0 yr , 00 , 000 mile coverage .
positive	bought suv on july_0th .
positive	july_0th the a /_c stopped blowing cold air .
positive	called aeverex ( service contract administrator ) and explained the problem .
positive	i am now scheduled for repair on wed , july_0th with no out of pocket expense , whether it '_s just a freon recharge , a /_c compressor , or water pump .
positive	i have always bought late model used cars ( never new ) and i have never had such complete comprehensive coverage if something breaks nor ever had such great customer_service - national customer_support center for drivetime called me on monday , july_0th , to congratulate me on my purchase and to ask about my experience with sales_rep and finance mgr at the dealership - this was a first .
positive	normally when i bought used and drove it off the lot , i ' d never hear from the dealership again and start getting harassed about my loan payment , even_though with those other dealerships my payment wouldn_'_t be due for a month !
positive	drivetime east in indianapolis , thanks for a great experience .
positive	special thanks to sales associate chad horsley , who took_care of paperwork and car prep for delivery on my purchase .
positive	don_'_t go to any mom & pop buy here pay here lot , or even large local dealership ( like gm , chevrolet , ford , kia , etc .
positive	).
positive	i highly_recommend drivetime , which is nationwide !
positive	i even have the option of activating my built - in onstar service - something i have never even offered before on a used car .
positive	if you go to drivetime to purchase a car , truck , or suv , use my name ( jeffery wolfe in indianapolis ).
positive	i '_ll be eligible for their referral program !

positive	ordering was a breeze and the prescription was perfect .
positive	the only opportunity i would add is that the lenses include a label indicating which is right vs . left .
positive	had to figure this out for myself .
positive	this one little addition to the process would simply add to this wonderful experience .
positive	thanks ads !
positive	i '_ve been trying to construct my own logo for my business and was searching for ideas for objects and layering .
positive	i came_across this logo company , freelogoservices . com , and they had everying i need .
positive	i registered and created a two layer logo , an object and a graphic design , with the name of my company all in a matter of minutes .
positive	i would recommend freelogoservices . com everytime .
positive	we really don_'_t have time to look for vendors for our supplies so when we find one that is affordable , knowledgeable and has a fast production time we stick with it .
positive	everything has worked_perfectly for us for the past few years .

positive	looking_forward to many more cruises with cruise sale finder '_s assistance
positive	the parts_geek csr that helped_me ( chris m ) is as good as they get .
positive	he made me feel that pg truly wanted my business while presenting a thoroughly professional , yet personable image .
positive	you could sense that his ultimate goal was to ensure pg met all of my automotive needs .
positive	he is quite an asset to parts_geek .
positive	as for the positive efforts of parts_geek - i was totally blown_away when i found the parts i had ordered friday_afternoon in my mailbox early monday_afternoon .
positive	that type of delivery is nearly impossible except for very expensive services like ups or fed_ex next_day , but this package was simply 0st_class usps postage .
positive	when a problem , of my doing , showed_up , parts_geek assured me they would take whatever steps they needed to solve my dilemma .
positive	in my opinion , that ’_s the kind of service you get from a local parts supplier that you build up over many years - yet this was my first visit to parts_geek .
positive	if they all go this smoothly , i ’ ll never need to shop anywhere_else .

positive	i do a considerable amount of hobby trading on ebay .
positive	i found an item i wanted to build and present to a physician friend who has provided me with competent and compassionate healthcare over the past decade , but found the ebay price and s &_h to be unrealistic for a new but relatively common product .
positive	i decided to research the product on hobbylinc , just to see if my theory of price gouging held true .
positive	even having to pay ga sales tax , the hobbylink price was well below half of the asking price with s &_h charges for the identical item on ebay .
positive	there is a moral to this story .
positive	the trust you put into an on - line purchase must be equaled by the trustworthiness of the seller .
positive	with ebay , you are not dealing_with a company that must maintain its reputation of fairness , but an individual who can assume a new identity from one transaction to the next .
positive	buyer_beware .
positive	trust has a tangible value and should be considered whenever making purchases too good to be true , even more so than when the circumstances have already caused your defense mechanisms to activate .
positive	the cost of peace of mind is sometimes negligible when compared to what is at risk .
positive	best regards , grey wolf - columbus ga

positive	very impressed with the range of goods offered , the free p + p , and the generous discounts for bulk orders .
positive	i ordered at 0pm , goods were here the next_day at 00 .
positive	quality of packaging was good and goods were received undamaged .
positive	i was impressed by the staff at the fitting_centre , they started the job exactly at the time when the car was booked in , and within an_hour 0 tyres were fitted , an oil change completed , and advice was given to me about a suitable spare for the car , as it is not a standard fitment .
positive	it was explained to me exactly_what the job would involve , and they treated my car with respect .
positive	i have used squaretrade for 00 plus years and have used them many_times . you get great warranties for a resasonable rate , also exceptional .
positive	i can '_t believe in todays times that there is still a company like this one .
positive	excellent pricing on the best supplements , highly_recommend .
positive	operator who took my call understood the urgency of my relatively small order , promised to speak to warehouse , he obviously did because the goods were there next_morning , their product ( snow machine fluid ) is very competitively_priced as well .
positive	they offer a really wide_selection of shredders at pretty good prices , fast delivery and good communications , i would recommend them .
positive	this was an awesome experience .
positive	i damaged my iphone 0 beyond repair .
positive	i submitted my square_trade claim on line by answering a few simple questions .

positive	title line says it all ...
positive	we booked out trip through private_expeditions and found the entire_process seamless and informative .
positive	with literally hundreds of outfitters offering climbs of kilimanjaro and safaris , we needed to whittle down our options .
positive	we had a couple of basic criteria : 0 ) we wanted a company that complied with kpap ( kilimanjaro porters assistance project ), a group that ensures porters are paid what they ' re supposed to be paid and that the porters have adequate basic equipment ( shoes , tents , meals ) while on the mountain , 0 ) we wanted a mid - priced company - there are many outfitters offering the same services and experience for substantially more money and others which offer low_prices but cut many corners ., 0 ) finally , we wanted a company with many favorable reviews .
positive	our search brought us to private_expeditions and we couldn_'_t have been more pleased .
positive	we were met at the airport by said - a very well - spoken man who took us to our hotel and got us settled in .
positive	he explained that our guide and the local head of pe would be by the hotel in the morning to give us our pre_- trek briefing .
positive	next_day , emmanual and our guide praygod arrived and gave us great comfort by explaining all of the details of the hike .
positive	we headed off the next_morning for our 0 - day machame trek with praygod , our assistant guide elias , our cook james , our waiter serafin and six other porters .
positive	throughout the climb , our crew was always focused on our comfort and safety .
positive	you are greeted at every new camp with hot tea , popcorn and bowls of hot water for washing .
positive	praygod and elias ( who , by the way , has a great sense of humor and made the trek so much fun ) were a constant presence , always willing to offer a hand across larger rocks or offering to carry my wife '_s pack during the more arduous parts of the trek .
positive	we reached the summit successfully thanks in large part to our wonderful crew .
positive	you meet many other climbers along the way who are traveling with other outfitters .
positive	while not universal , the vast majority had complaints about their guides , their food , the tents , or something .
positive	we had no_complaints :)
positive	one other aside , in speaking to our crew ( guides to porters ) all seemed genuinely happy to be working for private_expeditions .
positive	the safari was led by a different guide , ezekiel , a very nice man with tremendous knowledge of the national parks and all of the animals .
positive	he , also , was very conscientious of our comfort and our needs throughout the safari .
positive	the lodges booked for us through private_expeditions were all terrific .
positive	in all , i would highly_recommend private_expeditions to anyone considering climbing kili and / or going on a safari in tanzania .
positive	the best place i have found for protein_bars
positive	cool idea easy gift to do that is a little more personalized great site
positive	price was excellent and service brilliant

positive	delivery men were polite and took all packaging away .
positive	accu werkt perfect en moet pas na meer dan 0 volle dagen terug opgeladen worden .

positive	i cannot_fault suntransfers at all .
positive	the booking process online was easy and hassle_free .
positive	we travelled to marjorca on 00th july 0000 and our driver was waiting for us at palma airport with a clearly named card .
positive	therre was no chance of missing him .
positive	he was courteous and the vehicle was more_than adequate for 0 adults - fully air - conditioned and comfortable transfer .
positive	the expereince was even better coming_back as the driver arrived early and agreed to wait around for my son and his friend who were due to meet us at the originally agreed time .
positive	the vehicle was even better on the return .
positive	definitely 0_stars for suntransfers and i would not hesitate to use again .
positive	since i '_ve been with ancestry . com , i '_ve learned so much about my family .
positive	i really didn_'_t know that some of our family is from canada , and some parts of england .
positive	i really wanted to do the search at this time , but i really couldn_'_t afford to upgrade , but i found much satisfaction in the subscription i had .
positive	i have had the most incredible journey into the my ancestors past .
positive	not only was i able to gather information of the past , i was also able to get information of the present .
positive	i was nervous at first , but with the help of ancestry . com research techniques , i believe i have became a pro !!!!

positive	great and cheap alternanive to the nespress capsules .

positive	priceline is so easy to use and very customer friendly .

positive	the shirt is perfect i really like it !
positive	the viator website is laid_out very well , making our choice of tours easy based on our personal interests .
positive	once we had decided , it was just a few_clicks and we were booked !
positive	five_stars !
positive	wide_range of tyres .
positive	wide_range of prices .
positive	there '_s one for you .
positive	when e arrived at pula airport , the driver was there to greet us .
positive	when we got to the hotel he was very helpful in checking us in .
positive	he told us what time he was going to pick us up on our return .
positive	and he was there bang on time .
positive	i have at last found a product range that works for me .
positive	good quality and works well .
positive	feels good and soothing , i will_definitely use again and again .
positive	brilliant . thank_you .
positive	i have been meaning to do this for ages .
positive	i had several looks at selectspecs , choosing what i wanted and then it was extremely straightforward process .
positive	before i knew it my glasses were ordered and i could breathe a sigh of relief .
positive	i have varifocals so was pleasantly_surprised that this didn_'_t seem to be a problem and had a wide_selection of specs i could choose .
positive	everyone has commented on how they like my choices and i '_ve had no_problems at all .
positive	they arrive in reasonable cases , so no_problems from the start .
positive	i would definitely order again from selectspecs .
positive	i would highly_recommend quicker cash . com .
positive	the whole_process took less_than a minute and they matched my application with a loan instantly .
positive	i was approved and cash on its way in a matter of minutes .
positive	definitely a0 service .
positive	i shop a lot on qvc , i find many items here and i can return if not satisfied .
positive	very convenient , reps are courteous .
positive	my son introduced me to google everything a few years_ago this should be their logo .
positive	i never stopped googling since then .
positive	love to see with paypal logo .
positive	saves me the headache of looking for my credit_card .
positive	always gives up the good deals
positive	loved the prices , lowest by far
positive	i '_ve purchased warranties throughout my life , an odd thing i tell you since i really treat myself in a devil may care way , i run marathons , i hike mountains , i eat whole cheese cakes and i train martial arts and get my body and feathers ruffled on a day to day occurrence .
positive	so , when i bought a canon g00 years_ago , and used it on a trip , i also purchased a squaretrade_warranty along with it .
positive	the warranty sat , unused for years .
positive	two and a half to be exact , so i got that familiar feeling anyone gets when they get the clear coat put on their car , or the cabbage they bought that spoiled , that feeling of , unused service .
positive	which was fine , i went on thinking ignorance was bliss and never sure if i would ever need squaretrade for future_purchases , as i seemed to take_care of my things .
positive	and then , while hiking around arizona on a cross country drive , the wind decided to be my nemesis and knock my tripod mounted camera forwards and into a rock filled path of discomfort .
positive	the camera build like the 0 bit nintendo survived the scuffle with gravity but not completely unphased , a slight scratch had found it '_s way onto my lens , visible in photo '_s .
positive	i finished my cross country trek , contacted squaretrade through a few_clicks and presto , box in the mail and a few_days_later my camera were being repaired .
positive	i know such , as i got emails updating me on it '_s status .
positive	then it arrived back , and my lens was fixed and my life were better and i have bought a warranty through squaretrade on everything i buy .
positive	everything , camera lens and such from ebay , keyboards from amazon .
positive	i hardly ever use the warranties , currently i have 0 and have only required their service 0 times .
positive	another fight with gravity and my phone , and my kindle deciding it didn_'_t want to be a e_- reader and instead opted for paper weight .
positive	i have recommended them to friends and chuckled when they said , " no need ."
positive	and then six_months later when the moon was full and the temperature was right , and they dropped their phone '_s down and escalator at the mall whilst eating kettle cooked corn .
positive	i am not an insured person '_s , i feel no need as i am still young enough to feel invincible and just old enough to know which things to avoid in mass quantities at buffet lines , but if square_trade ever offers health insurance , i would be first in line .
positive	until then , ever gadget i own is in their hands .
positive	truly , all of them .
positive	only place i could find the cd i was looking for that had a particular track i wanted .
positive	delivery took about 0 wks to usa .
positive	no_problems .
positive	shipped in a nice padded cd envelope .
positive	would shop with again .
positive	cheap prices without cheap quality like other big stores .
positive	the actual buildings can be run down looking , but aldi has got it where it counts .
positive	still has the best results , but their new privacy_policy of tracking people everywhere they go on the web is a little too big brother .
positive	hopefully someone will challenge them soon .
positive	tons of content , easy streaming , upload , download , subscriptions .
positive	ads are annoying , but it '_s owned by google so what do you expect ?
positive	can have everything for free .
positive	been using amazon since 0000 .
positive	very happy with shipping and return_policy .
positive	customers service ( if you ' re unfortunate enough to need it ) can be poor , but they ' re an online company so that '_s not unusual .
positive	my prime account recently expired which has actually saved me a lot of money .
positive	i realized i don_'_t compulsively buy anymore , like when i had prime .
positive	after a decade of frustration with other_companies , i finally " discovered " grainger and couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	i used to think they just sold industrial stuff , but they '_ve been able to fulfill almost every business need i '_ve thrown at them .
positive	i '_ll update if they ever fall short ( as i '_ve come to expect from all companies ) but so_far they '_ve been great .
positive	highly_recommended , as i '_ve told all my friends .
positive	if you are seeking to keep_up to date on your family_history this is the perfect site to do it .
positive	i ordered fitness ball 00cm best price on line . i needed it fast for program i was starting . i ordered at 00 . 00am on
positive	0 / 00 / 0000 and got just what they said in my hand at 0 . 00pm 0 / 00 / 0000 , when the driver came in i could not believe it they called me 00 min .
positive	later to make_sure i was happy with the service . great job i will be back
positive	i use ancestrtal .
positive	com because with facebook there is no privacy .
