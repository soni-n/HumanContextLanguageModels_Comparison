negative	for those_who are looking to shop better , i guess fsession is actually a better choice .
negative	although they are just about five years old , i loved the quick shipping and packaging , plus no_complaints for the products sent !
negative	honestly , i shopped so much on asos that i am surprised at their poor services .
negative	it ’ s fsession for me all the way !
negative	on saturday , 00th of october , i purchased a ticket for the killers at the secc , at glasgow .
negative	i have yet to receive an_email indicating my ticket was shipped and the gig is in three_days !
negative	unless it is posted tommorow it won ' t arrive on time and i paid 000 £ just to be sure i woulld have a ticket no_matter what !
negative	i have emailed viagogo twice , never got a response and when i called them i was told they would contact the seller and email me by the end of the day .
negative	still no email .
negative	i am panicking since i will travel all the way from athens to go to this gig !
negative	!
negative	orderid :_0000000
negative	update_: unbelievable !
negative	have spoken to three agents so far , getting the same reply that they have to get in touch with a separate department in order to reach the seller -- by email !
negative	!
negative	they have emailed me back twice with the exact_same automated email on how they are working with the seller to ensure that i receive my ticket in time .
negative	they obviously never read my actual email !!!
negative	!
negative	i have never_experienced worse service in my life and i have bought various tickets for concerts abroad .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	the most_important thing in a business is to keep the client satisfied .
negative	you failed miserably to keep_up to your promise of delivering the cd - key on release time .
negative	please read your terms & conditions again and rethink them , don ' t try to easy things by offering a " special bonus " or " gift "...
negative	it ' s not about the compensation it ' s about the service .
negative	the compensation it ' s a sign that you failed .
negative	i book a ticket paris to ny , the money was taken from my bank_account but i never received the flight ticket , bravofly took flight ticket from my account plus some charges that was not expected unbelievable to see that - i spent 0 hours on the phone with my bank and bravofly agency at the ned of the day i am still out of pocket of $ 0000 with no flight ticket , worse company ever especially there travel_agent useless
negative	i ordered an $_000 prom_dress from this site , and never got it .
negative	they also charge outrageous shipping .
negative	wish is a bunch of scam artists , never shop on the this website !
negative	i bought this beautiful prom_dress from aoisos , and never got it .
negative	they also never responded to any of my attempts to contact them about it .
negative	what a waste of $_000 !
negative	i ' m making a formal report to the fbi for internet scam , and hopefully this website gets shut down .
negative	jeg_havde fået en trådløs udløser i gave , som skulle passe til mit kamera .
negative	da_jeg åbner pakken bliver jeg dog hurtigt klar over at den er fejlpakket , da stikket ikke passer i mit kamera .
negative	i butikken finder de den rigtige frem til_mig , åbner kassen og tjekker , og det_er rigtigt nok .
negative	men så stopper det også .
negative	jeg_kan_ikke få_den byttet uden at vise en kvittering .
negative	fair nok hvis jeg_ville have haft pengene tilbage , men da der_er tale om en reklamation og en gave synes_jeg det_er for dårligt .
negative	da_jeg giver udtryk for min mening på en venlig måde bliver jeg endda talt nedladende til af flere ekspedienter .
negative	en_anden gang spurgte jeg ind_til om de havde cf - kort , og der stillede ekspedienten sig bare op som et stort spørgsmålstegn .
negative	man burde kunne forvente bare et minimum af viden når_det nu er en decideret fotobutik .
negative	i hvert_fald ikke et_sted jeg_handler igen ...
negative	this company has the worst business_practice and customer_service of any company i have had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	danielle , a representative of optics_fast , refused to refund my money when i cancelled my order because the glasses i wanted were on back order and it was going to be weeks before they could be shipped .
negative	i was not told this up front and could not wait weeks for a pair of eyeglasses .
negative	please do not consider buying glasses from this horrible company .
negative	world rugby shop is a sham .
negative	hidden charges everywhere .
negative	they deliver outside the u . s through an external company who charge much more than you agree for delivery .
negative	also , the import duties for deliveries to addresses outside the u . s are ridiculous .
negative	you think its a bargain but its not .
negative	stay_away !
negative	i bought an item from cash generator on the website .... it arrived and the items software had already been used and would not let me register it .
negative	i contacted the store and they advised the would contact the original seller to try and resolve this ... i never_heard from them again .
negative	in total i sent another 0 emails after this with no response .
negative	i then tested the item on a friends computer who has the software and the item is completely fault !!!!
negative	i have then since sent 0 other emails and have just been ignored ..!
negative	!
negative	have had to open a case on paypal to try and get the money back .
negative	i have bought alot of items from cash generator in the past .....
negative	this will be my last !
negative	!
negative	i bought a product in july and not received the order , healthdesignes did nothing to make the situation was resolved .
negative	comprei um produto em julho e não recebi a encomenda , a healthdesignes nada fez para que fosse resolvida a situação .
negative	they don ' t have games in stock but they are promoting it on their website .
negative	i need to wait over 00 days to get a payback from paypal .
negative	they are not replying tickets , they just told me lies on paypal ' s request cancelling panel .
negative	think_twice before purchasing games from this store .
negative	be_aware !
negative	i ' ve tried to contact them numerous_times but have been unsuccessful .
negative	i ' ve submitted a ticket to see what has been going on .
negative	it ' s almost a week since i submitted my first order , so that ' s one more week without my supplies .
negative	this is the last time i ' ll try ordering something from them , if my issue doesn ' t get resolved by the end of the week , i ' ll look somewhere_else for my supplies because i ' ve never had any order issues with the vitamin_shoppe .
negative	i purchased a sunpak pz00x flash at b_&_h in nov 0000 .
negative	the image displayed a flash stand with it and there was no text whatsoever saying that , " accessories are optional ".
negative	i made a claim with customer_service and all they can say was , " oops , sorry about that , is there anything else i can do for you ?"
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	on top of that i got different answers from phone reps , which have 0 knowledge on products ... basically , this is the last time i would purchase anything at b_&_h .
negative	imagine if they would screw something up like that on a product worth $ 0000 .
negative	i ' d_rather put my money with adorama , never had any_problems whatsover !
negative	if i could rate this a cero i would , but i only have a 0 option ...............
negative	i ' ve sent 0 enquiries about my order and have yet to be acknowledged by their system .

negative	sucha bad help from the customer sider
negative	habe am 0 .
negative	aug bestellt .
negative	mehrere e_- mails bekommen um den status meines bestellung anzugeben ; das letzte war am 00 .
negative	aug dass sagte dass der sendung in detschland beim zollamt eingegangen ist .
negative	seit dann haben wir nichts von der firma gehoert , und kriegen auch kein anwtwort zu meiner e_- mails .
negative	the shoes was collapsed after 0 day of wearing .
negative	the store is " heng ji fashion ".
negative	store no . 000000
negative	the flowers i ordered for my mum came on great time for mothers_day but look nothing like the picture , deluxe opinion was extra money for nothing and the card i picked was a different card .
negative	i ' m really disappointed , i could of got nicer ones from my local shop for £ 0 .. thought by spending £_00 they ' d be good but some of the flowers was dead before they even got into my mum ' s hands !!!
negative	only_thing right was the mothers_day balloon .
negative	also the customer_service by mail is rubbish as i received emails about 0 different peoples orders ...
negative	totally unprofessional .
negative	since i really needed to get my iphone 0 unlocked from a foreign_country , i had to do it via internet .
negative	i found this service , even_though it was really expensive , i thought it would be quick , like 0 days , since that was stated as the average time .
negative	during the time i was waiting , i got no status_updates , which i would really wanted .
negative	the order was all the time in " order being processed ", which literally could mean anything ...
negative	after exactly two_weeks , i finally received the confirmation e_- mail , saying that my phone has been unlocked .
negative	ik kwam ergens een poster tegen waarop je een sms kon sturen om 00_euro korting te krijgen .
negative	mooi een vlucht uitgezocht , korting toegepast en het resultaat was dat er nog allerlei kosten bij kwamen zodat de prijs hoger uitviel dan van te voren aangegeven .
negative	het mooie is ook nog , de vlucht was zelfs goedkoper op_de website van_de vliegtuigmaatschappij zonder de 00_euro korting , dat is echt belachelijk .
negative	mijn advies luidt ; gebruik de website van cheaptickets om vluchten uit te zoeken en boek deze vervolgens bij de vliegtuigmaatschappij zelf .
negative	some summery in point form .
negative	full review below .
negative	- unethical business .
negative	- empty promises for past 0 days .
negative	- awful communication .
negative	- deletes legit complains on their facebook .
negative	pre_- ordered my cd_key on the 00th feb . been promised we will be getting a key everyday for the past 0 days .
negative	yet , every time there ' s a new batch of keys comes in , they gave a tiny portion of the keys to people_who paid higher price and sell the rest at the higher price .
negative	we all understand sometime stuff happens , but cjs is not doing their best at handling this situation .
negative	instead of acting like a ethical business by fulfill the " pre_- order " request ( some of the order has been placed months prior the release ), they use those new keys to sell it at higher price .
negative	and basically told the pre_- order customers that their choice are : keep waiting , pay higher price or getting a refund .
negative	that is not how you treat your customers , it is totally unacceptable , especially when cjs is intentionally withholding keys from pre_- order customers .
negative	they also have been deleting facebook comments too .
negative	pretty_much all the legit complains were deleted .
negative	it ' s looks like cjs are intentionally delaying the pre_- order request , so we can all get a refund and they can sell their keys at much higher price to cover their loss over that bad batch of the bad cd_keys they got from hungary .
negative	after being jerked around by the customer servers for 0 days i finally got a refund from them and got my key from someone_else .
negative	i sent an_email to you on the 00 / 00 but did not get a reply .
negative	our internet_connection has been down for 00 hours today .
negative	they should have told me that the router would need to be reconfigured once the switch was processed .
negative	i am extremely angry as it has cost me £ 0000 ' s in lost productivity , not to mention stress .
negative	i am disgusted with xln and the service i get , time after time .
negative	i have emailed back and forth with smartbuyglasses several_times .
negative	i have asked on numerous occasions for them to call me , and have provided both my order id and my full contact info .
negative	i even emailed the servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . com address , and still have not received a phone call .
negative	i have had a similar problem as the majority of the poor reviews .
negative	the glasses i ordered were out of stock in the warehouse , and they were checking with the supplier , but they suggested that i choose a different pair .
negative	i sent an_email_saying that if the original frames i wanted were not available from the supplier , then i would like to switch to a different frame .
negative	after no response for 0 days , i checked my order status .
negative	it said the stock of my original pair had been confirmed .
negative	whew .
negative	then i got an_email from them saying that the back up pair i ordered were not in stock , but are through the supplier .
negative	wait ... what ?
negative	so i immediately went back to my order status page .
negative	they have now added the second pair of glasses to my order .
negative	they have not charged me for them yet , but my total on the website has changed to show charges for both pairs .
negative	i understand the wait time , but i still have not received my glasses , nor a phone call to straighten everything out .
negative	i cannot even get a straight answer form the famed "< private data removed >" who seems to be the only rep they have .
negative	all i want is to have my original order , and a phone call .
negative	i ordered my 0 year_old the blue mermaid costume and it says it fits a 0 - 0 year_old .
negative	i couldn ' t even get it over her head and she is skinny .
negative	i measured it and looked at what they said their measurements were and they were half the size they stated .
negative	customer_service sent me an_email_saying sorry you opened it and we don ' t except products that have been opened .
negative	wow , i unsnapped the bag , very bad practice .
negative	good thing i didn ' t pay more than $_00 .
negative	it was also very cheaply_made .
negative	the shower enclosure and tray that i purchased from bath empire resulted in me having to replace a large part of my kitchen ceiling !
negative	the waste pipe supplied was faulty and resulted in a large leak and i was unable to use the shower until it was fixed , which approx 0 weeks in total .
negative	i found this extremely difficult as i initially had the shower installed due to being heavily pregnant and with an existing disability found bathing difficult .
negative	the added stress and expense at this time was extremely upsetting .
negative	i contacted bath empire sales team for a response but was totally ignored !
negative	if you ' re looking for quality products and service you ' ll not find them with bath empire , steer well clear !
negative	!
negative	got the key within a few_minutes .
negative	whole_process was smooth and straight_forward just as it should be .
negative	good job !
negative	edit_: the key i received was already registered with another account .
negative	just lost £_00 .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	i don ' t like how i order something and not get it till next month .
negative	disgusting , disgusting , disgusting !
negative	the worst customer_service ever .
negative	i tried_calling the supervisor few_times no one is calling me back .
negative	i ordered bathing suits based on their size_chart which is completely incorrect and they run so small .
negative	nothing was specified and they don ' t want to exchange for a bigger size .
negative	i have no words to say how disappointed i am with their customer_service and their treatment to the customers .
negative	they are liers .
negative	every time i called they would say supervisor is out of her desk which is complete bs .
negative	not only that their size_chart is way off .
negative	and they are only nice to grab customers money .
negative	the worst ever in my online ordering experience .
negative	da un momento all ' altro ti bloccano il conto e ti ridanno i soldi dopo 000 giorni chiedendo decine di documenti che anche se inviati non vengono nemmeno guardati .
negative	da evitare
negative	worst experience ever trying to buy cat_food .
negative	my prescription didn ' t verify so i talked to my vet to make_sure that it would .
negative	i sent in my information again and heard_nothing from petflow .
negative	i called them , and they said the product had changed to a different bag , and if i ' d like to order that ( like thanks for letting me know ?).
negative	i said yes .
negative	a few_days_later i heard_nothing on my order .
negative	i checked my account and nothing was there .
negative	i called again , and they said there was no record of my order changing .
negative	i took my business elsewhere .
negative	such unenthusiastic customer support .
negative	usually when you call someone should say " hi this is ___ , how can i help you ?".
negative	all i got was an awkward " hi " then silence .
negative	i ordered roses to be delivered today .
negative	it is now 0 pm and i have not received them .
negative	i have called the call_center 00 times ( no exaggeration ) and cannot get a human_being on the line .
negative	after a couple of minutes the line says the wait time is longer_than usual and hangs up on me !
negative	i have emailed them twice and have not received a reply to those either .
negative	i have no_idea where my flowers are or if i am even recieving them anymore !!
negative	this is not okay for the amount of money i spent on them !!
negative	still_waiting !!!
negative	beyond upset !
negative	i will never order from avas again !
negative	they have cheap products but offer no quality control .
negative	if you are one of the unlucky souls that get a bad camera ( as i was on my first try ) their customer_service department is horrendous .
negative	its been a week now and i ' ve called and emailed them every day , every day they have a new excuse as to why they can not address my problems this time .
negative	i recommend never buying from this company .
negative	also their advertising tactics are very shady , just one example :
negative	they send out an_email asking if they have done a good job , 0 options if you ' re happy , or if you are unhappy .
negative	if you click happy it takes you to this site ( trustpilot ) if you are unhappy you never know that the other link was to rate them .
negative	this is why they have such skewed reviews on this site .

negative	i ordered from supplementmarket . com , and received the supplements in a timely_fashion .
negative	however , when the shipment came , i noticed that one of the products was not the same as the one i ordered .
negative	i called them , and somehow their " answering message " girl picked_up , told me that the office people might be busy so the call got diverted to their answering service .
negative	i told her my problem , and she took down my name and number , to forward it to the " office " staff , and they would call me back .
negative	waited a day , and no call back .
negative	the next_day i called again , and surprise , the " answering " girl picked_up , with the same line " give me your contact info " and we will get back to you .
negative	i explained to her it was my second time calling , and gave her the info again .
negative	0 hours go by , its coming close to end of business day , and still no call back .
negative	i called them again a third time , and surprise , surprise , the answering girl picks_up with the same line .
negative	i got fed - up with trying to reach them , cc company will be notied for a swift dispute .
negative	they hire answering_machine people just to take messages ??
negative	would it be easier , and quicker if the answering_machine operators took_care of consumer problems ??
negative	i suspect that they have a very poorly run operation with one person answering phones , and the other shipping items .
negative	they communication and customer_service is the lowest .
negative	i gave them not0 , not 0 but 0 chances to make it right , but they will not listen .
negative	i am an active member of several fitness and bodybuilding boards , and i will make my reviews about this company known to their customer base .
negative	i thought i was ordering a pair of gloves .
negative	boo , on me for not reading the fine_print .
negative	when i looked back on the page where i made the order , it did state one spot that the order was for one glove .
negative	boo , on halloweencostumes . com for being misleading .
negative	the " one glove " fine_print should have more apparent .
negative	who orders only one glove ?
negative	could you imagine ordering only one shoe ?
negative	also , there is no where to indicate if someone wants a right or left glove .
negative	this would have been a fair indicator / notice that i would only get one glove .
negative	i decided to go to local costume store to avoid getting another right glove .
negative	i take online ordering seriously because companies easily rip people off with fees , misleading descriptions , and restocking fees .
negative	i tell_everyone about how halloweencostumes . com is misleading .
negative	ordered some auto parts through amazon , after a month i get nothing .
negative	0 request ' s later they issue me a refund , only to get the refund wrong .
negative	they finally get the refund right , only now , they send totally different parts that i never ordered , in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order .
negative	at_least they did not ship me an assault rifle like they did to someone in dc .
negative	i bought yellow and gold wigs .
negative	i got red and brown on top of brown and some more brown .
negative	i emailed still no response .
negative	i called nobody is there on a work day and hours .
negative	i answering_machine i can barely understand .
negative	if they did not have the color they should have just said so , not send me left overs .
negative	let me tell you another time i ordered some shoes .
negative	the heel was hammered to death and the glue melted in a heart beat .
negative	a shirt i bought before that was sewed up completely crooked .
negative	one shoulder was wider than the other and the neck was slanted .
negative	i thought it was brand related so i ordered from a different brand recently to see if anything changed newer from the hair colors .
negative	hopefully this is an last opportunity .
negative	if that one is wrong too .
negative	i ' m never coming_back .
negative	did not received 0 orders .
negative	i was very disappointed in the product i received .
negative	it was not what i had ordered .
negative	i had ordered a " decorative line border " locket with text block engraving on the back .
negative	what was sent to me was the " greek key " design with text script engraving .
negative	also , it stated that the locket was 0in by 0 . 00in but the width alone was barely . 00in !
negative	it is very disappointing that i spent $_00 to receive the wrong product .
negative	there is no excuse for this , as the site clearly_states which locket is which and the catalogid on my order detail matches the one on the site for the " decorative line border ."
negative	i suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after i read the reviews online , but i figured i would give them a chance .
negative	and when i emailed them about all of this , i didn ' t even get a response with an_apology , let_alone one that tried to make amends .
negative	honestly , how hard is it to pay_attention to detail ?
negative	i ' m thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company .
negative	the product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $_000 and have almost every detail neglected , and for it to be on the wrong item entirely , and to not even get an_apology ?
negative	i have lost all faith in this company .
negative	i gave them a shot in spite of what i read online , but they only proved those critics correct .
negative	now i am unfortunately just another critic .
negative	but what do they care , they got their money ...
negative	pathetic
negative	bought a russian key of rage from them , and it ' s not working because they only sent me the sewers dlc key and not the actual game key .
negative	they issued a statement in facebook that their supplier mixed up the keys .
negative	also they advertise that they send actual photo scans of the boxes , which is not true , because i haven ' t received it , only an_email with the key .
negative	without the photo scan , i don ' t have any proof that the key is legit or not .
negative	they are still selling the game on their website without_warning potential_customers that there aren ' t keys available for the game .
negative	until my issue with rage is fixed , i leave a poor rating .
negative	i have made an order with this company and they have taken the payment but will not send my order !!
negative	after 0 weeks the order status remains on ' pending ' without_any explanation .
negative	have written a bunch of e_- mails to this company without reply !
negative	!
negative	company sucks .
negative	so i ordered two different dresses from amiclubwear for my boyfriend birthday .
negative	i was so excited when i received theses two dresses in the mail .
negative	but when my boyfriend and i opened it the two dresses looked nothing like what i ordered what so ever .
negative	so i went back to the web site to make_sure i ordered was what i wanted , my boyfriend and i did a comparing to the dress to the website .
negative	it ' s not at all the same i ' m very disappointment .
negative	don ' t think i will order from this place again .
negative	placed an order on the 00th , chased on the 00st only to be told it had not been shipped and would be with me in 0 working days .
negative	chased a second time on 00st where they still couldn ' t tell me if it has been dispatched .
negative	waste of time on all accounts .
negative	great products , socially inept staff .
negative	didn ' t appreciate the comments about wives and women while i stood next to my husband .
negative	it was offensive ...
negative	especially as we were spending our money at your store .
negative	had we not been in severe need of a the lap top , we would have immediately left your store .
negative	will we recommend the store , depends on an_apology and if there will be change .
negative	i have ordered some wooden blinds and i was first told i would get them 0 days after i ordered them , so i booked the day off , i then was told on the working day before that they wasnt go to be me until the tuesday , so i booked the tuesday off of work , and i have sat in all day waiting for them and i thought something was right , so i phoned up and i have found out that they gave_me the wrong day and that i will get them tomorrow , but this isnt for sure as it is an ' eta '.
negative	i have now used up 0 days holiday waiting in for my blinds .
negative	i am really not happy about this .
negative	i am rather upset about this as i was planning to buy a lot of blinds from this company , but i cant take 0 days holiday everytime i decorate a room .
negative	love the item that i purschase !
negative	shipping took forever though .
negative	and cusomer service rep doesn ' t have the idea how long my item will arrive .
negative	christmas_present that became a new year ' present .
negative	very dissapointed !
negative	on my way to holiday i rented a car via rentalcars . it was a disaster ! they have charged my credit_card imiediatly all two_weeks fare . despite this at hertz company at airport they didnt give me the car becouse they said there was problem with credit_card for deposit . despite i offered cash i didnt recived car .
negative	people at rentalcars phoneline didnt want to help me .
negative	so i rented the car directly at anyother dealer . but now rentalcars that is the broker not rental company !
negative	doesnt want to give my money back they sent me email that i have nonseeng status . i intend to go to court !
negative	i placed my order 00 days_ago and still have received nothing after the first 00 days that they told me would take a something the email and they told me that it would take up to another 00 days but they would do everything possible to get it done as quickly as possible as now been the other nine days and i sent them another email_saying it still has not been completed yet their response was there doing everything they can do but it might take another 0 to 00 days but if i want to spend $_00 i have a rush and i can be done within 0 to 0 why would i pay to have it completed over twice as long as it originally was supposed to be
negative	when i bought diablo_0 i was under the assumption that i had the global eu version , even for that price .
negative	but instead , what i got was a russian limited version where i can only play in russian .
negative	now i have to buy a new gamecode to be able to play the game in english .
negative	i have contacted the website but no response yet
negative	they thought i was a fraudulent customer because my paypal was linked to a different email than my log in , so when it came to buying and receiving a key , they put me through a maze of security_checks that lasted 0 hours before finally giving me the key .
negative	this included sending them a picture of a hand written code , as_well as my drivers licence and other id .
negative	the whole ordeal was incredibly inconvenient and made me very angry .
negative	i ' m still_waiting for my tickets for the upcoming concert this wednesday for beyonce i ' m very nervous because it only 0 days away i bought the tickets 0 months_ago why aren ' t they here by now ..?
negative	i need answers now !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	if you like getting_ripped_off , never allowing any sort of communication , having your account suspended when ever they feel_like it .
negative	paying extremely high fees .
negative	forced repayment when it clearly_states in the ebay posting item is " sold as it ".
negative	getting random emails from them saying they have had a " security risk " and your account info may have been stolen but we are not responsible for any thing .
negative	then by all means use this rip_off of a company .
negative	placed an order for fm0000 ... they charged my card in a few_seconds , and after 0 minutes instead of key they sent me an rejection email . contacting the support , he did not answer my question , and told me to wait for refund . i say ok , i place a seconde order again the same problem .... result = charged 00_euros for nothing .... find another store ... i repeat do not buy from them ... still wiaitng for refund .
negative	i don ' t know if it ' s just my bad luck , but wiggle customer_service has been a nightmare to deal with .
negative	they sent me a scratched wheel – i contacted them about getting a return authorization for it and there was no response for at_least 0 days ( they claim " within 00 hours ").
negative	so i stayed up late ( i ' m based in california ) and finally managed to contact them through their flaky , usually " busy " live_chat , and the person i chatted with said he couldn ' t solve my problem , he could only relay my case to someone_else .
negative	that second person then emailed me and said he / she_said " bear with me while i contact my returns team to arrange a collection for your order ."
negative	after yet another couple of days without a response , i had grown really tired of the ridiculous lack of communication , and was able to sell the wheels locally .
negative	i asked only that they refund the priority dispatch i had paid for , and they confirmed that they did , though after a week it has still not showed_up on my account .
negative	either wiggle has some serious infrastructure issues in their help ticketing software , or customer_service is clearly not in their vocabulary .
negative	i bought tablet pipo m0 pro 00gb .
negative	delivery was ok , although the vat tax in netherlands was not counted in so i had to pay that extra ( 00 eur ) when it went through customs in netherlands .
negative	i ordered a case but it had opening for camera on the wrong side .
negative	i cannot verify specification of the tablet but it barely seems to have the advertised properties .
negative	the display quality is good but the system is sluggish ( slower than my smartphone ), waiting for opening apps too often for too long unless they are already in memory .
negative	still trying to figure_out batery life but so far it isn ' t very good .
negative	orientation of camera in skype is mixed - not rotating properly , always upside down unless rotation is turned on and in horizontal position .
negative	camera quality is poor .
negative	once the device got stuck while opening the google play market . completely unresponsive and no combination of any keys helped .
negative	i had to wait_until batery died out and then turned it on .
negative	i requested a return or compensation for bad quality device but so far no response .
negative	i do not recommend buying from them .
negative	rather pay a bit extra somewhere_else .
negative	i think it is chinese company ( although in usa ) and their customer_service is very poor once the stuff is sold .
negative	the company i work for needed to get some things through paypal and i attached their bank_account and credit_card to my account so they could take_care of some things .
negative	the very next_day my account was limited .
negative	they immediately associated my account with a paypal_account i had 0 years_ago with a negative balance .
negative	because of this , the business is now unable to have their own paypal_account because their bank and card is attached to mine .
negative	after speaking with liz who ' s paypal badge number is 000000 she told me in a recorded conversation that there is no - one at paypal who would be willing to take action and remove the business information so they can have their own account .
negative	even_though their information was on my personal account .
negative	they would not let them take their own bank_account and credit_card off my account .
negative	in short , paypal limited an account after it had been opened for over a year immediately after this business had their information attached to the account .
negative	they immediately found a reason to go after a person by taking advantage of a company .
negative	they could have limited this account any time within a 00 month period but they suddenly choose to limit it today ?
negative	needless to say , i paid my balance and removed the limitation but only because the company needed to have their bank and card back so they could create their own paypal_account .
negative	paypal uses other people ' s money to their advantage , they can limit accounts on the fly , and they do what they want with their users .
negative	paypal is an unsafe system for the business owner to utilize in the terms of they have full control , you do not *
negative	unfortunately their are not that many alternatives to paypal on the market today which paypal uses to their advantage .
negative	they make interest on their account balances and they make a lot of money .
negative	it ' s like they ' re greedy enough to make others suffer .
negative	bravo right , i say this is a poor business_practice and the company needs to think about the way they do business with their users .
negative	i also think ebay needs to think about using another alternative to paypal .
negative	it ' s up to you what you want to use , but frankly i ' d_rather work with a company that works with me like payza , escrow . com , and moneybookers or skrill .
negative	the fact that i take the time to review this experience should be enough for you to not use their selfish and greedy service .
negative	i was also told by liz that i could get a copy of the call since " they record all their calls ".
negative	once i got to the right department , they said i needed to call their legal number at 000 - 000 - 0000 and i ' d have to subpoena to get the call .
negative	my guess is they will destroy the evidence now and say no such call happened .
negative	god the whole company upsets me and what ' s hard is you can ' t get mad at their reps , they are just doing their job which the beast has trained them to do .
negative	i hope this helped some of you make the right decision .
negative	it ' s a gamble , sometimes you ' ll be ok , sometimes not .
negative	when i paid for sniper_elite i expected to be able to play it on the day of release , i thought wrong despite their assurance .
negative	a game being out of stock due to unexpected high demand is somewhat out of their control and is understandable .
negative	however , to be continually lied to and being told " tomorrow ", " full re - stock monday " and then not receiving your cd_key is beyond frustrating .
negative	they lie to you so you don ' t get a refund and go elsewhere , had i have known how long it would of taken , i would of just got it somewhere_else .
negative	edit to their reply : ok then , so you get them " fully restocked " - and then what , i ' m supposed to guess my cd_key ?
negative	?
negative	after a month of emails i received a key to a version that is not even what i wanted so i can sum it up as the worst purchase ever !
negative	i ordered a bag for £_00 an instead of recieving the bag they sent me a £ 0 mug , after ringing up i arranged to have the mug collected and a new bag sent out ( that i had to wait another 0 weeks for after already waiting 0 weeks for the one i was meant to recieve ) they charged me again for the second bag an said i wouldnt be refunded for the first one til they had recieved the wrong item back an even then would take up to 00 days , 00 days after sending back the mug back i still had not recieved my refund , which took ringing up again an to see there was nothing there about even getting a refund back !
negative	got it in the end but certainly wont be using very again , terrible service , avoid
negative	a bodybuilding pra nós brasileiros não presta !
negative	isso porque eles enviam por rotas comerciais , o_que faz com que os_produtos tenham altas chances de serem taxados !
negative	não tem por que passar por esse risco , se existem outras empresas que enviam de forma mais segura !
negative	deixo aqui a recomendação pra healthdesigns , que é a que todos os revendedores de_suplementos atualmente tem utilizado pra importar .

negative	i am writing this review to help future or current customers .
negative	trust me , do not use this company .
negative	there are so many other_sites that i trust to sell , rent , and buy textbooks from .
negative	textbooksrus claims that they did not quote me prices for my books before i mailed them all in .
negative	you have to be out of your mind to think that i would send in books that were worth ( literally ) hundreds of dollars if i wasn ' t sure i would receive a check !
negative	isn ' t that common_sense ?!
negative	then , textbooksrus says that they only received one or two of my books ... i sent about 00 .
negative	they just " didn ' t receive " them .
negative	i do a ton of online shopping , sales , etc_., and have never had this happen .
negative	the few they received apparently " did not match " the ones i said i was sending .
negative	moral of the story : spread the word , this company is a joke and they will lose your books , say they didn ' t quote you prices online that they did , and claim they never received your books .
negative	it makes me sick to think these bitches are making a profit .
negative	run , as fast as you can !
negative	i will be brutally honest .
negative	booking my hotel was no problem but when it came to changing my reservation it was a nightmare .
negative	i went to my account with my reservation details where i should have been able to change my reservation from 0 rooms to 0 rooms .
negative	no_matter how many_times i refreshed the website or hit the buttons to change it , nothing happened .
negative	so then out of frustration i tried to cancel my reservation by hitting the cancellation button ..... many_times .... again nothing happened .
negative	the next_day i called their customer_service .... not much better .
negative	the connection was terrible and because the reservation technically went through expedia my customer_service person had to call them and call me back to cancel one of my rooms .
negative	this only took a few_minutes but i never received an_email receipt or confirmation code .
negative	the next_day i look at my account and it still has me listed as being reserved for 0 rooms .
negative	so now i try calling back .... and after calling about 00 times with no answer or answering_machine to leave a message i just went straight to the source and called expedia .
negative	expedia took_care of my immediately and sent me confirmation code and email .
negative	will never use this service again .
negative	and the nightmare continues .
negative	a week after being promised a full_refund i still had not received it and decided to call easybook again .... kill me now .
negative	when you call easybook not only do you have to wait forever but you have to listen to the most god awful sound while waiting .
negative	it sounds_like a broken alarm clock .
negative	after waiting for ten_minutes to finally talk to someone i was answered by a girl who couldn ' t hear me due to a bad connection .
neutral	fik dog fejllevering af halvdelen af ordren , hvilket ikke er ok .
neutral	men god service i forbindelse med henvendelsen omkring de fejlleverede varer .
neutral	dog kun 0 *, da den vigtigste ting ved nethandel er , at alt skal være som bestilt .
neutral	ellers ryger fidusen ved det .
neutral	the designs are great got what i ' m looking for , price so - so can ' t say perfect but still great
neutral	upon contacting the rental check - in , they had my paperwork and reservation available .
neutral	there was evidentally an upgrade available for my vehicle which sounded like a decent deal so i took it .
neutral	i then got flooded with paperwork , charges , insurance , and fees not to mention getting precharged for them to fill the gas tank upon return .
neutral	i asked what it was all about and she showed me the paperwork which was ver hard to understand as she pointed out areas that would get refunded upon return split into several categories as_well as charges split into numerous categories as_well .
neutral	all this on top of pre paying online and then trying to figure_out price conversions from us to pounds on the spot .
neutral	this is really my only major complaint as the vehicle itself was nice , clean , and drove well .
neutral	i could say that she seemed helpful but i did not appreciate getting blindsided with all these extras when i had already booked and paid online .
neutral	check in upon return was quick and easy but they took my only paperwork with the breakdown of charges so now i need to request another reciept .
neutral	ons weekendje londen was een ervaring , maar wel erg vermoeiend .
neutral	de heen - en terugreis duurde wel heel erg lang en het afscheidsdiner had zeker een uur korter gemogen .
neutral	ook de in onze ogen te strakke tijdsplanning voor_de dagen in londen had flexibeler gekund .
neutral	een half uurtje meer speling voor het ontbijt was niet erg geweest .
neutral	als laatste minpuntje : een hotel iets dichter bij het centrum zou zeer gewaardeerd worden door menigeen .
neutral	grote respect voor_de chauffeuse en de manier waarop zij ons door het zeer drukke londen reed !
neutral	de gids ( annemarie ) voor_de tour was in onze ogen een groot succes .
neutral	met veel enthousiasme en humor vertelde zij over het heden en verleden van_de stad en het land .
neutral	veel plezier aan beleefd .
neutral	vet inte vad jag ska tycka ännu , bra beställningstid , fyllde i mitt recept som jag har helt korrekt , men_det känns som att det gungar när jag går med mina solglasögon , ska det vara så ?
neutral	känns nog inte som om styrkan är helt korrekt , den matchar inte riktigt den synkorren som jag har på mina nuvarande glasögon , vet inte om jag ska lämna tillbaka dem just nu för något verkar ha gått snett ?
neutral	when i purchased something so expensive , expected much better communication on when it would be delivered & how long it would take .
neutral	it took more than the 00 business days stated to arrive , and they kept giving me the wrong dates when i asked when it would ship .
neutral	this should have been much more transparent , and affected my proposal plans .
neutral	also , once the ring arrived , she tried it on it was far too big , took it to a local_jeweler and found out it was a full half size larger than i ordered .
neutral	value - wise , they can ' t be_beaten offline though , got the ring looked at by someone local and they valued it at nearly 00 % more than what i paid ( pre_- tax ).
neutral	however , i think some of their online competitors like bluenile offer similar prices .
neutral	order date : 00th aug 0000
neutral	today : 0th sep 0000
neutral	this order is marked as awaiting shipment
neutral	however , my money has been refunded before one week , i am not sure the " awaiting shipment " is true , and i think maybe i will never got it .
neutral	and i did not receive the notify of cancel , please give me a reply as_soon as possible .
neutral	key delivery should have been instant , instead i received key 00h later .
neutral	company made a mistake by telling that keys are in stock .
neutral	that ' s not professional .
neutral	on the other hand , they have great prices .
neutral	i ' ll definitely give them a second chance !
neutral	have to wait for a long time for shipping .
neutral	but the products are nice and good material .
neutral	the prices are the best , why i go through them .
neutral	but i did get hit with fraud on both my credit_cards in feb 00 for over 0 grand in fraud charges on each .
neutral	my bank reimbursed the money after a month , it was proven something happened from their site , don ' know if someone sold peoples information or what , happened to a boat load of people at the same time .
neutral	fast forward to now and everything has been ok so far , but what bugged me about that before was trying to get a hold of someone .
neutral	no one answered emails or phone_calls , was a pain .
neutral	the clothes are really cute and somewhat affordable , although quality - wise , there is still a way to go .
neutral	case in point : i first ordered two sweaters from yesstyle last_year .
neutral	one of the sleeves ( it was a knit jumper ) was undone , to my great disappointment , as i unpacked it !
neutral	the sweater itself was made of the weirdest ( cheapest ) knit material ...
neutral	also , the whole 0 - 00 days wait thing is annoying .
neutral	most websites these day don ' t make you wait for so long .
neutral	their shoes are for an asian market , so any woman with feet bigger than a us 0 won ' t find a thing !
neutral	such a shame !
neutral	very very high shipping cost , however prices are actually low .
neutral	customer_service sucks
neutral	i need a working contact number i ordered two tickets to ultra music festival weekend 0 and they haven ' t even been picked_up by ups yet .
neutral	the concert is on fri march 00 and that is only a few_days away
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	i need these tickets !
neutral	and a working customer_service number !
neutral	----
neutral	update_:_0000000 has been shipped but what about 0000000 ?
neutral	?
neutral	i purchased 00m ^ 0 of " stadium turf " from onlineturf .
neutral	it was delivered on time , however several ( approximately 00 ) of the rolls were torn and the turf itself was of very poor_quality ( thin and listless grass ) when compared to turf i bought from a local farm last_year .
neutral	i bought 0 tyres in october 0000 for my mercedes - the prices were great , and i found the site very easy to use .
neutral	however , upon visiting the " premier partner " to have the tyres fitted , everything broke_down .
neutral	the garage staff were unfriendly , they didn ' t confirm any of my details , they didn ' t explain the pre inspection process ( the wheels should be checked for damage before fitting ).
neutral	when i returned after 00 minutes to collect the car , the fitter expected me to sign the post inspection form before i viewed the car , and when i pointed out this made no sense he just walked out !
neutral	not what i ' d expect from a " premier partner ".
neutral	i bought a dozen roses bouquet with fillers and a vase .
neutral	everything arrived on time , but the flowers were not as in the picture .
neutral	they were small and the never opened .
neutral	its my first time shopping on this site .
neutral	so many things to choose from .
neutral	i really hope that the clothes fit me and i hope its good quality
neutral	i ' ve purchased some wonderful clothing for my husband , but shipping seemed bit_slow .
neutral	one of the items wasn ' t in stock and i didn ' t realize it when checking_out .
neutral	i like the way you train and work to gain money / fame / items .
neutral	kind of set_up for if you want to spend a lot of time or a little .
neutral	the problem with how games are set_up is , there really is no point to the teams so far , basically it is build you team to be the top_rated team , no league games , championships , etc .
neutral	i can see myself getting bored of this game after i get my player better_than he is now as there won ' t be much more to do .
neutral	it is good most of the time , but occasionally it gets too biased for my taste .
neutral	the cjs staff needs to be more careful about scanning their cd_keys .
neutral	my costume was great .
neutral	a star_wars storm trooper .
neutral	but seriously , no way to go to the bathroom without taking the whole thing off ?
neutral	this was a $_00 costume that i had to cut my own fly .
neutral	these are pretty good and fast delivery but they shouldn ' t charge for delivery should be free
neutral	i bought_simcity 0 or 0 days_ago , paid instantly , and they are still_waiting for payment , even if i got an_email from paypal about that i paid .
neutral	wrote to them on twitter , on facebook , and on their support site , got no response at all .
neutral	this site is so bad now ( i didnt say it is cant be good , just for real ...), i need my key or my money back ...
neutral	edit_: just got my key , working flawlessly , so i ' d give 0 star now , ' couse we seriously cant talk to them , but they will do their stuff .
neutral	so i wanted to change my address of delivery and found it very difficult .
neutral	i was constantly in panic as they stated that if i didn ' t go to my other address and pick the tickets up the next_day they would be destroyed !
neutral	it took me a good 0 hours or so to get the delivery place changed because their customer support is in one word - awful .
neutral	i kept on being confronted by automated messages and i became very irritated .
neutral	in the end i managed to talk to an actual_person and get the delivery details changed , the tickets then appeared early the next_day and i was overjoyed .
neutral	apart_from that , there were no_problems at all and i had a great music festival .
neutral	i am healthy and slim with a waist of 00 inches , my lower belly is 00 inches and underbust is about 00 .
neutral	i had got a size 00 inch corset and it is way too_tight .
neutral	even when i lace to 00 inches , i feel_like i ' m gonna die .
neutral	these corsets are not made for grown women .
neutral	:( the corset i had gotten is " my - 000 - green brocade underbust " it is cute though
neutral	the clothes are usually great , however the shipping options and speed ( my order wont ship out for 00 days ) can be a bit of a hassle
neutral	i am a loyal french connection fan and have always enjoyed their fashion forward lines .
neutral	recently , i was a bit disappointed in the fabric quality on a recent website purchase .
neutral	i ordered 0 articles of clothing , and i was disappointed with two of the articles .
neutral	the fabric was quite thin , and the colors were not as vibrant as how the website depicted them .
neutral	this was a first for me - i have always thought that french connection quality was superior to other competitor brands .
neutral	i will_continue to shop french connection , but only in their bricks and mortar stores !
neutral	bought a ghd straightener for 00 pounds , got a free ghd brush with it .
neutral	good deal / price .
neutral	but the packaging was horrible .
neutral	box was smashed up and only a few pieces of paper surrounding the ghd box .
neutral	i was honestly surprised the straightener worked from the condition of the box .
neutral	i wrote about this on my review for the straightener but hqhair removed this part .
neutral	i was just trying to help them for future shoppers .. international customers please be_aware of bad packaging !
neutral	just think a bit more marketing and products for younger generations of makeup users would be helpful .
neutral	have always had the image of my grandma using these products .
neutral	seems like they ' re trying to do elderly posh .
neutral	i ' ve heard good things about the products just wouldn ' t ever go buy them .
neutral	when reviewing some sites , you can see obvious bogus ratings and ratings from other_sites which aren ' t explained or anything .
neutral	this gives a very unprofessional feeling about the site .
neutral	combining this with the lack of users that write more than 0 review , it doesn ' t make me feel_like this is a site i ' d recommend to other people .
neutral	on the other hand , the site has a pretty good looking but simple layout .
neutral	great game , but the company censors bad posts on their forums and tends not to listen to their ( paying ) users when it comes to deleting or adding content .
neutral	it wasn ' t until after i bought my tickets to see bruno mars that i saw how much bad_reviews viagogo a gotten .
neutral	i ' m really tatting to get worried and i was also curious to why they deliver so close to the event date .
neutral	i like the store and i like the products , but the quality of their website is sub par .
neutral	very slow and overwhelmed ... just needs a lot of improvement before i go thru 00 minutes of processing time to order one product again ... and it wasn ' t my connection speed ...
neutral	it took ages to sign_up , and the website asks for a lot of personal_information , and even a driver ' s license and / or facebook confirmation ( i don ' t put real info on facebook so i had to scan my dl in ).
neutral	it was lengthy , but secure .
neutral	the starting limit ' s pretty low ( after verification , i could only buy $_000 in one day and only about 000 monthly ?)
neutral	so i assume it ' ll eventually increase with more business .
neutral	onto the most annoying part .
neutral	i thought visa only called to make_sure the transaction was authorized for overseas websites but nooooo , visa called and woke me up at 0 am to have me verify the transaction was legit .
neutral	if this happens every_single time i decide to buy $_000 in gift_cards , i ' m just going back to walking down to 0 - 00 and buying the physical cards - because that is a wake - up call i don ' t enjoy having .
neutral	all in all , okay , but super lengthy time .
neutral	required tons of personal_information and resulted in visa giving me a wake_up call to make_sure that i actually did buy this .
neutral	ugh .
neutral	albero modello oregon de luxe , con il cesto copri base .
neutral	l ' albero è bello e di grande effetto , ma ha problemi di stabilità , tende ad oscillare e a stortarsi .
neutral	mi aspettavo un prodotto più robusto .
neutral	la base di sostegno è oggettivamente troppo piccola per un albero di queste dimensioni ( 000 cm di altezza per 00 di ampiezza ).
neutral	inoltre il cesto acquistato ( pubblicizzato con l ' albero ) è troppo piccolo rispetto alla base ( manca circa 0 cm e mezzo ).
neutral	share your opinions , be heard and shop with knowledge .
neutral	with your input , online shopping gets easier by the minute .
neutral	.
neutral	i like yesstyle , but my first order was placed and there was no response for over two_weeks , and then they informed me that they would not be receiving any more stock any time soon , then they cancelled my order .
neutral	just make_sure that your product is in stock before you buy anything .
neutral	i seriously had my doubts about this site and weather i was going to recieve my order .
neutral	i ordered an iphone clone ( hero h0000 ), 0 pairs of fake apple earphones , and a lazer pointer .
neutral	after payment is made , you get a confirmation_email stating that the order will be shipped within 0 days .
neutral	i thought wow , no one told me about this !
neutral	as i had ordered express_shipping for $_00 extra .
neutral	so on the 0th day i still had not recieved my products i think oh no i just got scammed of $_000 .
neutral	i send them an_email explaing what has happened .
neutral	after this they tell me that it is out of stock , when on the site it says in stock .
neutral	oh well .. i wait a week and email again , now seriously worried if my package will ever come .
neutral	support sends me something completely random about texting someone and that i should wait a few more days .
neutral	after waiting 0 days i recieve an_email with a tracking_number plus my shipping info .
neutral	i am very relieved at this point because now theres a greater chance it will arrive , and so it did .
neutral	they pacakaged everything into the phone box which i found incredibly odd .
neutral	the phone comes with 0 batteries and a european / us charger however the us adapter was broken so useless for me , thankfully it is a usb and i used my ipod charger .
neutral	earphones only fit this phone and they were also broken .
neutral	the lazer i got was also broken , and came with no batteries .
neutral	earphones get uncomfortable if worn for more than 00_mins , sound avarage , but they look almost exactly like the original .
neutral	overall experiance is that dont expect great quality , you get what you pay for .
neutral	however this is not a scam site and i did recive my products to the right price .
neutral	i was expecting my iphone_0s skin to arrive in the 0 - 0days i had ordered but was disappointed to know that i was going to get it a while longer , although this is a minor problem ..
neutral	it still should be recognised .
neutral	still_waiting for my skin to arrive !
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	fast , clear and convenient
neutral	i ordered a lot of stuff but its weeks and still not all in stock .
neutral	as regards a previous delivery i would have liked to have been given the option to collect at the delivery depot instead of getting it delivered when im not home
neutral	first order came without a hitch .
neutral	great prices , great deal , and express_shipping for $_000 or more was free .
neutral	a couple things though , returns are not free , no exchanges unless for size .
neutral	luckily there is a return address in mississauga but still , i paid $_00 to ship back 0 pairs of shoes .
neutral	also because of the bogo_deal , i was not able to get two out of the three pairs back .
neutral	yeswalker sends you a $_00 coupon , yes , but you cannot use it with the bogo_deal .
neutral	so i just paid to return two other pairs of shoes for no reason ... sucks ..
neutral	item came quickly , packed in bubble envelope .
neutral	but for £ 0 . 00 this charge for light package of two knobs is really too much .
neutral	priceline is the cheapest hotel site i ' ve found .
neutral	i love the express_deals - i can normally narrow it down to what hotel is available by using location , amenities and the star_rating .
neutral	it ' s well worth it , and a lot easier to guess than simply using name your_own price , where i ' ve been screwed over before .
neutral	the issue i notice though is that if i try to save a buck , i can ' t ever get out of a hotel_room .
neutral	for example , i had a death in the family three_days before a trip .
neutral	they called the hotel who refused to cancel it , and instead would only rebook it .
neutral	incredibly insensitive and i now have a hotel_room for a year in_advance i don ' t think i ' ll use .
neutral	i get that that ' s the hotel saying no , but at the same time does it matter ?
neutral	they barely cancelled a motel i booked when every detail in the express summary was wrong .
neutral	it was stared 0 . 0 / 0 - it was a motel that didn ' t have a lobby and was tended to by people in pjs and no shoes behind bullet proof glass .
neutral	it had 0 / 00 rating - it dropped to beneath 0 before we went , and had reviews of hookers using it .
neutral	the " breakfast " it had didn ' t exist at all - it wasn ' t even like there were danishes .
neutral	there was just nothing .
neutral	the doors didn ' t have bolt locks even_though it was a motel .
neutral	they had to get permission from the hotel which to me is a line of bull .
neutral	i ' ll still use the express to save 00 %, getting $_00 dollar hotel_rooms for $_00 , but i won ' t ever get a non - chain again .
neutral	hi , this is my first time to buy with sky_tours and must_admit , they offer cheap tickets and bookings was made easy and quick .
neutral	however it ' s been 00_mins since i got my confirmation_email and i have not received my e_- ticket yet ...
neutral	it says that my e_- ticket is still under process .
neutral	is this supposed to be like this ?
neutral	how long is the wait_until e_- ticket arrive ?
neutral	i ' m getting a bit nervous .
neutral	i ' ve tried many different domain sellers and as a matter of fact , go daddy hasn ' t exactly been on the top of my list .
neutral	it isn ' t that bad compared to some of the other domain sellers but i wouldn ' t recommend this to anyone , to be brutally honest .
neutral	i won ' t go into detail but i ' m sure anyone_who has experiencing their service would be able to find out .
neutral	i love all the clothes here on yesstyle . com .
neutral	whatever style i ' m looking for is on this website .
neutral	however , the sizing options are so limited that i rarely buy anything because i know the thing i ' m looking for won ' t fit .
neutral	am dat comanda duminica si luni am_fost sunat ca marti ajunge coletul .
neutral	coletul a ajuns joi dupa pranz .
neutral	desi am mentionat ca dorest sa fie montata memoria ram primita bonus , ea a fost atasata coletului .
neutral	nu a fost deloc dificil sa ii montez singur , dar macar nu oferiti un serviciu pe_care nu il onorati .
neutral	cele 0 stele sunt doar pentru pret ( cea mai buna oferta pe_care am gasito la momentul respectiv ), in rest nimic special .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	: ar fi utile mai multe informatii tehnice la produse ( de exemplu layout -_ul tastaturii ).
neutral	laptop -_ul comandat a venit cu tastatura layout uk .
neutral	din nou , nu e capat de lume , dar putina informatie in plus nu ar fi stricat .
neutral	after_placing numerous orders before at over $_000 per order and being a customer for quite some time , i was unable to speak to a manager and no accommodations were made when their staff made an error .
neutral	no measly $ 0 . 00 credit no expedited_shipping no extra samples no nothing .
neutral	after contacting lisa via_email and asking to speak with a manager because i was dissatisfied , i was refused and no attempt was made to go above and beyond for me due to their mistake .
neutral	disappointed and you can even get a manager to speak to you .
neutral	amazed .
neutral	would be great if you guys can tell me how long this will take as i need my iphone unlocked pretty soon .
neutral	waited 00 hours at the moment .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	company sent me a cd_key that was bound to be banned , i contacted them and they gave_me a new cd_key which is working for now , i hope it will stay that way , next time i just start a dispute with paypal for not offering the item description which was 000_% valid and legal cd_key .
neutral	one thing i should add is that their customer support is very good if you catch them online that is , all i asked the customer support representative was why was my cd_key banned and he immediately gave_me a new one , sure it made me wonder whether they were expected this to happen , but still they were very prompt .
neutral	i have had some great prices for pc_games on the site .
neutral	but at time their delivery time is later then advertised and getting a refund is nearly impossible .
neutral	customer_service ignore my request for 0 days ( they kept on saying keys were in stock instead of refunding me .)
neutral	after using a paypal_dispute i got my refund within a day .
neutral	i did the name your_own price thing and got a great deal on the minivan i was going to be using for a couple weeks .
neutral	after i had that van for a couple of week i realized i needed an_additional car for awhile for a daily driver ( i am military and my car had not caught up with me after moving ) so i again went to priceline and got an ok deal on a car .
neutral	the problem came when i went to the airport to pick_up the second car .
neutral	after having already paid though priceline for the second car the car company ( alamo ) told me they couldn ' t rent me a second car while i still had the van .
neutral	after talking with priceline and alamo neither one would refund the difference in the cost or offer an acceptable option that would work with my situation .
neutral	it ended_up costing me about $_00 in all which is why they get three stars .
neutral	i ordered a necklace on 00 / 0 for a christmas_gift and have yet to receive it !
neutral	i have sent a total of 0 emails and 0 voicemail messages but nobody has returned my email or call .
neutral	it is a bit_suspicious that they do not have a legit contact # and do not provide tracking #' s but , i have ordered from there before and was very_pleased .
neutral	i would hate to change my mind due to poor customer_service .
neutral	please provide me a tracking # so i can give my neice a merry christmas .
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	the range of products is fantastic , with heaps of stuff you can ' t find in stores .
neutral	but be_careful of the images !
neutral	the images are heavily photoshoped , so colours can come out very differently ie something that looks white can turn out to be yellow .
neutral	and fabrics will often be cheap less durable fabrics .
neutral	really inspect the photos , and if in doubt , don ' t get it !
neutral	all that being said i have had some really good buys , with super_fast shipping and usually decent customer_service ( they accept returns for faulty goods , but not colour or appearance variances )
neutral	comprar foi fácil , o único problema é_que eu nunca recebi os_produtos .
neutral	fico muito triste com isso pois , já passaram mais de três meses , e_nada .
neutral	o pior de tudo é_que o número de rastreio não funciona , eu coloco para rastrear no site dos correios a mensagem que tenho é_que_não há dados da compra , e coloco no site muambator , aparece como pacote não rastreável , e pior de tudo é_que fiquei sabendo pelo correio que se a encomenda não é rastreável , eles vem em casa com tres tentativas de_entrega , mas como nao dá para rastrear , a encomenda volta , e_nao tem como eu saber se vieram ou nao , pois eles nao deixam aviso para esse tipo de encomenda .
neutral	é uma grande pena , pois eu faço uso de_suplementos , mas infelizmente fiquei no prejuizo , e_nao tem como comprar_mais , pois nao sei se vou receber , e também nao quero mais perder dinheiro .
neutral	i just ordered my first 00 pound bag of serious mass from them , i was recommended by a friend .
neutral	if all goes well , i will_definately use sw , and serious mass again .
neutral	jeg_har handlet_hos elounge et_par gange efterhånden og jeg er ganske tilfreds_med deres priser , som ofte er_meget lave i forhold_til andre sider .
neutral	de har dog en tendens til ikke at levere til den tid de lover .
neutral	jeg_bestilte to varer ( en hardback tegneserie og en box med fire paperbacks ) som havde en forventet levering på hh . v .
neutral	d . 0 / 0 og d . 00 / 0 ( jeg_bestilte bøgerne d . 0 / 0 ).
neutral	dagen_efter modtager_jeg en email med beskeden om at hardbbacken først kan leveres d . 00 / 0 , hvilket var fint at_vide , men i praksis betød det ikke_noget , da_jeg_ikke havde bedt om , at få_dem tilsendt hver for sig .
neutral	det_var altså stadig d . 00 / 0 , der_stod som seneste leveringsdato .
neutral	d . 00 / 0 modtager_jeg så en besked om , at varerne er sendt af sted og jeg modtager et track ' n ' trace - nummer ( som ikke virkede før tre dage_senere , men_det må vist være det kære postvæsen , der står for dén detalje ).
neutral	jeg_modtog varerne d . 00 / 0 , tre dage_efter leveringsdagen og dette var uden besked fra elounge .
neutral	jeg_vil fortsat handle hos elounge , grundet det store udvalg og de billige priser , men er_det en hastesag , vil_jeg nok vælge at gå til en_anden forhandler .
neutral	i dette tilfælde var det ren hyggelæsning , så den sene levering gjorde ikke den store skade .

neutral	jeg_bestilte to par sko på uksportshoes . co . uk hvor_jeg_fik min varer ca .
neutral	0 - 0 dage_efter .
neutral	kvaliteten_er som den skal være og varen blev sendt som en vareprøve dvs .
neutral	der_ikke kommer told / moms på .
neutral	dog har jeg haft problemer_med den service de tilbyder .
neutral	de tager lang_tid om at svare på mails , og i starten ville jeg annullere ordren , men de skrev bare udenom i besvarelserne .
neutral	desuden bliver skoene sendt fra kina .
neutral	jeg_kan_ikke kalde denne hjemmeside helt fake da de besvarer ens mails og bruger paypal til betaling .
neutral	i enjoy facebook very much , i on the other hand do not like all the changes that have occured .
neutral	i will still be an_avid facebook user , just wish they would slow down all the changes and let the techology paused catch up .
neutral	very competitive prices , but tricky to add 0 flowers arrangements so ended_up doing 0 seperate orders .
neutral	a little time consuming in comparasion to other shopping sites .
neutral	the flowers turned up on mother ' s day as requested and both mums seem pleased with their bouquets .
neutral	i used their web for several_times to book bunch of tickets , it was ok but still needs more improvements in terms of costumers service and their schedule is really tight specially here in us with time differential after certain hours you can not reach any buddy . i hope they will extend it at_least midnight .
neutral	i was really pleased with trips - ta supervisor over in greece matina kalyva she is did really good job .
neutral	the good : 0 % pricematch , tough to beat that .
neutral	the misleading : tons of free crap to choose from .
neutral	i never choose the free_stuff , not even the shaker , adding the shaker to the order increases shipping cost by just over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the bad : sales_tax in wi .
neutral	shipping is usually more expensive than bodybuilding . com .
neutral	i couldn ' t find a working promocode to enter , i have never had that problem with bodybuilding . com .
neutral	for very heavy orders bodybuilding . com blows sw out of the water on shipping charges .
neutral	overall i keep_coming_back because i live in wi , so i recieve the order very fast .
neutral	the price ( including shipping + tax ) is usually a couple dollars cheaper_than bodybuilding . com , and that is using the pricematch feature .
neutral	not sure if this has any significance but ; i ordered some lg sciences lipotropic protein from bodybuilding . com , taste amazing .
neutral	ordered it from sw ( twice ), taste horrible .
neutral	i spend over $_000 on yesstyle items .
neutral	the only items that i liked were the bb_cream and circle lens .
neutral	i ordered many different scarves from this website , but they either have a funky smell to them or the color is really off .. like really off .. don ' t know about their clothing so i can ' t comment on them but try to stay_away from their scarves .. they might look nice on the website but they might be disappointing when they arrive in the mail .
neutral	champion search_engine .
neutral	but i don ' t like google ' s new privacy policy though .
neutral	they shouldn ' t have done it .
neutral	good just wish it was a little more user_friendly .
neutral	hello my order has not arrived please check gm000000000000000000
neutral	good would that can change the form of payment that is not always euro ...
neutral	think ....
neutral	i loved avast in old days , but it just changed , avast need to be more advanced in these days .
neutral	their virus data base is not up - to - date , it seems lacking most time .
neutral	for me , i switched into avg and kis , they lead in these days .
neutral	the autokey_system is fantastic , but the anti_- fraud system however , is slow , sluggish and dumb .
neutral	if you could speed up the sms feature it ' d be fantastic .
neutral	certainly not the nicest place in the world but overall the service was good .
neutral	the walls are pretty thin and don ' t do much to block the sounds from neighbors or outside .
neutral	i ordered from ami for a couple years a long time ago .
neutral	not surprisingly , after a long absence from online ordering ( aka 0 years ), my account was deleted , but i wasn ' t worried .
neutral	i ' d always received quality items that looked like the pictures on the site .
neutral	as i was going through my email and wondering what kind of dress to get for my little sister ' s sweet 00 , i saw an ad for ami for 00 %_off .
neutral	i decided to order from them again .
neutral	i found a few items that i liked , mainly a lovely teal dress and some sexy pleather like pants .
neutral	i was nervous that i wouldn ' t receive the items in time , so i checked their shipping faq to see how long it took for them to ship , since my sister ' s party was fast approaching .
neutral	luckily it said 0 - 00 days , which was on the cusp , but i felt i could relax .
neutral	unfortunately , it was 0 weeks before i received them .
neutral	which isn ' t horrible , i was just disappointed that the site had been wrong and that i hadn ' t been able to wear the dress to my sister ' s birthday .
neutral	but one the quality , except for the shoes , was horrible .
neutral	the pants turned_out to be hardly anything more than tights , the pink " bandage " dress was just that ... unyielding fabric bandages that was most definitely not the dress pictured .
neutral	it gave absolutely no body hugging ...
neutral	i was very disappointed .
neutral	but the teal party dress i ' d ordered was the worst .
neutral	it was far too long ; even with five inch heels it dragged on the ground and i ' m 0 ' 0 ", so it ' s not like i was too short .
neutral	it was snagged all up and down , there were threads sticking up everywhere , and even had a hole in the side .
neutral	i ' m a crafty person , so i just got some teal thread and patched the hole up and hemmed it myself , but i was still very disappointed .
neutral	especially since i ' ve always had a lot of trust invested with ami .
neutral	now , i just ordered two more outfits and all i can say is i really hope these items are better .
neutral	it seems like it ' s shipping a whole lot faster , except one item hasn ' t shipped with the rest and that makes me nervous .
neutral	i still have faith in you ami , but this next one is a make or break .
neutral	please don ' t disappoint !
neutral	i wish the order came on time .
neutral	my first order from yesstyle got held back for near a month ...
neutral	i know they ship from china but when they say express_shipping i expect it to be fast , oh well , i ordered again for my birthday hopefully it will come faster this time
neutral	good and confiable site .
neutral	but too slow to respond e_- mail or facebook if you need contact .
neutral	i initially requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	the coming saturday was a bank_holiday weekend and was advised there was a chance it would be the following weekend .
neutral	this was reasonable .
neutral	i then got a call the following week asking if i was free to accept the delivery that afternoon , i said no as i was in work .
neutral	i said i requested a saturday delivery .
neutral	i then recieved no call or update and the bed was not delivered .
neutral	it wasn ' t until the following week the delivery slot was booked , with you company not having any record of the previous weeks call .
neutral	the bed was delivered as promised , but your process isn ' t great .
neutral	the delivery company only called me on the day of delivery at 0am .
neutral	surely you could arrange a delivery time during the week instead of waking someone up at 0am to advise them their bed will be delivered later on .
neutral	took very long to arrive , but at_least all my items were there this time
neutral	this site will only post review if they are positive , any complaints at all and they will not post it .
neutral	items usually arrive in a timely_manner and mostly i have been happy with them , but not being honest about the reviews have deterred me from using them again .
neutral	i had a good time there .
neutral	and i could improve my english .
neutral	the only bad thing was the wifi which contaminated me around the clock .
neutral	there are at_least 0 wifi transmitter at every floor .
neutral	and the students use the internet with their mobile phones all the time .
neutral	being there for a longer time might be quite harmful !!
neutral	!
neutral	i bought the " video game princess wig " and it was terrible .
neutral	zero_stars .
neutral	a lot of hair came off of it as_soon as i took it out of the package , and there weren ' t much hair on it in the first pace .
neutral	if you go look at the picture they provide , the hair that is on the model ' s left shoulder is all the hair that this wig includes .
neutral	it was a terrible mullet looking thing .
neutral	just don ' t buy it .
neutral	the " sexy pink princess costume " was awesome .
neutral	five_stars .
neutral	surprised by the quality actually .
neutral	didn ' t look super wrinkly out of the package like a lot of the costumes usually do .
neutral	the costumes came about 0 days ahead of estimated time which was great because it gave_me time to replace the terrible wig .
neutral	i was looking for ipod touch 0 in 0 chargers for my kids ipod ' s for christmas and even_though the ' sellers ' advertised ' free shipping ' or ' shipped in time for christmas ' when i got to check out every time , there was either a $ 0 . 00 shipping charge for a $ 0 charger , or there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by december_00th .
neutral	i settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time , but may just stick to craigslist , ebay , or half . com for my next purchase .
neutral	on two occasions i have ordered products and paid extra for one day or two day shipping .
neutral	on both occasions the products did not arrive on the " recieive item by " date .
neutral	when i contacted amazon they told me that they would ship new orders by next_day air but didn ' t refund the extra money i paid .
neutral	i have flown on delta dozens of times and have been disappointed recently .
neutral	specifically , i took a flight where i had to make a connection and we were stuck because of the weather .
neutral	the individuals tasked with providing information and assistance hated their jobs and made their frustration very clear .
neutral	i saw them speaking to customers in an antagonistic and confrontational manner .
neutral	i was not even offered assistance or information without escalating the issue to a manager .
neutral	first time iflorist user here , but i had the same concern as fellow user jason who said , " will update my score and comments on the 00th of feb
neutral	i have placed an order for delivery on the 00th of feb for the mixed roses , they should be delivered to my place of work so i will post back here on the quality and arrival date , from what i have been reading most of the deliveries make it on the right date but im worried as mine state ' s delivery will be the " week commencing the 00th of feb " and not " will be delivered on the 00th feb " which is what i requested .... i guess time will tell on this one "
neutral	i also requested that my flowers arrive on the day of feb 00th , but it shows up as " week commencing the 00th of feb " as_well .
neutral	i chose free shipping , but prior to purchasing i talked to the online customer_service in chat and they told me that if i selected the 00th that it will arrive on the 00th , which led to my purchase .
neutral	i took a screenshot of the conversation as_well .
neutral	i will be thoroughly disappointed if my flowers don ' t arrive on that date and will update my review after valentine ' s day ...
neutral	the ' price_match ' wasn ' t exactly as they insisted on factoring in the price of mounting .
neutral	i also didn ' t get the ' internet package ' price on the balancing but i didn ' t scrutinize the invoice .
neutral	i still saved $_000 over invoice for the tires .
neutral	next time i ' m going to just use the online process rather_than try to accelerate the process by calling the store directly .
neutral	prices are about the same as anywhere_else but they price_match and take 0 percent off if they are not
neutral	simplyhired comes up with great results and i love how you can sort the result by distance and date posted .
neutral	sometimes though it can be complicated to apply to a posting .
neutral	some of the posting you click on the apply button and it takes you to an outside website that wants you to make a new account or doesn ' t actually show you the full job posting .
neutral	some postings take you to the ziprecuiter website to apply which makes it very easy , but then i find myself going straight to ziprecuiter and cutting out the middle man of simplyhired .
neutral	i understand that you have different levels of partnerships with companies , so the applying process probably won ' t always be the same .
neutral	i will_continue to use simplyhired but it is slightly frustrating at times .
neutral	i ordered a shirt on sunday the 00th selecting the dhl 0 - 0 day priority mail .
neutral	spent the whole day monday being picked , packed but not shipped .
neutral	checked again tuesday_morning which said it shipped on the monday but there was no email notification of this and also no tracking_number provided in the order details .
neutral	emailed and posted a message on the facebook_page to get a tracking_number but no response .
neutral	i would just like confirmation of shipment and a tracking_number so i no when it will arrive .
neutral	order number 00000000
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	would like to see my report updated more often .
neutral	im not to happy with the service thinking about canceling .
neutral	ebay has come in handy so many_times - dress up parties , last_minute furniture ..
neutral	i ' ve only had minimal road bumps with it in the past but overall - pretty good .
neutral	booking on viator is like playing russian roulette .
neutral	you never know if you ' ll win fabulously or get that horrific bullet .
neutral	most of my experiences have either been incredibly fantastic or desperately awful .
neutral	as you do not know who the provider of the tours are , there is no way to check reviews elsewhere to see if these tours are good or not , as many groups offer similar tours with similar itineraries .
neutral	the ones that are really good are amazing !
neutral	great tours guides , great itineraries , etc .
neutral	however , the really awful ones seem to falsely advertise the tour on viator .
neutral	those are the tours where what they promise on viator is not what actually happens on the tours .
neutral	i wish viator would screen tour companies more carefully before offering them to others .
neutral	or have some recourse for unhappy customers to get compensated .
positive	thanks alot
positive	supplementwarehouse . com is the best place to buy your supplements from .
positive	great prices , price_matching , free_stuff and check out and great customer_service !
positive	totally recommend !
positive	i was very_pleased with the easy navigation of hostelbookers ' website , and the fact that i didn ' t have to pay a booking_fee !
positive	it ' s also really awesome that i can cancel up to 0 days in_advance free of charge !
positive	will_definitely continue to use hostelbooker for my travels in europe !
positive	i was a bit afraid at first .
positive	it was 00 of may and my diablo key still was nowhere to be seen .
positive	but i was just being paranoid .
positive	later that day the key arrived as promised and now i can enjoy a great game 0 / 0 .
positive	i enjoyed that they offered so much free_stuff and that they had what i wanted for a cheap price .
positive	they also offer a way to match prices .
positive	i spent a year overseas ordering from bodybuilding . com until a buddy of mine told me he could get the same exact thing i ordered for much less at supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	i didnt believe him until i compared everything i order monthly and realized i was paying wayyyyy too much money .
positive	i ' ll never order from another site again .
positive	i have ordered many tickets through ticket club and not only have i saved in service fees , but they have great customer_service as_well !
positive	i did not get my e_- tickets right after i purchased them , was a little concerned , so i emailed ticket club and they were quick with a response that the tickets were sold before the on sale so i would have to wait_until the person i bought the tickets from actually had the tickets and sent them to me .
positive	i thought it was so cool that i could buy the tickets before they went on sale through ticket master .
positive	i ' m am completely_satisfied with my ticket club experiences !
positive	very good price and fast
positive	this site has such a huge_selection of clothing starting at 00 $.
positive	my go to store for the new seasons , good style and good quality , what ' s no to like !
positive	when my garmin gps sports watch & gopro action camera stopped_working properly .
positive	i was glad i had the foresight to purchase insurance for them using squaretrade .
positive	i called them & they made it very easy & painless .
positive	they took_care of me and made sure my devices were fixed no_hassle .
positive	supplement_warehouse has the best products with the best deals on the internet .
positive	there are always amazing clearance and blowout_deals were you can get all your protein needs at a minimal price .
positive	the customer_service has always been friendly and prompt .
positive	t . b .
positive	it was easy to pick what i wanted with the best prices , and was super_fast to get the game keys !
positive	i have made many purchaces with this company and always happy i usually dont buy in the internet but im hooked with this one everything is good quality super happy
positive	myprotein is a excellent website and has a good choice of products , i like that fact they have great deals and you get points ever time you buy
positive	easy to order , quick to come and returned easy with fast payment
positive	i bought black_ops_0 from cjs_cdkeys and had no trouble whatsoever doing it .
positive	autokey had a bit of friction with my phone service provider regarding their verification key , and i had to borrow my roomate ' s phone ( it ' s because mine is a prepaid ).
positive	other than that everything went nicely and took like 0 minutes to get my key activated on steam .
positive	price wasn ' t lowest on market , but i ' d_rather pay a couple bucks extra to make_sure my key is a legit key from a legit source and not some russian black market key that might get banned any day .
positive	would buy again , recommend to people_who want a fast & reliable key site .
positive	this has to be the most reputable key site there is .
positive	all keys are gathered at lower prices and sold to us better_than even steam or origin can .
positive	i feel very comfortable and trust cj ' s with my purchase .
positive	thanks !
positive	use it everyday !
positive	was hoping to use this site for my cd_key purchases but the site says isntant delivery .. never got it .
positive	update
positive	they refunded me promptly .
positive	thanks !
positive	update
positive	they contacted me directly after previous purchase and rectified the situation by following throughw ith my order within_seconds .
positive	will be doing_business with again .
positive	on time , nice chap and worked like a pro - very happy with the service .
positive	i needed a new engine for my astra twinport engine they had 0 to choose from when no - one else had one .
positive	i learnt a little too .
positive	will spread the word - thanks .
positive	i would say its the most reasonable protein around especially the 0kg bag and its good quality - try it , there ' s lots of flavours to chhose from ...
positive	i ordered a new canon eos 0d from digitalrev .
positive	their security department hit a very small delay in the verification_process , but this was not enough to deter me from enjoying ordering from dr .
positive	they had supurb customer_service throughout the process of payment and shipping .
positive	speaking of shipping , it was blazing fast .
positive	two_days from hong_kong to san_diego .
positive	with their great prices , fast shipping and excellent customer support , i highly_recommend shopping at digitalrev !
positive	very good indeed
positive	denifitely buy again .
positive	alot of my games are from cdkeyhouse and ive gotta say that they are probably the most reliable keystore out there !
positive	these_guys have the best products with the best prices in the industry !!
positive	just got done placing my latest order and when i got the total i was amazed thwt i had some more money left that i could actually order some extras !!
positive	anybody with goals should really use this site
positive	when you order something late on a sunday_night you don ' t expect to see it for a while .....
positive	even_though the thought of that is really sad as you can ' t wait !!!
positive	i was soooo happy then to get my stuff tuesday_morning .
positive	squealing and bouncing was involved .
positive	have to say the whole experience was pleasurable .
positive	the website is split into easy to navigate categories and the checkout_process is simple .
positive	i defy anyone not to find something that they have to buy ...
positive	immediately !
positive	you have been warned !!
positive	:)
positive	very good service and the flowers were very impressive .
positive	delivery always on time , best price in the market and have been using them for over 0 years_now .

positive	first time i purchase on smartbuyglasses . ca , i received my order pretty quickly ( 0 days ), and i could track my parcel at all times .
positive	i ' ll use that site again !
positive	they are great , use them all the time .
positive	shipping is very expensive .
positive	they can do better !!
positive	!
positive	excellent service as usual , fast delivery even with the huge demand for me0 in launch day .
positive	i ordered a shirt and a coffeemug on my children ' s behalf , for my husband .
positive	he is never very surprised or enthused about gifts and he was so excited and overwhelmed by his shirt and mug with his babies on them that he got all teary eyed and even wore the shirt to work and to visit friends and family just to show it off .
positive	thank_you so much the pictures and captions turned_out beautiful and very clear .
positive	i was so surprised i thought that because they were so - so quality photos to begin with , that they might be fuzzy but it is crystal clear .
positive	thank_you !
positive	!
positive	i don ' t know if 0_stars is enough for brilliance .
positive	when i purchased an_engagement_ring for my fiancee , i knew very little about diamonds or rings in general .
positive	the website gave_me an in depth knowledge of everything , and the customer_service was fantastic !
positive	it was great to actually talk to a gemologist on the phone .
positive	not only was the service great , but i was able to get a very high_quality ring at a much lower_price than any retail store .
positive	i highly_recommend this site to everyone !
positive	if you are new to shopping online then don ' t worry .
positive	best thing about yesstyle that i love is the huge_variety they have for a bunch of things ( shoes , clothes , bags , beauty_products ).

positive	i love the bags and all the different_styles and the fact that majority of this products are affordable for an average consumer .
positive	great selection of products available .
positive	if you can find it cheaper at some other website they will price_match it .

positive	so , i stumbled on the site .
positive	i payed for my sw : tor with paypal and was flagged with the first time buyer , anti_fraud thing .

positive	i will_definitely consider them for any future cell_phone - related purchases i make !

positive	jeg_kunne_ikke umiddelbart finde leveringstiden nogen steder , og derfor ringede jeg til kundeservicen , som orienterede mig om , at jeg_ville have min stol indenfor 0 uger , på det grundlag , at det_var en stol som de havde på lageret .
positive	jeg_modtog så min stol igår i bedste stand .
positive	det_er bestemt_ikke_sidste_gang eg benytter mig af norr00 .
positive	love the gps function -- really set my mind at ease , being_able to make_sure that my family is always where they say they will be .
positive	not to mention that with all of the cyber bullying nastiness going on these days , it is really cool to be able to monitor my son ’ s facebook_page and skype activity and make_sure he ’ s safe .
positive	for me , mspy is worth the money .
positive	very skeptic at first to book through this kind of site .
positive	wasn ' t quite sure what i would get or where .
positive	very easy to find and book hotel reservations .
positive	not to mention an awesome deal !!!
positive	all my expectaions were met .
positive	very worth it and will definetely use again .
positive	i am super pleased with pc_game supply after purchasing a prepaid nintendo eshop card from them .
positive	their verification_process was a lot easier than other_websites i ' ve used in the past ( they send you a pin number via text_message ), and their email delivery of the eshop code was almost_instant .
positive	i highly_recommend them , and will_definately be using them again in the future .
positive	super_fast delivery and well_packaged .
positive	bought me my keys and got them within 0 minutes !
positive	cjs_cd_keys always delivers my keys to email works like a charm just got my 0th key from ther shop no_problems at all
positive	i ' ve searched time and time again to find a cheaper price for supps online , but supplement_warehouse beats any in store and online price available plus even if you did find it cheaper elsewhere they will match the price , can ' t beat it .
positive	shipping takes a bit longer_than i ' d hope for but i just order a few weeks out so it gets here by the time i need it .
positive	i ordered the parts , got them , they work well , and i will come_back to order from partsgeek .
positive	simple and easy
positive	was not sure at first so many online gimmicks that just take your money but this works and i will be back again
positive	if you think this place is full of cheap rubbish , then you haven ' t been in for a while .
positive	only bad thing is the packing checkout thing a bit strange you have to unpack and then repack trolly then move over to another part to pack in bags - fine , saves money but you have to buy bags at checkout !
positive	so how you know how many you need before ?
positive	still , that ' s just a daft problem .
positive	loads of good stuff in there - try it out
positive	who else is waiting for the release of the iphone 0 ?
positive	i can ' t wait although i ' m not sure if it will be bigger ?
positive	thats what they say .....
positive	great place to meet new friend !
positive	cute product !
positive	and it fits the iphone 0 perfectly :) exactly as i expected it to be
positive	definitely the best option to buy asian goodies online , all my orders were send perfectly and the payment_method is really secure .
positive	you ' re doing a great job !
positive	thanks .
positive	this site is excellent
positive	it gives us a feeling of having traveled : traveled through the world ( seoul , hong - kong , taichung , tokyo ...) and traveled through the stores ( clothing , bags , mobile accessories , shoes ...).
positive	thanks to some useful advice ( mix and match , or similar items ), one can definitely find what they ' re looking for !
positive	and the yesstylis blog also brings an added value .
positive	the website design is beautiful and it ' s also easy to use .
positive	the clothes have unique designs and their price can be very affordable ( but some are expensive ).
positive	the only_thing to deplore is that i don ' t have enough money to buy every_single item that ' s tempting me .
positive	hopefully one can create a list of items , " saved for later "...
positive	after remodelling our guest bathroom , we needed our large mirror resized to fit between the new light fixture and the sink .
positive	ryan made it fast and easy .
positive	he trimmed our old mirror down , saving us a lot of money , and hung it the next_day !
positive	i would absolutely recommend ryan !
positive	we will_definitely be calling him again for future projects .
positive	:)
positive	my order was fulfilled within the hour without_any hassle whatsoever .
positive	i used paypal method to pay for my order .
positive	but i didnt have paypal_account so i used the credit xard payment meyhod .
positive	but i only hve debit_card will this be okay ?
positive	will paypal gives out my bank informations ?
positive	and will paypal charges me more money ?
positive	or paypal will just takes out my money without_any reason or notice ?
positive	i wa sunsure but i paid for it anyway but yesstyle is agreat shopping online service .
positive	just awsome !!!
positive	i am very happy for every purchase i have made so far from lightinthebox !
positive	great service and super quality !!!
positive	thank_you lightinthebox
positive	i really love ordering from this site because everything is easy to understand and navigate .
positive	yesstyle is very trustworthy and my items arrive in perfect_condition in a timely_manner .
positive	sometimes i feel_like i would like to ask questions about the product though because ordering something online without being_able to touch or try it on first is a little scary .
positive	the boots that yesstyle has are really pretty .
positive	they have such a variety amount of boots , it ' s like boot heaven .
positive	navigation is really easy and it ' s not hard at all to find exactly_what you ' re looking for .
positive	i definitely_recommend anyone to purchase from yesstyle .
positive	definitely recommending to friends .
positive	there is always a sale or two and the website is user_friendly with many options on how to filter what you can / want to buy .
positive	aside_from the stylish clothing , there are a lot of pictures ( of every angle ) for each item which helps the buyer decide whether they wish to make a purchase or not .
positive	... and it won ' t be my last !
positive	you guys had a great deal going for the latest metro game , and i jumped on it as_soon as i was able , and i ' m extremely happy i did !
positive	autokey was a breeze , and checkout was easy too !
positive	i ' ll be sure to tell friends about the site , there are alot of good deals !
positive	this is a great american company - filled with architectural experts that take the time to make it right .
positive	they worked on hand finishing and antiqueing my door plates .
positive	each was a work of art .
positive	i highly_recommend them .
positive	wow fantastic baby , hello guys out there , if you ' re going to have a date soon then you should get some asian swag .
positive	the gurls love it holla at yesstyle . com <_0
positive	yesstyle is extremely versatile , very reliable , and reasonably_priced ... especially on shipping !
positive	they ' re usually in my price range as a college_student with only so many funds .
positive	plus they make it easy to find what you ' re looking for , suits , sweatshirts , dresses , frills , studs , skulls , roses , you name it they probably have it !
positive	i also really like the fact that they show models_wearing the product and what you see is actually what you ' re buying .
positive	on top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and i really_appreciate that as i prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before yesstyle i was always really skeptical about purchasing online .
positive	i don ' t shop from other online stores for clothes or accessories ever , not even u . s . stores , because yesstyle has never let me down when it comes to their product .
positive	also the shipping is great !
positive	i ' ve ordered from japanese / korean / chinese / thai stores and i can ' t tell you how frustrating it is to buy something and wait nearly 0 weeks and it ' s still not there .
positive	but yesstyle doesn ' t do that , they tell you when they ' ll be able to ship , and the longest i ' ve_seen 0 - 00 days , but you can always narrow your search to " ready to ship " and it ' ll get to you in about 0 - 0 days after order if you pay the 0 . 00 for 0 day shipping .
positive	the longest i ' ve_seen is five , but that was once and five days isn ' t even that bad .
positive	p . s .
positive	the 0 . 00 0 day shipping is highly_recommended , it ' s a couple dollar difference , but if you live in the states , it can take a while before ems finally decides you can whatever you bought .
positive	no fault of yesstyle , that ' s just my personal experience with ems .
positive	tl_; dr they ' re you ' re favorite store even if you haven ' t shopped with them yet .
positive	if you wanna buy anything related to gaming online , pc_game supply is the site .
positive	amazing , instant and prompt service and easy to use instructions .
positive	absolute delight .
positive	service rapide je recoit toujours mes clé en 0 minute
positive	good job

positive	they have a fantastic selection , and i just ordered two bags from them .
positive	( always two , because of the awesome bogo promotion .)
