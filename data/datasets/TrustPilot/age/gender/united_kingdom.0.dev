F	we recommend it to everyone , fast delivery , work well
F	this website should be the first_port of call for anyone considering emmigrating .
F	it is easy to navigate , yet packs in plenty of detail .
F	the country guides provide a good insight to various destinations and the shipping calculator is a nifty idea .
F	i would happily reccommend this site .
F	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
F	already_recommended julesb to two friends .
F	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
F	a refreshing_change with online shopping .
F	thank_you !
F	very pleased with the service at perfume - click , great value , well_packaged and delivered super_quick .
F	i placed my order on friday_afternoon and was a little_worried that due to the weekend it ' ll arrive late ( as i needed it for valentines_day ) but to my surprise it arrived monday_morning .
F	i have to say i was happy with the delivery charge too ;)
F	already ive started recommending to friends and family and would definately shop here again .
F	thanks perfume - click ..... full_marks !
F	i am happy with my purchase from highlandtitles .
F	the items are looking great .
F	good customer_service - i had to communicate with the company by email and they answered very quickly .
F	the only thing is that the next_day delivery is is fact not the next but the second day from the day the item is despatched .
F	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault ....
F	i have been using website for around 0 . 0 years and i am happy with it .
F	great genuine products at unbeatable_prices and free reliable delivery .
F	my order was only lost once ( i made around 00 orders so far ) but cheapsmells sent me replacement item without any_problems .
F	i am very happy with them so far .
F	great choice of spare details for helicopters and very quick delivery !
F	i had never bought glasses on the internet before but found best0specs on the internet .
F	i couldn ' t believe the prices compared with the last pair i bought from vision_express .
F	i placed the order over the phone and they were really helpful .
F	my new glasses arrived about 0 weeks_later and i ' m really delighted with them .
F	i ' ve saved_myself a lot of money .
F	i have used photobox . co . uk a number of times .
F	i used to leave my photos on my laptop but now i print them out at photobox - just like the old days !
F	i ' m on their mailing_list and i got sent some really good offers for free prints .
F	i recently got some photos of my kids put on canvas they really look great .
F	overall i ' m delighted with there service , quality and price
F	i was directed to hostelbookers via a comparison site .
F	hostelbookers had great information on the hotel , as well as photos and reviews .
F	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
F	will_definitely be using again !
F	why is your vat ridiculous now and why do you keep on raising my bill .
F	i ' m going to be paying Â£_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
F	good service , my computer was really fast now used the 0 gig .. good job mr_memory .. :)
F	many_thanks ,
F	cophi
F	i was lucky_enough to find precious_little one online when searching for baby items .
F	lower_than_expected prices , and good communication .
F	my order was placed in the evening thursday_night , and shipped friday_morning .
F	a great sight , and i will_definitely use this one again .
F	i had my baby registry at babies r us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
F	we then received a broken item , which we realized was broken when we tried to assemble it the same day it arrived .
F	we called the customer_service desk which was useless and a waster of my time .
F	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
F	then i was told i would have to pay to send it back with the company that delivered it .
F	trust me , they got it from me at that point .
F	they finally after pissing and moaning about it , arranged for pick_up from my house , as the nearest store is 0 hours away , and i am 0 months pregnant and didn ' t fancy driving all that way to replace something that was faulty on their behalf .
F	so it was picked_up , and i tracked the delivery .
F	it ' s been over 0 days now and they still_haven ' t received it in their system , and therefore hasn ' t been delivered .
F	i phoned and was told i ' d have to wait at_least 0 weeks for the new one , even_though it ' s paid for , and they ' re not losing anything by sending it to me .
F	i ' ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
F	i feel 0 star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r us , or babies r us .
F	awful service , useless customer_service helpline , and all around ignorant .
F	sold an ipod in november , they said the money would be in the account by christmas_eve and still have not received the money yet .
F	they also blocked my account for unknown reasons and haven ' t yet sent me a letter to help me reactivate the account .
F	this was last_year .
F	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
F	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only assume that this mishap has been a one - off .
F	i would defo_recommend using seranata flowers to send someone flowers !
F	really quick & reasonably_priced !
F	i like this web_site , because it can offer very good rooms for optimal price .
F	descriptions of hostels and casas are very informative and full .
F	photoes are useful too .
F	very good service internet service is great .
F	come here often .... addicted
F	been using them for a while now and find them a really good service
F	fantastic friendly helpful service , not to mention the ' ahead of trend ' range of sunnies !
F	fast deliveies and a even better after care service ....
F	i ' m a returning customer time and time again ... wouldn ' t go anywhere_else !
F	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
F	supplement_warehouse provides the best selection of nutrition supplements you can find .
F	the free extras are a super bonus , but i love that they will not only match , but beat a competitor ' s price .
F	my only complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
F	the turn_around time is amazing so i never miss a beat .
F	thank_you !
F	had a few things go missing and was resent without any_problems .
F	really great customer_service
F	really great choice of products .
F	bought a few beds and toys and really liked the quality .
F	would recommend buying this brand .
F	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn ' t turn_up .
F	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
F	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
F	she change our courier to a ups drop_off service .
F	i will_definitely be using p0g again because of samantha ' s help and just pay for a better 0rd_party supplier !
F	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
F	!
F	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
F	perfect all_round !
F	will_definitely be using temptation_gifts again .
F	i was expecting to pay a couple hundred_pounds minimum for a 00 might stay , but thanks to hostelbookers , i am spending less_than 0 hundred total , and still staying in a hostel with reviews over 00 %.
F	reading the reviews themselves is very helpful , because they give different ratings based on what you care about and why they ' re traveling - so if you ' re crashing for the night , access to a lot of showers might not be priority , but a higher safety rating might be .
F	a 00 percent rating on safety is fine if you ' re a 0 ' 0 muscular man , but 00 is perfect when you ' re 0 ' 0 can ' t do a push up without hurting my wrist me .
F	there ' s no booking_fee , so you see what you ' re paying upfront , and the deposit is only 00 percent , so if you have to cancel , it ' s not a major loss .
F	( a night ' s reservation deposit is never more_than 0 pounds for me .)
F	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
F	it only took a few_days from me sending the fone in to getting my payment .
F	the service is excellent and i will_definately use again .
F	an easy website to use and always quick .
F	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
F	also to compare the locations and prices .
F	its says how many places are left so you know how long you can wait or think about it .
F	bought a snugpak sleeping bag , as the title describes !
F	sent out the envelope very quickly , received my phone and notified me even quicker and paid the money into my account the same day - excellent .
F	good quality and arrived within a few_days accurate sizes to
F	my outfit came within a matter if days and is of a really good quality
F	will_defo use this site again
F	the item arrived within a couple of days and was of a very good quality .
F	i was also kept up to date as to when my item was dispatched and when it would arrive .
F	i also found the prices to be excellent .
F	i wrote an earlier , rather negative_review based entirely on the fact that i hadn ' t received my order after 0 weeks .
F	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
F	when i contacted peak_nutrition , they were quick to respond , polite and extremely_helpful .
F	despite the fact that it wasn ' t their fault that i hadn ' t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
F	i have now received my supplements which were perfectly packaged and all as they should be .
F	i would definitely order from peak_nutrition again as i would be confident that they would help sort out any_problems if there were any .
F	i would also advise that you ask for recorded_delivery as the post_office can be terribly unreliable !
F	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
F	quality products and fast delivery .
F	recommand to all this site .
F	best regards
F	lilian
F	i first liked hostelbookers . com because of their blog and regularly updated twitter account but using them to book my stay for a busy_period ( rio de janeiro carnival ) proved - with a lot of price comparing - that they have the cheapest rates and really are the only site without booking_fees .
F	i was very impressed and would definitely use them again .
F	so i was a little_nervous_about recycling my ipad 0 with ipad_recycle but after_reading the reviews and doing some research i decided to give it a go !
F	i posted my ipad monday_afternoon special delivery and i received a conformation email from euan saying that they got my package tuesday_morning and they will transfer my money later that day .
F	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
F	i will totally be recommending this company to my friends and family .
F	thanks again :)
F	really easy website to use , great prices , great options .
F	would definitely use again !
F	i love muubaa , not that i can shop there regularly !
F	but the two times i have they have been perfect .
F	it ' s a big deal to buy luxury leather jackets online when you can ' t try them on .
F	but muubaa understand this and make the process so easy and pleasant if you need to swap a size or return etc .
F	but most of all , the jackets are the softest leather i have ever felt ... and so comfortable and stylish .
F	worth ever penny .
F	my family and i have used buy wise for many things , from washing machines to mattresses , and have been more_than happy every time .
F	will carry on going back for much more in the future .
F	thank_you !
F	gadget_panda were communicative , efficient and did exactly_what they said they would .
F	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two days after they received my phone .
F	all in all , i would definitely use them again and highly_recommend them !
F	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don ' t need to search for materials .
F	there are videos as well as written units so if you learn best through either option , they are both presented to you and easy to use !
F	the course is set at your own_pace so you can fit it around family , friends , work and even university !
F	i did not know i could learn so much in such a short time_frame , and i thought i might struggle with the technology but it was all set out and explained in a way that i could easily complete all of the tasks !
F	i recommend you try this company if this a course you are interested in studying !
F	i never_heard of xskins before but seeing the design i was after on their website i thought i would take the risk and order .
F	really glad that i did service was quick and perfect , no issues with product upon delivery and it turned_out being exactly how i hoped .
F	would definately order from here again !
F	being somewhat of a penny pincher i always check multiple websites for the best rates and hostelbookers . com has never let me down !
F	the website has a beautiful layout that is extremely simple to use but jam packed with excellent search features .
F	booking the hostel was extremely fast and painless and literally took less_than a minute .
F	i ' ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
F	i will_definitely be using double0 again !
F	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
F	fantastic little surprise when we opened our tickets !
F	i ' d recommend them to anyone_looking to book !
F	item was dispatched quickly and i received the items far quicker_than the time stated .
F	very pleased and would order again .
F	again like many others i bought from them , money has been taken and they have not sent the item .
F	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
F	my 0 year_old_son is now without his present , regret ordering from them .
F	i had no_problems with this company received item quickly and with no hiccups to deal with .
F	great service
F	good company and quick nomally free delivery
F	great website and prices
F	yodel is by_far the most useless courier firm i have ever come_across .
F	shower of excrement doesn ' t even begin to cover it .
F	i would give them no stars but unfortunately that isn ' t an option .
F	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
F	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
F	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
F	did he think i was calling for a friendly chat ???
F	the call_centre staff are nice ( except the last one , who just sounded bored to tears but then i can ' t really blame her ) but despite message after message left with them were unable to let the driver know ( which a 0 year_old could probably work out after 0 failed tries ) that since they deliver between_0am and 0pm , perhaps they could try any other time other than the 0pm hour .
F	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won ' t change the time .
F	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
F	yeah , really handy .
F	cheers for that .
F	so in work on monday i ' ll try to get hold of someone on the phone and get no answer .
F	then on tuesday i ' ll call at the same time and get no answer .
F	i ' ll repeat this 0 more times , leaving my number but never answer their calls .
F	i haven ' t done my job but the boxes are ticked .
F	bottom_line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
F	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
F	until now i still don ' t have a broadband / internet_connection .
F	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single_person that works in customer_service / fault department / cancellation departments .
F	i had a visit from an engineer everything is fine inside the house and with the modem , oh , it was the bt guys who didn ' t activate the line from outside .
F	they will come on tuesday .
F	not sure if they came or not but still no internet for 0 weeks .
F	called again for around 00_minutes , did all the line testing that i already do with my eyes closed .
F	swith on , swith off , change socked , open the socket , flip the modem , dance samba with modem , everytime the same expertly advised procedures .
F	oh , you stay home from work from 0 to 0 ( thats not vague at all ) and a bt engineer will visit you .
F	never showed up .
F	called again - 00_minutes .
F	oh , no the problem is with the exchange .
F	bt is fixing it , i promise with my life and soul i will call you in 0 days .
F	until now .
F	called again today , i want to cancel the contract .
F	another round of testing for 00_minutes ( took a nap while doing them ) and now , no faults anywhere , dont know , let me send you another engineer ( lucky me , there is one available in 0 weeks time !)
F	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .
F	let me direct you to the cancellation department .
F	0 minutes on hold .. tcha nam ...
F	i someone hangs up the phone in my face .
F	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department .... 00_minutes with a broked connection ... oh let me direct you to the faults department .
F	what ?!
F	they directed me to you .
F	after 00_minutes on hold ... fault department , another round of line testing !!!
F	nothing wrong , do you want an enginneer in 0 weeks time ?
F	no , thank_you , just want to cancel the contract - sorry ma ' am , cancellation department closes at 0pm .... its 0 . 00pm .
F	guess i dont need to say anything_else ....
F	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
F	i was booking my first holiday by myself so had no clue_what i was doing , luckily i had a great guy , named ricky , helping me out all the way !
F	so , yea , i definitely_recommend them !
F	great service , and even better if you ask to speak to ricky .
F	haha
F	bought a raleigh swift folding bike , halfords have the best bargains for bikes and if there are any_problems you can always take it to the shop for service .
F	they have several delivery options including saturdays .
F	the bike folds up so that i can carry it up to my flat on the third floor without any difficulty .
F	i ' m pleased with the price and benefits of having the bike .
F	bought an extra hard_disk drive for our main computer at home ( western digital 0tb hard_disk drive ).
F	it ' s mainly for storing films and music .
F	the order arrived within four days which is good .
F	it also installed into the computer ok and was recognized by windows .
F	all - in - all a hassle - free purchase
F	i bought a beto mountain bike shock pump gauge & bleed valve mp000 for my husband a week_ago .
F	it was the best price i could find at Â£_00 . 00 and arrived in four days .
F	the recommended retail price is Â£_00 . 00 so this is very good .
F	bought a pre_- pay sim from vodafone . co . uk for my daughter .
F	arrived quickly and was easy to setup and use .
F	also very good value for money , unlimited calls for less_than $_00 . 00 per_month or just pay as you go .
F	bought a proline pl000wd which is a standard size larder fridge instead of a wine cooler , the fridge was Â£_000 . 00 which is more_than half the price of a similar size wine cooler .
F	this is our second fridge which we will use for beer and wine .
F	delivery was quick and the website has good size pictures so i new exactly_what i was buying .
F	the fridge arrived undamaged and works_fine .
F	well_done comet !
F	i bought the item from their ebay store .
F	i live in new_zealand .
F	item arrived within a week in perfect_condition exactly as_described .

F	always a great selection of events and locations .
F	confirmation_email sent promptly and tickets always come recorded_delivery which is fantastic .
F	i always use this site to get tickets and have never had a problem .
F	emily howell
F	ordered a set of polo_shirts for our staff and delighted with the finished products .
F	they came quickly and i would have no reservations_about recommending workwear_express to other_companies .
F	beauty expert is an amazing online store for make up lovers .
F	you ' ll find all the great high_quality beauty brands .
F	i find myself browsing through their range for hours !
F	my package arrived very quickly in just three days to belgium and service was excellent .

F	really pleased with my items and would highly_recommend this site to my family and friends !
F	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
F	it is exactly as_described on the website and just what i wanted .
F	unfortunately the delivery men struggled to get the chest of drawers upstairs for us and gave up leaving it in the centre of our living_room where we hoped to sleep tonight whilst the bedroom is being finished !
F	within 00 seconds of them leaving my husband measured the gap ( took the drawers out to make it lighter - not sure why the delivery guys didn ' t want to do this !)
F	and we had it upstairs in no time .
F	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
F	so overall lovely product and i would use the company again but i ' ll be moving the furniture myself thanks !
F	i bought a voucher for my web master course from groupon site .
F	so i redeemed the voucher on e_- careers web_site and this is how my study has begun .
F	the course is well_structured , it covers not just main topics like html , xml , php , etc_., but contains a lot of material how to manage your online business as well .
F	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
F	needs to know .
F	i would like to say that course really worth it , i have learned a lot new stuff and i really_enjoyed it .
F	and i would definitely_recommend e_- careers not just for my friends but for anyone who is interested in good quality learning .

F	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .
F	my t - shirt was a good fit and very funny , the best t - shirt i ' ve ever bought i think .
F	there is nothing about truffle_shuffle i could complain_about .
F	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
F	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .
F	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
F	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
F	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
F	i cannot_fault them , and i will_definitely use them again .
F	i ' m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
F	i didn ' t think you could get service like this .
F	wow why did i not find this website sooner before i wasted so much money on store bought products ??
F	im a pregnancy testaholic so these are so beneficial for me .
F	lets_hope i dont need them all !
F	!
F	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .
F	the page is really nice , and making reservations is super easy .
F	no booking_fees , and there ' s always nice hostels and hotels .
F	would totally book again here !

F	its easy , cheaper_than any where else and delivery time is fab better_than [_external reference_]
F	courses covered all content required along with additional content , not expected .
F	very pleased .
F	i created a photobook as a christmas_present and was very impressed with the ability to create the book offline where the programme linked to the pictures folder on my computer and displayed thumbnails allowing me to put the book together easily .
F	i was impressed with the easiness of use and the variations of layout i could have on each page .
F	at the end of the process the system asked me to proof the book which i thought i had done but then it flagged up an empty photo box on a page that i would have otherwise have missed and would have been obvious once printed so great save there , especially after i ' d ticked a box to say i had proofed it and was happy with it !
F	once i had finished the book it was uploaded to the website and i was able to track the progress through printing , binding and eventually posting where it arrived 0 days_later .
F	would have no_hesitation recommending to friends and family and came back on tonight to order something else .
F	extremely impressed .
F	never had a problem and appreciate the past customer discounts , excellent !
F	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
F	a good mobile casino , easy access to your account , game lobby etc .
F	easy to contact customer support if needed .
F	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
F	great service , cheap prices , very fast delivery with great communication via emails to let me know the processing .
F	after struggling to find a calling_card with high_quality calls to pakistan someone suggested a tried digital calling_cards .
F	i used my 0 minute free call to test it out and was really impressed
F	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
F	i searched for dates and it came up with all the hostels available on those dates .
F	those hostels came with prices , making it so easy for me to see what was the cheapest and what was recommended by others .
F	very easy service and quick payment so i don ' t waste anytime .
F	brilliant !
F	when i entered the world of poker for the first time , online play was relatively new for me .
F	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
F	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt_comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
F	although i found intriguing live poker , the convenience of playing online as i struggled to keep up and the number of websites which offer strategies and tips for poker players is correspondingly large and growing .
F	here in winner . com i have found a great and comfortable place for playing and meeting nice people , you have great info , great games for playing online and getting some nice tips for poker .
F	please keep updating your site , and keep bringing great stuff like you do , you already have a fan here .
F	congrats and greetings !
F	i appreciate the 0 %_off competitors ' prices on any product .
F	i ' m not aware of any other supplement company that offers that benefit .
F	also , the free return shipping is wonderful .
F	i wish all companies did that ( like many shoe retailers do , since you have to try things on for size .
F	the same is true for suppelements ).
F	with every other website i ' ve tried my iphone never completely stays unlocked but with official_iphone_unlock now it ' s locked for good !
F	i will_definitely_recommend this to all of my friends to use with their iphones !

F	hubby needed new glasses and as we were getting depressed with paying out Â£_000 for his prescription ( very bad eyesight ), thought we would give glasses 0 you a try as the glasses hubby liked were a quarter of the price .
F	i dont normally bother writing reviews , but have to say that the service that we received from russ at glasses 0 you was fantastic , and were over the moon with the finished_product .
F	the glasses are slightly thicker than what he has purchased in the past from a high_street store , but that could be down to the frame and tbh is not noticable at all unless you really look .
F	would recommend to anyone to use glasse 0 you
F	andrew from cateredchalets is awesome - such a nice dude .
F	we changed our party size from 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 then back to 0 , and everytime he was more_than happy to get yet another quote up , work out how it would be cheapest and best value for money .
F	i asked soooo many questions and he answerd them all
F	about gluten_free dietry requirements , vegetarian , whether the chalet has unlimited wine ( yeah im a student )
F	bookig was a breeze , cheers_guys :)
F	after ordering my first purchase with beauty - bay a couple of months_ago , it ' s now my first point if call for any beauty product .

F	thank_you beauty_bay !
F	ordered an xbox games and a phone cover for my iphone .

F	i would definitely use shopto again !
F	!
F	i needed a new laptop as the one i had wasn ' t good enough for what i needed .

F	i got great advice from the online tech_support and from the forum .
F	great price and laptop .
F	delivered very quickly and the delivery service was great .

F	i had a problem with a driver for one of the adapters , this was also sorted very quickly and efficiently .
F	i have been recommending pc_specialist to family and friends .
F	i will_definitely you them again .
F	thank_you pc_specialist .
F	i ordered a bouquet a day before i needed them .
F	it was very straight_forward and helpful throughout the whole_process .
F	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
F	and once delivered i was notified that nobody was in to collect them , i was given a detail description as to where they had been left .
F	very impressed .
F	this is the second time i ' ve used serenata_flowers and i will_defiantly use them again .
F	good products for any occasion :)
F	i love what this organisation is doing for these dogs .
F	my dog was rescued by these_guys back in july_0000 .
F	she ' s the most perfect beautiful dog anyone could ever ask for .
F	i think there needs to be more originations set_up like this one .
F	thanks lucky tales dog rescue !

F	i love this game too much < 0
F	i must spend 00_% of my time on facebook .
F	they keep making all these changes but you get used to it .
F	hope they keep timeline though , its freaking awesome !
F	!
F	i hardly_ever shop here for myself but i always find gorgeous clothes for my boyfriend :_d on the odd_occasion you find some awesome bits and pieces too .
F	so glad i have one in my high_street :_p
F	i swear you can get just about anything on amazon :_d
F	i love primark stuff , it doesn ' t really last more_than a year but i change my style so much anyway it does ' t matter !
F	keep it up primark !
F	my partner brought me a pair of shoes from " new look " on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	he had also paid extra for next_day delivery !
F	i was very excited , so we both decided to stay in and wait for them .
F	they were due to arrive between_0am and 0pm today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
F	i checked the " hermes : parcel tracking " only to find that at
F	" 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt "
F	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
F	we got on to the phone to new look and they told us we had missed the courier , but how could we ?
F	we have been in all day !!
F	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
F	i am very angry and appalled at the way we have been treated and i hope never to do business with these couriers again once i finally receive my shoes !
F	quick and easy to use .
F	what a time saver :_d
F	i ' ve been playing since 0000 .
F	i ' ve made so many great friends on this site .
F	i love browsing the forums as well as using the client .
F	imvu has come along way since i first joined .
F	its a brilliant boredom killer .
F	kloe @ imvu .
F	i love play . com
F	i bought all my christmas_presents from them and received them all within 0 days of ordering .
F	their products are a great quality and value .
F	never been disappointed .
F	i always buy from them on a regular_basis .
F	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
F	naturally i was excited .
F	00 / 00 / 00 - i got a text from o0 stating i would receive my phone this day between_0am and 0pm .
F	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
F	at 00 : 00 i got another text from o0 saying i had missed the delivery , i looked at the online tracker and it said " no one to receive card left " at 00 : 00 .
F	i looked for a card and there wasn ' t one .
F	i called the courier straight_away and told them i ' ve been in all day and missed a days work , so it would of been impossible for me to of missed them .
F	the courier said " oh i ' m new to this round , and i don ' t know the area , so i didn ' t come ".
F	what a joke !
F	its your job ?
F	what kind of excuse is that ?
F	" erm i ' ll do it tomorrow " they spoke to me with no respect what so ever .
F	can ' t believe they didn ' t even have the courtesy to call me and let me know what was going on .
F	well thanks for your blatant incompetence !
F	you might be a slacker but i ' m not , another day thats going to be wasted !
F	00 / 00 / 00 - when i checked the tracker early this morning , i noticed that my phone wasn ' t actually anywhere , i had no_idea where it was .
F	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
F	eventually i got tired and gave o0 a call .
F	all of a sudden the courier text me saying they would deliver between 00pm and 0pm .
F	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
F	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
F	i will be going to watchdog .
F	on the upside , i love my new phone .
F	i ordered my dress from vponsale on the 00th_september , and it actually arrived today .
F	i was a little_nervous when i ordered my dress after i read some bad_reviews .
F	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
F	it fits like a glove , although it is a tiny_bit long .
F	other than that its fantastic , its great quality and looks_like a lot of care went into making it .
F	i can ' t fault this dress , i ' m so happy with it .
F	i just hope i do it justice when i wear it to my first ball :)
F	the customer_services was also very helpful .
F	thank_you vponsale .

F	number 0 in customer_satisfaction .
F	on point .
F	never a disappointment
F	proper impressed
F	great place to easily compare prices and reviews , payments very easy
F	great company - we arrived earlier_than arranged and they were there to meet us .
F	highly_recommend .
F	we really_enjoyed our time at dixos from the moment we arrived .
F	there is artwork everywhere and great attention to detail in the decor .
F	as a couple , we had a private_room with a balcony and the bathrooms were always quiet so it felt_like a hotel , but nicer and more homely .
F	it is quite a popular hostel and the other_travellers were very friendly and talkative - good atmosphere .
F	the staff are very helpful and recommended some great nearby restaurants - a casual one for lunch ( churrasqueira do infante ) and o mercado for a nice evening_meal - both were very good .
F	it is very near the river - great for a stroll , coffee or trips to the port houses ( a must whilst in porto !
F	).
F	really good product ranges and much cheaper_than the shops , even with postage taken into account .
F	product arrived quickly and as_described .
F	can ' t fault it !
F	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
F	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
F	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
F	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
F	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
F	0 days mega
F	would not hesitate in recommending .
F	excellent selection of sweets at a very competitive price .
F	excellent , very responsive customer_service .
F	frank answered all my questions and sent me the tracking_details for my parcel which arrived very quickly and great care had been taken in the packaging so in excellent condition .
F	the only reservation i have is whether i can not eat them before the party ...=)
F	ps0 disc reader fixed within an_hour !!
F	!
F	it took 0 & 0 / 0 weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn ' t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
F	i have got so many of my friends and family changing their everyday products which contain so many unrecognizable chemical ingredients in them to lush products .
F	it cuts down on the high concentration of chemicals within the body and helps the environment not only with less packaging but with great advise and help to recycle what little packaging you do use in the process .
F	i am so glad there is a shop like lush that has many branches widespread over the uk as there aren ' t many companies that are eco friendly and use natural products as well as working towards increasing awareness of issues and ethics across the world .
F	i was thoroughly_impressed by the speedy_delivery of the paper work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
F	i thoroughly_recommend them .
F	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
F	very reliable service .
F	bought the yoda outfit for my son .
F	he_loves it !
F	plenty of room so he ' ll get loads of wear out of it .
F	fantsatic service .
F	there was a slight fault with the box that the watch come in , possibly caused in transit .
F	as it was a present i rang the company and left a message .
F	they rang me back first thing the next morning and that day sent me a new box .
F	very helpful .
F	the product is great .
F	would definitely order from this company again .
F	and by liking them on facebook i received a further Â£ 0 off !
F	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
F	tracking_system is amazing too , you don ' t need to worry what ' s going on .
F	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don ' t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that ' s why there are so many negative_reviews .
F	once again i think it ' s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
F	great service , easy to understand .
F	and everything laid_out so you can see exactly_what ' s what .
F	love the catwalk feature - brilliant !
F	i ' ve used liberette for a few_years now .
F	it ' s not a real mccoy clothes site .
F	it ' s about gaining the best immitation item you can find at a lower_price ..
F	i accept that .
F	yes , their sizes are quite small .
F	i do wish they ` d get bigger sizes in ..
F	i ' d buy from them much more if they did .
F	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can ' t return it which i think is silly as well .
F	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
F	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
F	in all .. cheap , cheerful and quick delivery .
F	some quality compromised for a lower_price .
F	just don ' t break that seal !
F	!
F	saw the outfit i wanted ... a smiffys spider web dress !
F	ordered it right away .
F	they kept in touch with me about delivery and it ' s whereabouts throughout it being sent .
F	i could track it all the way .
F	it arrived 0 days_later , on time , and in a nice clean packet in my letter_box .
F	tried it on and it was true to its sizing .
F	looked great i got many compliments .
F	very happy with the service and price = )
F	never had any_problems or troubles ever .
F	very good .
F	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)
F	i have contacted the winerist for organising a short personalised trip for a group of 0 people in one of the wine regions of france .
F	in the beggining we asked for a wine tour with an accent on architecture , as we wanted to see as many chateaux as possible in 0 days .
F	tatiana recommended the loire valley and we loved it .
F	everything was very well_organised , we followed all of their advise and were 000_% satisfied .
F	tatiana was great
F	i use transferwise monthly to move my pension from uk sterling to euros in cyprus and it ' s easy to do on line with the money arriving in 0 days .
F	great .
F	easy trasaction , free next_day delivery and 0euro better_than the post_office .
F	excellent service and will be even easier next time now details are logged in .
F	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly Â£_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
F	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
F	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from_hong_kong .
F	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
F	we got a bundle including cleaning kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
F	the only thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
F	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
F	!
F	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
F	i bought tickets to monty python at the o0 a few_days before the show .
F	seatwave was ideal as they offered a collection service right next to the o0 , which is great when you are buying at short_notice or are worried_about receiving tickets in time .
F	if this hadn ' t been offered i probably wouldn ' t have been able to go as i would have been too worried_about the tickets not arriving in time .
F	after_reading some negative_reviews of seatwave i was really worried that the tickets would not be there , or would be fake , as had happened to some people .
F	however this was completely unfounded - i collected the tickets from the collection point with no issues , there were no queues and the person working there was extremely friendly and polite .
F	based on my experience i would recommend that seatwave are a safe and reliable source of tickets .
F	i ' m really glad i used them and would do so again .
F	ps monty python were also amazing !
F	i ' ve been using topcashback for about a year , and it ' s been fantastic .
F	i was a bit_sceptical at first about getting cashback for nothing , but now i never buy or do anything online without checking it first .
F	i ' ve earnt about Â£_000 so far , just for shopping for things i was going to buy anyway , or using things like their car_insurance search_engine ( which i ' ve actually found to be one of the best for finding me the cheapest quotes ).
F	even if you don ' t shop online very much , just using it for essentials or one - offs like car or home insurance , buying phones , booking holidays etc , get ' s you so much money back .
F	i think everyone should be on it , there ' s literally no reason not to be !
F	... like i did .
F	my husband and i planned a trip and spent 0 hours on this website .
F	there are so many hostels , hotels , b_& bs , etc .
F	on this site with all the information you want and need .
F	i loved the map_feature so we could see which hostel was closest to where we wanted to be .
F	combine that with the ability to set a price range and filter out low - rated places we found the perfect place for us quickly .
F	but that didn ' t stop us from browsing around at other great deals and hotels way out of our price range .
F	i ' ll definitely use this site again .
F	like the price and we got a free gift !
F	now a repeat customer !
F	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone_looking to build a system for high performance at competitive_prices .
F	i got all that i wanted within my budget and i am pleased with the system .
F	i also got next_day delivery free of charge which i was very pleased about and was also happy that i received a phone call telling_me that my system was ready and when i could expect it to arrive .
F	excellent service , would definitely use again .
F	thank_you ginger0 .
F	excellent flight .
F	great staff
F	great chioce , good advice
F	value for money .
F	great staff
F	great advice in shop , patience and good services over the phone
F	excellent company .
F	quick delivery , had no_problems whatsoever .
F	highly_recommend to everyone .
F	found the link to their website through trivago listed at Â£_00 .
F	the link let me click " book " and enter all my details .
F	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at Â£_000 .
F	look on their facebook_page and many have had trouble with hotels not having the reservation or them taking money twice from their account .
F	stay_away !
F	fantastic service , glasses are at great value and was very easy to order .
F	delivery was quick , packaging was good , product was enjoyed !
F	the pass is amazing .
F	you can go to loads of sites around london using the pass and most of the time we didn ' t have to queue .
F	however , i would recommend doing your homework first and writing an itinery of the places you want to see as once the card is activated , no matter what time of day , that is classed_as your first day and then its consecutive .
F	the guide book you get with it is great .
F	i loved the card so much that i have bought the parispass as that is our city break this year .
F	i was really impressed with private_kilimanjaro from start to finish .
F	from meeting the lead guide at the hotel right to way through the climb , all the team were professional , encouraging and helpful with anything that was causing you a problem .
F	they ensured they did everthing possible to make the whole experience as enjoyable as possible - passing our water bottles , adjusting our rucksacs to make_sure they fitted_perfectly and motivating us when we started to suffer .
F	they made sure our group walked together , setting a comfortable and realistic ' pole pole ' pace , this was great for morale and enabled us to get the know each other better and therefore be there for each other on the final day .
F	the whole team , including the porters , chef and guides were polite and smiled all the way through .
F	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
F	the food was always tasty , so even when your appetite started to go with the altitude you could always manage something .
F	they even went out of their way to cook extra chips , which had gone down a huge success !
F	after summiting we were met half way back to the camp by the waiters with orange juice .
F	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .
F	as we walked we saw other groups who ' s guide was well ahead of them and people struggling with an injury .
F	the guides with private_kilimanjaro were with us every_step of the way and supported us physically and mentally .
F	our lead guide didn ' t bombard us with information , but discussed what was needed at the right time enabling us to enjoy the moments on the mountain .
F	every day had challenges but the whole team worked together so well these challenges seemed so much_easier .... so many amazing memories to take home with me thank_you so much to everyone at private kilimajaro for giving me the best experience !
F	bought 0 doors on 00st october which were delivered on 0th_november - 0 of which were fine .
F	however , one door was damaged in transit on one corner and the same door was faulty on another corner with part of the door not glued up properly .
F	door - deals are refusing to repair the damage or replace the door !!
F	!
F	bought a pair of glasses including date and time of ordering transaction date : 0000 - 00 - 00 00 : 00 : 00 , i was contacted twice for sending my id documentation , when i did after i recieved only 0 email_saying i should recieve my item within 00 to 00 days but now its months gone and havent recieved anything .... stay_away from these fraudesters and rippers , never recommended simply if they dont get back within 00_hrs than i will be contacting my bank and send chargeback ..
F	always find my best deals on flights , hotels and services .
F	very convenient and well_priced .
F	when in ny , for four_months tried to top up and every time calling 000 freenumber , got the same message " have not enough founds to connect my call ", for four_months calling the company to resolve this issue and nothing was ever done .
F	the roaming rates are outrageous .
F	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
F	the worst experience of the service and money value !
F	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom ' s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 Â£ at checkout .
F	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
F	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
F	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
F	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don ' t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
F	this company is not to trust .
F	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty ' s and coated me 00 Â£ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
F	!
F	i spoke to the policy store to get advice and everyone there was so helpful and friendly .
F	we ordered personalised thank_you cards for my son ' s first birthday .
F	they are lovely .
F	ordered the item on the thursday and was delivered on the friday of the next_day !!!
F	i had one very happy little_boy !
F	would most definitely use again !
F	and the item purchased was Â£ 0 cheaper_than other_retailers in the high_street !
F	and Â£ 0 cheaper_than amazon with faster shipping .
F	a trusted seller
F	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
F	00 years_ago i moved in with my partner who decided that we needed a telephone and internet access , we had everything plumbed in so to speak and off the line went no issues until we got a bill for over Â£_000 , it included a line fitting which we shouldn ' t have paid and telephone_calls to numbers that we had never_heard of ... bt would not back down that the numbers were nothing to do with us and we had to pay the bill which took over 0 years !!!
F	to sort out , we then left bt ...... 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it ...
F	it didn ' t work , they then said that there was not a line to the property and connected a new one giving us a new area code ( which we told them was not in our area ), this line did not work it was the wrong area code !!!
F	omg suprise_suprise !
F	they then came in a did loads of checks and told us that we had changed something in the house that had corrupted the line !!! what !!
F	!, they proceeded to fix it and gave us another telephone_number , guess_what wrong area code !
F	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house ... ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look_into what the hell was going on ) we went 0 months without a phone line but this wasn ' t the issue ...
F	i will_continue ....
F	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
F	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges ... of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
F	they didnt have a clue why i was complaining , they couldn ' t sort out the bills and worse of all couldn ' t sort out the line issues as there wasn ' t one apparantly this went on for a whole year until our contract finally expired and we were able to change supplier .
F	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over Â£_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection ..... we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent ... its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them ...
F	review closure .....
F	complete incompetent staff from the call_centre to the engineers , they have no clue_what they are doing and pass the buck on to their customers !!!
F	!
F	never again will i use them for anything !
F	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has been difficult .
F	sainsbury ' s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
F	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
F	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
F	products are not always the cheapest however are great quality and easily replacable if they do not meet my standards .
F	the nectar card is great ...
F	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over Â£_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury ' s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don ' t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury ' s !
F	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
F	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don ' t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
F	although you can help yourself here , make_sure you scan everything that goes in your trolley or basket , the more sainsbury ' s can trust you with your shopping the less likely you will get re - scans !
F	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury ' s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
F	all in all a great all_round supermarket !
F	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
F	our small business relies on fast_shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
F	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
F	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
F	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
F	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
F	as if it takes this long .
F	and my customer has no evidence that i ' ve even tried to send it .
F	i ' ve been in tears trying to explain that it ' s not my fault .
F	except it is .
F	i chose my hermes .
F	i suck
F	seriously poor service .
F	p0g knew this was important and they charged over Â£_00 for next_day service .
F	on tuesday .
F	wasn ' t collected until thursday and now on monday , it ' s still not their .
F	their customer_service staff have no clue .
F	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
F	supplement wearhouse is one of the best sites for researching as well as purchasing supplements for your workout_needs .
F	not only is it easy to navigate , it is consistently the lowest priced supplement webpage around .
F	it ' s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
F	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor swift in concert at the o0 ...
F	this was impossible on ticketmaster as they sold out ridiculously quickly .
F	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
F	brilliant service , quite expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
F	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
F	!
F	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
F	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
F	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
F	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
F	they don ' t quite have the biggest_selection around , but it ' s a nice shop with a reliable service and great prices .
F	i ' d say it ' s worth a browse .
F	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
F	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
F	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
F	delivery is super_quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0 days '.
F	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
F	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will_definitely use this service again .
F	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
F	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
F	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
F	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
F	they don ' t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
F	if i could give cultpens more_than 0_stars , i would .
F	one of the best online stores i ' ve used !
F	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0 days ) and an easy to use website .
F	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i ' m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
F	the products i ' ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
F	would use this website again , once i run out of supplies .
F	headphones never came after more_than a month .
F	emailed them 0 times in that month and recieved automated replies telling_me to wait longer .
F	finally , after 0 weeks_later , they said they ' ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
F	a week_later and i still_haven ' t recieved this form !
F	0 weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
F	the rest of the orders i ' ve made have taken longer_than a week or two to arrive .
F	terrible service !
F	use amazon !
F	reliable , quick delivery .
F	very easy to personalized your own card .
F	the selection of cards are fun and quirky too .
F	highly_recommended !
F	the quality of the materials they use is rather ... questionable .
F	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell off after one day .
F	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i ' ve had to sow them back into place !
F	despite this , i ' m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
F	i ' d hope they would have prove me wrong though .
F	i purchased these glasses on the 00th_feb and guess_what ....
F	still_haven ' t received them so i though i would send them an e_- mail to find out where my glasses were .
F	they said that payment has never been sent and to re - sent the Â£_000 again !!!
F	shocked !!
F	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
F	payment was sent and completed the day i placed the order .
F	be very aware !!!
F	scam !!!
F	!
F	easy to use site , great range of products although not everything i wanted was on the site , fab prices , great service i would recommend to others and will buy from them again x
F	i was very skeptical when my friend told me about this website and all the great deals .
F	i looked it up today and found every product i have been doing research on .
F	the deals the have on the website were beyond anything i have ever_seen .
F	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
F	i am exstatic when i see a product i have heard about and they have a promotion on it .
F	i can always find something to help boost my results and the description they give help me choose the correct ones without any doubts .
F	i will be back with more friends for more purchases !
F	house_network were great all_round .
F	the price was fantastic , saving us about Â£ 0000 on estate_agent fees .
F	they took lots of excellent photos of every room , all making the house look great .
F	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
F	they sent us statistics regularly .
F	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
F	we chose house_network after viewing a property they were marketing as we found them cery helpful .
F	overall we would definately_recommend them for the price and service .
F	i would definitely_recommend chillisauce .
F	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
F	they provided us with a really enjoyable hen_party
F	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
F	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
F	you have made 0 people very happy this christmas .
F	thank_you so much
F	sarah xx
F	would definitely_recommend using this company to anyone .
F	product was in excellent condition and arrived the next_day as promised .
F	will be using this service again
F	no_complaints .
F	would use again .
F	posted phone on the thursday , received money in my bank by tuesday .
F	very good service and very easy to use .
F	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
F	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos card has been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
F	keep up the good work !
F	!
F	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper work and the car was mine .
F	i selected a golf on the choice menu and was adviced i will get a golf or a similar car .
F	instead i got an old megan reno , a very long car which i am not used to driving .
F	i had to drive for 000_miles to get to my destination .
F	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
F	my dad told me that car shakes due to unbalanced tyres .
F	i was expecting a newer car that is easy and comfortable to drive .
F	wouldn ' t use this company again
F	great service , quick delivery and all for a very affordable price !
F	i have never written a review for anything before but i honestly am so pleased with my service and product .
F	i am 0 and a half months pregnant and have just bought a new mattress .
F	it ' s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
F	i decided to order a memory_foam topper and after searching the net found zleeps to be the cheapest .
F	i ordered a silver topper it came within 0 working_days and i got two free memory_foam pillows !
F	very pleased very comfy .
F	don ' t be put off by bad_reviews these people were either very unlucky or the reviews are fake .
F	i am going to be recommending this site to friends and family
F	boohoo from the start of my order were fantastic , great communication_throughout and all their products were a great price .
F	the only_suggestion to customers would be is if you are in a rush for your outfit to pay extra for delivery as standard delivery does take a while .
F	i had seen a number of isofix car seats on the market and struggled to make a decison .
F	i then came_across the britax isofix seat on precious_little one and read the customer reviews and product specification .
F	it was high in the safety ratings and also has a recline feature .
F	the car_seat when it came was high_quality and was dispatched very quickly .
F	as always great quality & service provided by precious_little one .
F	" enormously disappointing .
F	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
F	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
F	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
F	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
F	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
F	again there was no explanation .
F	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
F	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
F	now , i don ' t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that ' s a good thing and in everybody ' s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
F	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
F	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
F	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
F	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone who is simply trying to buy their products ."
F	the item was just as expected , and arrived in great condition and super_fast .
F	i would recomend to anyone .
F	this site is very user_friendly , easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , as well as lots of information on each hostel .
F	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
F	fast dispatch , item exactly as_described , great price !!!
F	!
F	i needed a wetsuit and had found the site link on an info board down at the lakes where my friends jetski .
F	i found the website very easy to use and found a suitable wetsuit at an extremely reasonable_price within about 0 minutes of looking .
F	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
F	i was so stoked and it fit me perfectly .
F	now anything i need for the water i ' ll be coming here first !
F	need some booties next :)
F	it can be a struggle finding the perfectly fitting frame and sending something away to be framed can take an age .
F	then l found this site .
F	with a range of different frames and whatever size you want , with a range of mounts , it was really simple .
F	all l had to do was measure the item l wanted framed , pick the size and dimensions of mount and they sort the size of frame for it .
F	couple days for it to be delivered .
F	will be using them again .
F	the item l ordered from here arrived quickly and was brilliant quality .
F	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
F	the items l ordered arrived quickly and were great quality .
F	also delivery was well_packed to ensure little chance of damages - other_companies should take note !
F	really impressed with them and will_definitely be using them again .
F	i had been needing a new watch strap for a while but l really wanted to get the right one to go with the model of my watch .
F	i had been struggling to find it until l came_across babla ' s .
F	they didn ' t have the strap on their site but had an option to put in my make and model of watch and they would source the strap for me .
F	it took them no time at all to find the correct strap and have it sent out to me .
F	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
F	they are ok
F	transfer from halifax to bv takes minutes
F	i suspect they have automated_system for deposits , which is nice , not like in goldmoney . com when you wait for days
F	did some withdrawal months_ago , no problem , fast and good
F	fees per_month range from 0 usd to 0 usd for each metal
F	overall they are ok
F	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities
F	and only deal with one main bank_account address
F	so all ins and outs are fixed to main acc
F	thinking , since uk gov taxes silver 00_% vat , is it not a bad idea to have silver in uk vaults ?
F	have some , and worry_about thieving uk gov
F	i am a massive fan of asos and have been for years now .
F	it ' s such a pleasure using their site ; really easy to navigate and ( being a picky girl ) i love the search and filter functions .
F	my favourite part is most_likely the saved items page , this has been so handy since it was introduced i really hope it stays as i now find every site that doesn ' t have this to be quite a pain .
F	i don ' t often return things as sizing is generally spot on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
F	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
F	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
F	on another occasion a product turned_up and had a defect so i emailed customer_services , then shortly_after received a response offering compensation ( part refund ) so i was really chuffed to have a resolution , and a positive one !
F	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
F	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who asks about selling a phone .
F	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
F	00 out of 00
F	when looking around for a case for my samsung note 0 , there were many available on ebay but none actually stated they were for a note so didn ' t want to buy just in case .
F	i came_across this website and the description matched exactly_what i was looking for .
F	purple is my favourite colour and delivery was when it was expected .
F	i ' m very happy with the service that i received and the product i purchased !
F	they were great !
F	they always came_across very professionally , friendly and helpful .
F	i didn ' t feel under pressure .
F	i ' ve used gear0music loads of times and pretty_much rebuilt my drum_kit with the things i ' ve bought off them .
F	my cymbals were always immaculate when they arrived and even_though all the pieces of bubble_wrap and cardboard were a pain to get_rid of , it was well worth it .
F	staff were very friendly when i rang them up with a query and they emailed me everything i needed to know within minutes !
F	i ' m actually due a delivery today so as long as it turns up , 0 / 0 every time :)
F	after applying online , i received my postage bag the next_day , sent my phone off and then received my cash 0 days_later !
F	highly_recommend this website .
F	this is the second time i ' ve used mazuma_mobile and will_definately do so again !
F	i had a great experience buying my prom dress .
F	it was very easy to look for and purchase the dress .
F	i loved it ! i love prdress !!
F	!
F	they are amazing , very fast and friendly .. easy to add funds to your account and make calls to any country .
F	i would advise_anyone to use dialtosave .
F	this is my second purchase with procook and again another great puchase .
F	i have only ever bought knives from here but my first set have been excellent and all my visitors to my kitchen comment on them .
F	this set is a gift for my mum and i am sure she will not be disappointed !
F	!
F	printerland ' s service was excellent !
F	they offered next_day delivery and they arrived as promised .
F	the toners we ordered are great value for money .
F	we will be placing orders again and i would certainly recommend to others .
F	i am extremely happy with the service provided by this company .
F	my item was dispatched very quickly and i was kept_updated about its location every_step of the way .
F	thank_you very much for such a professional service .
F	i have already_recommended this company to others and will_continue to do so !
F	i bought a pair of shape ups for Â£_00 less_than rrp and they arrived the next_day .
F	this was the first time i shopped at fitness footwear .
F	i ' m very happy and will buy from them again .
F	i waited 0 weeks only to receive the wrong book .
F	i had to call them up and arrange for another to be sent out , which took another 0 weeks .
F	i had to return the book they sent in error at my own cost , which i wasn ' t happy about , because it what they sent me was a hardback and it weighed a lot .
F	but , this is the only time i ' ve had problems with them .
F	when ordering dvds they ' re brilliant .
F	enromous range , great prices and fast delivery for when you need a pair of pretty boots urgently .
F	i couldn ' t ask for more from an online shop .
F	easy to find what i wanted , place and order and my boots arrived the next_day !
F	i ' ve been using different e liquids for a while but struggled to find ones that actually have a proper taste and vape .
F	these were awesome and will_definitely be buying more in the future .
F	ordered a washing_machine 0 weeks_ago !
F	it still has not arrived !
F	i have been constantly fobbed_off by the sales staff !
F	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
F	actually turned_up at the house without the washing_machine !
F	i am now 00 weeks pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0 weeks because of this company !
F	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but Â£_00 cheaper !
F	will i ever get this washer ?
F	who_knows ?
F	i think they should offer more swagbucks for everything you do .
F	i mean , i never watch those videos , and i bet no one else does either , but it takes nearly 00_minutes to earn 0 swagbucks by ' watching ' them , and 000 = Â£ 0 .
F	and i ' m not a geek and i wouldn ' t click through ads hundreds of times just to earn some pocket money .
F	think about it .
F	conclusion : they really should be more generous on the amount of swagbucks awarded , or lower the price of the gift cards .
F	i purchased a nikon_d0000 ( with a battery and charger ) in so called ' mint -' condition , from mpb_photographic for Â£_000 . 00 , but was a bit_nervous as this was the first 0nd_hand item i had bought .
F	i requested it for monday , and it arrived on monday at about 00 : 00 .
F	i couldn ' t believe someone had used it , in fact , i inspected the dslr for any sign of light use and could not find any , anywhere !
F	the camera was in better condition than if i bought it off amazon for Â£_000_+ extra in new condition !
F	the customer_service was fantastic ; the phone staff where friendly and helpful .
F	best camera shopping website for the uk !
F	i will_definitely be shopping here again !
F	great service from andy , and very easy to arrange over the net .
F	no waiting around in a garage - you can do it in the comfort of your own home .
F	i will_definitely_recommend !
F	great website .
F	i can now express my feelings and tell others about my experience about different shope i have bought with !
F	thanks trustpilot !
F	love you guys !
F	all i can say
F	really happy with all the items i bought , price paid , communication and packaging .
F	would use again
F	i placed an order on 00st november which i thought would be plenty of time for christmas .
F	nothing turned_up after 0 weeks so i emailed them .
F	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
F	gave them the benefit of the doubt and left it another week .
F	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn ' t work ).
F	after a few more days they hadn ' t replied so i raised a dispute through paypal .
F	they put a reply on the paypal_dispute pretty quickly but it was quite rude , no apology just the standard ' this has been dispatched , we will investigate , we still give you the chance to cancel this dispute etc etc '.
F	they contacted me again today through paypal saying ' please confirm you have received the goods ' - sorry , all i can confirm is that i ' ve paid Â£_00 for absolutely nothing !
F	don ' t order from these people !
F	!
F	i had a bespoke wedding_ring made to fit my engagement_ring as it ' s an odd shape .
F	it took just two days to receive the design for my ring , then 0 week for it to arrive in the shop for me to collect ( home delivery is an option ).
F	when i went to collect my rings i was surprised to see that my engagement_ring had been cleaned and was looking as good as new again .
F	the presentation of my wedding_ring was amazing too , a smart box inside a cute presentation_box inside a lovely bag whereas i was just expecting a ring box .
F	the service i received in store at bluewater was also fantastic .
F	colouring pages and pencils were supplied so i could really focus on getting my ideas . across on how i want my ring to be .
F	the staff were friendly at all times .
F	i ' ll be recommending the store to everyone i know !
F	thank_you very much .
F	the ordering_process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
F	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over Â£_000 .
F	i would rather go to another company or better still buy something else .
F	the service is completely unhelpful , rude and incompetent .
F	would not shop here again nor recommend to anyone .
F	if you are looking for a cheap nightstay but you are not too self confident in terms of your orientation and organisation skills , hostelbooker will help you , it s very comfortable to chose time and place on their page and they will you show wide offer , all presented in convenient form , and setting the matter after your choice takes honestly 0 min . if it seems that something happen and you could call off your travel , you can choose the option of payment protection when you are booking , so that your 00_% paid at booking will turn to another booking . thats a good possibilty , because the planned travel is never 000_% sure , but undoubtly i will_continue my booking with hostelbooker so my money stay there like in bank . and another matter , once my credit_card wasn t valid , they asked the hostel s manager to let me pay all at arriving , that was really nice of them and solved my problem in this case
F	and they also remind you about the travel , giving details and that helps a lot
F	i ve used that service many_times and they never let me down
F	look fantastic had everything i wanted to buy at a great price and the website was extremely user_friendly .
F	the reviews also helped to inform my decision on my purchases - just a shame p_& p wasnt included in the price .
F	very pleased with the product , was as_described .
F	fast delivery .
F	thankyou
F	everything i order from here always arrives in great shape .
F	i have ordered certain products from other_websites that arrive with water_damage or other issues .
F	never had a problem with supplement_warehouse !
F	i love hostelbookers because when you compare the same hotel or hostel on 0 other different sites , hostelbookers always gets you the best fares !
F	it ' s easy , clear and pretty quick .
F	have been using it for years !
F	i sent my phone to mazuma on saturday_morning and the money as quoted was in my account for monday_afternoon .
F	excellent , honest and reliable service , will recommend to friends and would use again !!
F	!
F	the costume is fantastic quality got here faster then expected and i would defiantly use the sight again and recommend it to a friend .
F	great job .
F	we were in need of 0 new tyres and found this site after they emailed us with a price compare option .
F	the tyres were very easy to view and order online , and when i phoned to speak to a member of the sales_team , the phone was answered_quickly and the guy i spoke to was very friendly , helpful , and knowledgeable .
F	i ' m always a bit_wary buying expensive items online from a company i know nothing about , but i will most definitely use them again when the tyres on our other car need replacing .
F	so much cheaper_than we were quoted by local garages .
F	i can ' t praise them enough !!
F	!
F	glasses arrived this morning , delighted with them .
F	pleased with the overall service and quality of the products .
F	particularly valued the free home_trial service which i used twice because none of the first set i selected suited me .
F	would definitely_recommend and will use again in the future .
F	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .
F	still unknown_reason_why i didn ' t get my collection today , so contacted customer_service on live_chat , and i was speaking to matthew , who quickly sort it out and re - booked my collection for next_day .
F	he was very polite and apologised for no show of the courier .
F	unfortunately my parcel will be delayed and have to wait another day at home with my fingers_crossed that they will show to collect it .
F	super promotions and fantastic products to buy :) thank_you
F	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
F	their reminder emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
F	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
F	i explained i was only in st tropez for 0 days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
F	my suitcase arrived the next_day and i received a call saying i would have to pick it up from nice airport - st tropez is 0 hrs from there .
F	nearly all other airlines will deliver your case to you if they lose it but not jet 0 .
F	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
F	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
F	when i arrived at the airport i found my suitcase was damaged and is no_longer usable - it was brand_new .
F	i wrote a letter of complaint when i got home asking to be reimbursed for the expense and the response was ' no chance '!
F	i would never fly with them again and i would strongly_recommend avoiding this airline at all costs .
F	as it is so easy to use i always do my booking and shopping online if i can now .
F	it takes an extra 00 seconds to go through the website and in 0 months i ' ve already claimed almost Â£_00 .
F	i even di my car_insurance through them .
F	i shopped arund and found the best deal , then went through top cash back and saved even more !
F	i had a lady_called claire help within the booking team and she could not have been more helpful .
F	i requirements changed daily until booking but nothing was to much_trouble .
F	it was so nice and refreshing to have so much help .
F	would highly_recommend this company and use it again in the future .
F	next_day delivery for a good cost ( only Â£ 0 . 00 not Â£ 0 or Â£ 0 ) and the jacket i bought cheaper_than other_websites .
F	learn ' t so much .
F	i was unsure at first , whether to put my tv on the wall , as i had always had it up the corner on a stand .
F	my lounge isn ' t the biggest in the world , and every time i moved my furniture around i always felt_like the biggest corner in my room was sucked up by my tv .
F	i rang home av , and spoke to ian , i told him my worries and concerns , he listened and gave me helpful advice .
F	i didn ' t feel pushed or like he was trying to sell me anything .
F	i arranged a time for him to come out and show me where he thought would be best for my tv to be mounted , and asked for a quote .
F	working full time , i didn ' t think he would want to come out on an evening , but he was flexible and fit around me .
F	happy with the quote , i asked him when he could do it .
F	just 0 days_later , ian & jamie returned to hang my tv on the wall .
F	one word describes how it looks - amazing !
F	!
F	i am so happy , and they even hoovered up after themselves .
F	thanks home av , i will_definitely be recommending you !!
F	all the best for your future .
F	i really_appreciate to use the dial to save service as it provide me lots of facilities to get in touch with my relatives .
F	best aerline to go in a holyday trip
F	is the easiest_way to find your perfect holiday
F	is the easiest and fastest way to shop
F	tesco is the best food shop , the best prices end the food is very fresh .
F	a greate companay , greate mobile deals !
F	thank to mazuma_mobile , it was a greate experience , mazuma help me u sell my old_phones at a gtreate value . thanks
F	i have been using printing . com for about 0 years now and i cannot thank enough for their fast and high_quality service .
F	i recommend you guys to people all the time !
F	thanks .
F	in short , terrible network_coverage , terrible pushy rude and sometimes unintelligable customer_service from call_centre and nearly impossible to get unlock code and pac codes from .
F	thanks 0 - i have been without a mobile for a week !!!
F	!
F	i ' ve booked a hen_night through a company before and wasn ' t verly pleased with the outcome of the night so was a little_apprehensive at 0st about booking through a company again but due to the limited time i had to book s ' thing as it was pretty last_minute i decided to investigate a little .
F	originally when i put my options into the boxes at the beginning i went all out to see what the prices would end up at , it was a little expensive but after_speaking with mike agar (??)
F	a consultant with hen_heaven who was extremely_helpful , we managed to get it to a price i thought people could afford and would still hopefully be a great night out .
F	unfortunately our hen who is australian was stuck in oz due to visa problems and some of the guests decided not to come , but 0 of us went along and made the best of it .
F	so manchester here we came ..... in the afternoon we did a cocktail_making session which was so much fun and we managed to drink enough for everyone that should ' ve been there .
F	we didn ' t know we were getting nibbles at the end of it which was an added_bonus to soak up some of the alcohol .
F	the meal and club_entry in the evening was at tiger_tiger which was fab .
F	tiger_tiger has 0 floors to it so altho we had to be in there before 00pm to get our free entry it didn ' t really matter cos it was already quite busy and we spent most of the evening in the 00 ' s / 00 ' s section .
F	the hotel was right in the centre of everywhere we needed to be so we saved money on taxi fares and it was very comfortable .
F	the only_downside to the evening was that in tiger_tiger they questioned us about the 0 complimentary bottles of champagne we were to receive and also about the payment at the end , they accused us of trying to walk out without paying so i had to keep showing them the email from hen_heaven proving that we were to get the bottles and that everything was paid for which was a little embarrassing but overall we had a great night .
F	like i said before i was a little_apprehensive_about booking through a company again but hen_heaven made things so easy that when the hen eventually gets over here i may well be booking through them again .....
F	i cannot_fault anything from this company .
F	we first bought a sideboard and a telephone table .
F	then afterwards we went back for a table , mirror and bookcase !!
F	the quality of the furniture is next to none and the price is even better compared to other oak_furniture i ' ve seen .
F	everything from service in store to the delivery men where fantastic !!!!
F	thank_you !!
F	it makes a change to see excellent customer_service like this !!
F	!
F	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
F	despite the short_notice i got great value tickets , delivered well in time for the show .
F	i have used them many_times before and never once had a problem with tickets or using the site which i personally find clear and easy to use .
F	i would strongly_recommend viagogo , especially for when looking for last_minute tickets .
F	we purchased little life toddler reins in fairy wings style .
F	my daughter absolutly loves the design as she feels she has her own bag instead of wearing reins .
F	the zip compartment is just right for a small teddy and a cup of juice .
F	the strap is strong and not too long .
F	the delivery was quick and all in all a wonderful service .
F	we are very happy and will shop with coz mole again .
F	[_name ] made sending my parcel so easy .
F	even when i got it wrong , [_name ] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
F	a credit to your company !
F	!
F	simple to use and search , once booked i get a full email with the details i need .... simple
F	i spoke to sam , she was so helpful and friendly .
F	i couldn ' t have asked for better service .
F	she kept in touch and checked everything was okay from start to finish .
F	thanks a lot .
F	after all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought id try out aldi paisley ( fulbar road ) scotland for the family shop .
F	going round the products are good , good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket , even a few brand_names .
F	however , get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing .
F	woman sat like a robot , didnt offer to help even_though struggling with a toddler .
F	was sighing as things started to pile up at one side .
F	i hadnt even finished paying and she was scanning the next persons products .
F	she was on to the next after that before i had my bags up .
F	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
F	i will not be shopping here again , ever .
F	if people worked like that in any other supermarket they ' d be sacked .
F	horrible dire faced woman .
F	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading reviews .
F	very disappointed .
F	i ordered some ghd straighteners on sunday , as my old ones decided to stop working suddenly .
F	i ordered new ones with beautycow as they had the ones i wanted for the cheapest price .
F	i received them today ( wednesday ).... quick and painless !
F	thank_you beautycow for your excellent price and service .... i finally have straight hair again !
F	i just completed a photoshop cs0 and web_design course with e_- careers , it taught me a lot and i will keep in mind e_- careers if i want to do a course again .
F	kirsten slater
F	i purchased a hair dryer .
F	i Â´ ve choosen the uk standard delivery and the item arrived next_day .
F	excellent timming !
F	the package was good and the product was as drescribed on the web_site .
F	i probably will purchase with this company again .
F	i found the site very easy to use , especially the pay_pal option which made checkout very fast .
F	i ordered a poster for my daughter and i was so pleased with the result .
F	communication was excellent and they also went the extra_mile by offering help and advice .
F	before the poster arrived a was a little concerned_about what the quality would be as the poster was so cheap !
F	however when it arrived in its secure tube it was fantastic !
F	will_definitely use again .
F	i bought a wowcher for a full head of human hair_extensions in march .
F	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
F	i arranged an_appointment for 0 weeks_later to have a full head of micro loop extensions fitted .
F	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
F	thank_god !!!
F	i was told i couldn ' t have my extensions fitted as i was so late and would have to rearrange .
F	i was asked what sort of extensions i was having and when i said micro loops i was told they didn ' t do these anymore and i ' d have to either have them glued or sewn in .
F	i don ' t want either of these methods due to the damage they do to your hair which is why i bought a deal for the micro loops .
F	i contacted_wowcher for a refund 0 weeks_ago and the only response i have received is a copy of the email they sent to the salon 0 days_later .
F	i contacted them again last_week to ask for some indication of when they issue might be resolved and i ' ve heard_nothing .
F	i ' ve emailed them this morning with ' trust ' as the subject , but as yet i have no reply .
F	i am really disappointed with the level of customer_service .
F	the maternity bras i have purchased are fantastic .
F	i have never had an issue with tesco .
F	they are taking over but a wrose complany could be dominating the uk !
F	i always buy my clothes online with the good value clothes that i love .
F	i always love that i can get free delivery and pick the items up from store !
F	love tesco :)
F	i have always used paypal and i have accepted certain charges but now whenever i sell items on ebay i have to pay a large percentage to paypal :( most items i sell don ' t sell for much anyway !
F	i ' d accept it , even if it was a much lower percent of the income .
F	maybe more simelar to ebay charges which averages around 00p for me for an item that i sell for Â£ 0 .
F	i love fb and i use it constantly .
F	it does everything i need it to and it doesnt need to keep changing to be like other_websites !
F	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
F	the simplicity was what separated it and made it stand out from the other social network websites !
F	i have bought 0 products now from selectspecs . com and i have been very pleased with each product .
F	perscription glasses for Â£ 0 each !
F	and i think that included delievery .
F	probikeshop is a good market !
F	recomended !
F	brilliant order arrived in less_than 00_hours
F	not just competitively_priced they were straight to notice i ' d mis_- ordered a prescription item and got in touch .
F	they resolved it instantly and i even received my order the next_day ( i placed the order mid - afternoon ).
F	wow wow wow !
F	i will be back !
F	i love twitter , and unlike_other social_media it is so simple to get your head around and whilst it evolves it doesn ' t change massively so it ' s easy to keep on top of !
F	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare ... talk about blowing your own trumpet .
F	i guess you get what you pay for !
F	that ' s why i ' ve since flown with easyjet or monarch !
F	so simple to upload videos !
F	facebook and i are best friends !
F	i use it to promote my business as well as being_able to maintain a private profile to keep up with friends !
F	always prompt to respond and go above and beyond other_companies .
F	despite allowing any resolution images to be loaded that look brilliant on the screen there is no quality_control at goodprint so my business_cards came to me blurry on one side and fab on the other !
F	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn ' t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
F	when i contacted customer_service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
F	- thank_you for your response goodprint , i was not advised on this offer at the time of my phonecall , had i been i would have felt a lot less let_down by your company .
F	i have since had my cards printed elsewhere but i do appreciate the response .
F	tried to order from vet medic and set_up an account .
F	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do business .
F	thus i did not receive emails when they queried my order , amongst the problems ( generated by them ) was the fact that the image of my vet prescription did not upload .
F	i definitely uploaded this when i ordered and inotice other people have had the same problem .
F	despite this , they took the money from my account and made no further effort to contact me , even_though they could have worked out the email address they used did not match the email and account details i provided .
F	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
F	i also found they were rude and defensive , everything was my fault rather_than theirs !
F	i asked for a refund which they promptly processed .
F	i will never order from vet - medic again , best avoided if you appreciate good customer_service and politeness when things go_wrong !
F	i am an_avid trollbead collector and i buy all my charms from identity .
F	every time i receive fantastic customer_service and they have a vast_range of charms to choose from .
F	i would definitely reccommend a visit !
F	!
F	searched for hostels in aberdeenshire and this was really simple to find and book .
F	have used hostelbookers in the past and stayed in some good quality hostels .
F	helpful not to have to pay the full_amount up front .
F	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
F	after i finished my job in aus , i started to travel to east asia by myself .
F	so i had to stay in hostel .
F	i need booking site which give me fully information about hostel .
F	hostelbookers is the one gave me all of information about hostel .
F	even when i lost my way to find hostel , i don ' t need to be panic .
F	i just check direction in confirmation e_- mail .
F	thank_you .
F	we ordered save the date magnets from bride and groom_direct with the promise they would be shipped within 0 to 0 days of the order .
F	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
F	i was annoyed that we hadn ' t had a simple email or phone call to explain the delay .
F	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
F	we may use them again as the products were so good but we will be ordering a long time in_advance !
F	la la love these_guys , would diffidently order again and again .
F	they were the first to pop up on google lol so i hopped on it and took my chances .
F	0st off my price_match wasn ' t met b / c it was from amazon ..
F	but they still took 0 $ off there price to lower the price the shipping was a bit much but not any different from amazon .
F	that being said i ordered my product wednesday and got it friday early 0am !
F	and the product came in mint_condition < 0 super excited and happy with my expierience .
F	there are a lot of negative_reviews but i ' m telling you try them for yourself ..
F	extremely courteous and helpful !
F	;)
F	disgusting unhelpful service .
F	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
F	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
F	not .
F	really disappointed
F	i heard of safercigs from aaec forum and it ' s great !
F	good prices and delivered quickly will order from them again .
F	i was served by sarah_hayes , which made everything in very efficient way
F	i booked my hen_weekend through chillisauce and found the service to be excellent .
F	the staff are really friendly , answer questions quickly and really do get you a fantastic deal .
F	there was 00 of us and we stayed in two gorgeous apartments in central edinburgh , these had everything we needed and were very secure and were large enough to accommodate hen_night games etc .
F	on the saturday we went cocktail_making , all the girls said this was a highlight and excellent value for money and the bartender was great fun , included were nibbles - these we ' re huge platters and were well received after quite a bit of alcohol !
F	as part of our deal we were given free entry to a few clubs , a 0 - course_meal and we also had a spa day included with treatments - a perfect end to the weekend .
F	i couldn ' t have organised this myself for the price we paid , i ' m so glad i booked through chillisauce and would have no_worries recommending them - in fact my other half has his stag_party in a couple of weeks and this was booked through chillisauce .
F	honestly can ' t thank_you enough for making my hen_weekend one to remember and everything i wanted it to be !
F	in peopleperhour i found a pool of talented people that were just there when i needed them .
F	i tried to move my transportation business on the web by creating a simple , yet practical reservation system that increased my traffic .
F	starting from the technical aspect of setting_up the web_site and continuing with the logo and web_design , firm branding and seo enhancements that would attract more clients to my site , pph freelancers were there for me ; not only to successfully complete the task i was assigning them , but also to give me insights on how to set_up my service more efficiently .
F	what ' s more important is that when i didn ' t know how to find what i wanted or had questions , their awesome customer support was there to assist me and help me move on .
F	i really owe them a lot !
F	i witnessed a 00_% increase of traffic in my business via the online reservation system in at about 0 months .
F	thanks for that pph !
F	ordered a highly demanded tent recently and had the normal free delivery on it .
F	tent price was very reasonable compared to elsewere and was a little_bit_dubious but thought what the hey .
F	i wasn ' t expecting it to arrive until the 0th of may and infact arrived on the 0th .
F	very impressed .
F	could not ask for better_than that !
F	the tent as expected is of high_quality and worth every_penny !
F	can ' t wait for the next camping_trip !
F	!
F	thank_you taunton_leisure .
F	one very happy customer .
F	quick delivery , even gave me a 0 hour time_slot for delivery .
F	brilliant :)
F	i have found out about raw gaia by chance browsing the internet .
F	before ordering i have asked for some recommendation , lucy responded me and i have made my first order .
F	it was very easy to order and paid through paypal , easy and secure , and my order came very quickly .
F	it was was packed impeccably , and the rose buds was a nice_touch .
F	sun dried green clay face pack is great , my favorite at the moment , i love the living facial cleaner too , it actually hydrates my skin .
F	i have only used the products for a few_days , but i will post another review after i give some time for the products to do their work .
F	one thing i want to mention , id that my pores seem to have diminished .
F	thank_you raw gaia .
F	fast delivery and all items received as requested .
F	good discount prices compared to other high_street retailers , will shop there again .
F	debbie
F	i ordered 0 mother ' s day bouquets .
F	i spotted that the courier company ' s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother ' s day .
F	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
F	didn ' t hear_anything back so i rang up .
F	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
F	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
F	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
F	surprise_surprise .
F	no call back .
F	no flowers delivered .
F	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i ' ve heard that one before !
F	she apparently couldn ' t put me through to head_office ...
F	so gave me a number to call .
F	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
F	p . s .
F	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
F	i signed_up after trialling the product for a week and was amazed at how simple everything was .
F	they certainly picked a good name for the product !
F	i ' ve found that the software can do an awful lot , but the way in which it ' s presented makes all the difference .
F	i was all setup and emailing candidates within minutes .
F	i â ve found their technical_support to be very good and they are always updating the product with customer suggestions .
F	such a breath of fresh_air from my previous software which shall remain anonymous :-)
F	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for quite a while , since i traveled in europe three years_ago .
F	i ' ve always found trustworthy , inexpensive places to stay through them ( and their prices really are the cheapest among the other hostel sites ...
F	i ' ve checked !).
F	never had a problem confirming my reservation through them or checking in with my reservation at hostel locations across the world !
F	highly_recommended for students and young people looking to travel on a budget !
F	always have what you want , or they do their best to get from another store .
F	very competitive_pricing and easy to choose online or in store .
F	like their new system instore .
F	always helpful , changing anything you return or refunds .
F	never had a bad_word_against them .
F	we have always been with o0 found them to be very reliable company , good choice of phones and very reasonable with their deals and rates .
F	we found superfoods website to be very informative and that is why we ordered from them .
F	we have to wait three months before we can leave a feedback relating to the effects of what we ordered .
F	so far we are pleased with their quick delivery and efforts so far .
F	sarah and ben
F	this is the best booking site i ' ve used !
F	accommodation is booked and confirmed within_seconds and the layout of the site makes it super easy to narrow_down searches and find what youre looking for .
F	would use again and recommend to everyone :)
F	well i was supposed to have a reunion of sorts with my rebel girl gang from college and was not sure what to buy as it was summer .
F	my problem was that i was supposed to meet on the weekend and was really caught up at work .
F	so during a chit chat with a colleague at my work she suggested to buy a dress online .
F	she in the same breath suggested to check out miss rebel .
F	being summer i wanted something flowery and vibrant .
F	in the evening when i logged_into missrebel . co . uk it was in for a surprise for the share range and cost at which they sold .
F	unbelievable !
F	gosh , it was a crisis of plenty !
F	trust me it was tough to decide what not to buy !
F	the summer collection was so beautiful .
F	and it took me 00_minutes to decide on a long summer dress with flower patterns .
F	not easy for a girl huh !
F	but most who i had heard from about internet shopping came with a warning about the problems in delivery .
F	but due to work constraint i gave it a shot !
F	this was wednesday_evening and i was set to meet my four friends on saturday .
F	guess_what miss rebel delivered the dress at my home soon after i came back from work on friday .
F	and that really made my day !
F	so when i went for the reunion , i received compliments from everyone .
F	i would strongly_recommend missrebel !!!
F	keep rebeling gals !
F	!
F	well , good items , shopped few_times .... good shopping_experience .... worth a try .
F	ordered something , but was delivered ( and addressed ) to wrong_address .
F	so never received it .
F	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
F	and a bit of customer_service would have been nice .
F	they expect me to sort this out .
F	visa dispute will has been opened !
F	i just don ' t like dominos ...
F	they got all this badly trained youngsters to cook pizza ... wel sometimes you better of not to eat that !
F	don ' t know why ... but i used it since i was 00 ...
F	good but a bit more expinsive than go direct sometims ...
F	so liked my new jewellery box , highly_recommend !
F	i so like this search_engine
F	rude personal !
F	pc wold is sucks
F	brilliant seo company , higly recommend .
F	top 0 search rankings
F	bad reception on south of england !
F	just do not like it .
F	that is it
F	better_than dixon !
F	if you are looking for good value find another place
F	i like this shop .
F	used it for 0 years .
F	cheers
F	i have a linux dedicated_server running fedora with fasthosts web_hosting .
F	i have been with them for 0 months .
F	the last month has been dreadful .
F	updates controlled through fasthosts wiping out php class files , and down times that break their service level agreements .
F	the update lost me 0 and 0 / 0 days , as they have no engineer support at the weekend - losses into thousands .
F	no apology , no communication and no one who_knows what they are doing .
F	recently lost all connection to my dedicated_server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
F	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
F	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
F	i have been boots customer for over 0 years .
F	experience is generally fine but boots . com is terrible .
F	recently placed an order for around Â£_000 and got it cancelled with no reason .
F	bank confirms the money has been claimed , delivery address is the same as billing_address .
F	called the customer_service but is absolutely no helpful .
F	feel very disappointed and angry .
F	they just think they are big enough to treat badley their existing_customers .
F	wonderful service - delivery has never been easier to me .
F	i simply went to my local_supermarket ( sainsbury ) whenever i wish within 00_hours to collect the parcel from lockers .
F	no curious question asked just simply brilliant .
F	indeed , i have problems with two of my parcels ( a samsung tablet and an ipod_touch ) gone_missing within mybybox network though those were compensated to its full value very promptly by mybybox
F	brilliant as always , have been using parcel0go many_times within 0 years now .
F	today again received brilliant support from sammie_taylor .
F	you are an angel
F	be_careful when you buy from here since you may get what you did not want you will be stuck with it
F	thank_you parcel 0 go .
F	they ' ve picked_up two laptops which i sent at a reasonable_price .
F	would highly_recommend them .
F	after a lot of research into the procedure for almost 0 year , i went_ahead with it .
F	i spoke with lots of people and they just loved it .
F	the treatment only took a few mins , and almost straight_away i could see the difference .
F	i have had some minor blurred vision on one eye , but this has been closely monitored and dealt_with .
F	all the staff have be great too .
F	this small procedure has made such a massive difference to my lifestyle .
F	i just wish i had had it done sooner !
F	!
F	you will never get answer to your emails if you have questions such as delivery time etc .
F	also no refund when you are not happy with the products and send them back .
F	i so much regret that i purchased for 000 gbp on this website as my refund hasn Â´ t been made .
F	avoid this seller !
F	excellent service , smooth_transaction and fast delivery .
F	no_problems at all .
F	my experience with ultralase was excellent from start to finish .
F	would highly_recommend them .
F	the staff were friendly & made me feel at ease & the care was outstanding .
F	i can now see better_than ever so the treatment was the best thing i have ever done .
F	completely_satisfied with all aspects of the experience .
F	thank_you ultralase .
F	i ordered 0 t -_shirts from truffleshuffle and both were good quality and true to size stated .
F	they arrived quickly and without any hassle .
F	would recommend this company for their awesome clothing .
F	the ability to check people ' s feedback is the key here - you wouldn ' t get that with a local firm .
F	used anyvan twice and wouldn ' t hesitate for a third time .
F	very easy to deal with , fast , efficient and friendly service :)
F	i have been recommending this site to everyone !
F	ive ordered 0 pairs of boots , a pair of shoes , 0 jumpers and a dress and i can_honestly say im amazed with all of it . the quality is top_notch and at Â£ 0 per item its great . the only down_side is the delivery prices which can bump up the total but it was still great value for money .
F	hi ,
F	i just wanted to thank the team at parcel0go for making parcel sending so easy .
F	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .
F	i was wary as i had read a few negative_reviews on facebook and other review sites so was unsure , but i took a chance as i had no_problems with my first delivery .
F	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
F	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
F	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .
F	i am very pleased and advise_anyone who reads the negative_comments to ignore them , parcel0go are 0 *****

F	i was so impressed with watchfinder .
F	i first emailed to find out about selling my own rolex watch , i got a response very quickly .
F	after ringing and speaking to a friendly , helpful sales man , i arranged to view a new rolex at their maidstone offices the very next_day !
F	tom holland was very professional and knowledgeable about rolex ' s .
F	the sales room is very secure and you are made to feel very welcome .
F	i would definitely_recommend watchfinder and am already looking at more watches to buy .
F	thank_you .
F	he reservado muchos hoteles con esta empresa y nunca he tenido problemas , recomendable 000_%.
F	txtnation provides a 0st_class service in internet & mobile solutions , txtnation is not a company to keep up with the times the goal is to be an industry leader & present new innovative products to the client .
F	nothing to complain_about with this company .
F	competitive_prices and promptly posted a packe to send my phones off in .
F	the following_day i got an_email to say my cheque had been posted and lo and behold there it was the following_day !!
F	highly_recommended !
F	ordered on thursday had envelope on friday , recieved phones on monday had money through same day by card payment overall no_problems unlike_other services who changed the price once sent phone back , very good customer_service
F	the booking was okay i guess , despite being promised Â£_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
F	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist_entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
F	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !
F	eventually we went in , didnt even ask for party name , as they werent expecting us , i enquired_about booking a table as i noticed some had been reserved , to which the manager explained that she didn ' t know what had been promised by hen_heaven , but it was extra for a table reservation and she didn ' t have any available , so instead gave us a wristband each for an exclusive part of the club - whcih she , didn ' t have to do .
F	we sorted out surfing as an extra activity external to hen_heaven and glad i did , as it was only the activity organisers that seemed to do anything right !
F	very much doubt i would hen_heaven again , would rather source activities myself without the expensive overheads that hen_heaven do
F	my husband and i went_onto o0 because we had relatives and friends on that network so we figured we would save money .
F	i was so wrong !
F	they ended_up charging us double for four_months until we finally got the problem sorted .
F	we have horrible experience with the customer_service .
F	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something else .
F	you can not change your tariff if you want to lower your monthly allowances and charges .
F	one customer representative was even argumentative and refused to transfer us to a supervisor .
F	they are very inconsistent .
F	my mum in law ended_up getting forced into a contract with them due to a family_member not paying the bill in her name and they were absolutely awful when she called to try and get a copy of the original contact and change the tariff .
F	they charged her Â£_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
F	absoutely no data was included in that .
F	even_though it wasn ' t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
F	the phone ended_up not working for a month and despite many time we helped her take it in to get fixed nothing worked and nobody helped .
F	we finally ended_up getting them to send her out a new one just to find out that that phone didn ' t work either !
F	it was absolutely_ridiculous !
F	do not use o0 as your network !
F	i don ' t reccomend to anyone !
F	sign their contract at your own_risk !
F	if you are a customer of o0 please make_sure to check your monthly_bill for unknown charges because they will not catch the error themselves !
F	i placed an order with precious_little ones on the 00st december_0000 for an east_coast cot mattress , i rang on the 0nd jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
F	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
F	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .
F	i rang customer_services to ask what was going on , someone had made a mistake and not placed the mattress in the correct section and it had been resold ( not sure how that even happens ), i complained at the time but was not offered any compensation , until i asked for delivery charges to refunded .
F	i was expecting to receive on email on the 00th / 00th_jan to say that the mattress had been dispatched , instead i have received another email to say that the mattress is still not a available and that there was a problem with the manufacturers .
F	again i rang customer_service to complain and ask for an explanation , but was given no more information , nor could i be told when the mattress would be available .
F	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
F	needless to say i cancelled the order there and then , and will not be using precious littles one again , whilst their prices are highly competitive , it would appear you have to be prepared to wait .
F	very prompt service .
F	definitely use this company again
F	absolutely rubbish !
F	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
F	no excuse , it ' s not even christmas !
F	never ordering from ' slow pharmacy ' again
F	i was referred this website from a friend and i ' m extremely happy with the pricing and the ease of shopping .
F	so many options !
F	excellent service , very professional , have already referred it to other small start - up companies like my own .
F	i ordered a dress according to the wrong_size chart and one of the workers called me with in a few_days to make_sure that was truly the size i needed .
F	she was very patient with me while i figured out what size i really needed !
F	they were very helpful and i would order from them again for sure !
F	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
F	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number )...
F	however using google translator i managed .
F	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening ...
F	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
F	i refused ( who wouldn ' t ?).
F	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0 months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
F	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i ' d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
F	no voucher after 0 days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn ' t work on weekend .
F	excuse me ???
F	bank is not involved at all .
F	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase ...
F	i had to explain the process to the customer " service " representative .
F	outrageous .
F	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
F	no call back received , no email received ... now i ' m desperately trying to get hold of bravofly however with no luck .
F	their 0 - midnight uk number does ' t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
F	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person ' s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don ' t feel_like doing this .
F	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen elsewhere .

F	the shipping speed is unbeatable !!!
F	great prices and a great selection .
F	i love supplement_warehouse !
F	very well_packaged and just what i was looking for , thanks !
F	thoroughly satisfied with the printer i bought and the customer_service was fantastic !
F	delivery was great and any_questions i had were answered .
F	i ordered some mats but when they arrived the clips didn ' t quite line up with the ones in the car .
F	i emailed in and got a response the same day .
F	they did some checks and admitted to making an error .
F	new mats were sent out straight_away and they let us keep the old ones too so we could use them for our camping_trip that weekend as intended .
F	very pleasant to deal with , the mats are great quality and i was very pleased with the price .
F	we got the luxury version with a red trim and they set the car off really nicely .
F	would definately use again and recommend to a friend .
F	from the 0st call to last everything was correct and efficient .
F	will def be buying again , great watch and great service .
F	thanks to lee for making easy .
F	i have used and recommended studio 00 at printing . com many_times .
F	their customer_services is second to none , the design work is excellent and the finished products of mine are still receiving compliments and feedback months after creation .
F	they are a truly brilliant firm and i would not doubt to recommend them and regularly do .
F	buy your meat snacks from jertong . com , seriously the best service ever and their prices are so cheap .
F	browse twitter cause there is always discount_codes for free postage or 00_%_off !
F	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
F	when i received it , it was all packed one item to a box so we received a stupid amount of boxes .
F	bags of sweets were split and taped back together meaning we couldn ' t sell them .
F	items were out of stock even_though in stock on their website .
F	boxes were damaged so items we had sold in bulk had to be repackaged in our warehouse to avoid disappointing our customers ( see , that ' s good customer_service on our part !)
F	sent items that had 0 - 0 months on the best before date meaning we have to either reduce them or sell them in bulk .
F	if you look around you can find the items a lot cheaper and with better stock_levels .
F	overall , it may be the worst experience we have had with a wholesaler .
F	having met them at ife00 we assumed they would be a good company to work with ... obviously not !
F	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer_service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
F	do yourself a favour , don ' t buy from uksweets .
F	i ' ve used face the future on three occasions and every time the product has arrived quickly and as advertised .
F	i would definitely_recommend them for service , product quality and value for money .
F	thank_you !
F	if i ever do find a cheaper price , they beat it .
F	and i love getting all the free_shaker_cups .
F	they have always had everything i was looking for .
F	it was easy to book with this site .
F	i was able to compare prices and locations easily which was nice .
F	would recommend e0p to everyone , great value clothes and shoes , never disappointed .
F	also , customer_service excellent , recently my parcel was ' returned to sender ' and e0p reshipped to me at no additional_cost .
F	will_definitely trade with again .
F	i have used glasses_direct twice now , purchasing a total of 0 pairs of glasses , and cannot rate them highly_enough .
F	the free home_trials are brilliant and have totally taken away the pressure of buying frames in the opticians and not beng sure if the glasses you have chosen even suit you !!
F	with the home_trial i can ask work colleagues and friends opinions before commiting .
F	prices are amazing , so i can now change my style of glasses depending upon what i am wearing .
F	hassel free transactions , i recommend all the time to friends and family !
F	!
F	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
F	however i wasn ' t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn ' t look like the photo on the webpage .
F	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
F	fhr is a fabulous site , had heard about this site from martin ' s money tips email and it exceeded my expectations .
F	seamless customer journey thought entire web_page , does exactly_what it says on the tin , no robbing card charges like some other online ' extra ' ' holiday ' booking services and the customer_service is fabulous to boot too , the competitors could do with learning from the fhr example for great customer_service and customer experience , and i know this from experience !!!
F	i will , l without_doubt in future , only use fhr for my airport extra needs !
F	fabulous !
F	love to do business with you again !
F	fab customer_service - you should be proud !
F	twice hackers cleaned out my bank_account and although i got money back , it took far too long and they didn ' t give any compensation , even_though it resulted_in bank charges and potentially late bills , luckily i had family to help out !
F	this is the second time i ' ve used , pc_specialist , although it feels_like its forever before you receive product , its well worth the wait , after all , it takes time to get things perfect !
F	and that is what my laptop is , using a lot of music software being_able to customise has improved , my overall productivity .
F	i ordered a bouquet for mother ' s day day and wanted it delivered the day before , arrived as requested and was left in the porch with a card through the door , my mum was thrilled with the flowers .
F	i paid extra to make the bouquet larger and added a vase for convenience all for under Â£_00 .
F	will be using again , would recommend both company and product .
F	would definitely_recommend etyres to any company or individual .
F	fast appointment after being_able to book quickly and easily online .
F	the technician kept in touch to let me know when he would be arriving and he did indeed arrive within that time .
F	also a great price for the tyre only a couple of pounds more_than quickfit but worth that and more to not have the hassle of getting the car to a centre .
F	i will be using etyres going forward for all my tyre replacement needs .
F	give them a try and you ' ll be pleasantly_surprised !
F	:)
F	mazuma offered me the best price for my t - mob pulse mini & after applying via their website , the packet arrived 0 days_later to post it to them & shortly_after i received confirmation & payment .
F	really excellent service , would reccomend & definitely use again when needing to recycle a mobile phone :)
F	amazing service from a company i used for the first time .
F	kept me in the loop when they were despatched and delivered .
F	will 000_% be using them from now on .
F	in fact everyone should use them .
F	despite placing an order over the weekend , come midday on monday i received an order update via_email_confirming my order had been despatched .
F	sure enough the following_morning , it arrived safe and sound .
F	as always , great job truffle_shuffle !
F	!
F	a nice and easy to navigate around website and easy payment process .
F	item arrived 0 days after ordering as a ' signed for ' item with royal_mail .
F	the chocolates were well_packaged and none of the items were broken .
F	will be using the chocolate trading company again .
F	shopping with the whisky_exchange has been so easy , from finding what i wanted to going through the checkout_process and with delivery .
F	the item delivered was very well_packaged and the whole_process has been totally effortless .
F	i would buy from the whisky_exchange again and would recommend them to everybody and anybody .
F	i couldn ' t ask for a more easier transaction .
F	i order medication for my parents dog after being charged over the odds at the local vets , not only as the medication cheaper , the customer_service was faultless .
F	perfect in every way .
F	i will_definitely be shopping here again .
F	i had an initial l ; oan and got caught in the spiral of paying back then taking another out to replace the money that quickquid have took .
F	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
F	i just want to pay and get quickquid out of my life .
F	please take my warning and do not use them
F	good customer_service and fast delivery .
F	good quality merchandise
F	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on the free home_trial until i found the right pair .
F	then i got another pair free and 00_%_off .
F	fast service .
F	arrived within a week and ive had loads of compliments .
F	nothing to complain_about
F	very good product range and great prices .
F	gutted i didn ' t find the site sooner !
F	!
F	very fast delivery and easy to navigate through the website !
F	!
F	great choice of products at low_prices !
F	my partner loves the little samples you throw in
F	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
F	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn ' t as it is very shimmery .
F	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
F	i can ' t get a refund because it ' s been used .
F	well , surely the customer is always right ?
F	customer_service is shoddy as well .
F	i was told to take it up with maxfactor !
F	just useless !
F	my order hadn ' t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
F	their phone_lines are terrible .
F	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
F	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .
F	it was 00am .
F	finally got through in the afternoon .
F	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
F	i was only told today that there has been a problem for 0 weeks .
F	makes me wonder if i hadn ' t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
F	i phoned today and had the same problem phoning , saying they were closed etc .
F	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
F	i don ' t know why the rest of the order couldn ' t have been sent anyway .
F	but oh well .
F	got there in the end .
F	it ' s a shame , because i ' m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn ' t say if something is out of stock .
F	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has been checked over .
F	i wouldn ' t go with them again simply because of this .
F	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
F	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
F	i waited until 0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn ' t had it .
F	i was told it isn ' t same day and loads of people had also said the same_thing i did to them .
F	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
F	i ordered some green tea pills on a saturday and i waited until weds and thought it was odd i hadn ' t had an_email to say they had been dispatched .
F	phoned up and they said they had a problem with their supplier .
F	well , why have them available online ?
F	there were in stock when i placed my order .
F	it ' s now friday and i have them .
F	wary to order from them again .
F	i have this app on my phone and its great .
F	it ' s easy to use , it keeps a track of your orders so its easy to go back to see what you had last time .
F	really big range of restaurants too .
F	they ' ve got very repetitive promotions , normally in places that are not very known ... prices are ok but nothing exceptional .
F	you really have to look for it , to not miss a good promotion as there ' s only a real good deal once in a while .
F	this website has loads of choice , postage was resonable , and my items wre quickly despatched , great communication !
F	i would definatly order from them again !
F	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
F	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
F	my experience is exactly the same as everyone elses , i ordered from them , few weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
F	i ' m so gutted that they are just able to get away with this =[
F	i have placed many orders with this website , and they never fail !
F	postage is super_quick and very discreet , they are very reasonably_priced , and they even offer a points rewards system !
F	i would definatly reconmend this website , and will definatly be ordering from them again !
F	i received my order in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
F	it is a great service - so quick and efficient .
F	i even received a follow_up e_- mail .
F	thank_you
F	opodo is a great travel site with competitive deals .
F	i really_enjoyed my holiday and felt i got a lot of bang for my buck .
F	i was pleased to be able to buy a ticket at the correct price once the event had sold out , from this trustworthy service .
F	the ticket arrived in perfect time and payment and everything went_smoothly .
F	ordered a wireless router , delivered promptly with no_problems .
F	i ' ve used this company a number of times and never encountered any_issues .
F	excellent website and delivery was perfect just as i expected from them
F	good website , easy to use .
F	ordered and delivered promptly with no_problems what so ever .
F	would recommend
F	absolutly hilarious , best weekend i will ever have !!
F	nude life_drawing was the best ice breaker for my 0 families to integrate !!
F	followed_by a superb comedy_club , and dancing feet on at oceana .
F	the next_day was our lazy day in our spa and superb treatments at nottingham park inn with vicky at revive , lovely lovely lovely_lady and treatments and knowledge of a high_standard .
F	then cocktail_making , will definatly book again with the girls , wished i ' d known about this years_ago , the fun nights we could of had there !!
F	then last but definatly not least , the ladies only river cruise ........ once in a lifetime and not for the faint hearted !
F	hilarious .
F	the weekend could not of gone any better , every_single lady that came on my hen_weekend is still blushing and laughing til our sides hurt !
F	superb weekend !!!!!!
F	!
F	saved the day !
F	extremely easy to use , fast and certainly affordable .
F	very disappointed the item hasn ' t arrived yet as it is a christmas_present and i am worried i won ' t have time to exchange if not liked
F	i booked with hostelbookers four times over the last month as i have a big trip coming up and its great , so easy to see reviews in everywhere from sydney , brisbane , thailand and london , really helps take the guesswork out of booking accomodation for travel and i can do it in work without anyone noticing :) will_definitely be booking any more accomodation i need with hostelbookers :)
F	items arrived quickly kept in contact with me so i knew what was happening with my item which i think is great .
F	i ' ve heard this company before but never gave it a chance , until i waslooking for a specific product and i came_across it on here .
F	this company seriously beats all other_companies , even amazon !
F	i saw that this website had the product i wanted for $ 0 more_than on amazon but amazon had very pricy shipping ... this company actually fixed their price to lower_than $ 0 .
F	amazing !
F	i am for sure going to stick to this website .
F	it ' s by_far the best !
F	brilliant system , always works well and it ' s easy to use .
F	my only complaint is about some of the takeaways themselves , who give themselves good ratings .
F	has nick from devon really been to the same restaurant 0 times in a week , given everything 0 out of 0 but left no comments ?!
F	and he has only visited just after the restaurant has received an honest , negative_review .
F	what a coincidence !
F	shame there is no way to stop this .
F	but justeat is brilliant and we have found some really great local restaurants that we wouldn ' t have known about otherwise :-)
F	we had requested a bespoke wedding_ring , a gold flat profile 00mm ring .
F	pretty standard .
F	we then wanted 0 star trek symbols added to the n , e , s and w points .
F	at every_step of the way we had email_updates as to what was happening and quick response times to our emails asking for updates .
F	all in all it took roughly 0 weeks from ordering to receiving the ring .
F	it was posted as received when they said it would be .
F	they are also very reasonable priced .
F	all in all i would recommend this company to anyone that will listen !
F	amazing !
F	recently_purchased 0 coby kyros tablets for our children from kenable - very quick delivery which was great , and the customer_service ( particularly the after sales service ) was fantastic .
F	finally a company who treats the customer like they ' re kings !
F	well_done kenable - would not hesitate to recommend you .
F	top quality products and good prices cant go_wrong always at the end of the phone or message to answer any_questions quick reliable delivery to :)
F	excellent service , fast delivery and great products .
F	if you actually want the ability to use your phone i would recommend using a different service .
F	i have little to no signal at all times and have had numerous problems with the simple things like direct_debits .
F	upon ringing up customer_service to try to sort out my endless problems i have been met with rude , abrupt and ignorant customer_service agents and i am yet to have any of my problems solved .
F	do not go to orange !
F	darren was excellent .
F	he gave us an honest opinion with regards to costing and our needs and got the job_done timely and professionally .
F	easy to book and easy to find !
F	there ' s always a good offer on this website and a lot of the time stuff is cheaper_than elsewhere .
F	and delivery time is also very good , and that ' s even with the basic free delivery .
F	always a top choice to order games online
F	i have been needing a new computer for a while , for gaming , and i was recommended to use this site .
F	when selecting components , if something wasn ' t quite right a pop up would appear and recommend a different component which would be more suitable .
F	pc_specialist would contact me an_email at each_stage of the order , whether for it having been built , in its testing phase and when it was ready to dispatch , which was also a lot quicker then i thought it would be , meaning i could get back to gaming faster the i thought !
F	the handbook provided was also very useful with tips on how to install and set_up my new pc .
F	everything about the whole buying experience and the product are top quality , and i would definitely_recommend using this website to a friend !
F	product exactly as_described .
F	brilliant quality !
F	cheapest i could find online !
F	received within 0 days of payment !
F	very happy customer !
F	very poor customer_service and terrible communication with customers !
F	avoid like the plague and use a more reputable music dealer , unless you have lots of time on your hands and feel lucky that your order will actually arrive !
F	i used lensstore as i needed my lens quickly for an event in the weekend and didnt realise i had run out and it usually takes a week from my optometrist .
F	i ordered very easily and they were delivered within a couple of days , fantastic packaging and very professional .
F	can ' t recommend highly_enough .
F	thanks !
F	ill be ordering again soon .
F	julia
F	ordered a dunoon mug for my mum overseas , package arrived in fantastic packaging ( i was nervous with it being breakable ) but was very satisfied and arrived within 0 days which was perfect .
F	will be sending my mum to site to buy more for collection to ship overseas .
F	thanks :)
F	it ' s the 0rd out of 0 orders i placed with hostelbookers .
F	i love them b / c i can pay wt my debit_card and it ' s always super_fast and easy .
F	plus , i do manage to find great places to stay for cheap .
F	i ' m a budget traveler and it ' s important to find a good and cheap double room in a hostel rather_than pay triple as much in a hotel .
F	safe and sound , trust_worthy online market place which always innovate something extraordinary .
F	once i thought vodafone is the best . but now i know the best . o0 is the best . no doubts
F	why this mess ???????
F	?
F	alertpay ??
F	i do not have any word to explain my feelings guys .
F	awful alertpay
F	hostel_bookers always finds the best quality cheap hostels and they are the only reviews i trust , wouldn ' t book anywhere_else .
F	never had any_problems with three .
F	the coverage is amazing and the contracts are great value !
F	i ' m a dutch person working in the uk .
F	i fly back and forth quite a few_times a year and always use klm instead of the budget_airlines .
F	the prices are fair and the stewards are exceptionally friendly .
F	i once had to book a very last_minute flight over the phone .
F	they called me back a few minutes later for details meaning i didn ' t have to pay premium call rates .
F	they never moan_about my luggage being a bit heavier than allowed .
F	and the complimentary drink and snack is always very welcome ;)
F	thumbs_up for this amazing airline !
F	ordered some new fitness clothing while i was aware of their ' magazine and mug ' scam so i opt out .
F	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
F	really , guys ?
F	i don ' t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
F	it ' s like shopping at the supermarket and have a employee sneakily put another product in your basket .
F	how is this even legal .. also , charging 0 . 00 for standard delivery .
F	no one does that anymore .
F	this is truly the last time i ' m shopping with this company .
F	i ' d rather spend a few_quid more to be treated with honesty .
F	they sold me a Â£_000 cage for the degus which turned_out to be way too small .
F	the reaction i ' ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
F	which it is not .
F	they also seem to know nothing about them , constantly miss - sexing them so people end up with an unwanted litter .
F	it ' s pathetic to see the animals in the shops in very small cages , and them being willing to sell them per one degu .
F	always keep them in pairs .
F	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
F	i ' ve build my girls a really big cage , for less money than the cage pah sold me .
F	i started shopping with this company since they supplied ready made seed mixes for degus .
F	my girls are on a special diet which the seeds are an important part of .
F	my degus even think it ' s the best part ;) delivery was very quick , i expected it later in the week but received it on monday !
F	i ' m a very happy prime customer .
F	i order quite a lot of things online , as i work a lot and never have time to go to the shops .
F	i ' ve never had any delays and get all my order the next_day ( often in the morning ).
F	i ordered a video_game a couple of weeks_ago which i thought got lost in the post ( not amazon ' s fault ).
F	customer_service was great and i got a refund without hassle , it was back on my account within 0 days .
F	i eventually received the video_game ( after two_weeks , while it was next_day delivery ) so i returned it .
F	it was really easy , printing out labels to put on the box and left it with collect +.
F	i ' ve been using yodel on many different_addresses now and i have yet to find a bad delivery .
F	they are always on time and the delivery men / women are always very friendly and patient .
F	please consider giving this same service to all the other people which must ' ve had horrible experiences with you .
F	i never usually_write_reviews but felt_compelled to do so .
F	after terrible customer_service from currys which_resulted_in me wasting a full day waiting in for a product which never arrived i decided to try ao .
F	the whole_process was quick and simple from order to delivery .
F	i was kept_informed of the status of the order and given a 0 week window for delivery however nearer the delivery time i received more precise information .
F	the order was received about 00_minutes outside my window but this did not concern me as i was kept up to date and knew the driver was in the area .
F	unfortunately the fridge /_freezer i order was slightly_damaged ( small dent in the side ) on arrival but i didn â t notice it until the following_morning .
F	i called and was given the option of a next_day delivery or a discount without any query and gladly accepted a Â£_00 refund .
F	in days where the high_street store is diminishing it â_s no wonder when internet companies provide such good service .
F	it â_s sad but the fault has to lie somewhere â¦.. and i will be using ao in future even if curry â_s has a better price !
F	tried to book our holiday on the website which was fine until i could only add x0 bags on with our monarch flight , but i only needed one .
F	called the freephone_number , got straight through to a lovely_lady who sorted it all out for us and amended the number of bags .
F	whole_process took minutes and i felt_confident our holiday was booked without any_issues .
F	confirmation came through on email as soon as i put the phone down as promised .
F	fab customer_service , i will be going straight to low_cost when booking holidays from now on !
F	thank_you :-)
F	i would never use any other company to sell my mobile , the webisite is easy to use , they pay for return_postage and even send you the bag to post the phone in .
F	that arrived in a day or so and i recieved the money directly in my bank 0 days after i sent the phone to them .
F	they email you updates during the process so you know it has arrived with them safely and when they start testing the phone , and then when you ' ve been paid !
F	great company :-)
F	this website gives you lots of great options for exactly_what you select in the search bars and the reviews are very useful !
F	excellent coverage
F	should have been confused . com
F	fab pizzas
F	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all aspects .
F	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them ..........
F	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
F	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
F	this is cost me another 0 pounds to buy tape and of course time which was more important to me .
F	as i wanted to have everything ready at the same time , thats why i have ordered them online .
F	i am not happy with my purchase at all .
F	hello friend !
F	what can i say ?
F	i just bought some paper
F	from ebuyer today !
F	it was cheap , what i need ,
F	and free , sent next_day !
F	why go anywhere_else
F	when ebuyer is so great !
F	i was caring for my mum for years , with four children , and i needed a new washing_machine but had no_idea what would be best for me or my limited space .
F	appliance direct helped_me with how to measure up , gave great advice and shipped me out a first_class machine for a fantastic price .
F	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else for my white goods now .
F	you just cannot go_wrong with them .
F	i bought my friend some flowers ,
F	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
F	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
F	could not wait to see them for real .
F	however dear friends , guess_what !
F	the flowers , they never arrived ,
F	my friend stayed late at the office ,
F	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
F	to ring the iflorist people
F	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
F	i ' d had my conformation email
F	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
F	but nothing !!
F	not even a phonecall !
F	!
F	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
F	i wish to now receive my refund
F	and i wish i hadn ' t shopped there at all .
F	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
F	to let me know that you guys had gone wrong !
F	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
F	but then tell me this before the whole day has gone !
F	you say it was down to the snow
F	and deliveries not made on time !
F	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
F	because that was your problem not mine !
F	i could have made other arrangements ,
F	now i ' m just a mum short of dough ,
F	please issue me now my full_refund
F	or its off to the papers i ' ll go !!
F	!
F	last friday i was trying to purchase eminem tickets for wembley stadium .
F	after trying a few_times i managed to get some and enter my details and paypal details , only after i had completed this the web_page then came up the tickets were no_longer available .
F	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
F	by this time i had already brought some tickets from another website as viagogo had said they were not available .
F	i called viagogo straight_away and they refused to admit that something went wrong with the site and that they would not give me a refund and they told me the only way to get my money back was to re sell the tickets .
F	.
F	massive problem with this is i will loose money if i re sell the tickets and when i check the tickets i brought ( even_though they told me they had sold out !!)
F	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually impossible to re sell them !
F	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0 days after the event !
F	just to make things even better they e mailed me today saying the time of the concert had been changed from 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
F	i called wembley to confirm this and they told me ever since the concert was first announced it started at 00 : 00 and that viagogo had made a mistake .
F	so now even if i did decide to use the tickets i wouldnt be able to make the show at 00 : 00 because i dont finish work until then .
F	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
F	!
F	i want my Â£_000_pounds back and it looks_like the greedy people at viagogo are just going to keep hold of it and mess me about for as long as it takesand fob me off with different reasons as to why i cant have it back every time i call customer_services .
F	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
F	!
F	my order id is 0000000 .
F	i am furious .......
F	the only delay was at my endas i ran out of ink to print the labels .
F	otherwise a fantasticly quick service with my money being in my bank within 0 days of sending the phone .
F	great to receive emails on where things were - order placed , received phone , processed , money sent etc .
F	i ' d use this again and have already_recommended it to a few of my friends too .
F	the picture of the costume didn ' t do it justice .
F	i loved my wonder woman costume .
F	it was the cheapest one i could find that looked half way decent so i was very happily suprised to have the best costume of the party .
F	i will be making all my costume purchases from here .
F	i ordered a 00 ' s groovy baby outfit with a wig and accessories all for a great price .
F	they were delivered in 0 working_days and were exactly how they looked on the website .
F	i would certainly order from fancy_dress ball again
F	i didn ' t hesitate to buy from watches0st . co . uk when i found they were selling the watch i had been looking for at less_than half the price of the high_street .
F	to make the buying experience even better , watches0st adjusted the watch strap to my specifications perfectly and delivered it to me very promptly .
F	couldn ' t be_happier with my purchase !
F	jennie , herts
F	i don ' t usually_write_reviews for companies but i have to post about flubit , as they seriously have impressed me with their after sales service .
F	i ordered a product that developed a fault several months after it was dispatched .
F	the merchant had since stopped trading so i was slightly distressed , contacting flubit to hopefully rectify the issue .
F	not only did they keep me updated through email and then calls .
F	they were also able to sort the issue and sent a replacement on my request .
F	i am thrilled , will be sure to use them again .
F	thanks david and the rest of flubit !
F	was happy with the product , no damage and arrived quickly .
F	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
F	no_idea how long my package was left there for .
F	if i could give no stars i would !
F	avoid this company !
F	i was on hold for 00 min and then they hung_up on me .
F	now i am 00 min and counting .
F	their bills are indecipherable .
F	their customer_service awful .
F	their final_bill doesn ' t show where the figures are coming from and i can ' t speak to anyone !
F	i love all of the zaggora products !
F	i ' ve really noticed a decrease in cellulite and now have much smoother skin than before using them .
F	the pants really do make such a difference to a workout and all of the products i ' ve tried are comfortable and the vivas are very stylish !
F	not only are the products great but the company is the friendliest i ' ve ever_dealt_with .
F	the staff are lovely and very helpful .
F	i also love that they support charities .
F	cheapest ghd styler and hairdryer i could find .
F	ordered on a thursday_evening and it arrived on saturday .
F	excellent service with next_day delivery at no extra_cost .
F	estimated time of delivery provided and a very polite phone call 00_minutes before delivery which was great .
F	best price i could find online and they even registered the product with the manufacturer for me to ensure i get the 0 yr warranty provided .
F	would most definitely use again and recommend .
F	superb service and print delivered in 0 working_days .
F	will certainly use again in the future and recommend .
F	used once , flawless booking .
F	no_problems .
F	would highly_recommend and will use again soon !
F	norman ' s provided an affordable slapstick for my sound effects table .
F	it was quick and easy to order online and the product was delivered very promptly and in perfect_condition .
F	i have made several purchases from this company , very impressed with the service and value for money , would recommend
F	really friendly service , very quick and reasonably_priced tyres would defiantly recommend
F	glasses0you are a great company , they have a great selection off glasses to choose from , something for everyone .
F	they kept me updated from the word go about my order .
F	the frames i order are fab , very funky !
F	i just love them .
F	i saved_myself a lot of money .
F	cant_wait to pick my next new pair of glasses form glasses0you .
F	i love o0 .
F	not ony do they have excellent coverage , they also offer top price plans for pay and go and pay_monthly and rewards !
F	i have never had a problem with this provider and always reccomend to everybody .
F	i received the envelope etc through the post just 0 days after ordering them .
F	it took me a few_days to get it all posted back but i heard back from them the very next_day telling_me that my order had been processed and the money would be in the bank by the end of the day .
F	and it was .
F	i was very impressed at how speedy the whole trancsaction was .
F	have booked with holiday_autos many_times over the last few_years - as long as you read the t &_cs they always turn out well .
F	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .....
F	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn ' t shower in both at once .....
F	and in the middle of nowhere ....
F	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i ' d say best part of the hen_weekend .
F	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh ..... not impressed ...
F	so after 00_mins of him faffing about he eventually let us in and shoved us on a table in the hall way far away from the dj and vip ....
F	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early ..... even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
F	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don ' t think the other girls will either ....
F	what a flop ....
F	being an internet shopper for well over ten years i ' m always a bit_dubious_about buying from sites that don ' t have a massive reputation , but so glad i did !
F	was in dire need of some more pampers sensitive baby wipes but i like to buy the 00 pack ( anything less seems a waste of time ).
F	i googled it and ebitsi came back as the cheapest so i purchased them before google changed its mind !
F	at a tenner with free delivery i wasn ' t going to complain - you can ' t even buy them that cheap at local_stores anymore !
F	( with exceptions to asda but where i live we don ' t have one ).
F	my order was actually through ebitsi from amazon and delivery was so quick , super impressed !
F	!
F	avoid this company like the plague .
F	they are useless .
F	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0 months .
F	they kept saying " it will be on by next week "... gone to bt now .
F	bought my nephew a t - shirt for christmas and it was perfect .
F	lovely colour .
F	personalisation was good quality .
F	it also arrived nice and quickly too .
F	about 0 days after i ordered it on a 0 day delivery option .
F	very happy .
F	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
F	when questionned , no response received ever .
F	they continue to send newsletters but never respond to emails - am unable to cancel my order now , they have left it in limbo and are not refunding me .
F	they took my money immediately after ordering and can not get through since , even on their phoneline .
F	absolutely_disgusting service , trading_standards will be informed .
F	do not use them .
F	this is one of my favourite websites to shop at , particularly for video_games , but it ' s nice to see that they have branched out recently with music / films .
F	they are almost always one of the cheapest suppliers i come_across , and my recent pre_- order of the wiiu premium pack couldn ' t have gone smoother - they kept me updated with the process constantly , and i received it before the release_date !
F	never mind the fact that it was the cheapest and , despite this , gave me more reward_points than was being offered by game , for example , even_though it cost more at game !!
F	love this site , i think they are brilliant :)
F	get paid for buying !
F	amazing , easy to use , quick payout by most merchants esp .
F	tc themselves , excellent customer_service :-)
F	beautiful food from a wide_choice of menu , reliable with quick delivery , food is always hot when arrives , staff are friendly and prices are affordable .
F	easy to use online ordering
F	i have taken my little girl ( 0yrs ) to funky_rabbit a few_times now to use their creative room and we both think it is fantastic !!!
F	all the toys and art and craft bits keep amy amused for ages , and their coffee_machine keeps mummy happy too !
F	:-)
F	never_heard of ebookers before and was going to book for my holiday , me and husband could only think of lastminute . com , expedia and opodo .
F	since i am a natwest credit_card_holder , i checked out their partners and found out ebookers is one of their partners , which means if i booked my flight with ebookers , i would have got my saving points from my bank .
F	this is how i knew about ebookers for the first time .
F	from browsing the holiday such as flight and hotel information on ebookers website to choosing the dates and confirming the booking , everything was very easy and smooth and i was very happy with the website .
F	however , i made a tiny mistake when i made the booking so i had to call their customer_service up and i found out that their office is actually based in philippines .
F	spoke to two customer_service staff and they were very friendly , helpful and professional , i am very pleased to see their high_quality of customer_service .
F	overall , i am very happy with their service so far from booking my tickets online to their customer_service on phone .
F	i shall be happy to book for my tickets and holiday again with ebookers in the future and would also recommend ebookers to my family , friends and colleagues who has not heard of ebookers before .
F	easy website to navigate and product is exactly as it states !
F	i appreciate no surprises .
F	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
F	haven ' t received it yet !
F	( almost 0 months ) i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
F	i just contacted_wowcher via_email and phone , when i called day by day they asked me to wait .
F	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
F	last_week i sent another mail asking to refund me back wowcher is keep silence .
F	wonder is since two_weeks , when i logged to their web application , vivacitystores mentioned that items were shipped .
F	and last_week i received a mail ( auto generated ) from vivacitystores asking that feedback ( thank_you for your recent_purchase !
F	as we appreciate your business and value your satisfaction , please take a moment to visit the link below to submit feedback on all items in your order ).
F	i dont know whats_going on but i ' m really frustrated .
F	doesn ' t deserve a star .
F	terrible to non - existant service .
F	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
F	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
F	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
F	again you are in a tablet deal , and already 0000 items sold , please dont miss these customers toooo ... :(
F	even i brought an android tablet from them via wowcher .
F	haven ' t received it yet !
F	i ' m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
F	doesn ' t deserve a star .
F	terrible to non - existant service .
F	stay_away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
F	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
F	i buy quite a bit of mobility stuff for my mum who needs a helping hand now she ' s getting older .
F	this company was very helpful on the phone as i didn ' t really know what we needed to buy .
F	great service , good value products and quick delivery .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	highly_recommended .
F	i ' m not a big buyer of such supplies , but i have always found mdp to provide brilliant service .
F	everything is always correct , and arrives in great time .
F	i like being_able to choose the courier as it means i can pick the one with the closest depot ( just in case i miss them ).
F	quality products and a very good price !
F	i ordered an ice breaker top for my husbands birthday and it came ready wrapped complete with ribbon and card all written for me !
F	all i had to do was put it on the table and bask in the gratitude of a perfecty fitting present !
F	used their service for repairs and was very happy with the turnaround time and the work done .
F	would recommend .
F	another great experience .
F	happy customer !
F	this is the real deal .
F	i needed to unlock my phone because i will be in italy for a few_months and officialphoneunlock fixed me up over night .
F	only problem was the credit_card verification process .
F	but that was no problem considering i was not attempting to commit a fraud .
F	lol
F	we used this company to do our cocktail_making in leeds for a hen_do , it was brilliant from start to finish .
F	plenty of cocktails and food .
F	ian ( our bar man ) was such good fun and made the event extra special .
F	thank_you
F	loved the weekend in leeds on my friends hen_do .
F	i ' ll be arranging one very soon for my friends hen_party and will be using funktion for that .
F	the hotel we had was in the city_centre and a very nice looking one with helpful staff and car_park .
F	we did a sms treasure_hunt , dance party and reserved booths / bar on the saturday .
F	all was prefect and ran_smoothly .
F	if you want a hassle_free hen_weekend i would recommend that you give funktion_events a go !
F	thank_you
F	really easy to find products , texts all throughout order to update on delivery and really quick delivery !
F	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
F	anyway the company is always slow with delivery took them 0 days to get back to me when i emailed them asking where a parcel was .
F	i am very impressed with the ease with which i could make an informed_decision on my hostel booking .
F	website is easy to navigate , reviews are helpful and most_importantly : rates are accurate !
F	keep up the good work !
F	good service and price .
F	quick delivery .
F	the pair of stools i bought are in pride of place under my bar in the mancave !
F	awesome .
F	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
F	once order was received , we received a confirmation_email and follow_up which was good .
F	delivery was quick and well_packaged although we are missing the ' thank_you ' cards that should have arrived free with the order ( we received the envelopes just not the cards ).
F	my only complaint would be that the finishing fold is not perfect .
F	i can appreciate that the card is pretty thick meaning that a crease fold would be difficult but i do feel this could be completed a little better .
F	00days and still no news on my phone .
F	send to be fixed for water_damage , no reply to my numerous_calls and emails , have only had limited contact via the instant_messaging service after much persistence .
F	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
F	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
F	awful company , terrible communication and service .
F	do not use
F	couldn ' t be_happier with how easy everything was with me being a first time buyer .
F	i just left a vitamin shop and thought i would look online first and quickly found this amazing site !
F	the price was half the price here online !
F	many free products !!
F	wow !
F	!
F	i was super excited to receive my wonder woman outfit ( which was brilliantly priced !)
F	and it came really quickly so i couldn ' t resist trying it on as soon as i could !
F	unfortunately , the costume was too big for me so i put it back in the packet ( folded and sealed again ) and contacted jokers ' straight_away .
F	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don ' t know what to do with my item !
F	it ' s my 00th_birthday in a few weeks so i hope i get an exchange by then .
F	not impressed at all with the service , despite its fast arrival .
F	very disappointed :(
F	the sizes are very strange , very long legs on trousers .
F	my cardigan had a very short torso and huge arms !
F	also , the label was cut out ?...
F	( what ' a that all about ?).
F	i would recommend buying small clothes and shoes a size larger , the shoe sizes are very strange and it ' s very annoying waiting for something to arrive and for it to not fit at all !
F	i ' ve been the same clothes / shoe size for god_knows_how long , so it ' s definitely their sizes and not a growth spurt lol .
F	to sum it up , it ' s just market quality crap .
F	not a good start .
F	opened an account as had a voucher for get Â£_00 off if u spend Â£_00 or more .
F	brought a pair of boots which were faulty .
F	arranged an exchange but had to call again to bring price of boots back down .
F	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
F	exchanged but had to call again to put voucher back on .
F	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around Â£_00 in phone_calls !
F	!
F	i found mazuma_mobile excellent .
F	it was easy to get a quote and sort out payment details .
F	our money was transferred within two days .
F	i would definately use this again .
F	hostelbookers takes the stress out of choosing a hostel with lots of options to help you find the right one and fast !
F	easy to pay and confirmation_email from hostelworld and the hostel was soon followed .
F	i will_definitely be using them my entire trip .
F	easy to use and compare places to stay .
F	easy to pay , love it !
F	easy to use website , informative and provides all required info on immediate email confirmation .
F	also Â£ 0 cheaper_than competitor who charged a booking_fee whereas hostelbookers doesn ' t .
F	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken toys .
F	on constructing the swing i noticed one of the wooden legs was split on 0 sides measuring 00cm and ending in a splintered point .
F	i contacted wicken and was told the split looked normal and wood will shrink / expand with the weather .
F	i sent a further e_- mail and photo ' s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
F	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
F	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
F	i have had to tape the leg up to stop my children receiving splinters from it .
F	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .
F	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken toys .
F	this has destroyed my faith in online purchases of such items .
F	ordered my ghd straighteners on sunday_night and they were delivered , free of charge , by tuesday .
F	fantastic service , cheapest authentic ghds on the internet .
F	definitely would recommend this site to my friends and will use again in the future !
F	i like this website because they treat you like a friend but at the same time are very professional .
F	i really_appreciate the cheap payment protection because my plans may very well change .
F	they always have lots of options and good info about each place .
F	until seeing all these reviews i have never_heard of a problem with them , i have bought tonnes of things off groupon and very please with what i have , i can understand some issues due to the different companies that advertise through groupon , guess that ' s just bad luck !.
F	i recently ordered x0 pairs of earrings with swarovski elements , only one arrived , so i emailed groupon and they were very helpful , my second pair have come today .
F	yet again i am pleased , i have even purchased a getaway through them too which i was wary about but i had a fab time !
F	thank_you groupon
F	i have never tried dieting before but after stepping on the scales and seeing 00st 00 i was very mad with myself !
F	so i ordered a 0 week deal on groupon ( split it with my mum ) so i have a 0 week one , which is the 000kcal a day .
F	i must_say that the first 0 days were hell !
F	i had headaches , felt dizzy , had no energy at all and just felt tired all the time , i was ready to give up at one point .
F	i just kept reading all the reviews on here and that kept me going !
F	its day 0 now and i feel fab !
F	woke_up in such a great mood , feel great , headache and everything else has gone !
F	i haven ' t really had time to exercise apart_from a 00 min walk on the second day .
F	i love all the shakes esp .
F	choc mint !, and all the soups ( not tried veg yet ) the choc & orange bar is yummy too !
F	my delivery came next_day , for a little extra charge , i was worried as a few reviews said delivery was slow , but it depends if you pay extra or not which i happily did !
F	i have lost half a stone in 0 days !
F	absolutely gobsmacked !
F	i couldn ' t think of a better diet to be on , i was getting bored of the shakes and leaving a quarter or so every meal time but today i have had the lot .
F	thank_you exante :-)
F	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
F	we ordered a large margarita pizza and garlic_bread with cheese and it took almost 0 hours to get here .
F	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
F	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
F	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
F	never again would i order from here .
F	its awful !
F	after my son purchased a new yaris from pinkstones toyota stoke i felt_compelled to write a review !
F	!
F	it ' s that time of year to buy cars with the plate change , new models and good weather coming up ..
F	so i treated myself to a lexs , then last weekend i went out to help my son buy his too .
F	he was interested in checking out toyota so as we ' re local we booked an_appointment .
F	we weren ' t sure what to do as we had booked an_appointment without really being 000_% on what car to get .
F	after looking around ( a lot !)
F	my son eventually settled with the new yaris .
F	the salesman was very patient , helpful and friendly , which of course always helps .
F	the new yaris also made quite an impression - it had a better quality interior than we had expected and the gadgets it offers as standard sold the deal !
F	my son went for a dark green colour as he felt the red was a bit too ' girly ' for him ( lol )!
F	i do have to agree the dark green does look good though especially with a slight tint of the windows .
F	while the new yaris is a fantastic car ( surprising just how much car you get for your money these days ) what i ' m really raving about is the service .
F	i think top customer_service is one of the most_important things these days and i really_appreciate it when i get it .
F	everybody we met , from the girl on the phone initially through to our salesman jo treated us exceptionally well .
F	the 0 % offer on the new yaris was also a great deal , so my son has gone for it and bought the car !
F	so thanks to all the staff for making the process thoroughly enjoyable .
F	highly_recommended .
F	i ' d never considered lexus before and i ' ve previously always been drawn in by audi and bmw , but i saw the lexus stand in telford with the ct f sport on display and had a quick chat to the sales_rep .
F	the looks were sharp and sporty so it had plenty of appeal !
F	the zero road tax also made this car very appealing to me !
F	after seeing the car i just had to book my test_drive to find out what it was like .
F	lexus stoke was quite close so i went to them .
F	i had high expectations ; i like to buy the very best and change my car every couple of years .
F	the ct 000h f sport surpassed my expectations altogether - considering it ' s top fuel economy , it had a very surprising high performance drive too !
F	i love high end gadgets and the f sport comes with plenty of gadgets as standard , so this was good too .
F	needless to say , i ' ve ordered my new car .
F	the whole_process has been fantastic from beginning to end and the staff have been very helpful / hospitable .
F	i ' m looking_forward to the delivery of my new ct !
F	cheap and easy way to get ebay purchases that are far away delivered to your doorstep without any bother .
F	i had an awkward pram and baby car_seat delivered and it came through in two loads absolutely fine - was very good service .
F	absolutely amazing band !
F	they sounded incredible and were all so friendly !
F	couldn ' t of asked for more .
F	would highly_recommend this band as they made my wedding so special .
F	i wasnt sure where i wanted to go so i called tina at verycheapholidays , from the start she was very helpful , thorough and friendly .
F	since booking my holiday ive had a few questions and her customer_service has been excellent .
F	i would recommend her to anyone .
F	used_shiply to find quotes for moving a car from london up to bedford .
F	got the most quotes on shiply ( also tried other similar_sites ) and got a really good deal for moving the car :) feedback system is really good too .
F	slightly annoying that deposit is non_refundable if anything were to go_wrong on the couriers end but all went_smoothly for me so no real probs :)
F	if it wasnt for amigos i would be in a mess so thank_you
F	i am unable to claim my Â£_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
F	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
F	hope that someone would help me sort it out !!!!
F	!
F	was worried shopping with them as had never_heard of them but the price of the car_seat was too good to miss !
F	i ordered sunday morning and received the seat on tuesday_morning by interlink_express .
F	fantastic service , would definitely shop with them again and will recommend the website to friends and family :-)
F	had an issue with the website ( my own incompetence !)
F	and my sos email was quickly responded to and staff were incredibly_helpful .
F	the delivery came very quickly and was extremely happy with the product when i received it .
F	highly_recommend the website and will_definitely use again as their price for this specific item was certainly a lot lower_than anywhere_else .
F	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
F	would use again and highly_recommend
F	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
F	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i ' ve had no repsonse back in ages !
F	we booked our_honeymoon via much_better adventures and were so glad we did !
F	the deal we got was matched perfectly to our requirements and the team have gone to every length to ensure we found exactly_what we were looking for .
F	they have been so helpful and courteous , we are really grateful .
F	00 / 00 and we ' ll definitely be using the service again
F	i bought a pair of stella mccartney sunglasses .
F	i saw them in a magazine and couldn ' t find them anywhere in the high_street .
F	my pal reccommended red_hot and they had all the latest ranges .
F	i got my sunnys and another pair at a really great price .
F	it was really easy to order them and i got them earlier_than i expected .
F	can ' t wait for the sun to shine so i can get an excuse to buy more .
F	thanks red_hot .
F	excellent service from the first contact to delivery .
F	the web_site is easy to use & even_though we always order on line the orders are followed up by an_email from a ' real_person '.
F	the standard delivery is excellent - normally next_day .
F	.
F	never , ever go with three .
F	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
F	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
F	they said it would be there in 0 - 0 days .
F	0 weeks_later the sim had still not arrived .
F	i called again and asked what was going on .
F	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
F	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can ' t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
F	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn ' t happen .
F	i then rang them again and told them to give me my pac_code .
F	long_story short , i was passed from person to person , none of whom had a clue about any of my details or the story .
F	you spend ages explaining everything again and again ( apparently , they don ' t possess such advanced technology as customer records and databases ) and they ask you to repeat your number each time .
F	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
F	( this was true ).
F	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
F	and then , after much wasted time that i ' ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we ' ll give you three months ' free service "!
F	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
F	i reckon they know perfectly well that people realise they ' re awful , so they put the hooks in and make it as impossible as possible to cancel your contract .
F	absolutely_disgusting .
F	avoid them like the plague !
F	i ordered from this company a few_times and have had no_problems .
F	i am always happy with the prices and the delivery times .
F	very prompt delivery and super cheap prices !
F	i was a little_dubious after i had purchased the glasses as it was coming from_hong_kong , i wondered if it would take weeks for them to arrive and whether they would look as good as they did on the website .
F	i have to say i very rarely write_reviews but thought i would this time as i was really happy with the goods and the service received .
F	i received a text off dhl the day after i had ordered them telling_me they were on their way and a link so i could monitor them , however 0 days_later they arrived !
F	thats quicker_than amazon !
F	also the glasses were gorgeous and definitely authentic .
F	overall im thrilled with the price i paid for them now .
F	id recommend this company to anyone .
F	great selection of glasses - i ordered 0 pairs of vivienne westwood glasses , they were excellent value .
F	the customer_service team were quick to reply to my questions .
F	kensington tea co . was an simple , easy to use ( especially for a green tea novice !
F	), and great looking website .
F	the site has a great range of contemporary products that also looks stylish as well as functional , it was hard to choose .
F	but the advice on the site allowed me to get the right product for me .
F	would thoroughly_recommend the kensington tea company for any loose - leaf tea related purchase in the future !
F	the quality and price of the outfits are very good .
F	the service is very efficient .
F	i needed to return my outfit to change the size and i did not have any_problems .
F	i would recommend using this website and i would use them again .
F	the only_criticism i have of hostel_bookers is the name - because it isn ' t just a site for hostels !
F	sure , i have booked some excellent hostels using the simple , quick and no - fees booking system , but i ' ve also used it to book top - end hotels and apartments .
F	the reviewing system i ' ve found to be very reliable , and the website seems to find cheap prices which other comparison_sites don ' t pull up .
F	thank_you hostel_bookers !
F	bought wii balance board ( black ) + wii fit plus solus game and from the ordering_process right up to the delivery was excellent i would recommened to my friends and family and would definetly use this company again .
F	thank_you
F	easy payment , tickets received in good time .
F	amazing seats , always in blocks close to the front .
F	my husband is a cycle fanatic but i am not .
F	i do however love going into sigma to pick_up gifts for him .
F	the staff are really helpfull especially when i don ' t really know what i ' m looking for are always happy to take the time to help me work it out .
F	just as i said above !!
F	:)) you will not be disappointed .
F	the website was easy to use , prices were reasonable and the delivery timing was awesome , took 0 days - ( considering it was a personalised item ).
F	i am very impressed with the product - good quality and comes gift boxed ( i ordered a keyring ).
F	will_definitely be using again and recommending to others .
F	0 ***** (",)

F	highly_recommended to anyone whos looking to buy a new camera or equipment .

F	i have used pet suprmarket many_times and they have always made shopping for my animals quick , easy and wallet - friendly .

F	i would definitely use them again and shall recommend the site to fellow dog owners .
F	i posted phone on wednesday and had the agreed amount of money in my bank_account the day after .
F	couldn ' t believe_how quick they were in processing the order
F	first time buyer with musclefood and i was really impressed with the service .
F	i was a little_hesitant with ordering meats online although glad i did .
F	everything came on time and the order was complete .
F	there was one slight_issue with a packet of chicken accidentally splitting open but the correspondence with the team at muscle_food was exceptional and they provided me with a refund which was in my account the next_day .
F	will_definitely use again !
F	great service !
F	i know it sounds too good to be true but it really really is .
F	had no issues with them .
F	as long as you read the terms and conditions of offers you will be pleasantly_surprised at extra cash coming in !
F	i was extremely impressed with the service i received - my furniture was delivered ahead of schedule and i was really pleased with the quality .
F	i ' ll definitely be using them again .
F	i was planning a trip to las_vegas with my boyfriend for my 00th_birthday in 0000 .
F	i called away0 as i had been to vegas before and the trip was booked through them although i never deal with them directly , it was done through a friend .
F	michelle dealt_with our query and she was absolutely amazing , she was very patient and accommodating .
F	we wasn ' t sure if we wanted to just do vegas or a multi trip , we gave michelle all the different options we wanted to explore and she gave us quotes for every option possible and ensured she found the best possible price for us !
F	as we both work full time , we dealt mostly with michelle over email and she was very quick to respond to us , the service overall was just brilliant !
F	in the end we decided to do las_vegas and san_francisco , the trip is booked for april and we can ' t wait !
F	!
F	i would definitely_recommend away0 to friends and family
F	love paypol what more can i say
F	great sevice they helped_me to use the computer and load my photos .
F	got my photots back to day they are of a high finish , will use again
F	i was on a rolling_contract and called the vodafone custmer service to see if they could give me better deal .
F	they saved me Â£ 0 per_month and double the mins and text allowwanc per mth . all that and it only took 0mins to do .
F	the delivery was terrible , i paid for next_day delivery but my nicece never recived them they said i that they left them in the porch .
F	the porch is an open porch near to the main path so if they did deliverer the flowers anyone could of stolen them . on the postive side they did redeliver some new flowers but a few_days_later and i still paid for next_day delivery .
F	the flowers were beauiful .
F	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
F	i love my beanbag its great for reading a good book only one down_side its so comfy i fall asleep a lot so my book is taking an age to read . its a lovely bright colour too which looks good in my living_room . i was worried_about getting a " big_boy bean_bag " after_reading some really bad_reviews but all i can say is that ive had no_problems with the dispach time or the beanbag . try it for your self !
F	the site had great product information and was delivered really quickly .
F	great wellies .
F	very impressed !
F	!
F	i searched for the item and this company had the best price .
F	ordered and it was delivered within 0 days .
F	exactly as_described !
F	!
F	so good in fact that i ' ve ordered other items from them .
F	really recommend them !
F	!
F	they offer really good named brands at cheaper_than high_street prices .
F	the website is easy to use and easy to navigate through to checkout .
F	they always deliver really quickly and everything is well_packaged .
F	give them a go , they are really good .
F	website was easy to use and gave all the information i needed .
F	easy checkout .
F	item received really quickly , was well_packaged and just as_described / expected .
F	great speedy service .
F	a great offering and brilliant way to get_rid of those old_phones !!
F	!
F	i cannot express how much i absolutely adore this site !
F	i use tcb to buy things as i usually would so it ' s not like i am going out of my way or buying things that i usually wouldn ' t , except i use this portal to link to my chosen shop / service and get rewarded handsomely in doing so !
F	click the link below to start earning :)
F	this company is diabolical !
F	do not order from them .
F	they are scammers .
F	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
F	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
F	i have emailed and called on numerous_occasions .
F	they keep fobbing me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
F	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
F	they are liars and crooks !!!
F	do not deal with valuebasket .
F	i wish i had found this site before i purchased the phone .
F	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it ' s because it is .
F	i wish i ' d of paid the extra Â£_00 with amazon now .
F	i ' m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
F	so i ' m just waiting it out .
F	they have me stuck behind a rock and a hard place .
F	very pleased with my glasses , great frames at a decent price .
F	really helpful and efficient staff who responded quickly to my queries .
F	received my glasses quickly even_though outside the " standard " prescription range .
F	i will_definately by from eyewearbrands again and recommend them to friends and family !
F	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
F	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
F	!
F	having spoken to many garages to replace a run flat tyre i then rang e_- tyres who quoted a far cheaper price and came round the next_day to my house to replace my tyre .
F	so convenient for me me with kids running around .
F	really friendly guy who showed me all the safety checks when he had finished .
F	i would definitely_recommend them .
F	i took the plunge and after looking for weeks i found them on google i decided to order two ralph lauren long sleeve polo_shirts and was amazed with the quickness of delivery and could not believe the fantastic quality of the stuff they had the supplier numbers in the washing label ( i expected not the best quality probably returns or something because of the price ).
F	anyway to cut the long_story short i was that pleased i just ordered another four items on the same day .
F	i regret to say i wasn ' t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
F	they ladies i spoke to was just simply too rude
F	sono rimasta molto colpita da sunglasses_shop .
F	il catalogo Ã¨ vastissimo e comprende tutti gli occhiali piÃ¹ belli e alla moda .
F	i prezzi sono i migliori che si possano trovare sul web e la spedizione Ã¨ velocissima , con un ' ottima cura nel packaging .
F	sicuramente acquisterÃ² ancora su sunglasses_shop !
F	grazie , sono molto soddisfatta !
F	i have been using chitoro for years now , i think probably 0 , and they have been fantastic .
F	really gone out of their way at times to help .
F	exceptionally fast service and never had a snag yet , despite my requests constantly changing and being a little complicated .
F	they are always willing to accommodate and get the job_done quickly .
F	can ' t speak highly_enough of them .... highly_recommended !
F	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher ' s poor service .
F	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
F	same here !
F	paid in good faith but no goods received !
F	simply not good enough !
F	if enough of us write to watch_dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it ' s affiliate companies .
F	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
F	was easy and delivery of medication was quick .
F	ordered a table lamp " parkbrass , alchemy , Â£_000 " from here on monday_evening , it was delivered on wednesday - perfectly packaged , i was worried the large shade may get squashed in transit - i need not have worried .
F	competitive_pricing , i did a google_search prior to ordering and the price was the same as all other on - line stores .
F	would recommend .
F	delighted with the santana tv_unit and nest of tables received yesterday - great design , quality build and competitively_priced .
F	items were well_packaged and delivered within the promised 0 hour time_slot .
F	the tv_unit was out of stock when ordered so delivery was longer_than usual , but worth the wait .
F	this was my first time selling a mobile phone over the internet so i was a little_nervous .
F	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .
F	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it ' s not in perfect_condition - who ' s phone is by the end of a contract period !
F	anyway no such issues with fonebank , sent phone recorded_delivery , the next_day received email confirmation they had received phone and set_up a bacs payment , Â£_000 was in my bank 0 days_later - top service - thank_you !
F	!
F	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
F	now told they have issues with the supplier .
F	not acceptable to me as selling this type of medice you would expect it to arrive faster given the nature of what it is for .
F	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read reviews before i ordered .
F	shiply provides a great service to everyone who needs to deliver goods or to move houses .
F	a very easy system where transpoters bid for what you request .
F	i used it 0 times already and everything always went_smoothly .
F	very good quality invitations - fast service , free printing of guest lists is excellent .
F	great customer_service .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	this was my first order from yorkshire aquatics , the website was easy to navigate and checkout was simple .
F	my order was with me within 0 days !
F	i was really impressed by this !
F	one item that i received was wrong , so i emailed and this was rectified immediately , and i had a replacement item sent , which i again received really quickly .
F	overall i would say very good :)
F	wednesday : registered phone with mazuma
F	thursday : posted phone to mazuma
F	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
F	saturday : got my voucher in time for a shopping trip !
F	brilliant , fast service from mazuma .
F	other_companies that i have used can take up to two_weeks to assess the phone and issue the voucher , i had this voucher two days after posting my phone .
F	amazingly speedy !
F	and i ' d definitely use them again .
F	0 * service from mazuma !
F	i find sold my phone was quick and easy
F	we were in venice for one week , and we had not booked any hostels in_advance .
F	so we arrived in venice and had no clue where to stay , all hostels we found were already full .
F	we met a guy who let us use his notebook to check in hostelbookers . com , and we easyly found a really nice dampingsite near venice for a really cheap price !
F	we stayed there for two_nights and we were really happy about this accomondation !
F	thank_you hostelbookers for saving our trip !
F	this was our first time using hostelbookers and the process was very easy .
F	the reviews , information and pictures of each location was very helpful .
F	five_stars - i have sold three phones now and the service has been fantastic every time .
F	i will only use mazuma for selling my phones in the future .
F	thank_you for your excellent customer_service mazuma
F	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
F	we had received a confirmation_email but the hotel had received nothing from hotel_voucher_shop about our booking .
F	we tried to ring customer_service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
F	we rang an_emergency number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
F	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn ' t ruined .
F	so in summary , terrible customer_service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
F	great customer_service at a good price .
F	would definitely_recommend using them .
F	their mini crane and operator have helped massively on our project .
F	i ordered a printer on 0 / 0 / 00 , received the order acknowledgement and patiently_waited for delivery .
F	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i ' ll need to go back online an re - order .
F	ok , a bit of a faff and a shame that no - one followed this up with me for over a week , but i go to the site and select the same printer & it is now 00_% more_expensive .
F	boo !
F	poor me , so no sale after all that & i ' ll have to go somewhere_else now .
F	i have used bondara for ages as they are the best .
F	i have always received my orders on time or early and find their service excellent .
F	they offer so much variety
F	was really happy with the service from prezzybox .
F	i order several items all for gifts to other people and felt the ease of their website was good , the options for delivery were good , the actual arrival time for delivery was exceeded ( always happy with that !)
F	and the products themselves were perfect & of good quality .
F	found website really easy to use , postal bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs ... deffo_use again !
F	hello im playing fifa_00 world_cup and i been buying fifa points to unlock players but is expensive .... i have bit concern about where to buy try to aboid an scam ..... but finally i choose mooga by recommendation and is great ... i bought 000000k and i got it in 0 minutes .... highly_recommend it guys and going to buy more i finished my coins already hahha .
F	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards ....... i eamil back and never got and answer .... customer_service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
F	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
F	do you have another contract with them ?
F	thats what i think after this expirience ..... but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!
F	!
F	shame i have to pick a start and no half of it

F	!
F	jessica lake
F	excellent service .. super_fast delivery .. will use again .. thanks
F	good communication from the start i was nervous providing i . d to a company had never dealt_with before but was reassured the reasons_why .
F	good delivery arrived speedy after payment , box had a little hole in it but considering the weather_conditions was okay with this .
F	the second game was available on download at xbox_live which i didnt know
F	another pointer for coolshop - i wasnt aware that the plug would be foreign three point , therefore needed an adapter to use in the uk luckily i checked the product before wrapping
F	would use the website again
F	excellent staff all very pleasant , welcoming and knowledgeable but not boring !
F	!
F	we got on near our hotel at victoria took red route , live commentary fantastic we enjoyed that much stayed on all the way around then went round again to get off and see sights !
F	!
F	brilliant value and funny commentary not too in depth to loose interest .
F	great to see london at a different angle , then in contrast to take the river thames tour and see the sights from below , it was fab !
F	!
F	my 0year old didnt want to go on a bus tour after an experience abroad last_year where we were listening to all different languages and very boring tour , half way round i asked if he wanted to get off ' no way ', so i guess that sums it up .
F	good idea that different nationalities can plug in earphones to listen to the tour in their language .
F	great photo opportunity , bet some londoners havent seen all the sights we saw in a matter of 0hours !
F	!
F	the stops are very easy to see and i asked the staff about the latest i could travel back to reach my destination all helpful , plus can book other trips with the staff , got my london eye tickets from them .
F	brill !!
F	( 00year old female and 0year old boy )
F	website easy to use
F	ordered headphones one day got the next and as an added_bonus , they stuck in a lolli - pop :)
F	will be using them again
F	never any_issues fantastic service
F	kvaliteten og farver kan variere fra det man ser pÃ¥_hjemmesiden til det produkt man modtager .
F	deres stÃ¸rrelser i bÃ¥de sko og tÃ¸j er_ikke til at stole pÃ¥ .
F	jeg_har i alt bestil 0 par sko fra nelly , alle i str .
F	00 .
F	de tre af parrene var for smÃ¥ , svarende til ca .
F	en 00 , og et_par var nÃ¦rmere en str .
F	00 .
F	Ã©n ud_af tre kjoler bestil pÃ¥ nelly har_vÃ¦ret helt anderledes i kvalitet , farve og stÃ¸rrelse end det jeg_sÃ¥ pÃ¥_hjemmesiden .
F	en anden kjole og snydt med formen pÃ¥ Ã¦rmerne .
F	grunden til at nelly fÃ¥r tre stjerner , er den gratis og hurtige levering og at deres produkter i knap halvdelen af tilfÃ¦ldene lever op_til forventningerne .
F	jeg_vil til enhver tid advare venner , der Ã¸nsker at bestille varer hos nelly .
F	jeg_har handlet pÃ¥ asos utallige gange og_jeg_har altid vÃ¦ret yderst tilfreds .
F	produkterne lever op_til forventningerne ud fra billederne og hjemmesiden er_meget overskuelig og med_en_god sÃ¸gefunktion .
F	de_har et stort udvalg af gode , kendte mÃ¦rker til meget lave priser ( det billigste jeg_har set indtil nu !).
F	ordren blev afsendt dagen_efter bestilling og_jeg modtog pakken 0 hverdage efter ( de lover levering pÃ¥ 0 - 00 hverdage ) - i forsvarligt emballage .
F	portoen udregnes efter stÃ¸rrelse og vÃ¦gt , jeg betalte ca .
F	00 kr .
F	for 0 mellemstore produkter - meget rimeligt !
F	produktoversigten er efter min mening ikke sÃ¥ god .
F	men tjek det ud - det_er besparelsen vÃ¦rd at bruge lidt ekstra tid pÃ¥ at finde det man leder efter !
F	absolutely_shocking customer_service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
F	prices may be good - but make_sure your prepared to wait a long time for delivery and expect bad customer_service .
F	for someone such as myself who is in no way a it person at all , i am always apprehensive using computer repair places , feeling like they see me coming and rip me off .
F	so i took a chance with the service team .
F	it has paid off , i liked the personalised service you get right from the first phone call .
F	then when the engineer came to my house to diagnose the issue he moved appointments around in the day so he could get to my house earlier as i had night shift that night .
F	i was very appreciative of that .
F	he was friendly and i felt_comfortable inviting him into my home .
F	also the best part is you see them doing the work then and there so you know what the labour cost is going to be .
F	absolutely recommend them .
F	i am not a heavy lifter , but i do often frequent the gym and stay in good shape with a combination of proper supplementing and diet .
F	what i really like to do is shop online ....
F	which works out really well for my boyfriend ( who is heavy into lifting ) when it comes time to place our giant , combined supplement order .
F	we always order together but he only asks two questions ; ' what did you get ?'
F	and ' how much was the total ?'
F	i guarantee that since i started placing the whole order with supplementwarehouse . com , he has been surprised by my response to that second question on each occasion , after hearing everything we were able to order for that amount ...
F	hands_down unbeatable_prices .
F	yes , there is a shipping cost , but its simple to justify having to pay for shipping when i know that it doesn ' t compare to what i ' d be paying elsewhere to get my supplements .
F	i don ' t need to ' ask ' for special pricing , i know i am getting the best deals !
F	additionally , i continue to order from supplementwarehouse . com because of their always up - to - date selection of products and fast_shipping .
F	a one - stop_shop for everything you need to ensure you are fueling your body with all the right things , whether you ' re male or female , working on gaining muscle or just like to stay in shape .
F	based on their prices , efficiency , and selection , i always choose supplementwarehouse . com as my go - to stop for supplements and i would highly_recommend their products and service to anyone .
F	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
F	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn ' t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
F	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
F	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
F	after that i kept on sending them emails to inform me when they receive my package .
F	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven ' t received my package .
F	then after waiting for almost 0 months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
F	fortunately , i found william ' s skype id from his email , added him and found him online .
F	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
F	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
F	i paid it right away and got my flash back within a few_days .
F	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
F	when i emailed william to send the diffuser back , he said he ' ll send one for " free " if i am willing to pay the shipping cost .
F	i replied_saying that it wasn ' t my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and i have already paid the shipping cost , since then i haven ' t gotten any reply from them .
F	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don ' t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer_service .
F	i ordered a pair of teva sandals from the site on tuesday around midnight , received a confirmation the next_day that my order was processed and on thursday at 0 a . m i received the parcel .
F	excellent service , highly_recommended !
F	absolutely_faultless and outstanding service , very highly_recommended !
F	prices are great , some very cheap some average but nothing ridiculously overpriced .
F	packaging was excellent , bottles are very securely packed and should be safe from even the most clumsy postman .
F	delivery time was also excellent , arrived in very reasonable time and i was kept_informed about my order which was also much_appreciated .
F	overall an outstanding and honest company and comes very highly_recommended from me .
F	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
F	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
F	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .
F	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
F	i ' ve wanted some brushes from crownbrush for a while and when there was a 00_%_off code i thought it would be rude not to !
F	i am really pleased with the brushes i bought ( all eyes on you set ) as they are such good quality , especially for the price .
F	the best brushes i ' ve ever owned !
F	i also bought the blusher palette which was a lot bigger than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
F	the colours are lovely , very natural and pretty palette .
F	i ' ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
F	thank_you crownbrush *****
F	this website not only matches competitors prices but will discount the lowest_price an additional 0 % !!
F	i will buy all my wellness products from this site !
F	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
F	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi fare to the hotel .
F	the next_day we rang the transfer company who told us we should have been given different information on the pick_up off resort_hoppa ( which we didn ' t receive ).
F	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
F	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can ' t contact via phone ).
F	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt with shortly .
F	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
F	!
F	i wrote the complaint in mid october and still have received nothing back now !!
F	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
F	!
F	my husband and i ' ve been using supplements for quite some time , we kept pouring money into it until we found you guys .
F	thanks for the great deals
F	would highly_recommend them and would use again .
F	i ordered a dress but was too small so i sent it back and my refund was paid back very quickly and with no hassle .
F	instant search result , quick and easy processing , sensibly designed email_updates providing up to date status of the process but with sufficiently discreet banners .
F	brilliant service all_round , online sh !
F	is impeccably reliable , so much so that i don ' t need to go to the store at all .
F	double0tickets was a reliable service , stressfree ...
F	i was pessimistic because i have been conned ... double0tickets was a phone call away , delivered tickets very safely , and were genuine tickets !
F	fantastic service with fantastic time at the gig !!
F	i willmost definitely use this service again .
F	julie s .
F	have never used simply_games before but they are now on my favourites list !
F	delivery was ver quick and great customer_service .
F	thank_you
F	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
F	booked a collection for monday and was told they would collect between_0am and 0pm so i made sure someone was home all day .
F	it got to 0pm and still no - one had been to collect the parcel , it is incredibly annoying to wait around all day and not get the parcel collected .
F	at 00pm i opened the front_door to let my friend out , there was no card on the doorstep yet in the morning i found a card on the doorstep ( they couldn ' t even be bothered to put it through the letterbox ) saying that someone had attempted to collect and that no - one was in .
F	which is an outright lie .
F	the card hadn ' t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
F	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
F	if you can avoid it , don ' t use this company to collect parcels .
F	completely incompetent and unreliable !
F	i received the package in 0 days ..... in italy so i ' m impressed .
F	thank u so much !
F	product arrived 0 days after ordering as planned and was much_better value than other_places i looked , would use again
F	we ordered from worktop_express because ikea didn ' t sell the lengths we needed .
F	we thought it would be much more_expensive but it actually worked out cheaper and was by_far better quality .
F	makes our standard ikea kitchen look really premium .
F	delivery was great , i got a call an_hour before hand so i could go home to sign .
F	make_sure you allow time to oil a couple of times before it goes on .
F	from the moment i spoke to robert ( our holidays_please representative ) my anxieties about booking our dream honeymoon were forgotten .
F	we were unsure of where we wanted to go and robert gave me advice and information each time we changed our mind about the destination .
F	robert was very knowledgable about all the destinations and got back to me very quickly with hotel and flight options ( which were always within our specified budget ).
F	he was honest about what we could and couldn ' t afford , to enable us to have the luxurious honeymoon we wanted .
F	we decided on mauritius and got it all booked up very easily with robert .
F	even when , 0 month before_departure , our orginal hotel decided to close for refurbishment , robert had already got 0 hotel options for us to choose from .
F	it turned_out to be a blessing as the hotel we chose , with roberts recommendation , was absolutely superb and everything we could have asked for and more !
F	we used the gift list service for our guests which worked_perfectly .. our guests commented on the ease of use .
F	i have no hesitations about recommending holidays_please and using them again for ourselves !
F	i initially called up webtogs to get some advice and spoke to a really friendly woman with encylopedic knowledge of walking boots .
F	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot on .
F	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
F	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
F	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
F	i have used double0 on various occasions and will always look on here whenever i am in a situation where i cannot obtain tickets anywhere_else !
F	every time i have wanted to go to the 00 to see a concert double0 always come to my rescue .
F	yes you may pay more but you are guaranteed to get good seats and the tickets everyone_else wants .
F	i would always recommend them to anyone , you pay for what you get .
F	thank_you double0 and i am looking_forward to going to see_beyonce very soon ...

F	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via groupon , 0 weeks before_christmas ; waited 0 weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before_christmas .
F	by 00rd_december it still hadn ' t arrive so i tried to ring them 00 + times and no answer !
F	i tried the infurn website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
F	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0 months for a simple beanbag .
F	groupon would not take any responsibility for this .
F	lets_hope it arrives in the end !
F	stay_away
F	revision 0th_jan :
F	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can ' t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !
F	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer_service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they dont want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
F	revision 00 / 00 /_0000
F	now been advised that the beanbag won ' t be in til march thats 0 months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
F	ridiculous !
F	groupon won ' t take any responsibility for not checking the availability for what they have advertised .
F	stay_away from groupon and infurn !

F	i have been taunton zizzi for many_times .
F	everytime is so happy with everything , ie , food , service , environment , cleanliness .... all .
F	000_% recommended .
F	that was my experience during half term at taunton asda .
F	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .
F	i showed her , she asked for the id for my children .
F	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
F	she insisted if no id of the children to prove they are over 00 .
F	then i cannot buy any lager .
F	i am 00 , restaurant licensee .
F	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .
F	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called amy .
F	she is fran .
F	i told her how can she check people ' s id but she did not have her own .
F	disguisting experience .
F	the manager came to sort out and said she had to back up her staff ??
F	what is the system ?
F	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
F	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0 days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer_service , blamed to the courier broke them .
F	ridiculous .
F	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
F	i never had that poor horrible service in my life .
F	they sells cheap but the service is so cheap too .
F	will not go back at all .
F	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu dhabi .
F	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
F	the previous tenant moved out and the new tenant moved in the day after .
F	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
F	since november we have been receiving bills and debt_collection letters for Â£_000 at our office address but addressed to the landlord .
F	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
F	first_utility refuse to speak to us as we are not named on the account ( despite our name being on the letters and bills ) but they have advised us rather_than the account being put into the new tenants name it has been put into the landlords even_though there was no usage over the 00_hours it was vacant .
F	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i ' m sure that is possible when he ' s based in uae ?!!!!)
F	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
F	will to live is disappearing very quickly .
F	we have no_problems with change of tenancy when the big 0 are the providers but endless problems when it comes to first_utility
F	just chatted with rob on parcels 0 go . com brilliant sevice .!
F	answered all my questions .!
F	great :)
F	everything went smooth !
F	i really_appreciated this site for it ' s ease of use and easy to follow design .
F	i had a hard time on similar_sites , finding the dates i needed to book , but hostelbookers . com only showed me the ones available for my dates !
F	i ' m a fastidious researcher and i went to multiple sites , including to the hostel sites themselves for prices and hostelbookers . com matched the lowest_price every time .
F	next time i need to book a hostel , i can save myself some time without sweating by going straight to hostelbookers . com , sans the research !
F	i really_appreciate that .
F	thanks !
F	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .
F	easy site to use and give the best prices out there .
F	i had my first problem today with the site saying i needed the live help to assist me .
F	i did and thanks to the very helpful and polite catherine my order has been organised and my parcel is being picked_up later today .
F	great service .
F	wish more customer_service people were that helpful .
F	will_continue to use parcel0go for all my courier needs .
F	i took my son in to get his feet measured and they were brilliant .
F	very nice and friendly and made a big fuss of my boy while giving me some very good advice on his shoes .
F	they also have a lovely range of clothes and toys and i will_definitely be visiting them again soon .
F	no hassle service .
F	registered online and sent phone in on same day .
F	the following_morning received an_email to say the phone had been received and the payment being transferred .
F	two days_later , money in account .
F	quick , efficient , good value .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	quick delivery , great boots .
F	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
F	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
F	the only account i have with them is a nectar card , i sent this and then they told me this is not what they wanted .
F	they wanted an order number .
F	two_weeks this was after my initial contact .
F	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
F	the staff were mortified that there was a big and didn ' t want to know .
F	they told me to ring the number on the back .
F	so i finally rang in , told them i was not happy with the customer_service , the delays and the fact that their ready washed and ready to eat salad is coming with bugs !!!
F	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put Â£ 0 pounds onto my card .
F	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
F	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don ' t do anything about salad .
F	useless and annoyed !
F	we purchased a billabong winter wetsuit for my nephew , needed quick delivery for a wakeboarding comp he was competing in , the wesuit outlet provided second to none customer_service , they were extremely_helpful and we got the wetsuit delivered the next_day .
F	my nephew was bouncing round the house he was so happy .
F	would recommend them to anyone , they have a great variety of products at very reasonable prices .
F	we are very happy customers !
F	thanx
F	really easy , not the best price but the most trustworthy and really clear_instructions .
F	hostelbookers is an amazing site where you simply type in a destination and a list of hostels in that area pop - up by price , rating , location , etc !
F	it ' s so easy and saves a lot of time .
F	i highly_reccommend this if your looking for inexpensive places to rest your head !
F	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink wrap . i was so upset for that .. unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
F	i ordered 0 of the same electronic item and they just cancelled my order just because i ordered two .
F	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
F	and their customer_service manager is very rude , i don ' t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .
F	it might be the cheapest broadband provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
F	the internet speed is not great , the tv channels not fantastic but i was able to live with that .
F	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services ... saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
F	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
F	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
F	they don ' t understand your request at all , don ' t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
F	helping you is not on their job description .
F	even now that i ' ve cancelled my account with them 0 months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
F	talktalk is not a reliable company .
F	the whole_process was very easy from start to finish .
F	sign_up was easy and you just had to print off the postage label and post it yourself .
F	when i was delayed posting it they emailed to check everything was ok and they held the price for 0 weeks .
F	i have ordered 0 times from this website and i would recommend it to anyone .
F	the price is great and the quality of the product is excellent .
F	received all products within a couple of days of placing my order , well_packaged and good value for money .
F	thanks , will_definitely buy again !
F	products & packaging very good no troubles !!!
F	defo_recommend .
F	pricing of products very reasonable and great quality especially when buying in bulk .
F	delievery - no_complaints with the delivery company arrived in good time and no damage
F	came the very next_day !!
F	very good condition will make a wonderful christmas_present defiantly reccomed this company
F	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0 weeks for my product .
F	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
F	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don ' t want the product anymore .
F	they have the worst customer_service and even their manager gareth is the most useless and very unhelpful , if you don ' t want to come off the phone crying don ' t bother buying from them because they would frustrate you .
F	excellent service
F	a real_life_saver when it comes to purchasing books for university .
F	i love the free postage and packaging offers and delivery is always prompt .
F	would recommend to anyone .
F	i have ordered a few things from this company now and would recommend it to anyone .
F	the products are very good value for money but do not lack in quality .
F	the free postage and packaging is excellent , items arrive within a week and are always well wrapped ( especially important since the parcels are often containing glass ).
F	do not hesitate to order from this company , i am always satisfied with the service and prices .
F	00 / 00 .
F	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
F	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
F	the next_day i received a phone call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
F	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
F	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn ' t be a problem " but failed to mention the Â£_00 charge .
F	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
F	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
F	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer_service number .
F	the lady i spoke to on the phone was rude , unhelpful and unsympathetic .
F	she didn ' t apologise at all and then told me that if i wanted a refund i would need to pay Â£_00 .
F	i argued that it wasn ' t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn ' t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
F	i am now paying fifty pounds to have this mattress taken away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
F	take note : no paper work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
F	appalling .
F	simply appalling .
F	camerakings is very quick in communication .
F	most of the times you can expect your e_- mail or facebook post answered within a few hours .
F	also , they always do as they promise .
F	i had two problems with a single order .
F	the first was that dutch customs charged me with taxes which i had to pay in cash to dhl .
F	camerkings refunded this within the hour !
F	the second problem was a faulty baseplate on the gini rigs advanced extreme 00 .
F	again , answered within the hour with the promise to immediately send me a replacement .
F	i ' m very pleased with the service of camerkings .
F	all companies should be like this .
F	hostelbookers beats out hostelworld for sure !
F	as a low - budget many - month traveler , avoiding an extra fee makes a big difference in the long run .
F	you can also log in and keep registration details , which makes booking a place much_easier - it is a pain to have to re enter all details on hostelworld when i am booking a new place every week !
F	the details on locations gives you all the info you need in order to book , and the site loads fast on slow connections , which is very useful when wifi is slow while traveling !
F	it also lets you select more lodging options than just hostels and sometimes these have special rates which beat out a hostel .
F	i ' ll take a private_room for the same price as a hostel dorm any day !
F	!
F	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .
F	the customer_service is non - existent .
F	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0 days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
F	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple_task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .
F	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
F	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single_person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay_away .
F	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
F	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone_else do the same .
F	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
F	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further Â£_000 in repair costs not to mention Â£_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .

F	i have always loved domino ' s pizza prob my favourite food !
F	i downloaded the app a few_months_ago but have never used it so thought i would for the first time wednesday_night .
F	i can not complain the pizza ( which was an half and half ) came exactly as requested but i just loved the extra bonus of the app saying at what point the pizza was at i . e baking or quality_control .
F	very rare i have ever had complaint with dominos but when i do they are always resolved straight_away .
F	kate
F	came when expected as had easter inbetween .
F	the website was easy to use without forcing extra products .
F	excellent quality came individually boxed for protection .

F	got my keys within a few minutes after payment .
F	they have good prices too , would recommend !
F	i ordered three small canvas ' s and they arrived within a week !!

F	easy to use site and very fast delivery
F	they were very polite and helpful , called me within a few minutes of my request and didnt take up too much time .
F	i have already recomended a friend .
F	very easy to search for what i wanted and deffinatly the cheapest deal , no where local could match it .
F	tyres_fitted the following_day .
F	i ordered a game from simply_games that cost less_than the other big companies i was thinking of ordering with .
F	the service was outstanding - the game arrived quickly and in perfect_condition .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	thank_you .
F	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
F	i just don ' t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
F	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night ' s accommodation that ' s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .
F	there are other_websites that are just as good that don ' t charge anything , like europe ' s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
F	i ' ve now stayed in 00 of their hostels throughout europe and am yet to be disappointed .
F	they are independent hostels so you don ' t feel_like you ' re in a hostel factory like i ' ve felt before in some of the big hostels - in , pay , sleep , out ......
F	whenever there ' s a europe ' s famous hostel in the city i ' m going it ' s an easy choice for me , i just wish there was one everywhere !
F	their website is easy to book on and they don ' t take any booking_fee which is a bonus compared to hostelworld , whose charges are pretty high .
F	000_% recommended !
F	so pleased that i had lasik done .
F	just wish i ' d had it sooner !
F	the process was professional from start to finish with friendly helpful staff and in a nice environment .
F	mr morris treated me at optegra in guildford , and i would recommend both him and richard the optometrist .
F	i always order clothes from boohoo and they always come really quickly which is amazing .
F	and they ae good quality and true to soze .
F	i will order from boohoo for forever !
F	thanks guys x
F	i was like i have a problem and bang in comes samantha not only did she solve my problem but she is now my new bestfriend !
F	great service and i couldn ' t think of a better way to spend my thursday_night !
F	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
F	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
F	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
F	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
F	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
F	i am a paying customer and the least i can get for my money is some help or some of my money back .
F	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
F	please stay clear !
F	where do i begin , bad coverage when i was told it was good , i had a 00 day sim which i only wanted for 00 days but you have to give 00 days notice so as soon as i got it i rang 000 to cancel now this is a call_centre in india they are very hard to understand it took 00_mins to cancel and get a pac_code during these 00_mins i was told i would have to pay for 0 months which i said i wasn ' t paying as its a 00 day contract and i was giving 00 days notice i will pay for that then i was told that i would get a bad credit_rating and enforcement officers would come and collect the money after this i agreed to pay so i could get my pac_code and cancel then i got put through to cancelations who then tried to sell me another contract i had to say i just want to cancel about 00 times before they actually did it awful company
F	great company they give you and hour_slot on the morning of delivery and they turned_up 00_mins into the hour_slot great service need more delivery companys like this !
F	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
F	great service and speedy_delivery .
F	highly_recommend .
F	i had been looking for a copy of this book for a long time .
F	i had seen several copies at silly prices .
F	this book arrived in good time was in good condition and was a reasonable_price .
F	can ' t fault outdoorkit , their delivery service was brilliant !
F	will_definately use them again without a doubt .
F	another reason_why i bought from this company was because of their accomodating returns_policy .
F	i highly_recommend this company !
F	the best stay you can have for money paid !!
F	!
F	the service is speedy , and it ' s great value for money - nice and discreet too .
F	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else .
F	very fast delivery , happy with the service
F	fantastic service , saved us a lot of money on the sale of our property .
F	currently using your conveyancing services for the house we ' re purchasing and very impressed so far !
F	speedy pick_up - car was perfect for what we required ... 0 adults and three children so we chose a citroen picasso c0 .
F	very helpful staff at the collection centre - great service all_round
F	i purchased sunglasses that weren ' t quite right for my face , despite trying them on in a store in australia .
F	pretavoir refunded my money in full as soon as they received the package - no_hassles .
F	this kind of customer_service is unheard of in australia and i have recommended pretavoir to a number of friends and colleagues for its good prices and exceptional service .
F	great company who saved my bacon on mothers_day after a disaster with a less reputable service !
F	very easy to use , lovely choice and free delivery to my mothers ( fairly out of the way , rural ) address .
F	thank_you interflora for cheering my mum up after her disappointment yesterday and saving me from being dis - owned :) from now on i ' ll be sticking to what i know !
F	having been with vodafone since the beginning of time practically , when my contract was due to end i decided to shop around some other deals .
F	couldn ' t find anything that bettered my current tarrif so contacted vodafone to see what they offered .
F	customer_services were really friendly and helpful and i came away with a brand spanking new smartphone , at no extra_cost and on the same tariff with a few extras thrown in !
F	i explained that i worked shifts and they arranged a time to deliver which suited .
F	i even got a text from them on the day letting me know the exact time of delivery , saving me from hanging_around all day waiting .
F	great service and i ' m very happy with my lovely new phone !
F	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
F	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
F	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
F	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
F	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
F	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
F	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
F	i have been offered a discount_voucher for Â£_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
F	i wouldn ' t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
F	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
F	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
F	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
F	in future i ' ll be reading reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
F	ordered miniature jagermeisters for wedding favours , contacted company and they price matched another company .
F	really pleased with service , the delivery was quick cannot complain at all !
F	really looking_forward to next week now ( 0 days to go )
F	just recieved our invitations today and i cant stop looking at them they look elegant , very professional and expensive ... although they werent that expensive compared to other_sites !!!
F	im so pleased with the service and cant_wait to buy the stamps now and send them too our guests !!
F	:-) my only complaint was that after we had worded the invitation the draft was not saved and therefore had to re write it !!
F	still worth 0_stars though im a very happy bride to be !
F	!
F	fast despatch and delivery despite the time of year and weather !
F	kept_informed of status of order throughout .
F	i can ' t recommend you highly_enough , thanks .

F	i ' m a repeat customer , always and excellent , valuble and clear service
F	this was such a no - hassle way to sell my laptop .
F	sell your - laptop made everything so easy for me , it was actually easier than throwing my laptop in the bin !
F	and i made money on it !
F	very fast international shipping .
F	no_complaints will order again for sure .
F	before i ordered from beautybay . com i looked at reviews on the net and was quite surprised to see loads of bad ones .
F	but i decided to take a risk anyway . i live in sweden .
F	my order has arrived within 0working_days or so .
F	i knew i will not have any_problems with beautybay . com . thank_you very much for my nice first experience with you :_d
F	excellent priced items .
F	excellent , fast customer_service !
F	will_definitely buy from sh !
F	again in the future !
F	great products at great prices .
F	delivery is prompt too .
F	will_definitely continue to shop here .
F	good value for money .
F	would definitely use them again .
F	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
F	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
F	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
F	i also said they could leave it with a neighbour .
F	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn ' t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
F	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
F	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
F	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
F	i then contacted body care 0000 to rearrange delivery and was again surprised to find they had refunded me less 00_% for costs for delivery .
F	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
F	i then inquired about what had happened and why i was being charged when i didn ' t feel i was at fault and i got some really patronising emails off someone called linda @ bodycare0000 .
F	i then asked for a number and a manager to contact and they never got back to me .
F	i am out of pocket and have no product .
F	the delivery was really quick and the products have been excellent and as_described .
F	fab - i would use again !
F	i would recommend beautybay again , they were really fast in delivery and the product is just what i expected .
F	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
F	yes there are some good reviews on this site for pyb , however they are from people who just say " cheap and quick to set_up " - they haven ' t even tried claiming from pyb .
F	my ipad was stolen and they are refusing to pay out .
F	avoid at all costs .
F	thanks for the dosh !
F	very quick payment !
F	from the very first phone call to the final delivery i received excellent customer_services .
F	the communication level was high and helpful and the product when it was delivered was exactly as i hoped , and was also delivered ahead of schedule too even_though it was a large order .
F	also , i work using a purchase order system as i work for a local council and this was no problem for adband who were able to invoice me and release the product even_though i was unable to pay immediately .
F	thank_you very much .
F	i have no_hesitation in recommending adband to anyone and would happily use them again in the future !
F	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost Â£_00 .
F	i was charged for both and only received one .
F	i have tried to contact boohoo using all methods ( inc twitter and facebook ) and had no response .
F	their customer_service is truly_awful .
F	they have no contact number and despite responding to most_recent messages on twitter , they ignored mine from hours ago .
F	very selective about who the help obviously .
F	disgusting .
F	if i could give no stars , i would have .
F	i will never be using boohoo again .
F	they do not care about their customers at all .
F	avoid at all costs .. you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
F	!
F	i don ' t know what is better , the extensive_range of products buyhair . co . uk offer or their amazing customer_service !?
F	my prostyles hair came super_quick and buyhair will not be_beaten on price !
F	so affordable , quick delivery ( with very reasonable postage and packaging ) and a huge_range of products .
F	i will always return to buyhair .
F	don ' t hesitate to call them if you have any_questions or concerns , they are lovely and always willing to help .
F	thanks so much buyhair .

F	no_problems with booking , very fast email_notifications , good website
F	i ordered 00 drawing mannequins from this website , i ' d never_heard of it before so didn ' t know what to expect but the low price and great delivery promises caught my eye .
F	got quite a few emails and texts to inform me of delivery days and times which was nice so i could make_sure someone was in .
F	then a text to inform me my ordered was left with my neighbour , and a picture of their gate , the little things just show the quality of the service .
F	i wiped out the stock with this ordered so received 0 out of the 00 .
F	i emailed to ask when the remaining 0 would be with me , i had an_email back within the hour telling_me it would be only a few_days and apologised for the unconvinced .
F	very impressed with the quality of the product and the service .
F	thank_you so much !
F	i thought i ' d have to wait a couple of days for the keys to come through but they were there the morning after i ' d ordered them online the previous afternoon .
F	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
F	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
F	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
F	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
F	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer_service lines .
F	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
F	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
F	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer_service via his customer_service line .
F	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer_service line .
F	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
F	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
F	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
F	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
F	now , let me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
F	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
F	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
F	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
F	i had spent over Â£_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
F	moral of the story ?
F	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
F	the silver lining .

F	we bought my engagement_ring a week_ago from diamond_dealer direct ...
F	i didn ' t really know what i wanted and spent the morning wandering around the jewellery_quarter feeling a bit overwhelmed by the huge choice !
F	christina was very helpful !
F	she went through loads of different type stones , shapes and bands until we ' d narrowed it down to my favourite ring .
F	she was very helpful , friendly and down to earth - felt_like i ' d brought a friend shopping with me !
F	also , the price compared to similar rings i ' d seen across the quarter was extremely competitive .
F	i ' d recommend to anyone !
F	great prices , fast delivery , good quality products and great customer_service .
F	fast returns refunds too .
F	00 / 00
F	very pleased with designer paint .
F	they have the best range of paints and the service is great .
F	lots of samples available although some are ridiculously_expensive for the size pot you get ( fired earth !!!)

F	as a company i would give them 00 / 00 .

F	would recommend to anyone and will use again .
F	thank_you blue herbs :)
F	i had a lot of email contact with aggressive health before i purchased my first vegan protein_powder .
F	the advice given was great and mike was extremely patient with my never ending questions and was able to answer all of them .
F	this company is ran by a fitness expert which made me feel so much_better when asking advice as i knew i was going to be recommended the right products rather_than being recommended the most expensive or supplement that makes them the most money like other faceless supplement companies !
F	it was a pleasure_dealing_with aggressive health and i will_definitely be use them again .
F	fast delivery , quality products , expert_advice .
F	highly_recommended !
F	00 / 00
F	great communication and very helpful staff thank - you for all your help !

F	after waiting until 0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
F	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
F	every flower is pretty_much dead .
F	really disappointed .
F	very easy to use service .
F	detailed emails explaining what is happening and when the money will be transferred .
F	would definitely_recommend to friends and family .
F	i ordered last_minute tickets to backstreet boy for this coming friday .
F	ordered the tickets at a discounted price on sunday and they arrived today .
F	a very reliable company to use , even_though i had my doubts at first , as i ' d not heard of them before .
F	much_better_than viagogo and similar_sites , the price you see is the price you pay .
F	would definitely use them again
F	i would definitely_recommend anyone to do courses with e_- careers .
F	they make is hassle_free and there is always support there when you need help .
F	this is the first time i used e_- careers , but definitely won ' t be my last .
F	animed is a great website with a wide_range of products at cheap , affordable prices .

F	thank_you for creating such a brilliant website !
F	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
F	when i contacted moon estates they told me it was a Â£ 0 charge to change the name and that they had had a great number of calls as wowcher had made mistake with order details .
F	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
F	have emailed several_times over a week_ago and heard_nothing back at all .
F	disgusted
F	easy transaction cash paid straight_away - thanks
F	i always use these_guys when looking to buy myself a new dvd .

F	we placed our order on camerabox . co . uk , the reason being ; they came out on top of the best deals we could find on all the price comparison_sites .
F	we placed our order on friday 0th with express delivery as the method of postage .
F	and we received it at 0 : 00 this morning .
F	in my opinion , that is extremely quick service .
F	to be honest we couldn ' t quite believe our eyes !
F	now i wouldn ' t think_twice when looking to purchase any further photographic equipment .
F	just outstanding service , i can ' t give them enough credit .
F	keep up the good work guys !
F	i heard about identity through a friend nearly 0 years_ago now , and what a fantastic find it was !

F	i would highly_recommend identity !
F	great company to deal with .

F	we just picked_up our brand_new kia sportage 0 today from this kia dealer .
F	we are from perth scotland and had looked around dealers here and met our fair_share of pushey dealers with very high prices .
F	after looking on the net we came_across a fantastic deal from chorley group thinking it was maybe to good to be true we gave them a call and was put through to sales and spoke to russell .
F	much to our delight the deal was there and ours from the taken which we snapped up .
F	after going over everything with russell and getting the car ordered and going to pick it up russell kept us well informed if i needed to know anything a quick email sent off was answered in great time .
F	nothing was to much hassle we were even picked_up from the train_station to go and collect our car today .
F	so to sum up our experience if you want to purchase a top_class vehicle with 0st_class customer care and great value for money , deal with chorley group .
F	even if you don ' t live in blackpool they are definitely worth traveling to .
F	russell made you feel at ease he took care of everything .
F	i will_definitely be looking to do business with him for our next car , best sales man we have ever had the pleasure of doing_business with .
F	have had countless orders from this company however my last 0 orders have been terrible .
F	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
F	sizes changed order a 00 it ' s like an 00 order a 00 it ' s like a 0 .
F	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
F	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
F	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
F	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn ' t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
F	they refused to let me return it .
F	person who emailed me was very rude .
F	my daughter had her 0th birthday_party here doing pottery painting .
F	she had a great time and the staff were very helpful and friendly .
F	we have also bought various pairs of shoes and trainers from here and again the staff have been friendly and my children have also had a good choice of shoes to choose from .
F	thank_you very much
F	i placed an order late one evening and received a phone call from a member of the team on the following_morning checking with me because the order had gone_through twice .
F	i spoke to two ladies who were lovely and i did only want to order the items once which saved me the hassle of receiving them and then having to return the items .
F	i have already_recommended this website to other people as i was extremely pleased with the whole_process !
F	many_thanks
F	i have just finished sage course , left it for last_minute though but once i sat down to get on with it i found it really easy to follow , even without much accounts experience .
F	could do with simple explanation of basic computer stuff - for example - click ok to exit , rather then move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen and left click on ok button once , except this all great and very pleased .

F	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine ' s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
F	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn ' t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
F	we waited until 0 . 00pm but couldn ' t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
F	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
F	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
F	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
F	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
F	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
F	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn ' t use eflorist .
F	i was reading the reviews whilst waiting for my tesco ' s shopping to be delivered .
F	doesn ' t feel you with confidence as there are a lot of negative_reviews but i was pleasantly_surprised !
F	anyway , i had a delivery for between 0pm - 00pm .
F	they arrived at 0 . 00pm .
F	friendly driver , he even apologised for the wait .
F	he advised that only one item was missing ( it was chocolate so quite upsetting lol !).
F	anyway , eggs were in the order and he checked them over before handing them to me .
F	very courteous and much_appreciated .
F	unpacked all the shopping and was happy that all the fresh items had at_least 0 days until expiry .
F	the only item that had a couple of days was some strawberries but in fairness , when you buy strawberries in the shop , they have a maximum of 0 days anyway .
F	thats it , all good , no_complaints ( they are probably saving my waistline not having the chocolate in stock !)
F	and i would use again .
F	i ' ve been using quidco for a few_years now but have really started to use it more intensely recently .
F	well , what can i say ?
F	i always shop on a quidco friendly site .
F	its all worth it , from 00p to Â£_00 . 00 , everything adds up .
F	most of the purchases track , but its easy to raise a claim if they don ' t .
F	i pay the Â£ 0 a year ( although you can opt for the free membership ) as it is nice to be able to receive my cashback quicker .
F	plus the live_chat option is really helpful and the staff are really quick to respond by email if you have a query .
F	i now kick myself if i ever buy something online and don ' t quidco it !!
F	in the last 0 months i have managed to track Â£_000 of cashback - 00_% of that has already been paid into my bank and the rest will probably come within the next couple of months .
F	easy money for doing nothing but clicking through !
F	super_fast service , received within 00_hours of ordering .
F	brilliant !
F	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
F	we ordered
F	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
F	it ' s wonderful but difficult to get around the screen to clean the bath .
F	- cube dual with quadrato head and ceiling arm .
F	very pretty
F	- quadra waterfall bath filler .
F	- quadra waterfall side lever basin mixer tap .
F	everyone love this .
F	- prima soft close toilet seat .
F	does exactly_what it says on the tin !
F	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
F	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
F	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan branch provided a solution .
F	without him they would have lost the sale to a competitor .
F	following on from reviewing a company trustpilot contacted me saying my negative_review of said company was in breach of their guidelines .
F	i edited by review to bring it inline and it went live .
F	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide_evidence to my purchase .
F	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
F	this is not the case .
F	i ' m now being questioned on what i purchased , as if that is relevant whether i bought a chair or a table !
F	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
F	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
F	this is the second time i have used this company and i will_continue to use them .
F	ordering online is easy and getting the tyres_fitted at a time and place convenient for myself is vital .
F	i would definitely_recommend to other people .
F	from start to finish i received constant contact from them updating me of everything and when i had placed the wrong delivery address they changed it quickly without hassle .
F	they also allowed me to track my item even_though i took advantage of the free postage available !
F	great company quick delivery too !!
F	would recommend to friends for sure !
F	i had some questions_regarding the layout of our_wedding invites and found the company to be really helpful and provided some good advice .
F	we ordered a proof to check the final layout ourselves also and this was all sent speedily so the order could be placed , as an impatient bride to be this was greatly_appreciated !
F	would definately_recommend !
F	contacted tyres on the drive & they were very friendly on the phone , i told them i live on a terraced street so the car would be on the road & they said this was no problem .
F	they gave a 0 hour time_slot & arrived just before .
F	chris & matt were very friendly & polite , and even_though i had ordered a new tyre , they told me that my tyre was in really good condition just had a tiny nail causing a slow puncture .
F	they gave me the option of having the new tyre or having it repaired for less_than half the price .
F	can ' t help but think many places would have taken the tyre , repaired it themselves & made the money on it , but instead they saved me Â£_00 .
F	excellent service & value for money & i would definitely_recommend .
F	the most professional company i have dealt_with for a long time .
F	good customer_service and very helpfull staff .
F	very have Â£_00 of my cash and won ' t return it .
F	can ' t get any response from then .
F	spent Â£Â£Â£ on their chargeable phone line trying to rectify their mistakes .
F	useless robots in a call_centre ( south_africa ?)
F	who say they will sort it out , then do nothing .
F	been in tears .
F	need my money back .
F	it ' s xmas !!!!
F	!
F	very impressed with mazuma .
F	very easy to arrange for the mobile to be sent off and i got paid the amount i was promised very quickly .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	being a full time ( 0am - 0pm ) worker , it is always hard to arrange time off for my service & mot every year and then trying to sort transport whilst the car is gone but this solves all my problems !
F	i didn ' t even have to leave my office and received a call to confirm if i wanted them to do the recommended work or not ... fabulous service !
F	i was recommended to your company and i can see why , i would recommend to anyone ... 00 out of 00 !
F	i buy natracare sanitary products as i am unable to use normal ones due to allergies .
F	my local supermarkey has now stopped selling them and i didn ' t know what i was going to do until i found the natural woman website .
F	they have the full range of products and are the same price that i paid in the supermarket .
F	the postage was resonable and were delivered very quickly , they are lifesavers to me !
F	i ramdomly found this website and so glad i did .
F	have bought loads from it and so have a lot of my friends and family .
F	people can ' t believe i only paid Â£ 0 for most of the things i ' ve got .
F	if something isn ' t right , they refund / exchange really easily and have never had a problem with them at all !
F	recommend it to everyone !
F	!
F	i ' ve been shopping in divine_trash for years the staff are always friendly , helpfull , and full of advice their products are bang on trend and very good value for money never disappointed x
F	excellent website , easy to navigate .
F	very useful product info , videos and reviews .
F	goods arrived next_day .
F	all in all , brilliant service , thank_you webtogs !
F	ordered on the wednesday and my order arrived on the thursday !
F	could not have been better especially over the christmas_period !

F	will_defo be using the service again thanks again catherine xxxx
F	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
F	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
F	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
F	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
F	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
F	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand tied them .
F	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
F	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
F	i am furious !
F	hope to be getting a refund !
F	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
F	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
F	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
F	really pleased to find the shoes i wanted at such a reasonable_price .
F	ordered my usual salomon size but they were too big so sent them back for an exchange .
F	received an_email confirmation of receipt of the returned goods and that the replacements had been dispatched .
F	that was yesterday and this morning the shoes were here .
F	amazing !
F	why aren ' t all mail order companies this good ?
F	i will_definitely be using outdoorkit again .
F	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it ' s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i ' ve tried several numbers .
F	i ' ve now written to bbc_watchdog and copied them this thread as well as writing to groupon about it .
F	will let you know what happens .
F	used this company for the first time and i am pleased to say i will_definitely use them again .
F	my goods arrived in very good time and i was delighted with the costs compared to purchasing these items fro the vet .
F	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
F	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
F	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
F	total_waste of time !!!
F	!
F	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont be keeping my money !!
F	!
F	servicing_stop did a wonderful job and i would certainly recommend them to my friends .
F	they picked_up my car on time , done the mot and returned it in spotless condition .
F	they saved me lots of time and money .
F	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
F	to this day , i still_haven ' t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
F	looking at previous reviews , it seems that the only way to get a response from wowcher is to leave poor feedback on a public forum , so here goes .
F	the lack of respect in answering potential customer ' s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won ' t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
F	compared brands to multiple sites and there ' s nothing like this one !
F	only used once , but would certainly order from the company in future !
F	speedy dispatch / delivery & was kept_informed of progress .
F	the item was very competitively_priced & arrived as_described .
F	horrendous experience !!
F	ordered my brother ' s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan ..( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
F	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn ' t have the courtesy to actually inform me of this in the 0wks since ).. then it turned_out they hadn ' t refunded the shipping ... so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
F	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer_service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn ' t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for Â£ 0 . 00 ... gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
F	shop with very at your peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don ' t care about shocking service ....
F	this is a comprehensive travel policy that has the ability to cover you for whatever and wherever you are going at a great rate .
F	moreover , the customer_service team are friendly , helpful and easy to get in touch with .
F	so far , so good ... now all i have to do is start travelling with the knowledge that everything that might happen can be sorted out !
F	using hostel_bookers is so easy - they even give you directions to the place !
F	winning !!
F	it is really easy to see the best deals and where each place is in town !
F	sometimes i think the reviews are a bit harsh on places , but it is super helpful to read about the positives and negatives of each place !
F	i will_definitely keep using this site !
F	everything went_smoothly .
F	we got the good quotes on the first day , amongst them was the perfect one .
F	it was really a great help .
F	i recently_bought the finger mouse fan club tee .
F	i loved that programme and think it is a fab idea to put video clips on each page of the website - a real feel good factor .
F	the tee arrived really quickly and is fantastic quality , so soft and washes really well .
F	i want to get some more tees as christmas_gifts .
F	what a great way to bring back your childhood during the festive season !!
F	thank_you so much .
F	i was a bit_unsure of using a site like this however it couldn ' t have been easier .
F	i registered my phone and the free paid envelope arrived within 0 days , i sent the phone and again within 0 days the money was in my account , overall the whole transaction took approx 0 week super
F	very quick from point of ordering to delivery .
F	very reasonably_priced .
F	the print has come out amazing , colours are sharp and vibrant and looks fabulous .
F	very very pleased with it .
F	thank_you .
F	ive brought quiet a few perfumes from here and every one has been excellent value for money compared to high_street prices .
F	my most_recent was burberry body intense which is normally Â£_00 but on here was Â£_00 .
F	excellent , very happy customer once again .
F	fast delivery even with standard .
F	well_packaged .
F	will_definitely be buying more from here in the future .
F	i love this website !
F	its saved me quite a bit of money just by changing my online shopping habits slightly .
F	some companies can take a bit long to come through but ive never had any_problems .
F	love the payout options as well , i usually pay mine onto my clubcard and keep it for christmas .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
F	i hadn ' t ordered anything in months .
F	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn ' t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
F	we have worked with passion_digital for a number of years and never once have we experienced a problem .
F	work is always of a high_quality , delivered quickly , and the team are a pleasure to deal with .
F	highly_recommended !
F	no_problems , were interested in my feed_back
F	they stole our money .
F	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release_travel hadn ' t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
F	we paid release months before .
F	of course there was no one answering release_travel " we ' ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
F	the hen was distraught .
F	have since looked up their credit history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven ' t paid up .
F	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
F	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
F	we got ours back by going down and visiting them in person , when they said the cheque would be ready .
F	which they had said about 00 times before .
F	ordered loads of shoes from everything five pounds .
F	they are such good quality !
F	i ' ve paid 00x as much for worse !
F	also had some jumpers and these are good for the price .
F	and a bag .
F	all the shoes come with replacement heels which is great
F	postage is expensive but its still well worth it .
F	have made a few orders from northern_parrots and always well_packaged , quick .
F	they have great choice of food etc and you can get everything you need for your bird here .
F	brilliant .
F	i have a few samsung products .
F	tv , fridge_freezer , oven , microwave , washing_machine , and phone .
F	i have never had a problem with anything except the fridge_freezer , and when i did it was out of warranty .
F	however as it was a known fault samsung sent someone within 00_hours to fix it and charged me nothing .
F	( id had the fridge for years too )
F	they then followed up to check we were happy .
F	thankyou samsung .
F	bad customer_services , useless don ' t know what each other are doing !
F	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
F	account often wrong and still now having problems with them trying to charge me money i don ' t owe !!!
F	all in all avoid very !
F	awful tried to charge me over Â£_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
F	awful customer_service , rude and arrogant .
F	goods terrible quality please avoid .
F	false economy using studio !!
F	!
F	the shop has so much to choose from and the staff are very helpful , they give you all the information you need and an all_round well_mannered , great service from the whole team .
F	i have order from abloomnova for couple years already , love there salon size product , always get back to me as soon as i have questions , love there free world wide shipping , i live in canada , but sometimes ill order for my aunt in hong_kong , usually take 0 days then she will get it .
F	we all know the impact of bulk sms marketing .
F	it is by_far the best way to approach your target audience .
F	i was dealing_with a bulk messaging company earlier but i started having problems with them regarding their rates as well as timings .
F	i was being charged a lot more_than i was told .
F	found voodoo sms as i was browsing .
F	its been a year i have been doing_business with them and as their name suggests , they are magical !
F	due to their advice and reasonable ( not ascending every other day ) charges i am having a great time with them .
F	i have seen constant on - site improvement and hope to see more .
F	keeping in touch internationally from mobiles was never affordable unless i got to know about inclusive international_calls .
F	i have used digital calling_cards before and was enjoying cheap international_calls but then i came_across iic i tried it because free sounds better_than cheap and to my surprise its totally free .
F	talking for free with my 00 inclusive minutes feels great .
F	now i can stay connected to my friends with free international_calls from the uk .
F	making free calls from mobiles is amazing when it is truly free .
F	000 numbers has surprised me with their reliable follow me numbers services .
F	i had to call my customers but i wasn ' t in the uk .
F	000 numbers proved to be very handy as i got to hide my private number .
F	they are cheap yet very reliable .
F	i must_say that the service is amazing .
F	i found it really easy and cheap to call my friends in scotland and australia .
F	there is no more gibberish when making long_distance international_calls to your friends .
F	i would suggest digital calling_cards to everyone who want to stay connected with friends without burdening their pockets .
F	excellent service .
F	staff were extremely_helpful .
F	thank_you .
F	easy to order , great range of products and really quick delivery .
F	have never had any_problems
F	this was my second order from gj titmuss and once again i was completely stunned by how quickly the order was processed and had been delivered to my door !!
F	needless to say my dog is very happy with the delivery and my purse is happy with how cheap the dog_food is .
F	would highly_recommend !!
F	fantastic customer_service !
F	of course after christmas we ' re all feeling a bit skint so i decided to sell my n00 and n00 to mazumba .
F	i ' d looked around and they were offering the most money .
F	i registered on the website which took a couple of minutes and they sent the paperwork through which arrived 0 days_later .
F	i then sent my phones on the monday and by tuesday lunch time the money was in my bank , exactly_what they said they would pay me , no questions , no hassle !
F	very pleased and surprised at how easy it was !
F	where do i begin ?
F	always check your receipts !
F	on one of these shops , 0 / 0 of the products i ordered were unavailable , on other shops huge amounts were unavailable .
F	regular promotion mistakes - always in tesco ' s favour , never customers .
F	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i ' d say .
F	deliveries made outside of a 0 hour time_slot 0 out of 0 times .
F	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
F	cheated on promotional points
F	0 / 0 shops was short changed on points
F	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn ' t deliver goods advertised ( 0 weeks in a row )
F	check your reciepts with care !!
F	!
F	i recently_bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .
F	in each boxset , there was one disc which was for a different season of the same show .
F	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
F	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
F	i would rather pay an extra few pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
F	ordered a personalized mug , which was delievered on time and great quality .
F	really pleased with my purchase and would highly_recommend !
F	tried to buy the same sunglasses from a different company as was so messed_around , so i tried blaze instead and i ' m so pleased i did .
F	i just received my sunglasses , ( arrived the next_day as promised ) they look a lot better_than the picture .
F	would definitely buy from this site again , and will be recommending to all my friends !!!!
F	very happy customer !!!
F	! 00
F	dear_sir / madam ,
F	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
F	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
F	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
F	) as it got to 0pm i was worried , our shopping was not going to arrive . we are on benefits , and therfore have no spare money what so ever .
F	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
F	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
F	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give Â£_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
F	i was told to go back through my orders on . com and to apply my e_- vouchers so the balance outstanding would therefore be Â£_00 . 00 .
F	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
F	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
F	so now i am back too square0 .
F	as i will never shop with . com again after this disaster , i did not want the e_- vouchers taking off my next shop , i wanted the money off the shop that was due !
F	i was told the driver had said he knocked at our door and there was no answer , which is a lie as we firstly have a camera too prove he never came to the door and so do our neighbours .
F	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
F	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
F	we arrived at the store at 00pm , after taking daughter too doctors .
F	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
F	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
F	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
F	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
F	he said he made a phone call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
F	this i was told will take 0 - 0 days too show in bank .
F	( i just hope it arrives )...
F	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
F	my husband then went too find my mum instore as she had got bored off sitting in car , as it was all taking ages ..
F	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
F	he was going too approach mr mike norbury in store , but i adviced too come away and complain to head_office .
F	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
F	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
F	0 .
F	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
F	0 . missing cheese ,
F	0 . squashed bread ,
F	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
F	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
F	i want this sorting asap ...
F	mr and mrs preston
F	absolutely fantastic !
F	i got exactly_what i wanted how i wanted it for a great price and quality to match .
F	i would definitely_recommend using their services !
F	there website is easy to use and their staff are always helpful and answer my questions quickly and thoroughly .
F	the products are exactly_what you order and i have been able to return things easily and quickly when needed .
F	i would recommend using them , i did all my christmas shopping here which was much_easier than rambling through town during busy hours .
F	i ' ve ordered business_cards from another online supplier and been disappointed .
F	after a lot of research i decided to use moo - and i ' ve never been happier with an end_result like this at an affordable price .
F	brilliant business_cards at very high_quality and i could easily adapt and change my design on the website .
F	i definitely_recommend using moo and will be using them in the future for my business from now on .
F	fantastic - keep it up !
F	i have had no bad_experiences from here at all !
F	all of the items i have purchased have been exactly as_described and cheaper_than ebay !
F	it took me ages to try to get the lense in my eye properly because it was so flimsy .
F	it ended_up tearing rendering the lense useless .
F	disgusted by the product .
F	the customer_service , pricing and availability make this the one stop_shop for online supplements .
F	you ' ll never find a price that they wont beat by 0 %
F	i recently opened an account with next and was really disappointed .
F	i ordered some cultery Â£_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .
F	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
F	i had to send them back asap and of course i had to pay for the return as well .
F	now the only thing that i ' ll order from them is flowers !!!!
F	!
F	ordered a camcorder and a freeview box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
F	i explained that i hadn ' t recieved the item yet and then the rep tells_me that not only did i get the camcorder 0 weeks_ago i signed for it !!!!
F	as advised i checked the garden shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
F	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
F	( when i asked the rep about the freeview box she said it was out of stock ).
F	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
F	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email telling_me that the complaint has been sent to the courier company but still i ' ve heard_nothing .
F	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
F	shocking !!!!!
F	!
F	recently spent some time in hospital and came home 0 days before my son ' s birthday .
F	i placed my order with amazon and son was skating around the house the next_day on his new skateboard .
F	thanks amazon , you saved the day once again .
F	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
F	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
F	i ' ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
F	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
F	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
F	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
F	**_update **
F	0th_february_0000
F	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
F	it didn ' t happen !!!
F	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
F	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
F	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i ' d be emailed back .
F	this did not happen either .
F	the service is shockingly disgusting .
F	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
F	let ' s see how long it is to take for this refund .
F	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
F	!
F	dissapointed that some things out of order but all in all great service with fast convenient delivery
F	surprisingly efficient , trustworthy and accurate info thank_you kathy !
F	hq_hair is the website for all things beauty , it has a wide_range of beauty products and all best brands to choose from .
F	delivery and service is quick and the prices are competitive , perfect !
F	i ordered 0 white horizon bar stools on late tuesday night and they arrived first thing thursday_morning .
F	the stools were extremely easy to put_together and are supplied with alan key do so .
F	i am no diy expert and i had two children under age of 0 trying to help but in matter of minutes i had two fantastic bar stools .
F	i hunted high and low matching prices of bar stools and these where the lowest_price , being cheap price doesn ' t reflect on the quality , they are very well made .
F	they are very comfortable and the lever action to raise and lower stool is very smooth and easy .
F	the white faux_leather is white and not off white , look brilliant in my white gloss white and oak kitchen .
F	very happy with the stools and the quality if service from lakeland furniture .
F	thank_you .
F	i recieved my items extremely quick and they are brilliant .
F	excellent value for money too
F	just ordered a new bathroom_suite and i love it !
F	everything arrived on time and the advise i got was really useful , excellent customer_service and really high_quality products !
F	i ordered a coat for a christmas_present and considering the busy time of year it was delivered within 00_hours .
F	i then had to return the jacket as it was too big and wanted to exchange it , i called the customer_service number and it was so easy and the customer_service agent explained the process clearly and put my mind at rest that i would get my item back and within a short timeframe .
F	good prices , quick service , polite and helpful staff - what more could you ask for when ordering online !
F	really easy to use , fast postage , love the free things that come in the packages .
F	i always recommend to people !
F	website really easy to navigate around reviews are very useful , when trying to pick where to book , 0st time booked a holiday this way and was surprised to find how easy it all was booked hotel flights and transfers all via website .
F	fantastic service quick , easy an efficient .
F	would use again .
F	great communication and incredibly fast payment .
F	really like the option to print off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
F	i went via topcashback and as a first timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options available .
F	and the prices were good too !
F	it ' s so easy to use and you get paid for shopping !
F	what more could you ask for ?
F	i recommend topcashback to everyone !
F	i did a lot of research before replacing a very dodgy cheap lamona dishwasher that had been unreliable for about a year .
F	we decided on a Â£_000_+ neff after talking to a john_lewis salesman and reading which ?, however due to finances we had to lower our budget by Â£_000 .
F	we had slightly low expectations vs the neff however we are both very pleased with the baumatic .
F	beautifully quiet , due to the cutlery tray i can fit lots more in and everything comes out clean .
F	it feels sturdy and well built .
F	the negatives which i ' d already read about prior to buying were that it took quite a while to assemble and my husband got quite grumpy with the instructions and the trays can be wet post cycle , however importantly the plates are dry and once it ' s built those frustrations deminish !
F	i ' d definitely_recommend for the price !
F	i ordered my bath 0 weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0 weeks_later and was damaged .
F	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
F	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
F	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
F	he said it was common practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
F	i would strongly_suggest you ignore the cheap prices and pay Â£_00 more fomr a reputable company .
F	update_: to clarify following laurie ' s comments i have not yet had a refund as he stated .
F	however they have not collected the goods yet ... not sure why he would say they have refunded me yet ...
F	the bigboy bean_bag is a great accessory for any lounge !
F	it ' s super comfy , super convenient and looks cool too !
F	service from infrun was also top_notch , very prompt delivery and easy to use website .
F	00 out of 00 !
F	i stupidly lost my first pair of ray - ban wayfarers on holiday in ibiza ( after only four days of owning them ).
F	needless to say i was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact i ' d have to shell out another Â£_000 to replace them .
F	i decided to search the net to see if i could buy them any cheaper_than the full price i had initially spent in - store .
F	after doing a quick google_search , i stumbled_across sunglassesshop . com .
F	i was amazed at how much lower the prices were here than in the shops .
F	i was a bit_dubious at first , but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little , i quickly realised i had nothing to worry_about !
F	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for Â£_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!
F	absolutely amazing service and amazing price , i have recommended to all of my friends and will_definitely be using this site again .
F	( hopefully i won ' t lose this pair after four days though ...)
F	bought tickets to wireless for Â£_00 and very excited as rihannas only uk gig this year .
F	doulbe0 tickets informed us of every_stage , from email letting us know payment details , a text_saying when tickets were dispatched and special delivery so that they definitley reached our flat .
F	could not have asked for a better service .
F	just got to enjoy the concert now :-)
F	will use them again definitly !!!
F	!
F	ashleigh auld , knebworth xx
F	my iphone was coming with yodel .
F	i stayed in all day waiting and when tracked online that night they stated they had been to deliver at 0pm and nobody answered so they left a card .
F	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments .... yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .
F	rang customer_service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning ... still no delivery .
F	upon calling customer_services couldn ' t get through .
F	finally got through monday_morning and kept getting passed through departments and drivers .
F	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don ' t know if we get on with our neighbours ...
F	worst delivery experience i ' ve ever had !!
F	!
F	would definitely buy from this company again .
F	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .
F	product was better_than described , will shop there again .
F	highly_recommend !!
F	!
F	really happy how easy it is to find an hotel ... great prices ...
F	i think it is brilliant that you can choose the pay later option !
F	the customer_service at hellocanvas is amazing !
F	they are so attentive and bend_over backwards to help !
F	the products are super quality and are delivered quickly and the canvas comes really well_packed to make sue it arrives in perfect_condition .
F	i would recommend to all and i will be back for another canvas soon !
F	hostelbookers has a good collection of available places to stay , and an excellent database of reviews , which is very helpful for a traveller trying to find the best place to stay .
F	in addition , the website design is simple but informative , allowing a person to quickly find the information one is looking for .
F	there are so many different brands and styles of products to choose from for all ages and from serious to quirky !
F	i have bought several presents for friends ... and some for myself !
F	:)
F	i have had really good service which is a credit to the company they were very responsive to an_email i sent with a query .
F	my items came really well_packaged , which really is a bonus as it prevents any damage in the post !
F	i ' m very happy all_round and will_definitely shop with campus_gifts again and recommend you take a look too !
F	:)
F	our pre_- booked accommodation with a different company let us down with 00 days to go until we flew to mallorca with our two year_old_daughter .
F	we found the late deals section on james_villas and were so happy to find that we could book an entire villa with private pool for much less_than we had been originally paying for an apartment with shared pool .
F	we did book over the phone , as it was last_minute and we had a few questions , but this was all dealt_with by the advisors with friendly efficiency .
F	confirmation , info sheets and documents were in my email inbox within half an_hour .
F	our accommodation was clean , well equipped , and exactly as_described .
F	we found it first time of trying , using the extremely accurate driving directions emailed by the advisor .
F	the resort rep was very friendly and helpful when we contacted her for some info .
F	in summary , a beautiful villa , managed by a fantastic company , and outstanding value for money ( especially when booked last_minute !)
F	- highly_recommended .
F	i chose this company because they offered the best value for money to buy back the brazilian currency i had .
F	i used a comparison website to search for potential companies and covent_garden fx came out on top .
F	they were very fast and changed my money for pound sterling almost_instantly .
F	one piece of advice : the business is located at the other side of covent_garden from where google_maps says it is located .
F	i ' ve booked a number of hostel through hostelbookers and i ' ve never had any_problems with them .
F	i also find their prices are almost always cheaper_than hostelworld ' s .
F	loads of choice and an easy to navigate site !
F	the website is really easy to use and they send the envelops for you really quick !
F	and money goes straight into your bank_account !
F	fab !
F	the order arrived straight_away , not sure if iit was next_day as it was signed for by the manager downstairs but definatley within 0days ...
F	pleased to have received a loyalty discount which i used on this order and means i can order in bulk .
F	always use to buy our printers and consumables they are cheaper_than others i have tried
F	quick postage , well_packaged & reasonable prices !
F	they dont even deserve one star !!
F	this company are ripping people off !
F	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
F	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
F	they quoted me Â£_00 and offered me Â£_00 !
F	they then sent me an_email knowing i was displeased with this and so offered me Â£_00 .
F	frustratingly , they have credited my bank_account with Â£_00 !!!!!
F	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
F	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
F	avoid at all costs !!!!!
F	!
F	very happy with the service i received 0st time round , i then used them again !
F	i would highly_recommend sell - your - laptop to family and friends due to the nice , friendly and informative service that i received and no extra_charges to pick it up the laptop from the courier !
F	:) the methods of payments you have a choice of , and with in a couple of hours of them receiving my laptop , and assessing it , they then made the payment the same day .
F	extremely happy with the over all service , staff are friendly and they offer you the best prices for your laptops !
F	the website is easy to navigate and the updates i receive are very welcomed and informative .
F	the ordering_process from beginning to end has always been spot on .
F	i ' ve been buying different professional haircare products and always received them in time .
F	will buy in future as well cause of the best prices .
F	have lots of friends who is satisfied too .
F	will recommend them .
F	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for a few_years now & i always book through them .
F	i don ' t even bother to attempt looking at other_websites anymore .
F	this is by_far the most helpful & efficient way to book a vacation !!
F	!
F	quick easy service
F	ordered headphones paid extra for next_day delivery three days on still_waiting .
F	they now say they have took the money but wont despatch the item as there is a discrepancy with my address .
F	what a load of rubbish .
F	cant find a number to call them .
F	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
F	please dont order from this company
F	brilliant and very fast service from sarah_hayes .
F	she was very polite , helpful and quick to source the problem and fix it for us .
F	thanks so much !
F	i could not fault her .
F	i am very happy with this company and this product - i ordered it on the tuesday and recieved by the friday , even living in north east scotland !
F	the camera is better_than_expected and i willl be buying from this website again !
F	best deal on the internet - could not be_happier !
F	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
F	however , way too expensive .
F	it ' s an awesome site which makes it really easy to find and book_hostels online .
F	most of the time i find that it ' s cheaper_than the other hostel booking sites and even the hostels own websites !
F	which i have to add ..... is also awesome =).
F	the site is really easy to use , being_able to look at the room type available without having to click on the hostel every time is a bonus for me , as is being_able to sort it by price ( either dorm or private ).
F	obviously having no booking_fees is also great and i personally like that i don ' t have to sign_up to the site to book things through it .
F	in all , well it ' s prety awesome really and i ' ve been using it for years when i ' ve needed it .
F	they have the lowes price of anyone
F	a very easy website to use .
F	anyvan provided some very competitive quotes which saved us a fortune .
F	the service worked exactly as_described and our bed was delivered to our door .
F	this worked out much cheaper_than hiring a van ourselves and we wouldn ' t hesitate to use them again in the future .
F	[_name ] was great with the non - stop calls , she was like my conscious speaking .. i just had to put the money aside to finally do my website !
F	[_name ] didn ' t stop creating until i was 000_% happy .
F	only thing i ' m not happy about is it doesn ' t have a mobile site , i can ' t see my website fully from my iphone_0s .
F	otherwise perfect service .
F	mazuma has exceeded my expectation yet again , such a speedy service with updates_throughout the whole_process .
F	not only that but now bank_transfers are available so money is in your account even quicker .
F	will_continue to use mazuma every time !
F	anytime i have placed an order it has always came within a few_days .
F	there website is very easy to use and their products are great value for money .
F	would definately_recommend their company !
F	i recently_bought a pre_- owned guitar , so there was only one in stock which showed when i ordered online .
F	i had the guitar in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
F	i even got a free bag included with the guitar , with a couple of plectrums in it !
F	i had to call the store because the guitar strap i ordered was not included in the package .
F	the member of staff apologised and promised to send it straight_away ( even_though i insisted there was no rush ).
F	again , this package arrived next_day , with no_quibbles .
F	excellent service and would thoroughly_recommend .
F	if you want to buy a buggy that ' s not fit for purpose then be my guest my daughter is only 0 months and my buggy is currently back with them for the third time having collapsed with my daughter in it and i repeat for the third time !
F	i love my quinny buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
F	why i would send my buggy off three times for apparently nothing is beyond me !
F	they offer a really decent price for tyre and fitting .
F	when they came out to fit new tyre tony the tyre fiter was excellent , fitted the new tyre in no time and took the time to look at my other tyres and even put air into my front_tyres that where slightly down .
F	great customer_service really went the extra_mile for me !
F	highly_recommend .
F	ordered a t - shirt for my husband on the thursday_afternoon , by friday_evening he was wearing it , such fast delivery !
F	excellent quality item which fits my husband well , and excellent communication from truffleshuffle , i ' ll be using them again as plenty of items caught my eye as i was searching for this .
F	not only do they have the best prices online , if you can find it cheaper elsewhere they will beat it .
F	shipping is always fast and there are always many different samples you can get " free " with order .
F	ordered late_afternoon on friday and received my brand_new toshiba 00 " the next_day on saturday_morning and driver called up to let me know he ' s coming within a hour !
F	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
F	received text with 0 hour time to receive the items and i did within that 0 hour time_frame !
F	amazing service not sure whats with the bad_reviews
F	i wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending ecareers to friends .
F	the course i did in sage was thorough and easy to navigate , and the couple of times i had any_problems with passwords or certificates the online_chat was really quick , easy and friendly to use .
F	really great customer_service .
F	000_% recommended .
F	impressed with fast efficient service and delivery .
F	would definitely use animed_direct again .
F	gjw titmuss has an easy to use website , low_cost products of good quality and very prompt delivery .
F	i was extremely impressed and i would use them again !
F	kevin at holidays_please always got back to me asap .
F	i also found them dramatically cheaper_than other holiday websites .
F	would definitely use them again
F	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
F	very helpful and very fast !
F	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel .... knowing full well how awful they are !
F	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
F	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don ' t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
F	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
F	the parcel was apparently delivered to me last_night at 00pm ( even_though yodel only deliver until 0pm ) and i had apparently signed for it !
F	even_though i was fast asleep in bed by this time .
F	i can only assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves ....... absolutely_useless !
F	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
F	half an_hour after that delivery slot ended i rechecked the tracking_information to find that they had apparently attempted delivery but no one was home !
F	i had been home all day !
F	after trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer_service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it ' s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
F	the man at the depot contacted the driver who said he attempted delivery and was here for 00_minutes and left a calling_card - ( i have a locked mailbox and it wasnt there !)
F	so i can only assume they just couldn ' t be bothered to deliver ..... i ' m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
F	first attempt in my view ) so we shall see ....
F	very easy to use , simply printed , posted and got paid !
F	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
F	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
F	i now don ' t have the box as i didn ' t need to send it with the phone .
F	so i ' ll get less selling privately .
F	not at all happy .
F	will be using mazuma next time ...
F	also received an_email after i ' d sent the phone saying they hadn ' t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
F	not impressed !
F	order cam earlier_than_expected , everything was well_packaged and it great condition , not forgetting the little sweets they give you with every order made !
F	never_fails to disappoint me , amazing service !!!!
F	!
F	recently_bought a few items for my wedding preps and found that glitter monster was great .
F	prices were really reasonable and very quick in delivery .
F	definiately would recommend .
F	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
F	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
F	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
F	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
F	the website has a tracking facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn ' t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
F	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
F	no card has been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
F	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn ' t have showed my id .
F	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
F	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
F	!
F	i am now out of pocket because of losing a days pay waiting around for them , i have run up a huge bill trying to get hold of them , and i ' ve lost the item i should have received .
F	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
F	i had a lot of messing_around with envirofone , so got my phone back and sent it straight to mazuma .
F	i sent my mobile to them yesterday , today it has been processed and the money is already in my account !
F	i am absolutely over the moon with this service .
F	i would definitely_recommend them to everybody looking to sell their old phone .
F	honestly couldn ' t fault them .
F	i will only ever use these from now on .
F	thank_you so much for a great , fast and easy service !
F	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
F	i went on to my account today to find they ' d knocke the price down by Â£_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
F	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
F	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
F	i ' m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won ' t pay the price that the phone is worth !
F	the fact is , it costs Â£_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
F	well i ' m not giving them that satisfaction .
F	i ' ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
F	rip_off_merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
F	!
F	simply got a hd cable for my new tv .
F	ordered online and picked_up at store .
F	very simple and good price
F	my friend used funktionevents because of their good reviews and helpfulness on the phone .
F	i told her at the time of booking the hen_party that i doubt they will deliver everything as good as they promise for that low price , but to my amazement they delivered everything brilliantly .
F	our hotel in manchester was very centre ( the midland hotel ) and very luxury with a swimming_pool .
F	the service here was great and i was happy that funktion managed to get us in there for a hen_party .
F	activities - dance party , sms treasure_hunt and meal .
F	these were all excellent and exactly_what we had been told ( no little nasty suprises ) and again all very central around the hotel .
F	overall , even_though my friend dealt_with funktion_events , i must_admit that they did everything we asked for at a great price .
F	use this company if you want no hassle and top quality !
F	loved the cocktail_making class which was part of my friends hen_party .
F	everyone enjoyed it and had plenty of cocktails to drink plus food .
F	thanks and will be recommending
F	i ordered 0 pairs of contact_lenses as it was the first time i had used lenstore .
F	i was pleased with the very quick delivery , and as far as i can tell the lenses are the same as what i usually get from my opticians , but significantly_cheaper .
F	i ' ll be ordering more !
F	i ' ve ordered quite a few things from very and i ' ve never had any troubles with any aspect of them .
F	delivery is always very fast and p_& p charges are always fair .
F	i love wowchers !
F	they have so many different things on offer there ' s something for everybody and the prices are always brilliant !
F	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
F	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .
F	the money was transferred into my account a few_days after i posted them the phone - easy_peasy .
F	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
F	!
F	i recieced email_updates_throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
F	really pleased with my purchase as i ' ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !
F	thanks for a really efficient service , highly_recommended .
F	the team at cambridge printing . com are more_than 0_stars in our opinion .
F	our quotes come back within minutes and are always the most competitive , they are very conscientious regarding our delivery dates and times as we often need things turned round ridiculously fast or delivered to random hotels !
F	they have done special printing for us of one off things things we ' ve needed like posters or intricate pop ups , and sometimes they even deliver to us by cycle courier in the snow and rain .
F	we ' d never go anywhere_else for our printing .
F	well_done cambridge , you ' re the best :))))
F	from everyone at clickview ltd
F	always foun what i need on amazon and the prices are great !
F	always find what i want and the prices are right .
F	always received great service .
F	the whole experience from beginning to end was easy , seemless and hasle free !
F	what a pleasant_experience .
F	i will certainly recommend mazumamobile to friends , family and colleagues !
F	thank_you .
F	quite happy with the main product and speed of delivery , but unfortunately the manufacturer had changed the item : this hadn ' t been reflected in the product description .
F	in essence , we ' d chosen the item because the ' freebie ' it came with made it good value compared to other sellers .
F	unfortunately , the freebie item was no_longer included .
F	when i contacted customer_services , they were great , apologised and assured me that they would contact the manufacturer , who would send the ' missing ' item directly .
F	this was followed the next_day by another email_confirming that the item would be sent , but then by yet another email the day after , telling us that the product had been changed and no_longer came with the freebie .
F	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
F	a shame , as up to that point was happy with the service .
F	have used hostelbookers a few_times and would def_recommend .
F	secure your hostel with 00_% deposit and pay no booking_fees , unlike_other similar websites .
F	search_filters made choosing a lot_easier .
F	i was very happy with the selection and great deals .
F	very good , easy to use website , competitive price relative to hostelworld . com and no fee !
F	amazing !
F	i always love buying with fragrance_direct .
F	always !
F	when the product didn ' t arrive due to postal issues , they immediately sent out another which arrived rapidly .
F	i ' ve been very impressed
F	i love google and i couldnt live without it .
F	a credit to the internet , super , super ace site .

F	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
F	i quicker to get in your car spend 0 hours in the supermarket and come home than trying to order a weekly_shop on this site .
F	i will not use again until the site is improved .
F	bad layout , bad company , bad seller , bad products , i will never use ebay again as long as i live .
F	when receiving my bath suite the courier was going to leave it in the middle of my drive but eventually pushed it into my garage after explaining i had cleared a space .
F	i had ordered what the plumber had told me so left it for him to check when he was coming , when installing it we soon realised we had the wrong sink 0 holes instead of 0 , when i rang up they apologised and said they would send the correct one out but couldn ' t send it out till the day after next as they ' d missed the courier however the plumber could not come back then as they had another job so i ' m without a sink when i received the correct one the plastic bit that goes in the drainage hole was snapped and broken luckily i had another from the wrong sink to replace it , the following_day after realising we had the wrong sink when the plumber was installing the shower tray the waste was missing to save time he popped out to buy one but the cheapest was Â£_00 i rang customer_service to tell them and by that time i was very frustrated i explained this was the second mistake and i was not happy they agreed to pass it on to the manager and the manager would ring me this was 0am in the morning it got to 0pm and still no phone call so i rang them back and i was told i had been given a refund i asked how much and i was told Â£_00 !
F	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste pipe and having to pay Â£_00 for another waste pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste pipe so they couldn ' t give me anymore ... ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more_than Â£_00 i was told i had only paid Â£_00 . 00 for the shower tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for Â£_00 .
F	i asked how i could make a complaint and basically was fobbed_off as that ' s the number i would ring to make a complaint or i can send an_email which is to them anyway so i did this i emailed and asked for a reply from the manager but i still didn ' t get anywhere it took 0 days to get a reply from the manager and was told i should of checked my items and they had given me Â£_00 as a goodwill_gesture .
F	disgusting customer care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am Â£_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and Â£_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
F	received money the next_day very fast and reliable , will use again !
F	!
F	i spend so much money on beauty products and get nothing in return .

F	thankyou for my free_gifts !

F	initial advised by vets to start my somewhat overweight cat on a special diet - dr jill ' s metabolic .
F	extortionate price at the vets and very difficult to source online due to it being a new diet and also requires vet support .
F	found viovet to be both exceptionally good value for money and provided excellent up to date information and progress on order !
F	will be buying from here again !!
F	!
F	my orders always arrive really quickly and i ' ve never had an issue with anything i ' ve ordered from them .
F	i love how they will let you know if something comes back into stock .
F	my recent order was a t - shirt i wanted to get my boyfriend for christmas .
F	his size wasn ' t in stock so i asked to be told when it was .
F	that ' s exactly_what they did and now i have his present all ready to go !
F	amazing site with amazing customer care and very professional .
F	a large_amount of products of any prize range .
F	recommended
F	my mother and father are both medical patients and a considerable_amount of our money is spent on buying medications for them .
F	at first i used to buy them from medical stores but then on my friend â_s recommendation decided to give chemist_direct a try .
F	i am happy that i made this decision because the medications remain the same but the prices are low which means that i can save up on 000_dollars atleast every month .
F	got my items on time no problem .
F	however , disappointed on how it was packaged , i ordered a pair of hunter boots and two_pairs of hunter socks which were squashed into the box , few scuff marks on the boots which came off thankfully .
F	other than that service was very good .
F	______________________________________________________________
F	update_: few_days ago i received a phone call from country house outdoors to say they read my review , asked if my item are okay and i am able to send the boots back from a new pair if damaged , as stated the marks did come off with a little_bit of rubbing the other items were fine .
F	they did compensate with a Â£_00 off voucher , which was a pleasant_surprise as its very rare for a company to even offer anything .
F	again very pleased with the service , would recommend .
F	added two extra stars for the after care event .
F	website is well_designed and easy to navigate , good product information and checkout is a breeze .
F	they even offer finance for large purchases , will_definitely use for my next bathroom project !
F	great communication at all stages of order , everything delivered together , competitive_pricing and easy to use checkout facility .
F	mazuma_mobile was easy to use .
F	quoted price for phone was given , and issued funds were received quickly .
F	the site has a friendly , clear and easy to use interface .
F	i was concerned cause it was my very first time using a site like this .
F	but everything turned ou just fine , the easiest reservation ever :)
F	firstly , i have bought a few things from groupon which were all fine , until i had to call them about one of the merchants .
F	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder mystery event on a particular date .
F	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don ' t work .
F	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
F	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
F	i waited another 00 days or so and called their call_centre again and they said that it had been passed only 0 working_days ago to customer care who would need another 00 working_days to investigate !
F	i complained as this would take us beyond the date that the event was taking place , the agent i spoke to was unhelpful and a bit rude and said i either wait or have groupon vouchers - i actually just wanted to go to the event so i said should i go or not as we don ' t know if it is tracking place but the agent just said she could not advise and that the voucher did not expire for a few_months - how could this be when the event was in less_than 0 weeks ?
F	i asked for a manager who was a lot more pleasant and said he understood and he would raise the issue again and explain that i need an answer in less_than 00 working_days as it is urgent , he also offered to credit me Â£_00 as a gesture .
F	this entire conversation took over 00_minutes on the phone .
F	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven ' t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
F	i could not believe it , i replied_saying i had spent over 00_minutes on the phone only yesterday and it was ridiculous as i was promised this would be dealt_with not closed , i requested someone call me to discuss it , but it has been 0 days now and i have not heard_anything - even_though they advertise emails will be replied to within 00_hours .
F	basically i ' ve been waiting almost a month and am no further forward , i don ' t know if i should turn_up for the event or not .
F	clearly groupon ' s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
F	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don ' t expect groupon to help !
F	they rock !
F	i came_across their site while searching for a weight_loss supplement .
F	not only do they carry a ton if product their prices are super reasonable !
F	i would have paid twice the amount at a gnc store for the supplement i wanted and that ' s including shipping !
F	so blessed to have come_across them !
F	my fridge_freezer broke_down so i needed a replacement as soon as possible .
F	i wanted a reliable , basic and sensibly priced unit with a fast delivery , i also need my broken unit recycled .
F	ao had the model i wanted and could deliver next_day , i spoke to friends that had also used ao and they couldn ' t recommend them highly_enough .
F	i ordered on - line which was easy and simple to do , i received text and emails confirming details and everything went_smoothly on the day of delivery .
F	delivery was really quick , was packaged well and all the items were as_described .
F	very reliable , would recommend and will use again in the near_future .
F	really quick delivery and free which is an extra amazing bonus and packaged really well .
F	wouldn ' t hesitate from buying from argento again and would highly_reccomend .
F	i had my first conference the other day , powwownow has the easiest set_up and the conference went great !
F	will be using powwownow for future calls from now on .
F	hostelbookers is so easy to book_hostels or any other place to stay when traveling .
F	you simply put in the information of where you will be traveling and what dates and the website gives you all your options to chose from extremely quick .
F	they compare every place to stay that matches your travel dates .
F	not only do they compare price , but also location , atmosphere , and other special characteristics of each place .
F	it is amazingly easy and fast and i recommend it to anyone !
F	i ordered 0 items for christmas_presents ; sjp nyc x0 , halle berry gift set , oo0 spray with gift .
F	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work colleague .
F	the nyc ' s , i had to just give to my mum and sis because they were so small .
F	not a good price .
F	i am extremely disappointed in the fact that the oo0 bought for my step dad arrived with an elastic band holding the spray to the gift .
F	surely , you could find a better way to package this so it doesn ' t look like i ' ve bought it off a market stall ?
F	i have now had to purchase a box just to make this look half decent .
F	really like this website , its cheap , you get freebies , fast delivery .
F	its just amazing .
F	recommend to everyone and from now in it will be the only website i use for perfume and aftershave .
F	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
F	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra Â£_00 to the price .
F	when i asked about it i was ignored .
F	been trying to get my refund ever since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
F	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
F	worst website i have ever shopped from in my life the customer_service is just disgusting , i advise everyone to avoid this website .
F	my husband purchased a cinema surround system from these people and whilst there are certainly better systems out there , it is a great system for the price we bought it for .
F	you always know what you ' re getting with these people and when you phone them you always get someone who_knows what they are talking_about .
F	bought a leather_sofa online and it was delivered in 0 weeks .
F	the sofa is fantastic quality and the service i have received has been exemplary .
F	well_done tesco !
F	whilst their prices are brilliant i feel that their customer_service leaves a lot to be desired as i bought an iron from them 0 month_ago and it broke .
F	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!
F	won ' t buy from them again .
F	i needed some replacement glasses after mine broke and they managed to get the frame i wanted even_though they did not list them on their website .
F	i got the glasses with free lenses delivered to my door 0 days_later and they didn ' t even charge a delivery fee .
F	the glasses are excellent quality and i ' ll definately use them again if my prescription changes .
F	magnificent shop .
F	very fast delivery to russia .
F	this product is very high_quality .
F	with pleasure i will order more .
F	thank_you .
F	i ordered flowers 0 days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
F	i ordered some goggles from here that said " in stock " online .
F	i then emailed a week_later after hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
F	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
F	the same_thing was said , so i asked to cancel ( as i am shortly leaving the country and don ' t have time to wait around .
F	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least Â£_000 below my price range ).
F	i picked the goggles as they were a certain spec that i desired and the alternatives were none of these .
F	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
F	so why , before this did it take a day or so more ?
F	they also didn ' t confirm my refund until i emailed them twice .
F	they may aswell have chucked my money back at me .
F	overall , i am totally appalled .
F	what a shocking service !
F	i just completed office 0000 course .
F	i found that it was easy to follow and the exercises were relevant .
F	i really feel that i know much more about the office sute now than i had known before i had the course and i feel_confident about my knowledge .
F	i would recomend it to anyone .
F	i have such great service from ao .
F	i love the website as it ' s easy to navigate , the reviews are very helpful as are the videos .
F	most appliances are cheaper_than in stores .
F	delivery was super_fast and i was kept_informed of delivery times .
F	the driver even called when half an_hour away .
F	i would use them again for sure !
F	needed a programme to download albums ( limewire is best for one song at a time ) a friend_recommended utorrent , so gave it a shot .
F	bit hard to use to start off with , but soon got to grips with it and best programme i have on my computer
F	had my phone stolen whilst out .
F	thought that would be the end of it until i received my bill .
F	i phoned o0 to discuss this and they were very helpful with the whole_process .
F	i have been a customer with them now for 0 years and will_continue to use them :)
F	opted for the express delivery for Â£ 0 . 00 , on the fuji finepix jz000 .
F	i found it extremely easy to order on their site , and after_placing the order i phone customer_services to check on the order and spoke to a very helpful member of staff , who advised everything was ok on the order and would be shipping it out later that day .
F	true to their word , i received my email_confirming the camera had been shipped , then one from city - link with my tracking_number .
F	i used their site all the way up to point of delivery the next morning .
F	the camera had arrived as promised the next_day .
F	the price was definitely the cheapest i could find anywhere and their customer_service was excellent .
F	i would recommend camerabox to anyone_looking for a cheap camera on good delivery and great customer_service .
F	i can ' t believe i ' m only using very now .
F	their online shopping is brilliant and at a great price !
F	i will be doing a lot of my online shopping with them from now on .

F	would definatly recommend to others !

F	i order them on a friday_afternoon they all arrived on tuesday_morning .
F	thank_you very much
F	amanda & andy
F	they have had my product for over a week i had to call them to arrange for my product to be delivered as i had not been contacted after an_hour and half was agreed it will be delivered in the afternoon 0 days_later .
F	received a message_saying delivery would be tomorrow between_0am - 0pm so called the office i was told its tough , the sales_assistant sonia could not care less and had the attitude of i will speak to my manager and call back if i have the time .
F	this is a bed i had ordered that should have arrived on 00th i now have no bed to sleep on i suffer from a back problem where the lower part of my back is fractured , this company does not care at all
F	â onlinebestmobiledeals . co . uk â is the best comparison site that compares latest mobile phone deals offered by many retailers and networks .
F	i was ordered apple iphone 0 contract deals on talk mobile network with great allowance of 0000 texts and 000 mins from onlinebestmobiledeals . co . uk and got my order next_day .
F	as they compare deals , they took me through â talk mobile â site to buy this deal .
F	then i placed my order with talk mobile and got my order on time .

F	simple instructions and procedures .
F	i will be using them again when needed and advise others to use this service
F	i was slightly nervous_about ordering lenses online , but i have been ordering from lenstore for around a year and have always been very satisfied with the service .
F	there was only one_occasion when the lenses did not arrive , but as soon as i notified the company , a replacement was sent straight_away .
F	usually they take a couple of days to arrive and as they are in a small box they can be posted trough the letterbox , so no need to collect from the depot .
F	i wanted to treat my husband for our first year wedding_anniversary plus celebrating 00 years together in total .
F	got fantastic tickets practically almost on the park , i knew they were going to be expensive tickets and wanted to buy them from a reputable company .
F	i was extremely pleased with the service and was kept up to date with the process of my order , was a real bonus when they came through early .

F	thanks for making this a memorable and a stress_free , amazing experience for my husband and i to enjoy !
F	mrs stephanie kitson
F	great service , was easy to choose the drink i wanted which was very hard to get hold from any local_shops .
F	would definitely have repeat_custom from this website .
F	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
F	our broadband and land - line have not been activated now 0 days past activation date !
F	has been over 00hrs we were told to wait to get a call back .
F	no - one has called .
F	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
F	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone call from asda , nothing !
F	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
F	we were told we would be called back , but no one called back .
F	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
F	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
F	so far it ' s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
F	asda may say the fault here lays with the bank , however if asda had delivered the shopping that i had paid for , we wouldn ' t be in the situation .
F	we have written a letter of complaint but are still_waiting for a response .
F	after a non delivery you would think they would contact us , but i guess that ' s why they ' re cheap !
F	had a bit of a defect in product and safercigs were quick to rectify the situation :) we ' ll definitely buy from again and recommend you to as well !
F	second order , needed a new charger and quick for my 00000 ' s i emailed daz to ask if i bought it in the morning , if he would be able to ship it same day , sure enough he could !
F	i got it in less_than 00hrs from time of purchase .
F	spot on !
F	daz even gave us a phone call , customer_service from his company is amazing !
F	i had been researching car seats for months and getting so confused and then i found winstanleys !
F	i wish i ' d just gone to them first !
F	i emailed first of all to check the models they had in store and got a very quick response , i then phoned to check the stock which they were able to confirm and ensured the product i liked the look of would be held at the store ready for me to purchase if i liked it which i thought was great .
F	as soon as i arrived at the store , the staff i spoke to were extremely confident in their product knowledge and extremely willing to demonstrate products .
F	i was so impressed with the checks that were carried_out when trying the seat in the car .
F	i had previously been to 0 major high_street stores to look at the same seat and they failed to carry out vital checks but the winstanleys staff were straight on to these therefore ensuring my child ' s safety to the highest_level , what more could you ask for ?
F	thank_you so much winstanleys for the fantastic service , knowledge and safety level checks , we are extremely pleased with the besafe isofix izi combi seat and highly_recommend the product as well as you !
F	we will be back soon !
F	ridiculously_expensive i don ' t know how they justify their prices .
F	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre .... we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
F	i ' ve been a scottish_power customer for 0 years and finally i ' ve had enough !
F	( 0 years previous address ( great service ) ... 0 years current address ) current home was intitially british_gas which i thought i ' d switch back to scottish_power
F	this last_year alone i noticed everytime i topped_up on my pre_- pay card they were taking money at the same time .
F	Â£_00 they would take Â£ 0 and leave me with Â£_00 credit .
F	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer ... they put the blame down to switching from british_gas ... that british_gas owe me the money .
F	phone british_gas .... i didn ' t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .
F	phoned scottish_power they give me a pin to wipe it off .
F	.... few weeks_later debt on it again .
F	this time same reason ... only 0 weeks electricity was unaccoutnable for when i switched .
F	i explained i ' ve already paid for my eletcricity ... i ' m not paying for it twice .
F	same_thing again gave me a pin wiped it off .
F	this time they were taking Â£ 0 ... this went on 0 - 0 times ..... were they wiped it clean .
F	then the final time 0th or 0th time i flipped and had enough ...
F	i topped_up Â£_00 ...Â£ 0 . 00 off ... i checked my meter ... it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
F	bear in mind i hadn ' t noticed them taking the Â£ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
F	i contacted scottish_power who asked me for my meter_reading ... i gave it them and the woman on the phone said you are not Â£_00 .
F	in debt your are now Â£_00 in debt .
F	i asked how can i be in debt i do not get Â£_00 worth free of electricity .. i pay for what i use i pay as you go .
F	this time scottish_power were not for wiping the debt off ....
F	i ' d had enough i contacted consumer_rights ombudsman to put an official_complaint in about how badly we were being treated ... to investigate sp because surely this is fraud tapping into to pay as you go customers meters and adding debt on their meters without us knowing .
F	this had happened to us 0 times .
F	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip offs !
F	so i switched only last_week because i can ' t take this with scottish_power anymore .... this morning had a phone call from sp on a sunday morning from a witheld number .... bearing in mind scottsh power are not open on a sunday said he was clearing the Â£_00 debt and he can see there was always a problem with the meter_reading ... that i shouldn ' t have been in debt because i ' m pay as you go ....
F	so what about all the money i have paid weekly in debt ???
F	... i ' ve never been given that back ... all as i ' ve been given is the meter wiped .
F	not any of the money i have paid on this so called debt !
F	.... sp only acting now because i have took it up with the ombudsman .
F	i ' m just one customer they have tried to rip_off ....... how many vulnerable customers are out there who don ' t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
F	my advice is put your key in and scroll through the options it will tell you if there is any debt and how much they are taking a week !!!!!!!!
F	.....& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
F	because this is theft of an energy supplier who already get enough of us customers !
F	every time i make a purchase with this company there is a problem !!!!!
F	!
F	they ' ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags .... items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
F	there is always an item out of stock ....
F	and when you are really looking_forward to receiving something like a rare opulence ballerina dress they send you a shoddy side train dress not what i ordered and contacting them by telephone is terrible !!!!!!!!!!
F	not only that they don ' t send you a returns sticker ..... i have to pay my own returns cost and wait 00 days for a refund !!!!
F	avoid if you don ' t want to be disappointed because i ' m disappointed in every transaction i make
F	no other competitor has been able to match supplementwarehouse prices .
F	i ' m 000_% satisfied with the quality of my products and how quickly i receive them .
F	the free_gifts are always great !
F	apart_from holidays bought from very well_known holiday companies this is easily the biggest single purchase i have ever made over the internet .
F	it was an_eternity_ring , bought as a surprise for my 00th wedding_anniversary .
F	i have to confess the last piece of jewellery i bought without any input from my wife was the engagement_ring , 00 years_ago .
F	i knew nothing about the 0 cs or purchasing diamonds .
F	my starting point was jewellery_shops , both high_street and independent , there were many fine looking rings but i just wasn ' t sure i was getting the biggest choice so i turned to the internet .
F	i spent months researching all online jewellery companies but i kept returning to purely_diamonds .
F	it certainly helps that the website has a very professional look , unlike some of their competitors , it was also extremely_helpful on education .
F	i was able to use their tools to work out my wife ' s ring size and the pictures and animations of the rings were really helpful for look .
F	i settled on a design and size and made my selection and order on the internet .
F	it was then the nerves set in , had i done the right thing , i decided to email the company .
F	i was emailed straight back by stephanie and from then on she was able to put my mind at ease .
F	the ring was delivered as promised .
F	it looked amazing to me but the true test was giving it to my wife .
F	she was delighted and despite the fact it has been on her finger for 0 days now she still can ' t stop looking at it .
F	i am more_than satisfied that i received great service and the ring is more_than value for money .
F	i would recommend purely_diamonds to anyone !
F	i have posted this through my wife ' s fb account as i don ' t have one .
F	i spoke to michelle after i thought i had selected the wrong drop_off point with ups .
F	she then altered the details for me and re - sent the delivery note to my email but it still showed the wrong_address .
F	i went back through to her and explained the situation , she was more_than happy to help and was patient too !
F	she cancelled the order , gave me a credit to my account and re - ordered it for me , correcting the error .
F	she was friendly , patient and professional throughout .
F	i ' m thankful for all her help !

F	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0 days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0 days ago .
F	phoned customer_service and said they would check with hermes delivery and see what happened .
F	i then had to phone back as surprise_surprise they didn ' t phone me !
F	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
F	again phoned back and told same_thing but that they always side with customer !
F	what a joke my son was left gutted and i ' m hoping for a refund but i ' ve reported them to watchdog and to my bank for fraud so that ' s .
F	how bad they are !
F	i think some tramps hermes guy has spotted my parcel and lifted it as barca kids strips are hard to get right now .

F	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
F	last e . mail was delivery in feb before 00th , like others saying check site order page for details ... etc
F	& an_email from groupon saying Â£_00 off next purchase .... i cant afford any of their stuff , so gave it to my mum ...( she informed me of these numourus complaints !!)
F	at_least now i dont feel alone in the matter .
F	i have contacted bbc ' s watchdog via their website , advise you do also .
F	i ' m also concidering refund from groupon even if i loose my Â£_00 odd p_& p from infurn as seen similar priced / sized bean_bags instock at my local range store !
F	!
F	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
F	i do however want answers from infurn and a definative answer as to when my itm will actually arrive !
F	!
F	was told feb 00th ..... well on site its now saying calender week 00 ... lets_see shall we ......
F	i have been in my house all this time without a flat screen television immediately i joined very i know that one day i will have my own television .
F	i started with Â£_000 credit giving to me and keep on manage with the money until now that my credit has improve .
F	last_week i when for that television but unfortunate for me i did not place what i want i make a mistake and go for wrong want i did called very direct and i was answer immediately that if my product come i should send it back with the delivery person and your money will be credited back to my account then immediately i can go back to the site and get what i want .
F	so this morning i went to very site and got just what i want which was excellent and sample to get .
F	i will advised everyone to join very and see the excellent business the have and no one will never be disappointed .
F	that every thing you want , you will away have even if you want to talk with the team you will alway be happy because someone will alway be there for people .
F	for that reason i need to thank everyone working with very experically manager director assisstant manager and all the sale assistant .
F	is great do business with you people
F	i had lots of questions and leah was extremely_helpful with everything i needed to know .
F	i even went to the company and spoke to her in person again , was very helpful .
F	i had my printed work in a few_days_later so very quick and the quality of them are brilliant .
F	i was dubious_about ordering currency online , however , after checking the reviews for the currency_club i was comfortable in using them .
F	they also had one of the best rates at the time with no commission and free next_day delivery when ordering before 00pm .
F	i ordered about 0 . 00pm and still received my order next_day .
F	i was kept_informed via_email of progress and when my order was on the way .
F	very pleased with the rate , service and speed .
F	the last four orders i ' ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
F	i have now lost my patience and give up with them , most certainly will never order from them again .
F	i ' m surprised they are still trading !
F	from my first experience of specsavers i will be returning to my previous opticians !
F	the only reason i tried them out was because i had a free eye_test voucher .
F	the optician said i had a very slight prescription and didn ' t need glasses , but proceeded to try to sell me reading glasses .
F	the whole atmosphere seemed more of a sales place and out of about 00 to 00 other people in there at the time , i was the only one to walk out without purchasing anything .
F	after possibly the worst online shopping_experience ever - no thanks to miragerecords0000 , chemical_records restored my faith .
F	my purchase with m0000records was for a pack of ' rock on wall ' vinyl frames , which i paid extra delivery for also , after them not arriving and not 0 single reply to my numerous polite emails , i finally spoke to dave who told me in so many words to do0 , this all without my order arriving .
F	in the meantime , i thought all was lost but one more try to get them as the ones in john_lewis werent quite as nice , and tadaathere was chemical_records !
F	i called them ob the website listed number for assistance first to ensure they were real and if would take order over phone after what happened above , this wasnt possible but they were friendly and provided reassurance that this purchase would be as hassle_free as you ' d expect it to be , and that it was !
F	website clear about shipping and delivery dates , which were exact my order arrived on time and in great condition .
F	to be fair , im probably a lil over excited at chemical_records right now , as had such a poop time with miragerecords0000 , but either way top score for a top store !
F	thank youuuuu , x
F	i ordered the guitar as a christmas_present for my sister .
F	i have never bought from this site before and was a little_nervous , however i am more_than pleased .
F	the guitar arrived today , ( i only ordered it yesterday ) and it ' s in perfect_condition and it ' s simply beautiful !
F	it put a smile on my sister ' s face .
F	( she got the present early ).
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	felt a little_nervous after_reading all the bad_reviews that yodel have , however , i received excellent service .
F	the package was delivered the next_day in excellent condition and the delivery driver was very friendly .
F	this site has everything you need and it ships from wisconsin so everyone can get a fair price on shipping .
F	my car was picked_up and delivered when expected .
F	they kept me informed_throughout the whole_process .
F	i will_definitely use their service again .
F	i chose to use divorce_online because all the documents that had to be filled out was quite overwhelming .
F	divorce_online did most of the work and checked my documents before they got sent to court .
F	they prepared the documents and would inform me when i needed to print and sign something etc .
F	the online tracker was quiet useful as it allowed me to log on and see what stage of the divorce process i was at .
F	all in all an excellent service .
F	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns up .
F	book the wrong tickets or need a refund and it will cost you dearly .
F	not just the cost of the tickets but the numerous_calls to their indian_call_centres where they recite a speech - no matter how many_times you tell them otherwise they will repeat the speech ... nightmare .
F	would never use again : 0 (
F	great site , great value , easy to navigate round ... pages and pages of offers can be a bit mundane tho - best to search what you ' re looking for , then find the best price / offer : 0 )
F	great site , simple to use , love the favourites / usuals - makes the weekly shopping nightmare turn into a dream_come true : 0 )
F	been banking with santander for 0yrs now , efficient , simple and secure .
F	very happy and would not go back to barclays for love nor money : 0 )
F	have booked several holidays through thomascook . com and would recommend them .
F	site is easy to navigate round , holidays have been superb with an option to review upon return .
F	payment pages very secure , would use again and recommend to a friend : 0 )
F	spent lots of time searching out the ideal destination through first choice - first time i ' ve ever used this company and love the " my first choice " account you get to use when you ' ve booked a holiday .
F	easy to navigate round , secure_payments and instant email confirmation .
F	a big_thumbs_up all_round : 0 )
F	ordered several_times from this site , great value for money and easy to navigate round ... would shop there again and recommend to a friend : 0 )
F	wherever possible i always use paypal due to its secure_payments and dispute centre its very difficult to pull a fast one meaning happy buyers and sellers !
F	fees are nominal and well worth it when you put things into perspective .
F	seems a crook - free site to me !
F	ebay is a gem for hunting obscure items you thought you ' d never see again , usually a very safe_place to buy from with a tiny minority being pains !
F	vast_majority of buyers and sellers are good people with just a few trying it on .
F	always pay via_paypal for additional security .
F	ordered from robinsons many_times , great service , great products - perfect retailer
F	easy to order ,
F	ecco shoes are very comfortable and modern design .
F	i wish i bought earlier .
F	everything fine , fast delivery !!!!!!
F	!
F	i ' m really satisfied with both ordering and receiving my new pc .
F	no_problems with finding information on the website .
F	delivery was fast and efficient .
F	thanks a lot pc_specialist !
F	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for Â£_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
F	i continued to check the small_print which all seemed to pan out .
F	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at Â£_00 per hour .
F	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don ' t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay ....
F	in light of this i contacted " groupon " to be told that i had misread the fine print and because it was longer_than seven_days after i purchased the voucher i wasn ' t entitled to a refund and they could only give me credits ....
F	i was furious ... why would i want credits i haven ' t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
F	i payed with cash so i should be given a cash refund .
F	avoid .
F	regards sarah
F	i have used uni baggage a few_times now , and have found it a very very useful service .
F	uni baggage allows you to pack more_than you could ever bring on an airplane , and allows for a hassle_free journey without dragging bags around !
F	they were extremely reliable and on time .
F	my bags always arrived when they were supposed to and in perfect_condition !
F	would recommend to anyone !
F	i used several websites ( hostels . com , hostelworld . com , hotels . com ) when looking at hostels for my trip .
F	i found hostelbookers . com to be on of the easiest to use with lots of info and helpful reviews .
F	the only thing i would like added is more information on where the hostels are located .
F	hostels . com has a good feature where it tells you how far each hostel is from the city_centre that i think would be helpful to see on hostelbookers . com as well .
F	i ordered an ipod_touch for my 00yr old .
F	he didn ' t have enough birthday money for a new one and was really disappointed when he thought he would have to wait til xmas .
F	i found the link for studentcomputers on moneysavingexpert and it had really good feedback so we went_ahead and ordered a b + ipod_touch on the tuesday .
F	it arrived on the friday and it was practically perfect , the tiniest of surface scratches on the screen which would have gone unnoticed if i wasn ' t looking for the fault that made it a b +!
F	!
F	we will_definately be back !
F	thank_you !
F	just to say thank_you for your amazing telephone customer_service :)
F	from the start the service from this website was just brilliant .
F	i ordered a sonos play : 0 zoneplayer at 0pm and received the item the next morning .
F	i was also updated via_email with evey step of the order .
F	i also have a very nice follow_up phone call making_sure everything was ok with my order .
F	thank_you :)
F	exceptional customer_service ..!
F	!
F	mr john joy is a great personality who always goes that extra_mile to help me in finding the right ticket and of course the right pricing .
F	john is very patient and had always listened to what i have to say .
F	it â_s been an_absolute pleasure working with jon and i must have used john â_s service for about 00 times by now and every time i get outstanding customer_service from mr joy .
F	i will certainly recommend anyone to try and use john â_s service for all their travel related needs .
F	kind_regards

F	hostelbookers allows you to do a quick reservation with no unnecessary hustle .
F	it has great search tools to find that perfect accommodation of yours .
F	map_view , organising by price , room type .
F	quick and easy .
F	you ' re provided with all important details how to get there , what to expect , check in / check out timing , rules .
F	i ' ve used the website for all my travels and i fully recommend it .
F	hostelbookers has been my website of choice for the last couple years because they organize and rate the hostels so well , without adding a booking_fee .
F	course is interesting , and if something brakes there is always someone to help and fix the problem .
F	really easy to follow website and great understandable emails once ' order ' has been placed .
F	really easy to order online and the photo was a good representation of the flowers that were received .
F	excellent service & loved the fact we were kept_informed when the flowers were sent out and when they had been received .
F	would recommend and use again !
F	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
F	o0 customer_service is simple , easy and things are done pretty fast , in the other hand , three website is useless , their customer_service even more useless and their policies are ridiculous .
F	i am a pay as you go customer , and never loved 0 anyways , but now i have it more then any other operator
F	trying to get my phone ' s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message confirming that they had my details checked .
F	after waiting over an_hour for the text , i got a text_saying that they couldn ' t have my age checked therefore they were unable to provide me with my adult content pin number .
F	and i just want to watch a normal film
F	wtf ...... not impressed , in fact really disappointed
F	three is the worse mobile network in the uk
F	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
F	i have used the software to unzip , worked well .
F	i had a bit of a problem with the download as something else came with it .
F	i quickly removed it .
F	last_night i downloaded some software .
F	got my browser highjacked by malware .
F	took me 0 hours to remove it .
F	i will never use them again .
F	there was no click or unclick box to let me know a bundle to software was going to be loaded .
F	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
F	what has happened to their standards ?
F	this was the 0 star_review , which is now downgraded to 0 star , see far below .
F	i ' ve used asda home delivery for groceries on and off since their days of the telephone order service ( with the lovely gentlemen from the north east of england taking the orders ).
F	i use asda , now via a laptop , every couple of months .
F	the delivery has normally been within the 0 hour_slot .
F	occasionally early , but they have phoned first to check i was in .
F	the quality of the groceries have been fine .
F	the occasional substitution , but normally fine .
F	although i have to say asda do get the prize for the most weird substitution , ordered - a packet of cigarettes , delivered - a plastic picnic set for one .
F	the only similarity , they were both blue .
F	i just had to laugh .
F	the substitution was the healthy option !
F	!
F	recently for the first time for years i ' ve had need to phone their customer_service over a missing item .
F	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
F	they have promptly dealt_with my enquiry and refund produced in a few_days .
F	i will_continue to use asda for groceries from time to time .
F	i will also use tesco and sainsbury for my online groceries .
F	for me the service from these 0 suppliers are about the same .
F	just depends on what i need to order as to which one i use .
F	update to asda review - it is now months after my original review .
F	i have now had to stop using them completely as their website is now not compatible with firefox .
F	i have emailed a couple of times and all i get is change to ie ( which kept freezing for me , so i gave up with it ) or change to google_chrome .
F	as i ' m very happy with firefox i have given up with asda .
F	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my Â£_00 per week will go elsewhere .
F	such a good selection of products , reasonable prices and quick delivery
F	good value , delivery as promised .
F	we ordered the bath and sink taps with the help of the clear photos on their website .
F	the bathrooms0u price was by_far the best we ' d found .
F	we ordered the taps and they arrived within 0 days - in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
F	the whole transaction was easy and organised .
F	excellent !
F	had 0 htc now - desire g0 & sensation xe brilliant phones !
F	everyone i know who has had an iphone has had nothing but trouble ... however my last 0 0 / 0 years has been trouble free internet browsing texting and calling !
F	would not recommended any other make on the market at the moment as these_guys have it spot on - easy to use , powerful , long_lasting , fault free and great looks !
F	excellent
F	had loads of problems with my box sky is very unhelpful .
F	repeat the same programs far too often and even_tho there are hundreds of channels there is often nothing to watch
F	can ' t fault mazuma_mobile i have an account which i have used to sell several phone .
F	their service is 0 ***** and when you send a phone off you generally have the money paid by faster payment the day they receive it .
F	( mine was next_day )
F	all invoices and packaging labels can now be printed off line so no waiting for envelopes to be sent through the post .
F	will_definately be selling my next phone to them when it is time to up grade !
F	keep up the good work x_x_x
F	i placed the order 0 minuted after 0pm and was told the order would processed the next working day .
F	come to find out the items i ordered were not in stock .
F	i called customer_service twice both_times the agent tried to cancel my order .
F	i wonder_how they make any money if the customer_service agents simply cancel orders to make problems go away .
F	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
F	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
F	the chap hadn ' t just fitted my tyres but had educated me on the general care of them .
F	my tyres were shocking to say the least .
F	excellent value .
F	superb service .
F	and there was no_messing_around .
F	the driver had kept me really well informed about his whereabouts so i could plan my morning .
F	he turned_up exactly when he said .
F	i couldn ' t feel happier ( and thankfully safer in my car .)
F	i would recommend these_guys , and when the time comes again i ' ll be going back to them for the next set of tyres .
F	thanks to pete and van betty .
F	after my first purchase from hq_hair all i can say is that i ' m back reviewing items to see what i can purchase next .
F	delivery did not take long , the product was nicely packed so i have no_worries about future buys getting damaged , product was of excellent quality ... so i can say that they company deserves the 0_stars i am rating it .
F	we ' ve just returned from a hen_weekend in liverpool and while the weekend was fab the week leading up to it was fairly stressful !!
F	i work full time and had decided that booking via chilli_sauce would make things fairly easy and hassle_free for me as the weekend organiser .
F	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn ' t have our booking !
F	needless to say this was more_than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn ' t either !
F	after emailing vanessa ( our " manager ") she assured me that everything was booked and when we did arrive on friday , thankfully there were no_problems .
F	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
F	long_story short , chilli_sauce are great for the online payment system and we did feel that we got great value for money with everything that was included in our " package " but for peace of mind ask for someone a little more competent to manage your booking !
F	came_across truffle_shuffle using google as i wanted a harry potter t - shirt to wear to the wb studio tour , london .
F	found exactly_what i wanted , easy to understand sizing and in my opinion are very accurate .
F	placed my order and it arrived in 0days .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	they were brilliant .
F	couldn ' t have asked for better .
F	communication_throughout and they were really quick to dispatch and deliver my order and it was free postage !
F	order came and looked even better_than i thought and gift_wrapped as well for no extra_cost .
F	what ' s even better was because of a sale i got the item marked down to lower_than the original item i was going to buy and this bracelet makes an even better christmas_present .
F	would definitely shop on argento again :)
F	i was really pleased with my order .
F	i was notified at all stages what was going on with the status of my order and it came promptly and as_described .
F	would definitely order from this website again .
F	bought lacoste men and women gift sets , well_packaged and presented .
F	arrived very quickly , good cost , and very easy - to - use website .
F	a ++++
F	booked two tickets to see paris st germain vs rennes for the 0th_may .
F	game was rescheduled for 0th_may but unable to get refund for tickets - take note people !
F	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
F	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
F	unable to list category 0 seat numbers for the game - supposedly a psg restriction - however , loads of other sellers ( of category 0 area ) are able to list their seat numbers and when i first bought them i was able to see what seats i was buying !
F	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
F	000euros possibly down the drain !
F	poor poor poor - your customer_service stinks !
F	it quick and easy to sell your phone with mazuma .
F	i sold both of my phones and was happy with service .
F	after a slight_delay we received our furniture today & it was well worth the wait .
F	we ' d got great service from the salesman in the leeds store & he was always available to contact if we had any_queries .
F	when we found out there was a delay on our delivery he quickly found out what the problem was & while we were a little disappointed at having to wait longer we were grateful for his honesty & the fact that the delay was due to them wanting to make_sure everything was 000_% perfect . everything arrived today & we are so pleased with it .
F	all the pieces were extremely well_packaged , which put a previous delivery from another oak company to shame !
F	there were 0 big pieces & a tv cabinet which the delivery drivers had to get up a flight of stairs as we live in a town house but they didn ' t complain !!
F	fantastic furniture at a really good price with good customer_service from the leeds store , highly_recommended .
F	i decided to buy from solid_oak warehouse after seeing the great pieces a friend had bought with no_problems .
F	i was worried after_reading some of the negative_feedback so we travelled down to the showroom & was impressed with the furniture & had excellent customer_service .
F	we bought a dining_set which was just what we were looking for but a lot cheaper_than other_places we ' d looked .
F	we were told it ' d be delivered in 0 - 0 weeks but in just over 0 weeks it was delivered .
F	it is fantastic & great quality .
F	all in all we had a good experience & would recommend this company to others .
F	well , what can i say apart_from wow !!
F	with statements from the bride to be to the tune of " i ' ve just had the best weekend of my life " it doesn ' t get much_better .....
F	i wish i could take full credit but none of this would have been possible without clare .
F	clare has been absolutely superb and patient with me throughout the whole_process ...... understood about last_minute changes and answered all of my questions and queries whether by phone or email in a quick and efficient manner ( i ' m sure she must have been tired of hearing my voice by the end as there was a few !)
F	hats_off to clare and the rest of the team at my big_fat brighton_weekend you are superb , i just need an excuse to use you guys again !!!
F	x
F	i really was massively impressed with this whole weekend !
F	went to edinburgh and did the pub_crawl treasure_hunt !
F	the accomodation was perfect and the treasure was challenging , fun , but achievable !
F	would definitely_recommend this to any future hen / stag_do ' s !
F	it all pretty_much gets done for you and the website is incredibly easy to follow !
F	thanks chillisauce !
F	:_o )
F	funky_rabbit has been a very welcome_addition to devizes .
F	we ' ve bought a number of different shoes from there for the kids and always been happy - it ' s nice to have a range of different_styles available in the centre other than the usual clarks options .
F	the service is fantastic and very friendly .
F	the creative / play area upstairs is a fab idea , we ' ve been to a lot of the sessions held there and the kids love them , plus it ' s great even for a normal play / craft time plus coffee for mum ( and now cakes !
F	).
F	great to keep the independent shop spirit alive in devizes ... we ' ll keep supporting you guys !
F	do not use this company !
F	!
F	i ordered almost Â£ 0000 of furniture .
F	i got Â£ 0000 finance and paid the rest with cash on the day of order .
F	it was delivered broken .
F	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
F	instead , they ' d taped up a corner or two of the very badly_damaged boxes and shipped out regardless .
F	i refused the delivery and sent photographic_evidence .
F	i had to chase them for my refund .
F	when it was agreed i was told it had just been processed and i would get my money in 0 - 0 working_days .
F	it ' s now been 0 working_days and they still have my money .
F	i ' ve been told i now have to wait another 0 working_days .
F	this company doesn ' t in any way approach professionalism .
F	they have absolutely no interest in making the customer happy or delivering anything remotely approaching quality .
F	bought rayban , the item arrived in good packaging , looks authentic , and fast delivery .
F	finding a hostel with the best rating , most relevant location and cheapest solution was very easy .
F	although it took me more_than 0 hours comparing between hotels , hostelworld , agoda , trip_advisor , in the end i still come back and book through hostelbookers .
F	which is a breeze .
F	very happy and look_forward to my trip .
F	the reviews people left for the hostel really helped a lot .
F	although i think the owner of the hostel could have put up more photos for detail description of the room .
F	great service , fast and clear help .
F	recommended .
F	very useful idea and better then payday loans , ideal if you have poor credit like me and cant get an overdraft with the bank .
F	customer_service is really good too .
F	english speaking staff who are very polite and helpful .
F	still_haven ' t received order .
F	i have contacted you but apparently i have to wait_until wednesday next week .
F	i have now completely ran out of both products and i ' m not happy with the service .
F	easy process , super_fast delivery and great communication .
F	i have used this site about 0 times now and will_definitely be using it again .
F	i ordered a car_seat from kiddisave and was worried after_reading bad_reviews .
F	i ordered it monday night , it arrived thursday_morning .
F	i got an_email wednesday telling_me it would be delivered thursday and on the morning of delivery got and email telling_me a time .
F	great service , i would use them again .
F	i emailed them on the tuesday asking if the product was in stock as i had read bad_reviews and they emailed me back within half an_hour .
F	can ' t fault the service whatsoever .
F	great service and quick delivery .
F	very pleased .
F	fantastic service , will_definitely use base . com again
F	competitive_prices , good product range and great service .
F	i love all the ranges argento stocks online and in store .
F	fantastic service and quick home delivery .
F	mary was a star helping me with the access to my account .
F	super_quick !
F	this website has great prices on their prework out supplements .
F	also great freebies !
F	website was easy to use and received tickets within 0 days of ordering .
F	from the beginning to end hen_heaven were on the ball !!
F	we had an excellent weekend in lovely apartments and the cocktail experience was fantastic !
F	the value for money was also unbeatable !!
F	would highly_recommend !
F	!
F	brilliant quality blinds for a very good price
F	my order arrived very quickly ... not been using the tablets long enough to know how well they work for me , but also recieved a free drink shakey and a six - blister sample_pack of another product foc !
F	no_problems here and so far a very impressed customer .
F	i had my reservations_about getting my lenses replaced / reglazed by an online company but i needn ' t have worried .
F	the lady i spoke to on the phone was friendly and helpful , i got my prescription updated on my glasses quickly for a very reasonable_price and my glasses were even tightened when i got them back .
F	a very happy customer !
F	would definately_recommend , and will probably use again in the future .
F	how a " company " with such horrendous customer_service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .
F	found a failed delivery card left in the morning - was in all morning with the door within earshot , no knock or sign of attempted delivery apart_from the failed delivery card .
F	fair_enough , perhaps i ' d gone temporarily deaf .
F	on trying to reschedule delivery / pick - up from depot with the reference_number on their card as advised , was told numerous_times by their website and their phone line that the reference_number was not recognised .
F	bare in mind i tried this various different times throughtout the day on the day of failed delivery and the following_day just incase theyre system hadnt been updated yet .
F	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest depot .
F	but noone actually answers either of the phonelines for the depot .
F	so , i contact office ( who i ordered from ) they eventually ( 0 working_days_later ) let me know that theyve asked the courier to redeliver , though with no eta
F	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
F	fair_enough .
F	day 0 - no parcel
F	day 0 - no parcel
F	day 0 - thats today ..... still no parcel
F	i just want my order !
F	delivery or pick_up i dont care i just want it !!!!
F	!
F	also note : unlike so many other people on this site , i have actually once received an order from hdnl , however this was only after a failed delivery and i picked_up from my local_depot .
F	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
F	however when i went to collect my parcel , i did get it , but the norwich depot was an_absolute state , parcels piled / toppling everywhere looked horrendously disorganised ... i thought not alot of it at the time as they did actually find my parcel , but perhaps the shockingly kept depot was just scatching the surface on a truely catastrophically run sham of an organisation .
F	steer_clear at all costs - poor communication with customers , poor organisation and poor service .
F	they make me hate internet shopping and thats saying something because internet shopping is like crack to me !
F	easy to use website
F	great mobile tyre_fitting service , quicker then having to go the local kwik_fit and having to wait .
F	the mobile fitter was very professional and informative , i had first purchased the wrong_size tyres , in which the fitter informed me and later came back with the right set and quickly changed the tyres .
F	found the service extremely_helpful and useful when having it all done in the comfort of my own home .
F	would definitely purchase from kwik_fit again .
F	my boyfriend and i have used feelgoodlenses for some time now , and we ' ve never been disappointed .
F	they ' re quick , efficient and prices are usually unbeatable , on the lenses we both wear .
F	i ' ve had the unfortunate experience of having several parcels come ( or not !)
F	by yodel .
F	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn ' t mine ( wasn ' t even in the same county ).
F	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
F	i called and called about that one , and despite multiple notes , i had to cancel the order with the company so that they could recall the parcel .
F	there was another order with lots of chasing .
F	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
F	if i hadn ' t , i don ' t think he ' d have stopped .
F	in short , they ' re the worst delivery company that i ' ve ever_experienced .
F	waiting on a parcel that they ' re meant to deliver at the moment and honestly not expecting to see it anytime_soon .
F	hostel_bookers really helped_me to find good , comfortable and cheap accommodation in different places in europe .
F	england , germany , france , ireland , netherlands , italy , swiss ...
F	i always come here when i need a place to stay , and their review on each hostel is very trustworthy .
F	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
F	had an_email an_hour after making the purchase to say they were out of stock and their delivery for them to be back in stock was 0 - 00 days away .
F	however after 0 weeks i still had no sunglasses delivered to me .
F	i had emailed and phoned a couple times .
F	they responded to my emails quickly which was the only good thing .
F	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
F	couldnt be without sky + makes watching_tv even better .
F	find every thing you could ever want in one place at great prices .
F	love their own_brand range just as good as big brands but better for your pocket .
F	so easy to find people , even someone you havent seen in years is there somewhere .
F	find out any thing and everything you ever wanted to know but never knew who ask .
F	easy to use safe a simple service for buyers and sellers alike .
F	easy way to pay online and completley safe .
F	easy to use website and very helpful .
F	the engineer arrived_promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
F	he did not return on - site until 00 . 00 am , that is at_least 0 hours and 00_minutes later !
F	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
F	the actual job ( moving the door entry phone to the other room ) was done in under 00_minutes .
F	i have been charged 000 gbp for a job that should have cost gbp 000 due to the time he disappeared off - site .
F	i have flagged this with aspects customer_service last december but have yet to hear back from them after this initial reply :
F	----- original message -----
F	from : tina hxxxxxxxxxxx [ mailto : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ]
F	sent : thursday , december 00 , 0000 0 : 00 pm
F	to : hester @ xxxxxxxxx
F	subject : fw : [ aspect - vm ] feedback
F	dear hester ,
F	firstly please_accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of aspect . co . uk that your experience was anything other than the highest_level of service we aim to deliver .
F	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
F	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
F	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
F	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
F	again i am sorry you feel so strongly about your aspect experience .
F	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer_service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look_into the problem and get back to you .
F	may we take this opportunity to wish you a very happy new year .
F	kind_regards
F	the aspect team .

F	....... a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
F	i can understand that they would need to make the necessary checks with this engineer as to ascertain what would have taken him 0 hours , but their inability to keep me updated has made me doubt aspect ' s level of responsibility and clarity on what is chargeable to the customer .
F	please beware .
F	i had a problem with setting the time on my handset .
F	after contacting telappliant ( our supplier ), the technician took me through the solution step - by - step .
F	following his suggestions i sorted the problem easily .
F	i also received a follow - up email from telappliant to check if the problem was solved - this also proves the great customer_service offered by telappliant
F	well , my experience was positive ..
F	i received my product on time and was wrapped in bubble_wrap and in a package that seemed to be durable and recycled , .. everything went well !!
F	!
F	my husband bought me an_eternity_ring for christmas and it ' s stunning .
F	i emailed purely_diamonds a couple of times in the hope of it being delivered before_christmas and they were very helpful and i did receive it the week before_christmas .
F	the packaging was lovely and made it feel very special .
F	i would definitely_recommend purely_diamonds to others .
F	thank_you for a gorgeous ring !
F	great fast service , quality products excellent range of products and delivered quickly with a smile .
F	easy to use website , offering excellent quality products at very reasonable prices ( especially when compared to some of their competitors who were trying to charge 0 times the cost for the guillotine i ordered ).
F	ordering was smooth and simple , and the goods arrived the next_day .
F	very impressed indeed and would not hesitate to recommend them .
F	i purchased the longchapman handbag sets on wowcher roughly about a month_ago now and i still have not received my purchased items .
F	not only did they take my money the company initially partnered with wowcher on the deal also took my money on delivery costs .
F	it ' s been a week now since i ' ve contacted_wowcher and the initial company they done the deal with , and i have not received a reply from either of them .
F	i am so disappointed and upset .
F	i would rather have my money back then actually receive the products .
F	i ' m so disappointed .
F	i advice all those who i reading this to save your money and look for deals elsewhere
F	how is it that they can take your money for a month and not delivery what you paid for ?
F	absolutely poor customer_service !
F	where is my money ????
F	?
F	i ' ve been with tmobile for years now and had several contracts .
F	i was mugged last month and called the same night to inform them , block the phone and sim and ask for a new sim .
F	made a complaint as the woman i spoke to was completely uncaring and blunt with me .
F	so a month later no sim and can ' t get through on the phone because they won ' t speak to me without me telling them my last bill amount ( not payment , bill ).
F	finally get through tonight and after being cut_off 0 times , i am told i never reported my phone lost or stolen , but they will send me a new sim as a good - will gesture !!
F	and that i will have to pay the last month ' s bill because i didn ' t report the phone lost , i rang to cancel my contract ( with a year left ?).
F	now taken it to the ombudsman because they won ' t do anything more .
F	no apology , they just don ' t care .
F	never been more angry with a company .
F	i brought a digital version of modern_warfare 0 .
F	i thought the price was too good to be true and upon seeing it was a ukraine copy and i had to follow vpn instructions to activate i was skeptical .
F	but i bought it anyway .
F	the key was emailed immediately , as always .
F	i followed the vpn instructions on the website and now have a fully functioning english modern_warfare 0 for an amazing price .
F	i ' ve purchased from this company many_times before and never had any_issues .
F	i wanted an online shop set_up for my university society to order hoodies .
F	i also wanted to make it complicated by allowing the option of several logo designs on several different items .
F	they did this for me at no charge .
F	the quality of the items are great , they really went out of their way to make_sure i got what i wanted .
F	couldn ' t be_happier !
F	finds the cheapest things and very reliable
F	easy to use , very helpful on line chat if required ... would definitely_recommend and use again
F	louise parton
F	0 .
F	very competitive price
F	0 .
F	email received to say my phone had arrived
F	0 .
F	bacs payment for original amount made same day goods received
F	0 .
F	money cleared within two days .
F	would recommend and definately use again , great service .
F	this store is brilliant , it does what it says and i received my order quickly and everything was packaged safely .
F	the items were all as_described , my only problem is once you shop here you ' ll want to spend more money !
F	i had problems paying with my card online ( still not sure why ), so phoned up to book everything .
F	the salesperson was very helpful , clear , and polite .
F	everything worked out as planned .
F	all of my questions were answered in the pack that i was emailed .
F	it was really useful to be able search under different criteria such as voltage , wattage , size , and style .
F	i have used the service 0 or so times now , each time has been so easy , i have never had any_problems , its nice to find something that works as well as it is supposed to .
F	i sent my phone off using special delivery and the next morning the Â£_00 was in my bank ready to spend !
F	i ' d definitely_recommend mazuma .
F	i have used wowcher in the past and had no issues , however it seems when there is a hitch that they just don ' t get back to you .
F	i ordered a blender on the 00th_august which went through the wowcher automatic sending page ( where they deal with the selling company on your behalf ), but have had no contact since .
F	i really dont like the ' sit back and wait ' strategy as i have no_idea if it was ever sent or if the seller even received my order .
F	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .
F	i ' m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
F	no_messing_about , very friendly great service , happy customer .
F	very quick and easy .
F	polite staff and not a long wait to be picked_up when we arrived back home .
F	i think dominos should know me by name now !!
F	whenever we have dominos we always order online , it is so easy to use and really quick delivery .
F	a no hassle way to get great food to your door !!
F	!
F	i love using play . com !
F	and its coming up to that time of year again where i will be buying plenty from here !
F	great delivery times , excellent variety !
F	!
F	i always use amazon to order books , dvds , games , and for cake decorating supplies .
F	always delivers when it says it will , great value for money , great variety of products !
F	i ordered a refurbished i - pod touch and was very pleased with everything , the price was great , the i - pod is great , delivery was really fast and i loved not having to wait in all day because i knew what time it would be delivered !
F	would definitely use this site again !!
F	!
F	i have been using parcel0go for quite sometime now , i have never had any_issues with them they have always collected and delivered my parcels as promised .
F	the customer_service has always been fantastic , especially today when i dealt_with daniel .
F	i had a couple of changes to make to some deliveries and he was extremely_helpful and dealt_with my request quickly and efficiently .
F	couldn ' t recommend these_guys enough , if you need anything sent out these are the people to use .
F	remove the background provides an awesome service at the lowest_price i ' ve ever_seen .
F	they are very responsive to emails and complete projects within 00_hours .
F	i am listing my products through amazon and am was very eager to begin sales when i found out my pictures were all the wrong_size .
F	the contact at amazon recommended remove the background to me and it was a great experience !
F	i will_definitely be using rtb again in the future !
F	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
F	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction site so i assumed that they were reliable .
F	after browsing their website i found some items that i liked .
F	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or Â£ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over $_00 .
F	unfortunately as soon as you spend over $_00 or equivalent in gbp ( i am an english customer ) the website automatically takes away the option for the cheapest delivery , so the extra you pay for shipping , you do not save anything , it actually costs you more .
F	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don ' t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
F	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
F	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
F	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
F	most of them were competitively_priced with the uk market as you would expect , one of the items was expensive though (Â£ 00 . 00 for some nail_varnishes ) so my total order was Â£_00 . 00 for five items .
F	the shipping amount i paid was Â£_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
F	in total i paid lightinthebox Â£_00 . 00 .
F	the items were not sent through national post they were sent through a courier service , i assume because they were expedited through their 0 - 0 day shipping option ( but the cheaper shipping wasn ' t an option as my order was worth over $_00 ).
F	this meant that the package was received and dealt_with by parcelforce and not delivered by royal_mail ( all of the items i ' ve purchased from china arrive through royal_mail .)
F	my items were not delivered to me .
F	i instead received a letter from parcelforce stating that i was required to pay Â£_00 before they release my package .
F	Â£_00 as a handling_fee over Â£_00 in import_tax .
F	as i had already waited over 0 weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
F	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
F	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
F	the reason for this is because lightinthebox had written the value of shipping as 000 yuan which is over Â£_00 !
F	which made my total order amount appear to be Â£_00 when it was Â£_00 . 00 as stated on my invoice .
F	after a very lengthy phone call to parceforce i was told it was an issue for hmrc , cue another long phone call to hmrc where i was told i would have to go through the process of claiming my money back through them and a lot of agro .
F	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
F	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
F	i thought purchasing from this website would be reliable and yes i have received my items but it has cost me over Â£_00 for items that are worth Â£_00 ( and that ' s being generous ) at uk value , i do feel completely ripped_off .
F	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
F	a complete nightmare experience , i will chalk it down to a learning curve and never again will i use this company or recommend anyone_else to it , nothing short of criminal .
F	have always had positive_experiences with purchasing from amazon .
F	when i have had to contact customer care , they have been very helpful and swift in rectifying my issues .
F	would highly_recommend to anyone .
F	i have been shopping with play since day one when they first started .
F	have always had fantastic customer_service ( have only needed to send back 0 items since 0000 ) with very swift responses .
F	products are priced great .
F	delivery is nearly always within 0 days of ordering the product .
F	obviously at crimbo or other busy_periods or when weather is dodgy with snow then delays are inevitable but not the companies fault .
F	love this site and always go to for great gift_ideas too !
F	bought a 00 seater garden set at a reasonable_price .
F	they delivered when they said they would and the furniture is great !
F	great customer_service , would definitely use again
F	sent phone and had an e_- mail the following_morning to say it had been checked and i would be credited with the money they quoted .
F	really fast service - no hassle at all .
F	would definitely_recommend ,
F	the lack of intervention from ebay is very frustrating when things go_wrong .
F	when it goes well it is average .
F	ordered an oven .
F	paid extra for fitting .
F	fitters didn ' t cut a ventilation hole and the oven overheated and burned the control_panel off .
F	contacted currys many_times by email , letter , phone and in store and this was never resolved .
F	don ' t trust these people .
F	don ' t reward them with your business .
F	prices are are well and reliable source ,
F	the service was fast and the food was really fresh and in lovely containers .
F	the taste was perfect .
F	this will be the only chinese restaurant that i will be ordering from now on .
F	well_done and excellent service .
F	i would recommend that perfume to other people as it has a beautiful fragrance .
F	i would buy another one .
F	ordered some flea_treatment for my dogs .
F	fantastic price for the brand we always but from another retailer .
F	delivery arrived within a couple of days .
F	really happy with product , price & service .
F	saw an offer on groupon & checked out the website .
F	ordered the 0 piece marie set in white .
F	room wasn ' t ready when they initially called but were happy to deliver a few weeks_later to suit us .
F	delivery was this week and we are over the moon .
F	we were conscious we had only viewed the furniture online but the quality is fantastic and the installation was done quickly & efficiently on the day which was booked .
F	got a call that day re some missing drawer runners which is no problem .
F	great experience from start to finish .
F	thank_you so much for a first_class service .
F	out baby to be will love their nursery as much as we do :-)
F	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
F	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn ' t either !
F	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
F	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
F	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
F	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
F	i do not recommend to shop here at all !
F	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
F	absolute_disgrace !
F	we used hen_heaven to help organise a hen_weekend in newcastle upon tyne in april_0000 .
F	the whole customer_service experience was fantastic , nothing was too much for them even when we needed to extend the invite / deposit phase to accommodate more people .
F	very professional and organised company and the cost per head we paid was very reasonable too !
F	we dealt_with jack chandler and a girl called beth both are a credit to hen_heaven
F	i booked with a lovely girl that made the process easy for all members and myself .
F	rochelle found the best price for us and i am very glad she did , we stayed in cardiff at the novetel this was a lovely hotel worth the money we paid .
F	the highlight of the weekend was the cocktail_making , perfect for girlies that like to have fun safe to say we all enjoyed the alcohol and got a little tiddly .
F	we also had oceana pass that was a great hit with free bubbly .
F	thanks chilli_sauce i will using you again .
F	wobble wobble , what a great , simple , fun website !
F	great work and is a must visit for all bingo lovers !!
F	!
F	at first it was good it gave me an updated amount for phone and i accepted then got an_email_saying payment would be in by end of day and still_waiting 0days on .
F	and i keep getting emails about having 0 days before price ends they seem unorganised .
F	i have then received payment 0 days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
F	great service , prompt delivery good quality products .
F	very happy .
F	i needed a few extra quid to pay off my bf for the last bit of my holiday ... i was working but i needed to start saving i knew about mazuma and remembered that they send free post bags etc ... i was trying to do it through another site before but i had to send it off myself this gave me no motivation so i never bothered .
F	i logged on put up four phones ... tahts id never be able to sell on ebay or anywhere !!!
F	and i got Â£_00 for them all !!!
F	i was shocked it was that much !...
F	so i filled everything in on m , azuma days_later i received the bag / box posted it few_days_later received my cheque .. yeah sure i felt a bit cheap putting it into my bank but oh well it felt_like free money to me !!!
F	it really is not a scam and to those who say it is .. have you even used the service ???
F	obviously not because thats not what my bank_balance says !!!
F	i will definatly be using this service again !!
F	!
F	i am really glad i found this site !
F	great , cheap ( but not quality cheap ) product and fast_shipping .
F	really easy to use , good layout , easy to sort by whatever you ' re looking for , doesn ' t show hostels that arent available for all dates requested , overall really happy to use hostelbookers
F	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
F	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
F	wrong decision !!!
F	they actually sold me something that they did not have available in their stock , then days after , they sent me an_email_saying that they had " ordered " it from their supplier and it should take maximum 0 weeks .
F	never happened !
F	their costumer_service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
F	no one could locate where the sunglasses were .
F	after a month of no decent update or answer i had enough and requested the cancellation of the order and my refund .
F	it was about a week_ago and so far no sign of my money .
F	i sent another email to the company ' s costumer_service asking when the refund will be provided and again , the unclear , non precise answers started .
F	now , they claim that their system is down and their accountant department cannot deal with the refund right now but they will , asap .
F	there is no telephone_number you can call , only one email address and that is it .
F	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
F	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
F	i am so disgusted and upset about this situation that i decided i will deal with master card directly and hopefully get my money back from them .
F	the only thing i have to say is avoid !!!!!
F	the worst experience ever !!!!!
F	!
F	i called autoglass a little unknowingly : i had noticed a chip in my windscreen going into a crack and going through my insurance booklet called the number given for the windscreen damage hotline .
F	the lady helping me was quick and professional , but i only found out at the end of the call i had been speaking to autoglass !
F	i thought i was calling my insurance company !
F	i had been given a time for the next_day in the afternoon , but received a call in the morning asking me if earlier would be more convenient as they had an open slot .
F	the gentleman arriving was quick and clear on the service provided , and even tried helping me with my flat battery ( for which the car needed to be towed later in the day ).
F	we had a nice chat and the work was done within 00_minutes .
F	and it was free as it ' s a further damage - preventing repair !
F	i couldn ' t possibly rate them higher and would recommend them to anyone :)
F	i only used the site once , to test if the quality of printing sent digitally from my laptop would print well with this company .
F	i watched the videos and downloaded the print profiles , following the recommended steps all the way .
F	when my prints arrived , i was blown_away - i have never seen my own work printed this nicely before !
F	i love the various kinds of paper they offer , they really bring an additional dimension to the chosen images .
F	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn ' t even have me registered as their customer .
F	good website that helps you find a high_quality policy at a premium you can afford .
F	they will search all of their providers to find our cheapest car_insurance quote for you .
F	excellent service .
F	they ' re offering cheap rates for international calling to any phone , all over the world .
F	they offer the best selection of quality plaques .
F	i am very satisfied with the products i received .
F	looking around for supplements with a budget in mind is a difficult task , but supplementwarehouse . com make it easy .
F	they have the best prices i ' ve seen in years in stores or online .
F	the vast_selection of products and readiness to beat out competitors prices and availability of supplements is outstanding and puts them more_than just a head above the rest .
F	i will be pleased to recommend this site to all my friends .
F	whatever you need they have !!
F	!
F	i purchased a pair of ray_ban wayfarer on 00 / 00 /_0000 and was really pleased when i received an_email the next_day saying that my purchase had been shipped .
F	the sunglasses arrived in around 0 days which was fantastic !
F	however , even_though the website is a . co . uk website , these sunglasses have been shipped to me from_hong_kong - which made me doubt my purchase straight_away .
F	when i opened the package the sunglasses were in perfect_condition and came with authenticity etc but the lense size was smaller_than i had expected .
F	at this point i wasn ' t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
F	so i went abck on to the website to try and find a telephone_number to contact them on .
F	no such luck .
F	there is no contact number on the whole website !
F	so i had to write an_email to thier customer_service email address and hope for the best .
F	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
F	now ..... 00 days after receiving this item and 00 emails later sent to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk and servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk i still do not have a returns merchandise number for my purchase ( en0000000000g ).
F	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
F	i honestly wish i had just bought these sunglasses from a highstreet retailer , and at_least i would know where they had come from , and would have a point of call for any_queries i might have regarding the purchase - for the sake of saving Â£_00 !
F	i have never received such appaulingly low levels of customer_service , and i will not be purchasing from your website again , and certainly will not be recommending you to anybody .
F	i don ' t usually_write online reviews about these sort of things but your lack of communication has made me realise that you seem to respond to complaints on trustpilot . co . uk and not via your customer_service email address .
F	regards
F	unhappy customer
F	this shop is amazing !
F	arrived fast , more_than well_packaged !
F	a sledgehammer couldn ' t have damaged my items !
F	i bought two_pairs of boots and they were fantastic !
F	very cheap and amazing quality .
F	thank_you joke . com !!
F	!
F	i had never ordered from , or heard of , homesupply prior to this order .
F	i ordered some bristan wall - mounted bridge mixer taps for the utility room and some bath overflow / waste things .
F	firstly , they had what i wanted and the prices were very competitive .
F	there seemed a wide_selection of things but i already had decided what i wanted .
F	secondly , the best bit about them as far as i was concerned was the regular email_updates which i found really helpful and re - assuring .
F	every_step of the order and dispatch process was matched with an_email to me .
F	delivery was fast .
F	i would not hesitate in using them again .
F	beware when changing to this company haven ' t had a bill for 0 months and they want to put my payments up think they bit off more_than they can chew
F	had to get a parcel to my son in england urgently .
F	rang unibaggage , they delivered as promised .
F	have no_hesitation in recommending this company and will be using anytime i need a parcel sent .
F	good customer care is a rare thing these days , but 0_stars to unibaggage .
F	the item arrived within two days of ordering and looks brilliant .
F	thank_you
F	emily
F	very trust_worthy , very safe , simply the best money processor for online payments there is .
F	the website is very helpful for different travellers .
F	it ' s nice not to pay extra and feel secure about your booking .
F	thanks :)
F	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife ' s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
F	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won ' t see them alive !
F	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
F	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i ' m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
F	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
F	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid extra for the before 0pm delivery .
F	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
F	and cannot get through via phone .
F	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
F	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
F	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
F	found the sight really easy to use , ordered the cartridge - which was easy to find - the item was delviered next_day with no damages or holds up .
F	excellent service .
F	i ' ve been looking for a particular product , which is hard to find in the uk .
F	not only did buyhair . co . uk have what i was looking for , they had it in more colours than anywhere_else and for a better price .
F	the delivery was quick and the product was exactly as advertised .
F	i will_definitely be using the company again .
F	convenient and easy to use , always had great experiences !
F	i bought a case for my new phone .
F	the description on the website was correct , the delivery was very quick , and the price was amazing .
F	have never seen this hostelsorderservice before , always used hostel . com and hostelworld . com .
F	unexpectedly , this hostelbooker . com showed more options , which were much more suitable .
F	fast procedure and fast reply !
F	very nice
F	first time using the online delivery service and maybe my last , estimated 00 pounds online shopping receipt was 000_pounds , 00 quid of it was for 00 tubs ( they didn ' t deliver 00 tubs ) of ice_cream i didn ' t even order , called customer_services and was told they ' d call tomorrow ?
F	y tomorrow ??
F	y not sort it now ?
F	then ill have to wait 0 days for money to return to my account ... come on sainsburys not good !!
F	!
F	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
F	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
F	but when i tweeted them again , they responded within ten_minutes ?
F	lol .
F	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
F	i came home that night to a delivery card saying hermes attempted delivery but would return the day after .
F	when the day after my order arrived i was fuming .
F	after dealing_with their awful customer_service , i realised that them saying my refund was being_processed was a complete lie given my order was being delivered the same day i was supposedly getting my money back .
F	i ' m beyond irritated by the way i was treated and will never use your site again , and will be telling friends and family to avoid also unless they wish to be treated with complete disrespect .
F	and just to add , i didn ' t get petty over a five pound order , i spent over sixty pounds .
F	i wrote about this on my blog , a full rave review sharing how incredible this was .
F	my opinions on this brand where so high numerous people have already ordered products by the brand .
F	the items are of superb quality , have used them before and will_definitely be using them again .
F	i ventured into one of their stores today to buy an item for my camera .
F	they were very helpful and polite and even tried the product i was after on one of their sales items so i could see exactly_what i was buying and how it fitted .
F	they didn ' t treat it like a waste of time and couldn ' t do enough for me .
F	it wasn ' t even an expensive item .
F	i will use them again without_hesitation .
F	i entered my details on the website on the sunday , opted to have them send me the pack so as to send the phone back .
F	i received that on the tuesday , sent the phone back and got my email on the wednesday saying they had the phone and would send me my payment that day .
F	wanted an instant transfer and that ' s exactly_what i got , no_quibble , just money in the bank .
F	if i ' d have known it was that easy i would have done it ages_ago instead of giving my old_phones away .
F	good price too for a phone i haven ' t used in months .
F	wouldn ' t have even thought about it but happened to see an advert on the box and thought " why not ".
F	deffo gonna be using this company again and i reccommend you do the same if you ' ve got a phone kicking about !!
F	!
F	i always use hostelbookers when i travel !
F	it is so simple to use and i always find the best prices .
F	i have booked probably about seven or eight times through this website and i have had a great experience every time .
F	there are many of these televised phone buying websites but following their release of an advert which is related to charlie and the chocolate factory , i knew which was the company to use !!
F	!
F	i went online and got a quote for my old iphone and compared that to the prices people were paying on ebay , i opted for mazuma as the price was fair and it would cut out the extra costs i . e .
F	commission / listing fees on ebay .
F	i sent my phone which cost Â£ 0 . 00 through insured mail and received emails constantly keeping me updated on the process and then my cheque arrived within days .
F	the service is brilliant and so very quick !
F	never at any point did this company give me any reason to doubt them !
F	highly_recommended .
F	quick speedy service .
F	would recommend using them .
F	i was delighted to discover cult_pens - the range they offer is extensive , and much_better value than any shop i ' ve found in bristol or plymouth .
F	the website is well_designed , with a range of search functions that make it easy to find what you ' re looking for even if you don ' t know the name of the product .
F	the delivery and service are faultless .
F	i was hesitant to order first because of the low_prices , but after_reading the reviews i decided to go_ahead with it .
F	i ' m_glad i did because the postage was fast and the product was exactly_what i ordered , can ' t complain .
F	i will_definitely be using this website again .
F	i was looking for somewhere that sold ghds , i tried everywhere but i couldn ' t find any in the shops so i tried online , the only website i could trust was this on , and because it had money off i decided to buy .
F	i couldn ' t be_happier , they arrived the next_day as promised and they work excellently , i don ' t know how i managed with my other straighteners , it now takes me half the time and my hair is actually straight !!
F	!
F	i ordered and the next_day it arrived .
F	a very excellent service , thank_you !
F	i had lasik intralase wavefront performed on both of my eyes in february_0000 and an enhancement , but lets call it a correction in october_0000 and have regretted that decision ever since .
F	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
F	every_single day i have to deal with my eyes stinging and feeling achy and tired .
F	eye_drops have become part of my everyday life .
F	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
F	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
F	nice bright summer days are no_longer enjoyable to me due to becoming light sensitive , i often find myself wearing sunglasses on a relatively dull day to help with the floaters and brightness sensitivity .
F	my vision fluctuates constantly and although i am told i have 00 / 00 vision , this does not mean the same as perfect vision as i was led to believe pre_- lasik .
F	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
F	i truly believe that within 0 year i shall be back to wearing contact_lenses .
F	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
F	this procedure cost me a staggering Â£_0k , i may as well of thrown that money in a bin .
F	having this surgery truly has affected my life immensely as i now suffer from high anxiety and often get depressed about my situation .
F	anyone considering this procedure should really do their research as the side effects really can ruin your life .
F	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it ' s really not worth the risk !
F	if only i could turn back time i would walk out of that surgery room with my eyes unharmed !
F	when i was ordering my internet crashed and i didn ' t know if the order had gone_through so i sent hifiheadphones an_email .
F	they rang me 00_minutes later to let me know it hadn ' t gone_through .
F	then when i managed to complete the order they sent me a personal email to confirm that this time it definitely had gone_through .
F	i thought that was excellent .
F	the item arrived very quickly , and included a free lolly .
F	small gestures are appreciated !
F	also the product is great - i have already_recommended the product and the website to 0 people .
F	i would buy off this site again .
F	my order arrived about a week after i ordered and the hair is lovely and soft .
F	the clips are all in working order , i have bought loads of clip in extensions in the past and i ' ve noticed that usually some of the clips don ' t work .
F	but these all work .
F	i wish i ordered a extra pack though because my hair is quite thick and the extensions ( 0packs ) are still too thin at the ends .
F	but having said that i will buy again in future *****
F	i was not pleased with my order at all ... the stickers . where too small there for we are not able to use for . buisness ....
F	i am very upset and very unsatisfied with my order ...
F	online courses made easy .
F	available 00 / 0 to fit into any schedule .
F	highly_recommended .
F	ec0000
F	i am satisfied with the system of this website . also , i found a hostel that i booked without service fee !!!
F	!
F	it is unique that i have never met !!!
F	!
F	hostelbookers is a great website , and it is cheaper_than hostel_world !
F	it is very easy to use and i believe the people leave descent reviews for everyone , so the travel experience becomes the best !
F	so thank_you hostelbookers for making my travel better and easier .
F	i have used wowcher twice .
F	both_times the deals were misleading , listing things that weren ' t included in the price , and both experiences were disappointing .
F	recently i contacted_wowcher three times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
F	i have nothing good to say about wowcher , don ' t use them .
F	brilliant from start to finish .
F	i used this company for my last place of work and it was so easy and straight_forward to use .
F	keep up the good work guys !
F	was put off by the website , quite tricky to make a booking .
F	unfortunately my order was not even placed with the carrier , and i am still_waiting for my refund !
F	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
F	one call .... to someone_else , more like !
F	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story .... no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
F	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont be using again .
F	i recently did a project on comparing on - line parcel companies and here are my findings ..
F	the dodgy website should have been enough to scare me away , no parcel collection , no response to my emails , no telephone support , no support at all .
F	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont be using again .
F	absolutely discussing service .
F	i was let_down less_than 00 before i flew , i had to try and arrange another luxury car for my business trip .
F	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
F	i had to ring them to confirm my booking at which point i was told it was not going to be possible , at what point were they going to let me know ?!!!!
F	never again !
F	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
F	i use glasses_direct all the time after having it recomended to me , i found the high_street so expensive , i have only had the experiance of the reglazing service from them , and can ' t fault it at all .
F	have recommened it to all i know !
F	within my price range and stunning quality .
F	only wish i could get married twice :-)
F	delivered quicker_than_expected
F	would have absolutly no reservations_about using again
F	also really good value for money couldn ' t find it cheaper anyhwere else !
F	never answer the phone - didn ' t have the stock .
F	poor .
F	i was very pleased to find the product arrived so fast .
F	was disappointed once i opened the package .
F	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
F	can ' t even use it .
F	i spent an_hour trying to book flights through this site ; every time i got to payment after entering full details for 0 passengers , the site would fail .
F	you couldn ' t even tell if you ' d paid or not , it was so frustrating .
F	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot cheaper .
F	don ' t use opodo , it ' s a waste of your time .
F	parcel0go were very helpful , they entered all the information for me via the live_chat so i only had to pay for the delivery , i would definitely use them again .
F	i have recently sold my house using house_network and they were fantastic .
F	they advertise on all the popular and major sites so we had lots of viewings .
F	i found a buyer under 0 weeks and the sale went through very quickly .
F	the viewings were arranged very efficiently by the team at house_network .
F	they are also very well_priced not overpriced like most estate_agents .
F	i would definitely use them again and i would recommend them to everyone too !
F	worst company i have ever_dealt_with ....
F	ever !!!
F	sent my phone on the 0th_june special delivery recieved by them on the 00th_june still no payment i called on friday 0th_july as i think i have given them more then enough time now to pay up , they told me the money would be in my account in the enxt 00hours .
F	waited until monday still not recieved called back on monday to be told the money would be in my account by 0pm that night it wasnt called tuesday again told i was the next in the que to be paid and it will be in my account by 0pm still not recieved called today and demanded i speak to the manager , at 00 . 00 i was advised he will call back within 00mins - called back at 00 . 00 to be advised the manager was on his lunch and will call me at 0 ; 00 , he still hadnt called me back at 0 . 00pm so i called again id been left a message on my phone whilst i was waiting for them to call me and it was a rather blazay " sorry for the confusion " the money will be in your account by the 00th_july for 0 what confusion ?
F	and 0 00th_july 0 weeks after they recieved the phone ............. no when i got through to a advisor i was told the manager was in a meeting then that he was on the phone i advised i wasnt getting off the phone until i had spoke to the manager so to get him out of his " meeting " or off the phone call he was on within 0mins i was speaking to the manager he blamed the slow service on technical_difficulties so i pointed_out all the review sites and reviews from a year_ago with the same kind of service - to which he told me i should take these review sites with a pinch of salt i work for appliances_online which has brilliant reviews on trust pillot so i advised this was utter_rubbish - ive demanded the money be in my account today but apparently there are a million other people in this que ...... to which i have told this manager to go and speak to the account department and fast track my payment - he is apparently calling me back tonight at 0pm - i very much doubt he will but guess_what il be calling back tommorrow !!
F	!
F	i sent my iphone0 00gb to cash for phones on 00 / 00 special delivery recieved on 00 / 00 and im still_waiting for my payment , before i realised how shockilngly sh_* t this company is i told my little sister how much i was getting for my phone and she asked if i would send her phone too ......... after_reading the reviews on cash0phones and then reading the reviews on mazuma i decided to send my sisters phone to mazuma instead , it was sent special delivery on friday 00 / 00 and the money was in my account on tuesday 00 / 00 .
F	i was updated all the way through with the process - unlike cash0phones who i have had to ring 0times and now threatened legal_action aswell as sent the managing_director a message on linkedin advising i have sent a complaint to watchdog - which i have - all to no reponse but they can send reminder letters about my sisters phone i enquired_about sending !!!!
F	!
F	really pleased with how quick and easy it was having me car serviced at fastfit !!
F	and a damn sight cheaper_than the manufacturers garage too :-_d
F	i will never use them again .
F	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0 days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn ' t happen .)
F	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
F	awful
F	we ' ve used hostelbookers a number of times and have found every experience to be great , from the huge choice of hostels and hotels available on their site , to the great prices , ease of booking , and fee free bookings !
F	we ' ve never had a problem with any of our bookings , with all hotels / hostels having our rooms ready on arrival and as booked !
F	we will_definitely continue to use hostelbookers in our travel planning .
F	well what can i say !!
F	pretty_much the same as everyone_else !!
F	ordered the bluebud 0inch tablet for a christmas_present , it has never arrived .
F	i was issued a tracking code which when you use on royal_mails website says " this item cannot be tracked untill its delivered " so that helps !!
F	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
F	i have called bluebud 000s of times .
F	always engaged .
F	sent emails .
F	never replied .
F	have contacted_wowcher god_knows_how many_times .
F	they also never reply go calls of emails .
F	so frustrating .
F	last_week i had an_email askin me to review wowchers service and the item .
F	hahah .
F	probably not the best idea when i haven ' t received it !
F	funny enough .
F	they didnt reply to that email within their 0 day time scale .
F	called last_week for a refund .
F	" oh " " i shall pass this to the refunds team as they need to see if you have a valid reason for a refund ".
F	0 days they said .
F	guess_what !!
F	yes !
F	it ' s been 0 already !
F	please steer_well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
F	i ' m not sure about a wow a day .
F	i would say its about time they called it a day !
F	!
F	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
F	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
F	your time .
F	your patience and frustration .
F	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
F	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
F	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
F	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
F	everybody should pursue this route .
F	i always use hostelbookers and it ' s always great and so easy to use !
F	very stressful experience buying from viagogo .
F	booked tickets for lionel richie for my mams birthday on 00 . 00 . 00 and concert is tomorrow 00 . 00 . 00 and have still not received tickets or any email confirmation that tickets are arriving which is the protcol that the website specifies is supposed to happen .
F	contacted viagogo to no_avail as they blame sellers and only act as an agent .
F	no further updates received and not kept in contact about tickets even_though when speaking to an advisor i was informed that they would look_into it and call me back .
F	would not receommend to anyone .
F	not a happy experience .
F	happy with quote price and service
F	psychedelic prints and outstandingly comfortable ...
F	they get me ready for the weekend ;)
F	xxxxxxxx liz xxxxxxxxxx
F	brilliant products at competative prices !!
F	customer_services are 0 star and i have gone back and bought more since my first purchase !
F	delivery is super_quick !
F	would recommend !
F	couldn ' t be_happier with the items i have purchased !
F	on time and great service ...
F	shipped to me on time !
F	we got the baby waker for our little_boy for christmas , when we got it we put it togerher to see how it looked and i love it so comofy , and our little man loved it as we tryed him in there to see if like it and hes smile told us he did , cant_wait for christmas to come now so he can play in there .
F	i find no other place like gaming dragons which offers latest games at such a discounted price and that too with speedy_delivery .
F	after_reading the bad_reviews on this website i tend to disagree .
F	i have now dealt_with thornton ' s twice and have had great customer_service both_times .
F	i have found the staff to be very diligent and prompt with their replies on email and phone_calls .
F	congrats to the company on hiring great staff .
F	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
F	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
F	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven ' t received 0 days_later .
F	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
F	awful company , don ' t use them .
F	fuss 0 are not only reasonable in price but the staff are extremely_helpful and help beyond their call of duty .
F	fuss 0 ' s after sales is exceptional !
F	why go anywhere_else ?
F	i have used hostel_bookers everywhere i have travelled and always found them easy to use and very clear in their instructions .
F	my favourite feature is the reviews being available to read whether negative or positive and average percentages given for every hostel .
F	i received my products quickly , well_packaged , cheaply and with a couple of freebies .
F	what more could i ask , i was very happy , thank_you very much
F	i have this escada rio perfume and it just finished and i have been looking for a good deal and i found it in cheapsmells . com .
F	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
F	so i thought why not give a try .
F	i order an escada perfume from them .
F	service was good and fast got the perfume within 0 - 0 days .
F	but the product turned_out to be fake .
F	i called the customer_service said i wanted to return the product , first they said they wont accept as i had opened the cellophane packaging and when i mentioned fake and its not similar to the one i have then they said ok send it with a letter stating the reason for you return .
F	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
F	hope they do as they say ..
F	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
F	i ordered a lot of things before_christmas and most of it arrived without any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
F	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0 weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
F	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
F	on a positive note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
F	ordered my tumble drier and it was delivered the next_day in perfect_condition .
F	prices are totally reasonable .
F	will recommend to anyone
F	*****
F	cancelled an order with simply_electronics on the 00th_october after_placing an order on the 00th_october and still no refund !
F	Â£_000 they have belonging to me all they keep doing is changing the status of my refund , yesterday it was at refund completed today it says refund queuing on the gateway and will be with you soon !!!
F	i just don ' t understand !
F	its theft in my opinion , they shouldn ' t be allowed to trade at all .
F	i have also contacted watch_dog to report them .
F	looks_like i ' ve had the same experience as most on this site .
F	i ' m taking_legal_action_against these scumbags
F	i went to sigma to buy a wetsuit on the recommendation of a friend .
F	as it was some distance to travel , i phoned up first , to get some advice on what they have on sale , logistics / parking facilities and the guy i spoke to was really helpful .
F	i knew very little about what type of wetsuit i needed and at the store , i was given a lot of help in fitting .
F	chris , who served me , also looked into which lakes i could go to nearby to try it out , which was great .
F	i was also really impressed with the follow - up service .
F	i had a query about the wetsuit once i got back home and chris phoned me up and sorted it all out very quickly .
F	the sigma store is too far for me to shop there regularly , but i have found the online service really good as well .
F	i purchased a swim cap online and it turned_out that there were none available .
F	however , the customer_service was prompt and helpful and i was sent another ( more_expensive ) swim - cap and it was sent to me as next - day delivery , with no extra_cost , as i needed it that week .
F	i â m really impressed with all aspects of the service .
F	ordered this balance bike after lots of research .
F	it appeared to be the best one which would suit my son from the age of 00 months old .
F	the bike is very well made and should withstand a boistrous young boy !
F	the item didn ' t arrive within the 0 working_days , however after one call to kiddisave they rang the suppliers and confirmed it would be with me by the end of the week , which it was .
F	very good service .
F	sent phone off and within a couple of days i received a cheque for the agreed payment .
F	good company ,
F	ordered a box of byker crisps as they can be quite hard to get hold of !
F	good that you can pay by paypal , makes the transactino a lot quicker .
F	i put the wrong delivery address however , but i emailed the site and they managed to courier it to the correct address .
F	would def use again
F	thanks for sending everything through so quickly .
F	having free delivery is also a massive perk to your service .
F	the products were all considerably_cheaper_than those in my local_shops so i ' m really impressed and will_continue to use you .
F	many_thanks
F	had a discount for hostelworld so went there first .
F	wouldn ' t allow me to book , kept returning me to the info for the hostel and happened to my friend too .
F	wouldn ' t let me register .
F	looked here for the same hostel , clicked book almost instant .
F	will use again .
F	excellent
F	i ordered a bedroom suite ( bed , 0x bedsides and a wardrobe ) from the furniture market having looked around for some time on the internet and the high_street .
F	i came_across the furniture market website and was really impressed with their range of products on offer , their free delivery service and great product knowledge after_speaking to them on the phone .
F	i couldn ' t find similar items cheaper on any other website but most_importantly , having spoken to them on the phone , i had confidence that i was dealing_with a company that were reputable .
F	i received my items shortly the next week and the delivery drivers were more_than courteous lifting the items into the house .
F	the items were well_packed and the sections of the bed and wardrobe fitted together easier than i expected .
F	great buying experience and i will be coming_back again to buy from you !
F	excellent service .
F	mazuma accepted my phone as working even_though i told them in_advance that the buttons were a bit sticky and there was some superficial damage .
F	i sent my phone recorded_delivery on the tuesday , had it accepted on the wednesday and had the money in my account on the friday .
F	will_definately use this company again .
F	unprofessional shoe manager , discussing my husband and his discussion in front of other staff and other custmers , then preceeded to argue with me when i noticed .
F	needless to say i have e mailed the ceo and will refrain from ever shopping there again .
F	only requested an exchange for my sons hat which was faulty !
F	!
F	my complaint regarding vodafone
F	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
F	it simply would not charge .
F	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0 months .
F	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as â charging_port not working â and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
F	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
F	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
F	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
F	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
F	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
F	i agreed to this .
F	off the phone went again .
F	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
F	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
F	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
F	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0 weeks .
F	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
F	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
F	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
F	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
F	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
F	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
F	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
F	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
F	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
F	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
F	this was the fourth time .
F	the phone came back a week_later , working .
F	i thought that was the end of it .
F	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
F	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
F	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
F	i accepted this .
F	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
F	the phone was reconnected .
F	no one called .
F	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
F	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
F	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same_thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
F	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
F	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
F	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn â t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance department .
F	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
F	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
F	he agreed .
F	i received no text .
F	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
F	i woke_up this morning and my phone is not working again .
F	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
F	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
F	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
F	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
F	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
F	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo â_s of my children and my newborn niece .
F	numerous_times my days out with my children has been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
F	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
F	i cannot face another phone call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .

F	awaiting a response from you ,
F	other lenders would not entertain me .
F	clearaccount took my account banking into account and i borrowed an amount i can afford .
F	very quick , straightforward with lower aprs than other lenders .
F	i ' d highly_recommend .
F	nice trade discount .
F	free delivery for orders over Â£_00 .
F	not really any_problems to report ...
F	they delivered my recently ordered pc actually on time , i had no_complaints until the driver arrived at my door .
F	he rang the doorbell i opened it to see him drop my " please handle carefully " pc box both upside_down and from waist height .
F	when i commented on it , he simply grunted at me .
F	i have showdogs and kennels , there is a huge sign on the gate asking people to close it .
F	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
F	a disgraceful representation of a company and i have a feeling from the reviews i ' ve seen below an all to regular view of this company .
F	a0 computer , and very fast service , 0 working_days it was turned around in and with me on the 0th .
F	i ' d looked around at other pc builders and actually came to pc_specialists because of the number of good reviews i kept seeing online ... now i can see why !
F	the website was easy to use and covered all the options that i wanted and needed .
F	once the order was placed i was kept up to date by email and with the excellent my orders section on the website .
F	my only slight complaint and suggestion would be to change courier .
F	my computer arrived , the doorbell rang and he dumped the " please handle carefully " box upside_down and from waist height - i wasn ' t impressed .
F	very fast turn - around and all_round excellent service !
F	i had no_problems at all .
F	fast delivery , friendly but to the point customer_service .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	pleased with the service received from flubit , item was cheapest price on the net and was brand_new and sealed when received .
F	decent delivery time and well_packaged with good comms as to when the item had been dispatched , overall cannot_fault the company and would recommend them to others with no_hesitation .
F	the item ordered was Â£_00 at next cheapest site compared to Â£_00 ( with next_day delivery ) at babycity .
F	item arrived_promptly and was exactly as expected , would certainly recommend and would use the site again .
F	thanks !
F	sarah_hayes was fantasic x
F	would recommend them to anyone , fast efficient service
F	sell your laptop are brilliant .
F	the website was easy to use and produced an accurate estimate , which they later paid in full .
F	the funds were in my paypal account within 00_hours of the laptop leaving my house with the courier !
F	my only critisim would be that when arranging collection you can only select a day , 0 - 0 monday to friday , and are unable to specify further - am or pm would have been nice .
F	they do offer to collect from business properties , but if ( as i do ) you start work midway through the day and are not in the same place all day long it can be tricky .
F	i emailed them my request that am be one location and pm another and it was noted .
F	but the option to do this on the website would really be the cherry on the top .
F	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use sell your laptop again , or to recommend them to anyone who ' ll listen !
F	!
F	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0 days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
F	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
F	so all ok , so far yes .
F	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
F	oh joy i thought so i contacted customer_services who said somebody should ring me .
F	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
F	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn ' t been sent out for delivery ?
F	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
F	only answer was i can try for tomorrow but can ' t guarantee it another unpaid day i will have to take it is ridiculous .
F	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn ' t honour the delivery ?
F	no answer .
F	i have to say this is not the first time this has happened to me and it appears that the collection of parcels are far more important than the actual delivery of them thus being if they run out of time on the day by collecting the parcels they just simply won ' t deliver them .
F	if they can email you to start with to say when they are coming then why can they email to say " actually you have wasted a whole day at home waiting as we have more important things to do than come to your address and deliver your parcel the day we said we would " if i hadn ' t of contacted them they just not have turned_up a shocking way to provide a service .
F	and i am very disappointed no contact , no apology nothing the chap gave me the complaints details whom i could contact then these promptly disappeared off the screen as soon as he ended the chat so the only way i can complain is on here .
F	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
F	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
F	i got a new phone on contract and i really didn ' t like the handset i just couldn ' t get to grips with it just wanted a quick and easy sale a friend_recommended enviro phone to so i went online and was amazed at the price offered from start to finish you were kept in the loop at all of the stages they are very professional and very fast sending out the packaging and when sending payment i would definitely reccomend them .
F	i would recommend this to anyone_looking to unlock their phone .
F	fast , easy , cheap !
F	well worth it !
F	i love vodafone ive tried other_networks but always end up coming_back to vodafone
F	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0 days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
F	?
F	the website is great - especially the " cocktail " section .
F	it ' s such a easy way to find out how to make my favorite cocktail and buy all the ingredients directly :)
F	it is a best online album for me , easy upload with picasa tools .
F	used it few_years , it is secure and fast , convenience .
F	used to blog with blogger everyday !
F	is a convenience online diary ^^
F	got their cheap and excellent deal before with their promo !
F	thanks to airasia as i can always fly with their exciting promo !
F	always found the ideal and cheapest hotel through agoda and user_friendly .
F	use this service last 0 year and my item got stolen .
F	i cant find my phone model specification after 0 years later ...
F	google is my dictionary !
F	!
F	i ' m suprised how good these 0d images are considering they come from a flat photograph - very impressive and i ' d thouroughly recommend them .
F	i always use hostelbookers while travelling to browse and book_hostels online .
F	it is cheaper_than hostel_world as there is no booking_fee , i ' ve never had any_problems using it as a third_party to book , upon_arriving at the place i ' m staying .
F	it ' s handy because you can filter your searches , view as a list or map_view , and various other features that make it easy to hunt for a place to stay , whatever your need .
F	i ' ve even managed to use it to book on intermittent wifi on my iphone with no_problems .
F	this is the first time i have used hospitality_finder , and certainly will not be the last !
F	i dealt_with gareth burch , and from the first phone conversation to the follow_up call after the event he could not have been any more friendly and helpful .
F	i did not attend the event myself , i booked it for my director and he was extremely impressed with how the day went .
F	i would highly_recommend gareth and the hospitality_finder - thanks again for your help !
F	i ' ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .
F	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
F	unfortunately , they suffer in terms of customer_service .
F	if you have any_problems with ebay ( or paypal ) you ' ll have a very frustrating experience trying to get things sorted .
F	great website , and i still buy from there regularly , but selling is something i find myself doing a lot less lately .
F	easy to use website , quick delivery and great returns service .
F	i ' m a regular ample bosom customer , and on the rare_occasion that i order the wrong item , they have a brilliant returns service .
F	the staff are very helpful and i always get a quick email response whenever i contact them .
F	overall , a highly_recommended lingerie site .
F	i ordered a go pro camera with you for Â£_000 on 00rd august and promised delivery within 00 days .
F	it has now been 00 working_days and i have no go pro and no response to my emails regarding this matter .
F	i refuse to call an 0000 number from my mobile and i don ' t have access to a landline so i am relying on email communication which has not been forthcoming ,
F	i ' m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
F	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
F	if i don ' t receive any contact from them by the end of this week , i will be contacting cab and escalating this further until the matter is resolved .
F	as above .
F	would use again .
F	a great choice of stock for all your baking needs - i expect i will be back when i have more birthdays coming up !
F	delivery was fast and efficient .
F	overall , very pleased with planet bake :)
F	i chose this website after googling " muscle_milk " and seeing that the price was much lower_than the other_websites .
F	the website explains that other_sites add shipping_costs into their products in order to have cheaper shipping or no shipping_costs for the customer .
F	supplementwarehouse . com does have a higher shipping_costs than other_websites but i went through the checkout proccess on supplementwarehouse . com and on another supplement site and even with the larger shipping amount the total was still less at supplementwarehouse . com !!
F	highly_recommend !
F	very good company .
F	easy to use and fast payment .
F	would use the company again .
F	definitely the best poker site for starters and high stakers no other poker site like it you can deposit a fiver and hit the 00 p 00 p cash tables and play against people all_round england ive played every site under the sun pokerstars , 000 poker , pkr , titan poker , william_hill , partypoker and none compare to sky_poker its the best poker site by_far .
F	i would like to thank the home laundry company and mark in particular for the exceptional customer_service and for supplying a quality product .
F	i made a couple of glitches when ordering and instead of being ignored or fobbed_off mark went out of his way to ensure i got the product i wanted .
F	dare i say it - it is the most beautiful washing line ever !
F	my only recommendation would be to speak to mark or one of his_colleagues prior to ordering to make_sure you are buying the right line for your needs .
F	i cannot recommend this company or its staff highly_enough
F	mrs b
F	very efficient and helpful staff_members .
F	i was contacted within 0 minutes after making the payment to confirm the transaction and within the next two days the watch arrived .
F	it looked exactly the same as presented on the website .
F	i would only appreciate to receive the invoice with my name and address on it .
F	as a professional makeup artist i am always looking for quality products and regularly purchase from crown .
F	delivery is always fast too which is a bonus !
F	the 0pc hd set is amazing , each brush feels so luxurious on the skin and am considering purchasing another set for my kit .
F	another of my favourites is the b00 angle blush brush , it also feels soft and luxurious whilst still being dense enough to apply colour evenly and is great for contouring !
F	i always recommend crown to my friends as they have the same quality as high end brands without the hefty price_tag !
F	well_done crown , keep up the good work !!
F	!
F	i booked a roundtrip from london , heathow to san_francisco international ( sfo ) with them .
F	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
F	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .
F	all is well i thought and proceeded to choose a seat . next morning i tried to print my boarding_pass only to find that i couldn ' t choose myself as passenger and the seat reverted back to unassigned . i went to the airport , went to the self check in - of course same story there . an agent helped_me , to no_avail . the check in agent told me she ' s sorry but for this booking i do not have priority in boarding so i needed to go to the gate and wait for an agent - i still did not have the seat i paid for . an agent finally arrived and i made a beeline for the queue - only to find out guess_what , i had a standby ticket .
F	netflights or aa or both screwed up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
F	had i not been the first in line i would have been stuck in sfo - the flight was indeed overbooked .
F	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
F	never ever again .
F	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
F	well no , e_- ticket number as well as the booking code they provided were of no use to me .
F	inf act on viewtrip .
F	com which netflights lead you to , my flight status reverted to ' not operating ' indicating that unbeknownst to me i had been relegated to standby on a ticket i paid for .
F	fast delivery , reliable service , wide_range of products , foolproof return and claim procedures , also offers good deals on used books and cds , and their prime and one day shipping policies rock .
F	can ' t ask for more .
F	i had to review you after getting my items on a timely_manner ( when one of your competitors lost the items in transit and then refused to refund me ): i will always order protein items from you .
F	i ordered egg_whites after searching for an_alternative to us egg beaters in the uk and am very pleased .
F	i ' d also ordered crunchy peanut_butter and it ' s the best i ' ve tasted -- wasn ' t expecting it as the only ingredient in it is peanuts !
F	perfect for my fitness_goals .
F	my one request is if you can provide liquid egg substitute as well -- not just egg_whites , similar to us egg beaters .
F	thanks for the good service !
F	i organised the hen_party for my sister in law and she still can not get over how perfect the weekend was !
F	we organised the house ( the lighthouse ) and the activities through big_fat brighton_weekend and i can not start to explain how helpful they were at every_stage of booking , how they were understanding with issues i had , how they helped_me decide what we could do to have the most fun and just providing us with the foundation for a great weekend .
F	one thing i would totally recommend to anyone booking a weekend away for a large_group is to stay in a big house , its much_better_than a groggy hotel where everyone has to pair off .
F	the house we stayed in was beautiful , big and airy .
F	the rooms were massive and the living_room was much bigger than_expected !
F	which was perfect for all the games we had planned .
F	the activities were wicked , we did the pop video !
F	it was awesome , it was a proper studio and they did your make up , there were props and they taught you dance routines ( don ' t worry they weren ' t that difficult !)
F	i would just like to say a massive thank_you to clare she is so so lovely and absolutely awesome at organising brilliant weekends !
F	thank_you so much !
F	!
F	found a hotel and was able to book with no_problems .
F	then the hostel itself contacted me within an_hour or so to confirm which was wonderful .
F	have been shopping at amazon . co . uk for more_than a year and i have nothing but good to say about the site .
F	really easy to use and most of the times i find everything i want on stock .
F	is probably the fastest ( items arrived the next_day ) and most reliable online shopping world .
F	purchased some items and was told by the website that i would be able to book a one hour delivery slot - next_day - with dpd .
F	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
F	after_reading the emails , it appeared that they would only arrange delivery after dispatch .
F	so i waited , and late last_night i had an_email to say my goods would arrive tomorrow !
F	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two days_later but never mind i ' ll just book a days annual_leave !
F	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
F	so i ' m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
F	thanks viovet , what an_absolute con .
F	i will not be using you again !
F	prompt email confirmation , easy to use and compare hostels .
F	bought a karcher k0 . 000 jubilee pressure washer 000 bar for much cheaper_than anyone_else .
F	arrived next_day .
F	quick no hassle purchase , thankyou
F	at first i was a little iffy about sending off my old_mobiles , but the process was easy , quick and most_importantly safe .
F	after putting in the brand and type of mobiles i wanted to get_rid of on the mazuma website , i was shown how much i could get for them and once i accepted the amount , i chose the best payment option .
F	then , i got sent the envelope and off they went !
F	the payment got sent within two days .
F	i visited the website and printed off the address label and other required paperwork .
F	i popped my mobile in a jiffy_bag and the next_day received confirmation that it had arrived .
F	the phone was processed and checked , i opted for the same day transfer and was notified when the money was put into my bank !!!
F	i got Â£_00 for my phone which was a very welcome january bonus !!!!
F	!
F	able to clearly see the cost per_person and room option , quick easy and straight_forward .
F	the 00_% to hold the booking so much more helpful than paying all upfront to get the best deals !
F	i called their telephone customer_service today to help find an item but received horrible customer_service !!
F	:
F	0 ) they stuck to their rote learnt bookish lines insisting i give them item number .
F	there was absolutely no desire to budge or help or " waste time " on a customer wanting to spend the money on their company and buying the product .
F	0 ) to begin with , he spent good long time asking me to confirm my address , my landline_number , my email address , my full name as though i was calling a bank and not a happy shopping place .
F	0 ) when i said this is not so great customer_service , there was not a single word of apology just to make me feel better at_least ... it was a mere okay ... like im calling some royal highness where i should be sorry i wasted their time .
F	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
F	0 ) the quality isn ' t to die for - but would have been bearable if i was at_least treated like a customer they cared to retain .
F	it ' s so sad to see when a company is suffering because their customer_service is amazingly horrible .
F	i would rather spend double the money on a product that is given to me with precious customer_service
F	i bought a chemistry set for my nephew which was what he had wanted .
F	was really impressed by how quickly it was dispatched
F	i searched online for the best â¬ rates and " the currency_club " topped the table .
F	i only needed â¬_000 and almost all providers ( except saga ) wanted a â¬_000 minimum order for free delivery but not tcc , their minimum is â¬_000 .
F	i ordered , cleared checkout ( before 0pm ) and then the postman knocked for a signature the next_day when the monies arrived very well_packaged .
F	will be my first_port of call from now on .
F	littlewoods are great easy to use service and fast delivery always
F	i would say that cex is the better online than instore so go for it online
F	excellent posted tuesday got money wednesday amazing service perfect in everyway
F	i use top_cashback whnever i need to shop online , i regulary use a company for pet supplies so love that i get a little_bit of money back each time i shop .
F	never had any_problems with recieving credit & have used the cashback to purchase treats from amazon a couple of times a year .
F	would definitely_recommend to anyone
F	i rang kiddies kingdom as i had some questions about delivery dates , they were very helpful & accomodating .
F	i placed my order with confidence & it arrived exactly on time in perfect_condition .
F	i will_definitely be using them again as i prepare for the arrival of my first child
F	good reliable service , lots of options from ways to collect and deliver .
F	good coverage of service at reasonable prices per weight .
F	friendly staff .
F	all_round great service
F	throughly recommend whittard of chelsea , they have a gorgeous luxury hot_chocolate range with new varieties to try !
F	the fruit and herbal teas are also great .
F	also have some great offers via_email !
F	have always had promt service and deliveries well_packaged .
F	highly_recommend .
F	needing a ring wraith sword urgently , as one often does , i looked around websites for a decent priced sword with cheap postage and a quick delivery time .
F	impossible , some may say !
F	however , i came_across this website on my search and was pleasantly_surprised by their pricing and shipping times .
F	all was fine and dandy until i got the check - out and saw an option for " click and collect ".
F	this absolutely blew my mind .
F	they would send it to a locker near me and then message me with the locker number and code the next_day !
F	whoah .
F	so , anyway , this was appealing and i ordered right away .
F	unfortunately , my sword was too big for the locker and so i didn ' t get to try out this secret - agent - style service , instead , they upgraded me to next_day delivery for free .
F	the package arrived_safely , the sword was very wraith - like and i don ' t feel as though i spent too much .
F	i would recommend these fellows as i don ' t have a bad_word to say about them .
F	if you want a company that :
F	0 . lies ,
F	0 . gives you wrong information ,
F	0 . blames everyone_else when things go_wrong ,
F	0 . are unhelpful ,
F	0 . have terrible customer_service ,
F	0 . try to rip you off ,
F	0 . refuse to help you ,
F	0 . hang_up on you
F	0 . leave you waiting on hold for ages
F	00 . sends you on wild goose chases
F	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
F	!
F	i was unfortunate enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
F	trying to get a refund from these is like trying to get water out of a stone , only the stone would probably be a lot more helpful and courteous .
F	their customer_service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
F	their staff are rude , arrogant , unhelpful , send you on wild goose chases , hang_up on you , refuse to help you out , speak down at you , insist they ' re correct even when all the facts say other wise , ignore your requests and generally don ' t appear to be able to understand basic english .
F	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
F	total_con !
F	quickly found the jacket i was looking for at a very competative price .
F	the online ordering system didn ' t like me for some reason but my order was quickly and efficiently taken when i phoned up and my tnf jacket arrived the next_day .
F	i ' m very happy with the product and the service i ' ve received and will be back to check out some more deals soon .
F	quick delivery and great when it came to keeping me informed how my delivery was processing .
F	the sweet in the parcel is a nice friendly touch too .
F	i am very satisfied and happy with charm school - uk .
F	very nice contact .
F	quick answers by e_- mail .
F	highly_recommended .
F	gladly again .
F	the charm is beautiful and very well made :-) i love it .
F	just top !
F	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .
F	i have also written twice and not received a reply .
F	rubbish company .
F	this is the easiest_way to buy tyres , you put in your registration no and it tells you which tyres you need with all the different prices .
F	pick what you want , i always get the cheaper ones , ( i dont do a lot of miles and no long journeys ).
F	then pick what day you want them fitted .
F	you just pitch up on that day and jobs done .
F	un site que_je recommande absolument pour l ' achat de montres .
F	rien_Ã  dire sur_le produit et sur les dÃ©lais , et aussi - fait rare pour moi , comme je pense pour beaucoup de client - excellente conseillÃ¨re en ligne , charlotte , qui accompagne le client tout au long de sa commande , du choix initial Ã _l ' achat du produit .
F	absolument ravie des emplettes que_j ' ai fait pour la fin d ' annÃ©e , que_je rÃ©itÃ©rerai sans aucun mal , si j ' ai la chance de retomber sur des professionnels du mÃªme acabit .
F	the items arrived shortly_after i ordered it .
F	this is the second time i have ordered with barrington_sports and was equally as pleased then .
F	i was recommended to use barrington_sports by a friend and have not been disappointed !
F	i am not a big_fan of online shopping especially when it comes to clothes .
F	that ' s why i had tons of questions and doubts about my purchase .
F	i called three times to verify the sizes and colors and to ask everything that could come to mind .
F	the lovely girl i spoke to was ever so patient and friendly .
F	she addressed my every doubt and gave me a piece of mind - something i really_appreciate when shopping online .
F	during the last few month i have had the most terrible experience with this platform ' s service .
F	i had posted a review for a company i ' ve been using for quite some time .
F	without any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
F	when i tried to find out what was wrong i was asked to provide information and documentations containing personal information .
F	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
F	during this time i was unable to even log_into my account .
F	i got banned for no reason and they had basically accused me of posting a lie !
F	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
F	imagine my surprise when i found out i was not the only one going through all this .
F	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
F	who do they think they are ?
F	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
F	my initial review was deleted .
F	i would not be surprised if this one gets deleted , too .
F	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
F	and your account is to follow .
F	edit_:
F	i just found out that there were other people who went through the same issues but their reviews did not get deleted and are still on the site .
F	i would very much like to receive an explanation .
F	why was my review deleted ?
F	what exactly didn ' t trustpilot like about it ?
F	was it against some rules ?
F	what was the reason ?
F	i believe i deserve an explanation .
F	hostelbookers is a great site which makes it easy to find the cheapest but also the best hostels possible .
F	i ' ve used it twice this week to book_hostels in hamburg and krakow and will_continue to use it when booking the rest of my trip around_europe .
F	it ' s really easy to use and makes the organising of a trip much simpler and stress_free .
F	i recommend !
F	as a specialist shop in electronics you would think that they would have a wide_selection of solder , not so .
F	they don ' t even have something as basic as simple as 00 / 00 0 . 00mm solder .
F	the 0mm solder takes far too long to melt , and the tips for the solder irons are poor , they should at_least be chisel , not point .
F	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
F	i am seriosuly considering funky_pigeon .
F	bought a jean paul gaultier gift set , was easy to order and recieved item a day before stated , no_problems and no_quibbles .
F	fantastic quality , had a sofabed delivered , both very comfortable and affordable .
F	can ' t go_wrong with john_lewis or waitrose .
F	love the hampstead branch , very friendly staff and there is always a good audience .
F	they really do follow the wittertainment code of conduct !
F	!
F	i bought two items that were delivered via_royal_mail , they came quickly but unfortunately i needed to return one of the items because i accidently ordered the wrong_colour .
F	they were very helpful with my return and promptly sent me a replacement once i told them of my dilemma .
F	great service !
F	!
F	from the moment we walked_into marlows we received wonderful customer_service .
F	a lady_called margaret served us , she explained all about the different type of diamonds before asking about what our price range was for my engagement_ring .
F	she then bought out lots of different rings to allow me to decide which one suited me best .
F	she was honest the whole time and didnt try and get us to up our budget .
F	i ' d definitely_recommend marlows in terms of price , we got the ring for a third cheaper_than you would pay for one from a normal high_street shop .
F	thank_you for the wonderful service , we will definetely be going back for our_wedding_bands :)
F	the website is really easy to navigate and the reviews are both useful and insightful .
F	my favourite feature is being_able to pay the deposit and a cancellation insurance fee , as i have found my plans can often change at the last_minute .
F	this means i will only lose a small amount of cash , but have felt_confident that i have a place to stay when arriving somewhere on my own !
F	have used on more_than one_occasion always very quick delivery .
F	i am really happy with the items themselves and fancy_dress ball ' s service they dispatched my item very quickly as i ordered last_minute and the items should have arrived on time .
F	however due to interlink_express trying to deliver to the wrong building i didn ' t get my order until the next morning which was just about in time but later than i was hoping for .
F	i still got everything just about in time as i needed it that evening .
F	ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 no reply .
F	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
F	am very pleased with this service & would definitely_recommend it to all my friends & would also use in the future !!
F	many_thanks !
F	!
F	this is the first time that i have used servicing_stop and it made a huge difference having someone on the end of the telephone who was polite , helpful , and kept me well informed .
F	having your vehicle serviced can be quite an expense as well as not knowing who you can trust to deliver a good service .
F	i feel completely_satisfied with the work that has been carried_out , the overall experience was a very good one , i will_definitely be using servicing_stop again .
F	thanks
F	superb service , kept up to date during the whole_process .
F	we are so pleased with the canvas , the quality is flawless and looks better_than the photo we used !
F	thank_you for such a fantastic memory which we are now able to cherish forever :-)
F	i have used hostelbookers many , many_times and have never had even the slightest problem .
F	it ' s easy to navigate , has a great range of hostels for all over the world and tells you everything you need to know about each one .
F	the fact that there ' s no booking_fee and frequent competitions really helps too !
F	without hostelworld my year abroad would have been a much more stressful experience !
F	thank_you so much guys !
F	had the item i wanted , at a competitive price , easy to order and arrived the next_day !
F	brilliant service , thank_you very much :-)
F	never had such a disappointing_experience as a customer .
F	they took money for my item nearly 00 days ago now .
F	they ignored several complaint emails .
F	they continue to send group emails about there is admin issues and your item is on its way but its not .
F	then today another email including a form i had already filled out 00 - 00 days ago .
F	i regret to say following this experience i will be avoiding this company from hereon as they clearly do not care about the individuals involved .
F	groupon provides a far more efficient and satisfactory experience and when that fails for what ever reason , they are more genuinely concerned_about the individuals and give small_amounts of complimentary compensation unlike wowcher .
F	had been asked to do the photos for a wedding , although i am learning the art of photography , the lens choice was hard to select , i had one in mind and they helped_me understand the cons about that lens .
F	i spoke to dan at lenses for hire who was brilliant .
F	enjoyed speaking to him and took his advice .
F	he tried to help me save money and i really got the impression that he was there to help .
F	i would definately use these_guys again .
F	i loved the website with the comical humour and am greatful for the service .
F	i ended_up with great lenses and the service was amazing .
F	the photos are brilliant too .
F	thank_you guys !!!
F	!
F	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
F	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more_than 00 quid coud this be the reason ?
F	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
F	!
F	i bought 00 " human hair , it was so thin i had to go online to find more as it just wasn ' t enough for a full head .
F	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
F	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
F	i sent the phone off on thursday , received an_email_saying it had been received on friday and the cheque arrived on saturday !!
F	what more could you ask for , a professional , simple and fast transaction , i wouldn ' t use any other mobile phone_recycling company .
F	anastasia is a very professional coach and she helped_me to look at my problem from a different point of view .
F	i recommend her as a coach , as she also has a lot of life experience , positive attitude and a strong character .
F	i also really like her free tips that she is sharing in her weekly mailing - would recommend it to all my friends .
F	really fantastic prices for such a wide_range of products , so many shades and options too .
F	i informed them of the mis_- service i ' d received from royal_mail whom they used to send my item , so they refunded the postage !
F	brilliant service , lets me see what take_aways are available in my area , enabling me to have an excellent choice !
F	good quality items , very reasonably_priced , very fast delivery .
F	will use again !
F	thank - you sammie_taylor for all your help , it was an easy and smooth process thank - you
F	supplement_warehouse offers the most extensive line of products , has excellent customer_service , fast_shipping , and the price_match feature guarantees you ' ll get the lowest_price !
F	!
F	great deliverys , on time and hardly substitute my order .
F	arrived_promptly .
F	easy to follow_instructions ( i ordered some drawers ).
F	great product and price .
F	couldn ' t recommend these_guys more highly .
F	the call_centre girl was really lovely and helpful and asked the engineer to pick_up a carbon monoxide alarm for us specially to fit as part of the call out because i mentioned i was worried_about it .
F	i called british_gas as well and whilst they were Â£_00 cheaper_than aspect they would have taken a week to come out and wouldn ' t fix times .
F	aspect had an engineer out that day at exactly the time they said he ' d be there .
F	he was really friendly and efficient and left us totally happy that we weren ' t going to die in the night from carbon monoxide poisoning and that our boiler would last another wee while - all good !
F	we also used them to fix our toilet last_year and while the guy was here he fixed our toilet lid which had been doing my head in as well as the flushing issue .
F	couldn ' t recommend them more highly for a value for money , efficient and friendly service .
F	... so i ' m still not too sure how our old_mobiles are worth money these days and they never used to be but this is now the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile and they ' ve been brilliant .
F	i was a bit_sceptical about sending the phones first and even worried was it some sort of scam but as it was an old_mobile i would have binned anyway i thought i ' d nothing to lose so gave it a go .
F	the whole_process of me going on the website to them sending the bag to me posting it back ( all prepaid and just through a normal post box so no hassle there ) and the money hitting my account took less_than a week .
F	i ended_up sending my old blackberry too a few_months later and the service was just as quick and hassle_free .
F	they do what they say on the tin and couldn ' t make the process any easier given they do need to see the phones first to check they ' re as you say on the website .
F	they also send some emails to keep you updated on status which is helpful .
F	couldn ' t recommend them more if you ' ve any old_mobiles lying about doing nothing !
F	delivery was prompt .
F	price for sports bra was competitive .
F	good online shopping_experience .
F	asos is where i shop if i need an outfit or shoes or something quick !
F	i am a premier customer so pay about Â£_00 to get next_day delivery for a year and exclusive first looks at sales .
F	i can order 0pm at night and the clothing can be there at my desk the next afternoon .
F	they give you a delivery time_slot too so you know roughly when it ' s going to arrive .
F	good range of clothing , good prices .
F	only con is i spend too much time browsing the site - too much choice !
F	prices competitive when you buy in bulk , fast delivery time , never had any_problems .
F	very happy customer here :-)
F	it ' s one of my fav ........ site nt only me bt most of the people thats why definetly it have to get five_stars :) the clothes are so fashionable , cute n comfort and the price is decent lop it < 0 ..... yesstyle is doing awesome job
F	i had never used this service before and had to use the live_chat option .
F	the girl that helped_me ( sarah_hayes ) was very pleasant and quick in responding to my queries !
F	the first time to buy here .
F	great dr . martens , perfect_condition !
F	delivery took 00 days by royalmail .
F	it is very fast !
F	kind_regards ,
F	from russia
F	the lighthouse was spacious , comfy and the livingroom as stunning as the photographs .
F	beds were comfy and the location is great , there are cafes in every direction , which is perfect for breakfast .
F	only thing which could have been there and wasn ' t was some basics , tea / coffee / sugar / olive oil .
F	it meant we had to buy everything in and couldn ' t use it all in the couple of days stay .
F	all in all it ' s a great place .
F	third set of blinds i ' ve ordered - they ' re so quick it ' s amazing !
F	and great value .
F	i can not believe what i have just experienced .
F	absolute disgusting service .
F	i am almost 0 months pregnant , we received a delivery of some very heavy items .
F	i asked if driver could just pop the items inside for me as he was simply dumping them outside .
F	the driver proclaimed he is ' self - employed and has no obligation to bring the items inside for me '.
F	when i pointed_out that i was clearly not in a position to be lifting these items , his response was " yeah , i see your problem , but i don ' t have to take anything inside for you ''.
F	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it ' s not something i have to do ".
F	at which point he walked back to his_van and drove off .
F	leaving me on the doorstep with 0 heavy items and nobody to help me .
F	still in shock about it .
F	absolutely apalled .
F	shame i had to even give 0 star .
F	would have preferred none .
F	wow service !!
F	which is unheard of these days !!
F	no_probs whatsoever .
F	fast delivery and i did an exchange which was dealt_with efficiently .
F	i have had 0 pairs of glasses from glasses_direct and they are great value look good and are comfortable to wear :)
F	this is the 0nd set of these lights i have bought now !
F	they are great !
F	both_times the delivery has been prompt !
F	the customer_service is great and when i initially thought i may want to return my order ( before it had been delivered ) i rang the company to see what i could do and spoke to a lovely helpful woman who didnt sound resentful ( like most places i come_across ) that i may want to return the item and informed me that its actually free to return items !
F	which i think is a great service !
F	as i have been living in costa rica and am now moving around during semana santa , hostelbookers . com were great in showing was what available within my limited_budget .
F	it has been a great help at home , europe and the wider world .
F	great service and will_continue to use it !
F	thanks !
F	so despite the wheels that i needed had been_discontinued , the company informed me by email and gave me a good selection of other wheels with the same specification .
F	for someone like me who isn ' t knowledgable about wheels and tyres , they were incredibly_helpful and efficient !
F	tim deserves a bonus !!!
F	wonderful help !
F	very good , honest and patient thank_you very much .
F	you ' ve a great employee on your hand .
F	00 / 00 !!!!!
F	!
F	the item arrived a day after i ordered it , first thing in the morning .
F	really happy with the printer we bought and the quick and efficient service of printerland . co . uk , will_definitely_recommend the site to colleagues and friends .
F	hello_canvas adjusted my photo to include the top of a tree - just to make it perfect - for no extra_cost .
F	finished_product excellent quality and packaging sturdy and shipped quickly .
F	folding of canvas around frame very intricate and particular attention to detail .
F	if your print surrounds the frame - it gives a stunning 0d appearance .
F	fairly costly , but if purchased through one of their regular special_offers , well worth the money .
F	this is my second purchase and would definitely_recommend and am sure i will use them again in the future .
F	frames are sturdy and easy to attach wall fittings to .
F	ordene unas flores llegaron a tiempo sin ningÃºn problema totalmente recomendado
F	they were the first company i phoned for a quote .
F	after i spoke to jacob i didn ' t ring anyone_else .
F	he was so helpful .
F	they sent me a sample that i got the very next_day and they designed and suggested better options for our company air fresheners .
F	really great product and i will_definitely_recommend and use them again .
F	many_thanks ,
F	hoyles of todmorden
F	i ' ve used interparcel many_times and never had a problem .
F	i always use parcelforce as the courier and never had a problem there either .
F	the website is easy to navigate , and the customer_service when you do need to call them is very efficient and helpful .
F	i will use them everytime i need to send items bigger than what royal_mail allows .
F	easy to use & attractive site full of good advice & information .
F	great prices on all products - a lot cheaper_than buying from the vets !
F	fast & reliable delivery .
F	delivery with animed is so good that we have now taken_advantage of their scheduled order service so that we no_longer have to worry_about having to remember to re - order as the products will arrive straight to our door on the same day each month !
F	i was really worried that leaving it to the last_minute to buy v_festival tickets , i would end up getting ripped_off , but luckily i stumbled_across double0tickets and i have to say it really surprised me at how reasonable they were .
F	i now have 0 tickets for v_festival and paid a really good price for them .
F	i would definitely_recommend double0tickets to others and will_definitely be using them again myself !
F	!
F	ordered 0 lipsticks which arrived in no time !
F	two colours looked very similar in the bullet so i asked if i could exchange one for another .
F	fast response from the customer_service team , was allowed to keep all the lipsticks i already had and was sent out the chosen ' replacement ' shade free of charge !
F	excellent customer_service !
F	obviously i wouldn ' t expect this every time i wish to exchange something , but it was a very nice treat !
F	thanks very much , will_definitely be shopping here again and have recommended it to all my friends !
F	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .
F	full payment taken and email confirmation sent to me .

F	very very dissapoonted
F	i was really impressed with promo_parrot .
F	they responded promptly to my enquiry , provided excellent customer_service ( kept me well updated with lead times and transparent pricing ) and provided quality products which i was genuinely pleased with .
F	i would definitely buy from them again and happy to recommend them .
F	i wanted a mousemat with a picture of my husband and son on for a birthday_present for my husband and found this to be the cheapest place ( with delivery included ).

F	the price is low compare to the quality of the sofa . very big and nice .
F	it gave my living_room an instant modern look .
F	my family was surprise how much i paid for it .
F	on the high_street it ' s more_expensive .
F	my brother wants one this .
F	costomer service was satisfying because i order through the telephone .
F	thank_you furnisho for making me afford this lovely fabulous sofa on a cheaper rate .
F	love to shop there !

F	we thought we were getting a really good deal going with this company and my sister organised everything and we paid the money for the hen_night .
F	my sister then started having problems with the company saying that they couldn ' t get us all in the same hotel and that we would be at_least 00mins walk apart_from each other , they also said that the people staying in the hotel had to pay extra money .
F	my sister constantly tried to get hold of management at the company and was told that the two members in charge were not available and they would return her call .
F	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
F	she called them back at_least 0 - 0 times but the person she needed to speak to was apparently busy or in and out of meetings all the time .
F	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn ' t give her any money back .
F	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone_else the money back .
F	we were worried that something else would go_wrong on the actual day .
F	i would avoid this company at all costs the customer_service is shocking and all they are interested in is taking your money .
F	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
F	these goods were worth well over Â£_00 .
F	i was working on my laptop during the day which is next to the window which looks out of my the front of my house .
F	sure enough a yodel van came up and the man got out from the drivers seat and got into the back of the van and was in there for about 0mins .
F	the driver then got back in the drivers seat and drove off .
F	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail stating that they had delivered my parcel which they clearly hadn ' t because i had seen them drive off with no attempt at delivering the package .
F	it ' s now been over 0 week and yodel are still apparently investigating at to where my parcel is .
F	this isn ' t the first time this has happened and it ' s very frustrating to say the least .
F	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
F	i purchased the gel nails course along with the maintenance course and couldn ' t wait for it to arrive .
F	i was pleased when i received the courses the following_day .
F	shopping on the website was easy and delivery was really reliable with very detailed tracking_information so i could track my parcel ' s every_step of the way .
F	i ordered a water bottle from the usn website and was impressed at how speedy the delivery was . i was considering purchasing some of the usn powders from here , how - ever i have found them much cheaper at other_places , which is a shame as if the prices were lowered i would also the powders from here as well due to the reliable and speedy_delivery .
F	i found that out of all the mobile recyle companies that mazuma have the edge over them and are very reasonable prices given and that they accept mobiles that are not working and they are helpful , they keep to their promise and process the phones and money on the same day i ' ll definately recomend mazuma to my family and friends
F	all through the process of my order , after my order arrived and still to this day i have had great communication from them .
F	my order was delivered very quickly and i couldn ' t have been happier .
F	the branded jewellery all came as shown in there original_packaging .
F	the price was affordable and worth it .
F	i highly_recommend this company .
F	i loved the jewellery so much i kept 0 of everything for myself !!!
F	i will be dealing_with them again in the future .
F	very easy process , acknowledged phone when received and very quick payment by bacs .
F	great service !
F	i have recently dealt_with hen_heaven and can safely_say that they have some of the most helpful people i have encountered in quite some time !
F	i have specifically been dealing_with owen and he has been so incredibly_helpful , any question i put forwards to him would not only get answered fully with extra information but he would get back to me in at_least 00mins ... fantastic !
F	i would recommend this company to anyone who is looking to organise a hen_do and wants it to be a stress_free experience .
F	brilliant service that cannot be_faulted !
F	really easy website to navigate .
F	great prices .
F	exceptional service .
F	i was very lucky at christmas to receive one of these blocks .
F	absolutely beautiful .
F	the personalisation of the block is really unique , and makes it even more special .
F	cannot recommend this company and its products enough .
F	outstanding .
F	fantastic gift idea .
F	really beautiful packaging .
F	the website was incredibly simple , i had to ask a question about the picture as i wasn ' t sure if it was the standard bunch .
F	i got an answer almost_immediately saying it was , as beautiful as they where i upgraded and my mum was absolutely over the moon with the flowers .
F	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i will be using them again in the future .
F	thank_you
F	i love the kindle and cant_wait for the new version !!!
F	!
F	download of books is fast and easy .
F	i have been using isme for around a year .
F	i have never had a problem and the delivery is fab !
F	would definitely_recommend the company to all who are thinking about buying from them .
F	so quick and easy this is the 0th time i ' ve used mazuma would reccomend to everyone !
F	thank_you , your customer_service was without fault .
F	i recently sold my mobile phone through mazuma , i got a quote off the website , confirmed that i was happy with what they offered me and within next few_days i received the free post bag and delivery note to send my mobile phone to them in .
F	then within the next couple of days the cheque was delivered back to me .
F	very easy , convenient and reliable .
F	excellent communication through whole_process via_email .
F	000_% satisfied and would recommend everyone to use it if they are wanting to sell their mobile phone at a good price .
F	i ' ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
F	i tried to purchase an iphone on line from them coming from their store in derby .
F	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
F	i called the store and they politely apologised and said if i sent the phone back they ' d refund me .
F	a week_later another phone arrived .
F	this one was faulty as the speakers didn ' t work .
F	i called them to explain the fault and they told me to send the phone back .
F	which i did and called to check they ' d received it and make_sure they knew what the fault was .
F	the next_day i called to find out what they were going to do about it and they informed me they ' d tested the phone , it was fine and they had posted it back to me .
F	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
F	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn ' t told what the fault was so didn ' t test the sound .
F	he then informed me that they could pay for it to be fixed but could not refund me since it had been more_than two_weeks since my first transaction and i was not within my rights to receive a refund anymore .
F	i don ' t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
F	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0 weeks and they still_haven ' t produced the item i have now more_than paid for ?
F	don ' t ever purchase anything from this shop and expect them to get it right first time , if at all .
F	having been quoted an exorbitant price by our usual_supplier for an imaging drum and a yellow toner , i decided to shop around to find the items cheaper elsewhere .
F	printerland . co . uk not only charged us less_than half the price of our usual_supplier , but the delivery service was extremely fast and the products arrived in great condition .
F	i will be using printerland . co . uk for future printer consumables orders .
F	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0 weeks of constant emails to get refunded and that wasn ' t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that ' s it .......
F	they don ' t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
F	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
F	even_though i am covered i bet again i don ' t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
F	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
F	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium gas cylinder ran out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn ' t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
F	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
F	the large foil number ballons were excellent .
F	don ' t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer_service .
F	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
F	it took me 0 weeks and 0 emails to the ceo to get my money back .
F	they also tried to charge me 00_% for cancelling but i had mithered them for written confirmation of my cancellation so they didn ' t have a leg to stand on .
F	that ' s another point - you deal with the customer_services on the phone but they don ' t send confirmation emails so it ' s your word_against theirs .
F	a very dangerous game when Â£ 000s are at stake .
F	each time i had to email the conversation to them via their website form so that i could get written confirmation .
F	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn ' t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it ' s arrival .
F	if their customer_service is this bad , i don ' t even want to imagine the final product !
F	i initially ordered a sofa from laura_ashley .
F	after_placing my order in store , i did some research and saw a plethora of awful reviews .
F	the vast_amount of negative_reviews concerned me so i cancelled my order .
F	this was a lot harder than it should have been and i didn ' t receive a refund until four weeks and three emails to the ceo later .
F	this negative experience led me to do a lot of research into my sofa purchase .
F	i ordered fabric and leather swatches from three companies .
F	saxon ' s arrived the next_day !
F	saxon had the best reviews i have ever_seen and with their showroom a few miles_away , i decided to pop in and see what the fuss was about .
F	i was not disappointed .
F	their sofas are even more beautiful in person and their customer_service is incredible .
F	on our first visit we must have taken 00_minutes and asked 000 questions .
F	adele was incredibly_helpful and knew the answer to every one .
F	we left with a sofa in mind and had booked in a home visit to make_sure we had enough room .
F	saxon offers an amazing service where they send one of their delivery men to your properly to make_sure the desired sofa will fit through doors etc .
F	it costs the same as the delivery fee and will be taken off your total if you do buy a sofa .
F	we were told we had enough room so we could go_ahead an order the sofa .
F	coincidentally i checked their website again and saw that they had my sofa and an armchair in their clearance section at a nicely reduced rate .
F	adele called us to see if we wanted to buy a sofa and i explained that i had seen the clearance sofa but would like to see larger pictures .
F	within minutes she had emailed me a link to their facebook_page where i could scroll to my heart ' s content .
F	the next_day we popped_into store and she even let us see the sofa in the factory .
F	obviously this was only the case as it was a clearance sofa and they had it in storage , but it was wonderful to see it before we bought it .
F	we ordered it expecting a 0 week wait .
F	however , as we are local , the delivery men were able to squeeze us in .
F	we had the sofa and armchair by the end of the week !
F	we couldn ' t be_happier .
F	if you are looking for a new sofa , look no further .
F	very quick to respond when i changed my order ; kept me informed_throughout and had replacement within a few_days .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	price seemed to be the best around too
F	nikki was extremely_helpful , very well - informed and charming .
F	the showrooms were exceptionally well set out and we had ample space to view , try out and relax .
F	the only slight quibble was that we had to pay for delivery , as we had chosen a sofa which had been reduced due to a change of mind on the part of the buyer ; it was still quite expensive and i resent paying for delivery when a much cheaper sofa ( at half the price ) would have been delivered free !
F	also , we were told we might have to pay storage charges , as we cannot pick_up the sofa for several weeks !
F	this has not , thankfully transpired .
F	we will be going back to order another sofa , but have decided to wait_until we have exchanged contracts on the sale of our home so we don ' t risk any more charges
F	too early to say how long it will last but looks are excellent and size is generous
F	excellent service from the start .
F	even the delivery dirver was pleasant and helpful ; would alwasy use your firm again .
F	many_thanks
F	if you ' re headed to prague for your last_minute jaunt of freedom before your big commitment then i can highly_recommend these_guys to give you best seeing off that you could possibly experience .
F	so good we ' re heading back just for the fun of it !
F	we found flashbay to be a highly professional and reliable company .
F	the service was fast , the product was high_quality and our account_manager ( jack walton ) was extremely_helpful and knowledgeable .
F	monsoon accessorize will_definitely be placing an order with flashbay next season .
F	the envelope to send off my phone arrived really quickly .
F	got email confirmation after a day or 0 tht my phone had passed the tests and they gave me a date of about 0 working_days that the money would be in my account .
F	money was there in the day they said .
F	would definitely use this company again .
F	flawless
F	having worked for a company for over 0 years who use citylink and send many parcels through them daily - i have never had so many incidents causing so much stress and problems from one company .
F	here are but 0 of those incidents that have happened in the past 00_hours :
F	0 .
F	my customer calls me to say the goods havent arrived ( despite us doing our job and the courier failing to deliver - obviously the customer will balme us as we are their contact ).
F	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
F	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct address .
F	i ask what the new address is which he tells_me and it is exactly the same as the original address .
F	after i ask to know why this package has been delayed when the " new " address has no changes from the original , i was greeted with a lot of stuttering and dithering before being put on hold for 00_minutes for him to " investigate ".
F	he then had no new information to give me so i expect he probably went for a cup of tea and found out nothing .
F	the package was finally delivered to the " new address " 0 days late and missed the customers event the goods were needed for so rendered useless so a refund was made from our company .
F	0 .
F	a top priority client needed goods for another event - he calls to say they havent arrived .
F	i call citylink and the person i speak to says they were sent to the wrong depot ( for no apparent_reason other than stupidity ).
F	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered useless ).
F	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
F	she said she would find out and call me back .
F	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us Â£_000 . 00 !!!!!
F	so i said , so let me get this straight , we have paid to have these good delivered this morning , someone at your moronic operation has sent them to the wrong depot meaning the parcel is late and you ' re saying we need to pay for this ???
F	yes she says .
F	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
F	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct address .
F	this is absolutely not possible as we are a huge manufacturing company distributing hundreds of parcels daily so to have someone check this manually would take hours of time which we cannot_afford to have someone doing .
F	i have been imploring to my superiors to stop using citylink and am hoping that finally we will be looking to use an_alternative courier .
F	you would think that with the amount of money we spend with them , we would be treated as a priority and they would do their best to keep us however when i expressed my dissatisfaction and the fact we will be looking to leave , the response i got from the manager there was " ok ".
F	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !
F	!
F	do not use this company - chocolate teapot - useless !!!
F	!
F	my friend recommend this site for the prices , free_samples , and selection .
F	i ' ve only made one order so far but i will for sure be a future customer .
F	great products and prices !
F	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
F	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
F	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
F	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
F	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
F	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
F	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
F	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
F	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
F	the other inconvenience is the Â£_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing around to sort this on valentines morning .
F	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
F	compared to other_websites that i viewed , including my go - to amazon , supplement_warehouse had the best selection and lowest_prices , including shipping , for the cliff shot gels ( 00 pack ).
F	i would definitely shop on this website again .
F	i am not joking ... mazuma_mobile saved me big time ...
F	when i thought all hope was gone and i was really upset because i couldn ' t do anything with my mobile ... mazuma_mobile accepted it and gave me a brilliant price for it !!
F	i was seriously over the moon !!
F	i can ' t thank mazuma_mobile enough ...
F	thank_you !!>..
F	0 -)
F	the card team is my favourite website for buying pokÃ©mon cards .
F	they have great customer_service and their website just keeps getting bigger and better with new things to buy .
F	would highly_recommend !
F	x
F	no_problems happy with the service i received
F	best price and service !
F	easy to navigate and provides relevant_information .
F	a smooth_transaction from order to delivery .
F	great product too , fab !
F	easy and fast service to use .
F	i ordered a bag for my clothes online , it arrived 0 days_later .
F	i filled the bag and arranged a pick_up date .
F	the courier came as promised and i had the money in my paypal account the very next_day !
F	can ' t get much_better_than that , cash for clothes i didn ' t want .
F	i love the selection of bags and purses on this site some of the other departments aren ' t as good particularly the home section .
F	i ordered a travel wallet which arrived quickly .
F	i ' ve ordered twice from here and never had any problem .
F	another company let me down and i finally gave up on them after waiting for 0 weeks .
F	one call to kac and i had my tap within 00_hours , delivered in a one hour delivery slot and i saved over Â£_000 !!!
F	would definately_recommend them
F	i bought an item as a christmas_gift for my partner .
F	unfortunately the item was not suitable , superfi refused refund even after many emails and emailing manager .
F	offered an exchange as a gesture of good will !!
F	!
F	appalling customer_service , to get a refund you need to return within 0 days of order ... and so they obviously dont care about the christmas market .
F	still have Â£_000 worth of audio_equipment unopened in its box which is completely_useless and worthless thanks to superfi .
F	incdently , superfi were still selling the item at full price and so wouldnt have made any loss by refunding me .... as i said appalling customer_service ... i will be taking my custom striaght back to amazon who are top_notch company !
F	before we went to iceland , i booked this online , it was so easy .
F	the rates were fantastic .
F	we were picked_up from our hotel and taken to the office to collect the car .
F	it was a toyota i go , as promised .
F	the staff helped_us with a route back to the hotel .
F	maps and instructions came with the car .
F	the overall condition was excellent .
F	we were late leaving for our flight , they even collected the car from our hotel .
F	we recommend you use this company as they are excellent
F	i wowchered 0 bracelets rrp Â£_000 . 00 @ Â£_00 each .
F	at checkout i paid Â£ 0 . 00 pp each .
F	only 0 arrived .
F	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
F	i contacted_wowcher who over 0 weeks have sent in excess of 0 emails .
F	all ignored !!!!!
F	wowcher have only a mobile number for fasgion revenge which is never answered .
F	wowcher have returned the Â£_00 and the Â£ 0 . 00 pp which fashion revenge has kept !
F	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .
F	what if i had paid full price !!
F	rubbish goods .
F	rubbish company !
F	steer_well clear .
F	very professional and friendly service .
F	highly_recommended !
F	love shopping here
F	chose the costume i wanted .

F	placed my order before 0pm had it by 00am next morning .
F	fantastic .
F	does what it says on the tin .
F	what more can i say .
F	amazon know customer_service .
F	i have used them on multiple_occasions and they have never failed me .
F	:)
F	i was clearing out a room after a relative died , and boxed up his dvd ' s .
F	we used two companies .
F	the first [_link ] and the second music_magpie .
F	we sent 00 dvd ' s to music_magpie by courier , and 000 to [_link ] ( as they offered more money ).
F	the boxes were both collected / posted on the wednesday .
F	the wednesday after i had received payment from [_link ].
F	yet music_magpie were denying receipt of their parcel even_though we had a courier collection leaflet .
F	i rang up on the thursday and was told the parcel had arrived at the depot today .
F	i asked why it took so long - he said its not a priority .
F	nice !!!
F	he said that i should get an_email_saying that it had been received that day .
F	i received the email two days_later then expected after 0 more phone_calls .
F	waste of time .
F	i still am yet to receive confirmation or email / cheque from them .
F	poor poor service .
F	i suggest you use sell to [_link ], if you want your dvd ' s to be a ' priority '.
F	i cant_believe it has taken 0 weeks longer then the other company to check not even a third of the total the other company checked .
F	what an amazin company !!
F	great value , super_fast delivery n really great quality products !!!
F	will_defo use tshirt_studio again n recommend it 0 friends n family !!!

F	i came_across this website by searching online for what i thought was a relatively obscure beauty product and they had it !
F	sometimes uk women need to look further afield especially when they read international beauty blogs and watch videos from youtube reviewing certain products which are not so easy to get over here .
F	i would recommend this website and would definitely shop here again .
F	i ordered a clarifying shampoo and a dermalogica moisturiser and i loved the selection and the free shipping .
F	i would definitely shop there again when i need to make more beauty purchases .
F	i found plumbtap via their ebay store and purchased some groher tap and shower items .
F	communication from the company was fantastic and they helped_me with a complicated vat issue .
F	incredibly_helpful and always quick to answer questions .
F	delivery was within 00_hours and the items look great .
F	if definitely use them again and highly_recommend them to anyone .
F	i placed my order and the joules jumper arrived the next working day .
F	excellent service , the best price around , great all_round , i ' m really pleased .
F	thank_you !
F	i used moneysupermarket . com to compare the prices of a sebo x0 extra vacuum and it said that freenet ltd was the cheapest place around .
F	i had never_heard of them so i was a little_wary and put the purchase on my credit_card rather_than debit_card just in case !
F	i have been incredibly impressed by the company , i received my sebo within 00_hours of placing the order and the local courrier company were really helpful as well .
F	i received not only an invoice but once the item had been collected from freenet ltd i received a courrier tracking_number which was updated frequently .
F	the sebo is exactly as_described , no_problems whatsoever and i ' m a very happy customer .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend or use them again in the future .
F	i cannot speak highly_enough of my online_estate_agent .
F	i had a few teething_problems to begin with , as would be expected with a relatively new business .
F	within hours of reporting the problems ( photos not too great ) i had a personal phone call from one of the managing directors ( which shows how dedicated they are even at the very top !)
F	and the problems were sorted instantly .
F	my property sold within a few_months for only Â£ 0000 under asking price .
F	maybe a high_street agent could have negotiated a bit more , but with their extortionate fees i would have been Â£ 0000 out of pocket rather_than Â£ 0000 so i ' m still Â£ 0000 better off !
F	the staff are so friendly and are always at the end of the phone .
F	i found them to be a lot more contactable than the several high_street agents i have used in the past .
F	my solicitor ended_up being completely inept and had it not been for the advice and support from the team at my online_estate_agent , i would have gone crazy !
F	they helped every_step of the way , right up to moving day !
F	i honestly cannot speak highly_enough of them !
F	i ' m hoping to stay in my new house for a long while now , but if i ever did decide to move again , i would use my online_estate_agent without any hesitation !
F	ordered a few products for myself and received them at value cost and fast delivery
F	e_careers provide excellent support from beginning throughout and has supported me with a problem already .
F	honest value and good communication
F	everything0pounds is a company use again to buy cheap fashion wear .
F	ideal for those who can ' t pay designer costs on the high_street .
F	highly_recommend !
F	insurance_cover meets my needs
F	low_cost makes it affordable giving you the option of annual payment or monthly_payments .
F	i thought this website was really easy to navigate .
F	it was easy to find hostels in the area i wanted .
F	being_able to read the reviews was extremely_helpful .
F	i also liked that you could look at the hostels on a map so you knew how close they were to the city_centre .
F	overall i was very impressed !
F	!
F	one of the lowest_prices i found that stocked my product .
F	plenty of communication via_email and text_message .
F	fast delivery .
F	only problem i have is that the website is too ' busy ' and not really user_friendly , which made me question how trustworthy the site was .
F	but it ' s all been legit for me .
F	:)
F	best price for burton luggage , fantastic delivery and service .

F	fast_shipping and friendly service .
F	thanks btt !
F	fast delivery which is always good and very high standards within products .
F	contact information in case of any_issues and regular_emails to update you on your parcel is something not all websites give .
F	would defiantly use again and recommend .
F	the chat box is a really good idea as the service is quick and easy , my problem was fixed within a matter of minutes .
F	thanks for your help !
F	i really cannot_praise feelgood lenses for their reliable and quick service , standard delivery to ireland was really quick and i can not fault it ...
F	the title pretty_much sums it up !
F	either you devote your entire day to sifting through the piles of poorly sorted clothes in the shop or you dont !
F	wish there was an easy option .
F	online would be perfect !
F	i love ebay i buy & sell items on there .
F	granted sometimes delivery times are annoying but as a seller also i understand the constraints of day to day life .
F	otherwise ebay have been brilliant but make_sure to check feedback of buyers and sellers alike , and always read the small printed bits !
F	i feel the need to point out this company is in league with marisota , if you search for their reviews it will tell you alot of what to expect !
F	if i were you i ' d steer_well clear , and if your tempted in for gods sake make_sure you keep note of who you speak to and when it can help when it comes to writing a complaint to their md !
F	i ordered a pair of boots for Â£_00 .
F	they didnt turn_up next_day despite me paying in full on my debit_card and being assured they would , then marisota sent me out a replacement pair and didnt charge me for them until they could find the other parcel .
F	the replacement pair turned_up at the wrong_address !
F	this over the space of 0 weeks having given up i didnt bother trying the boots and instantly returned them .
F	in the midst of this there were lots of phone_calls , emails & live_chat conversations held .
F	eventually wrote a long and rather strongly worded letter to their md mark cheshire , they gave me 00_%_off ( ha not using that !)
F	and a written apology which has still not been recieved !
F	eventually got a refund after them having my Â£_00 for 0 weeks !
F	appalling !
F	i always book with hostelbookers .
F	it ' s a very good company .
F	initially i contacted a few companies about branded usb memory_cards in boxes , and usb0u . co . uk were the most helpful and also spoke to me on a personal level instead of the auto generated / template emails that i received from other_companies .
F	the design progress through to delivery of the finished_product was very smooth and i will_definitely be ordering another batch when i run out .
F	highly_recommended !
F	very pleased with better bathrooms - this is now my 0rd purchase and happy with customer_service , and also the correspondance from delivery driver .
F	i use cewe photobooks for wedding albums for clients - i have been very happy with the quality and turn_around .
F	however , the most_popular cover option is the ivory linen and i would like to be able to offer photopaper as an option - unfortunately if they don ' t start offering more options ( photo paper and glossy paper for the faux_leather and linen covers ) then i will have to look for another supplier .
F	otherwise , they are have good customer care etc
F	as soon as i paid for the key it was ready to be used for the game thanks and will use your service again a ++++ :)
F	fab products fab quality fab prices fab delivery !
F	recommend this company
F	great products , great price , quick delivery great ideas .... highly_recommend .
F	thanx
F	found this website by chance when looking for my dogs diabetic food after being charged a crazy high price by my vets after they diagnosed him with diabetes .
F	i love this website / company .
F	great value !
F	great quality !
F	great customer_service !
F	and ever ending expanding variety of products .
F	i always order his food , toothpaste and adaptil from you .
F	delivery is always quick and the text_message_telling you when the delivery is coming is a brilliant idea .
F	thank_you petmeds your the best online seller and i would and have already recommend you to friends , family and collegues !
F	!
F	do not order from them !!!
F	i have no_idea how the hell they have even one good review and now i suspect they are actually doing fake buys them selves to be able to create what looks_like real buyer reviews .
F	they take your money and i waited to 0 to 00 working_days for my item .
F	it is now 00 working_days and no item , have emailed them 0 times and no response what - so - ever !!
F	!
F	i have told them now i want a full_refund and my order cancelled !
F	but like everything else this has been totally ignored .
F	i am now having to put in a claim through paypal and by the time i get my money back it will be about 0 weeks since placing the order and no sunlgasses !
F	!
F	the total_lack of customer_service says to me that if anyone does get their sunglasses from them double and triple check them because i would definetley guess at them being fakes !
F	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
F	need i say more ??
F	?
F	if ' smartbuysunglasses ' ( thats a joke in itself ) is a real company and reads this refund me my money and cancel my order nowwwwwww !!!!!
F	!
F	good value , easy to order , on - time delivery and the chilled box with re - usable ice - packs is just excellent for keeping the products cold until i get home from work .
F	will_definitely be using again once i ' ve got through this order !
F	i ' ve bought from deramores on a few occasions now and i ' ve been able to find what i wanted at a good price and received my order quickly .
F	all my goods have been good quality and i ' ve no_complaints - even when i ordered a pattern leaflet this arrived in perfect_condition .
F	i would recommend deramores to everyone .
F	i love their emails too with the deals on selected wools , inspirational pictures ( which led me to purchase a pattern book ) and the free pattern downloads .
F	i ' ve nothing negative to say - a great company !
F	i always use the same old_fashioned perfume which is not always easy to find & it ' s really expensive even in duty - free .
F	i can ' t remember how i came_across cheap_smells but i ' ve always been able to get a bottle at a really good price and it ' s delivered within a couple of days usually .
F	i would highly_recommend this website - this time i bought sun lotion as well .
F	simply acer had the model i wanted at the best price .
F	i ordered it , choosing the cheapest delivery method and it arrived within a couple of days .
F	would not hesitate to highly_recommend this company .
F	i have used this site many_times and had no prob at all would recommend if ur looking for somthing deferent at a good price too 0 * from me
F	fab service got everything i was looking for in just one click , i will_defo uses jacinabox agan and my 0 year_old_son was so happy for his 0th birthday thanks
F	i had been mislead on wowcher , i ordered some hair extentions under the impression that is what i was ordering , only to find out after i had paid Â£_00 , i had only brought the ' wowcher '.
F	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .
F	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
F	phoned up for a quote on multi city flights to america next june and was put through to rosanna byers !
F	i was sick of looking on the internet and going round in circles !
F	after asking what i was looking for , she asked if i would like hotels as well .... something that i did not even think about !
F	i gave her all the information on what i wanted , where i wanted to stay and for how long .... within 0 hours rosanna emailed me an amazing holiday and within 0 hours i booked !
F	rosanna went above and beyond , very friendly and within 0 weeks i have booked and paid for my holiday , has all confirmations back and receipt .
F	will_definitely be contacting rosanna again .
F	i cannot thank her enough for all her hard efforts ... she is a credit to the company !
F	brilliant service and very quick delivery , can ' t fault them 0_stars .
F	ordered some products on the friday - delivered on saturday ( next_day ).
F	very efficient .
F	no extra price paid for fast delivery .
F	ordered the new tunnels for my hamster cage over the easter bank_holiday .
F	i was very surprised to receive it very promptly after the bank_holiday .
F	all correct parts in excellent condition .
F	very prompt delivery and service ( received emails about updates of my order ).
F	will_definitely be using this company again .
F	you rock !
F	i wouldn ' t buy from anywhere_else online .
F	great experience though i was a little baffled that they charged me Â£ 0 for the short stay parking at luton .
F	surely they need to factor this into the original booking price , clearly mention when booking or pick_up where there isnt a charge .
F	this website is amazing , really good value and all styles in line with current fashions .
F	i will_continue to shop here .
F	easy to book and we were kept well informed prior to traveling .
F	all required details for our stay were provided .
F	we would use this company to book again :-)
F	they will take your money , tell you the product is out of stock , then fail to deliver a refund despite numerous_calls and emails .
F	tomorrow i ' m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
F	i have used mazuma a couple of times now , with no_problems and always prompt payment .
F	i would definitely use them again .
F	i ' m planning my trip and the hostelbookers is being a wonderful help !
F	it ' s easy and quick to use !
F	love energy savings helped_us get a great deal on our energy and the process couldn ' t have been simpler .
F	their helpful representative was friendly , knowledgeable and incredibly_helpful .
F	would definitely_recommend them to anybody looking for a great deal on their energy tariffs .
F	after_reading some of the reviews for the website , i was a bit_wary about ordering a perfume from there .
F	they said that the quality of the products were reflected in the price i . e .
F	they were poor quality and did not smell like the perfume they claimed to be .
F	fortunately , there were more positive_reviews than negative so i took a gamble and placed my order .
F	i didn ' t need to contact customer_services but i was very pleased with how quickly they dispatched my order and how fast it was delivered .
F	in my case , the delivery arrived on the third day after dispatch , which was actually a day earlier_than they had stated .
F	when the package arrived , it was very well_packed and the perfume box was new and unopened .
F	i have bought this perfume before ( offline ) and this one smelled exactly how i remembered and expected it to .
F	overall , i am very pleased with my experience with this website .
F	searching for products was easy and placing an order was quick and simple .
F	i would definitely_recommend using this website .
F	the prices are a bargain but there are no strings attached !
F	p_& p for standard delivery is also included in the price - result !
F	the site gave us lots of options and made it easy to find the best place for the best price .
F	i love my australian gold moisture lock moisturizer so when it runs out its a sad day , i always try to look around to find the best price so i can save a few pennies .
F	by_far its the cheapest at fragrance_direct which is why i ' ve brought it from here before and will_continue to buy it from here until they no_longer stock it !
F	it comes pretty soon after you ' ve ordered it which is always a plus so if i ' m at the end of a bottle without realizing and it ' s my last bottle ( i always buy 0 at a time ) i can order it and know i ' ll have it within a few_days even with buying the standard delivery .
F	couldn ' t ask for more as its quick , easy and a brilliant price !
F	i find the website as a great source of wholesale closeout and clearance deals .
F	easy to contact sellers , no strings attached just like other_websites .
F	very helpful customer_service .
F	arrived soon after i sent my phone website was easy to follow overall was an easy way to get_rid of my old phone !
F	!
F	ordered a speaker for a vivaz was totaly the wrong one

F	rachael
F	such a good sight , perfect print .. just how i designed , thrilled .
F	i recently_purchased day and evening invitations , i ordered them on a monday and received them on thursday .
F	very happy with the service and outstanding quality , will be recommending you too all my friends .
F	you have made a bride to be very very happy .
F	thank_you so much
F	after weeks of searching the internet , reading reviews and deliberating , i ordered the tv corner unit , lamp table and book case from the rustic range and 0 days_later they were standing proud in my living_room .
F	i cannot_fault the customer_service i received from oak_furniture land .
F	as soon as i ordered online i received email confirmation of my order and could keep_track of its progress on the website .
F	i received a phone call about 0 hour after ordering to arrange delivery on a day of my choice .
F	i have been kept up to date on the delivery by text and email and was even given a 0 hour time_slot .
F	the delivery guys were fantastic !
F	i received a phonecall on the day to say when they would arrive , once here they asked what room the furniture was to be placed and gave me a card with a phone number to contact if there were any_issues .
F	there are none .
F	all items arrived very well_packed , the furniture is beautiful and the buying experience hassle_free .
F	so thank_you to oak_furniture land , i will be buying more very soon .
F	so happy that i found strongvpn because prior to , i had tried 0 other_companies and was online with customer_service more_than i was online watching shows and movies .
F	i ' ve only had to contact strongvpn customer_service once , due to me uninstalling accidently and the chat rep had me back online in 0 minute !!
F	now that ' s quality customer care !!
F	i ' m so happy that with strongvpn , i am now able to enjoy all my us shows while stationed in japan !
F	i ordered a book for christmas but it has never been delivered .
F	i complained and amazon immediately refunded me back .
F	i had to go and buy another present but i appreciate the speed of their response !
F	i ordered some flowers for international delivery for some special occasions and the service and flower quality were excellent - my mum and friends were so surprised to receive such a big bouquet of flowers !
F	i bought a parfume for my boyfriend for christmas and i was really pleased : saved a few pounds and the delivery was really quick .
F	i would recommend it !
F	i have been with orange for 0 years and they have provided an excellant service throughout .
F	much_better that any other service i have used .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	the item i ordered arrived quickly as usual .
F	also the service has continued to be excellant every time i use it .
F	would highly_reccomend this site .
F	all fine - packaging just way too big for small item ; paypal option would be nice
F	this is very annoying .
F	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
F	i ordered a pair of glasses , my account was debited and only because i randomly checked the order status , i saw that the glasses i ordered are not in stock and that it can take an indefinite time ' more_than a month ' to get them delivered .
F	i find this quite impertinent as this company didn ' t even bother to notify me that the glasses are undeliverable !
F	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
F	as i need these glasses urgently , i would actually expect some kind of indemnification as i have to place an order somewhere_else to get glasses and who_knows when i ' ll get anything from this company .
F	really friendly helpful staff .
F	i would recommend to anyone needing a loan for whatever_reason .
F	we love this site .
F	we have some really happy , spoilt bunnies thanks to the excellent products sold by this company .
F	the price & quality of the goods sold is amazing .
F	we would highly_recommend to all of our friends .
F	0 * all the way .
F	debbie & lianne
F	i was looking for a reasonably_priced rash vest and i found it straight_away !
F	not only this , there was great choice .
F	i will_definitely buy from surf dome again !
F	the most_important ingredient to my night out is skiddle .
F	tickets delivered on time everytime .
F	i ' d never considered using a cashback site before i joined quidco - i didn ' t believe that you could get money for nothing and thought there must some catch .
F	but three years later i have earned over Â£_000 in cashback and have just over Â£_000 to come .
F	i only buy from the most competitive sites and the cash back is a nice treat .
F	quidco and their customer_service have been excellent .
F	i ' m a premium customer and recently my sky cash back was taking a long time to be confirmed - i contacted customer support and they authorised my money immediately - all Â£_000 of it .
F	as a premium customer (Â£ 0 a year ), i can request a phone call or have an online_chat with an advisor .
F	i also qualify for faster paying cashback .
F	there are a couple of drawbacks - sometimes it takes upwards of six_months for cashback to be paid especially with time sensitive things such as insurance - but the timescales for payment are clearly_laid_out on the site .
F	occasionally , cashback does not track or it takes a long time to be paid but if you contact quidco they try to get it sorted out asap .
F	i always check quidco when i ' m intending to make an online purchase and although it isn ' t exactly money for nothing there is no catch .
F	used this site to book our 0 week inter - rail trip in summer 0000 , was so good and the hostels were sooooo great i used it for my trip to perth !!
F	!
F	i have been using this website since 0000 and have never been disappointed with their service .
F	their reservation system is trustworthy and quick .
F	they have no booking_fees like other_websites .
F	their prices for accomodation are usually cheaper_than hostelworld as well .
F	i received the bag for my phone the next_day after e_- mailing and received notiifcation of mazuma getting the phone the following_day and got the cheque a few_days letter - amazingly quick service and really easy to use - was impressed and would use mazuma again !
F	would definitely_recommend and will be using again .
F	as documented in various forums ( just google ' homefiresides '), this company is completely fraudulent !!
F	you will not receive your goods as the company went into liquidation months_ago .
F	company also known as firesgalore .
F	avoid !
F	i found this out the hard way after paying them Â£_000 .
F	this was my first time booking with double0tickets and wont be my last . i found the customer_service staff very useful and friendly , was very easy and quick to book with . i got a great deal for my tickets and a first_class service .
F	i would recommend double0tickets .
F	thank_you x
F	thanks my engagement_ring is perfect !!
F	would never have got what i wanted for this price on the high_street !
F	the order process was easy and i was kept_updated all the way !
F	thank_you !
F	booked sun transfers before my trip to amsterdam , picked_up and dropped_off on time .
F	great service , would highly_recommend
F	i have been in business for 0 years , i was selling high end cosmetics and skincare .
F	when i first started out i purchased a few memberships to wholesale sites and so on , i only found a couple of useful sources between all of them .
F	i have now switched to wedding products and have found several useful sources on this site just in my first visit .
F	i think the service is very good , they have a very large number of viable suppliers , it was definitely worth the membership fee and i would definitely_recommend it to others !
F	received a damaged parcel .
F	when contacted , they said they ' ll get back to me in 0 business days .
F	been more_than a week , nothing !
F	contacted them .
F	customer_service didnt sound professional enough .
F	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
F	recently used this site .
F	great service and very genuine .
F	i recently ordered a new bed from land of beds and was so pleased with their level of service .
F	the ordering_process was seamless , and their customer support and delivery service was excellent .
F	we also found them to be the lowest_price online .
F	00 / 00 from us , cannot recommend them enough .
F	best night ' s sleep we ' ve had in years !
F	was unsure at first as the branding makes it look like a scam .
F	e . g .
F	send us your gold and we ' ll send you a cheque .
F	yeah , sure .
F	the opposite was true , very impressed .
F	i think they should publicise what they ' re doing with the phones to be able to pay so well ?
F	was really pleased with my purchase from this website and the delivery was quick too .
F	will_definately be ordering from them again :)
F	so 0 of us have just come back from a long weekend in marbella for our friends hen_weekend and it was the best weekend ever !!
F	we laughed the whole weekend !!
F	we used hen_heaven to help us out and they were brilliant !
F	they sorted out our hotel which was in the perfect location of san pedro right next to a supermarket , taxi rank and lovely bars and restaurants , they arranged our transfers and a spa day which was simply perfect !!
F	they were super helpful with any_queries i had , the whole_process was simple and stress_free !
F	marbella is beautiful we spent the whole weekend feeling like vips and because we went out of season we pretty_much drank for free all night !
F	puerto banus is amazing !
F	the bars are great and the people are lovely !
F	cannot_fault a single thing and will be going back there as a weekend was just not long enough !
F	thank_you hen_heaven for making it such a momentous weekend !!
F	one we will ever forget !
F	my dress is what i believed it should look like .
F	it made me feel great and sexy .
F	i have worn it to a wedding and a cocktail party and it worked well in both events .
F	i will be back to buy more and have shown your wed site to many others encluding brides and mother of the brides .
F	thanks shopindream for your quality , reliability .
F	my order arrived fast , it was well_packaged , will buy from viovet again
F	great prices , fast delivery from again
F	next_day delivery , great product , gave as presents , and everyone that got the product loved it so much , def would buy from again and again
F	if you want to work with a truly innovative , trustworthy and forward thinking team , then visualsoft is the company for you .
F	after experiencing many difficulties with our previous provider , we made the move to visualsoft who provided us with the perfect website for our brand .
F	from our initial meeting with rich himsworth through to our ongoing contact with our account_manager hester short , and pr manager sarah the development of our site was professional yet personal and visualsoft truly understood the need to retain our brand image .
F	we ' ve found that visualsoft are very forward thinking with their website add_ons , ensuring their brands are at the forefront of web technology .
F	it is great !
F	useful , easy and no fee .
F	i like !
F	beautiful rugs and great people ... cheers_guys !
F	xx
F	excellent choice of products at fantastic value .
F	delivery is always speedy and trouble - free .
F	was recommended to all beauty by a friend - and now it ' s me doing the recommending .
F	i love boohoo - and must buy from the site every month .
F	there ' s so much choice and what ' s better , is the fact it ' s so affordable .
F	never had a problem with delivery or any of my purchases .
F	everything is always good quality too !
F	i ' ve been a 0 customer for almost four years .
F	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i ' ve been using it .
F	setting_up the contract was easy .
F	upgrading to a more_expensive contract was even easier .
F	i didn ' t even need to speak to anyone , everything could be done online .
F	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
F	even when i went abroad , the roaming was switched on and it was all good .
F	until the next time i went abroad .
F	i was cut_off from the rest of the world for two_weeks as 0 had randomly decided to switch off roaming without telling_me first .
F	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should ' ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
F	i don ' t even know what their logic was ...
F	then the problems started .
F	i wanted to switch the contract from my husband ' s name to mine as it was getting annoying that he had to phone them everything i wanted something .
F	so we went into a 0 store .
F	i ' m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer_service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn ' t possible to change the contract that easily .
F	we gave up .
F	one time i had a problem with my bill , when i ' d gone over my free minutes ( something they ' d previously notified me of by text but this time they neglected to tell me and so i accumulated a spend of over Â£_00 instead of my usual Â£_00 .)
F	after a lot of very frustrating phone_calls they finally_agreed to refund Â£_00 because they ' d stopped the notifications without actually telling_me they would .
F	i ' m not sure they ever did refund me though .
F	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer_service , i finally decided to switch to another provider .
F	so my husband phoned them from work ( as he ' s still the person named on a contract ).
F	after half an_hour ( of his work time ), they told him they ' d phone him back .
F	instead they phoned my mobile and left a message_saying i ' d been authorised to make changes to the contract , could i please phone them back .
F	so i did .
F	it took five_minutes just to get through the pre_- recorded adverts and nonsense they ' d like you to know about before they even let you talk to a person .
F	( also , if they ' re closed , they still make you listen to all the nonsense before they tell you they ' re closed and when you should phone back ).
F	this guy then told me i wasn ' t authorised to do anything , could my husband phone back .
F	seriously ?!
F	so my husband took another half hour out of his work time only for them again to say they ' d phone back .
F	he made sure they had his work number this time but they still managed to phone my mobile , only this time i had magically been authorised to do anything i wanted with the contract .
F	i told him to cancel it .
F	he spent litereally 00_minutes arguing with me about how i should stay , they ' d fix everything , they ' d give me a better deal , they ' d instantly change the name on the contract , they ' d give me more free minutes etc etc .
F	it took all the patience i ' ve ever owned ( and a bit more ) not to swear and hang_up on him .
F	he was so pushy and tried to put down the new provider i ' d chosen .
F	i even went as far as saying " i ' m sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let me deal with any_problems i ' ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
F	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn ' t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who ' d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally_agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
F	most frustrating morning i ' ve had since ... well , since last time i tried to fix a problem i had with 0 .
F	he said he ' d send me the pac_code within two hours .
F	i do hope this is the one time they keep their promise because if i have to phone them again i ' ll probably just throw my phone out the window .
F	also , if 0 reads this , please don ' t contact me with offers of better deals or apologies .
F	i ' m not interested and i don ' t want anything from you .
F	i just want to warn_people to stay_away from you .
F	i ' ve been using redbubble since they first started and always loved it .
F	it ' s got a fantastic range of t -_shirts , framed prints , stickers etc .
F	and although i ' ve only used the t -_shirts and greetings cards i can confidently say that if the quality in their other products is just as good , they ' ll be amazing as well .
F	unlike some other_sites that have artists uploading their work ( such as zazzle ), this still feels friendly and personal and possibly because it ' s australian and not american , it ' s got a completely_different feel than some of the other_sites that essentially do the same_thing .
F	their t -_shirts are amazing .
F	i ' ve only ever had trouble with them twice .
F	the first was years and years_ago when i ' d ordered some tees for christmas and they got delayed but even before i noticed they were delayed , i ' d got a full_refund for everything i paid even_though they were still going to ship it all and i think it actually arrived just before_christmas after all .
F	great costumer_service !
F	the second time i had trouble was about a week_ago when i received a t - shirt with a blurry print on it .
F	they replied to my email straight_away and have already sent out a new one , hopefully non - blurry , free of charge .
F	apart_from that , i ' ve only ever had perfect t -_shirts and perfect prints and although they ' re sometimes slightly more_expensive than getting something in a shop , you know part of it is going to the artist who you can talk to and send messages on the site .
F	this is absolutely the best place to get something awesome with amazing costumer_service as well .
F	this is a ridiculous website .
F	i was looking for a cheap sd_card and found this website that had them so cheap it was hard to believe .
F	turns_out it was because it shouldn ' t be believed .
F	it said shipping was free and the items would be ordered via amazon ' s check - out system so i figured if amazon were involved , it was probably alright .
F	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about Â£ 0 with an estimated_delivery date about a week_later .
F	i decided not to use it and ordered my sd_card on amazon instead .
F	after much frustration i ' m finally sitting here with the angry birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
F	when i ordered the game at the end of november i pretty confident their 0 working_days delivery would leave me with plenty of time to get it wrapped up and sorted out and when i didn ' t receive the email to confirm it had been despatched after two days as they said i would , i didn ' t think any of it .
F	however , after two_weeks of not hearing anything , i got a bit annoyed .
F	there was no reply to my first email .
F	or my phone call to the office listed on the website .
F	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn ' t want people to experience the same_thing .
F	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they ' d been overwhelmed with how many orders they ' d got and they were really sorry that they hadn ' t got in touch before .
F	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
F	they told me they ' d post it to me the next_day ( as they ' d run out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
F	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
F	today , the 00nd , my angry birds game arrived in the post .
F	i doubt i ' d recommend nicecans to a friend or even use it again for something with a deadline , but i might try it at a less busy time ( with something cheap ) to see if they can offer better service when it ' s not christmas .
F	i was recommended to these_guys and it was a good thing i was .
F	what a fantastic service they provided to me from the minute i walked in until the product was delivered and even after sales .
F	the design team could not have been more helpful nad the quality of the product was really professional looking and on top of that , the price was just so reasonable .
F	if you want a high_quality product , at affordable prices , and designed in a really professional and friendly environment then just do it .
F	thoroughly delighted customer with business coming in already from the work done .
F	thank_you so much !
F	!
F	i found the site really simple to use and all booking_fees etc were declared up front so there were no nasty_surprises when it came to the payment .
F	one phone call and i got brilliant wifi internet at home !
F	took only 0 days to get it !
F	also got the best suiting me deal and contract !
F	very pleased as struggled with other_companies before a lot !
F	absolutely love this company !
F	very friendly and helpful !
F	sent different parcels 0 times already , always delivered on time , with care and no damage !
F	door to door service - what can be better ?
F	also prices are very nice , cheaper then many post services in some countries !
F	easy tracking !
F	would highly_recommend !
F	had to buy laptop via phone , thought it will be a nightmare , but guy on the phone was very helpful !
F	explained everything , helped with calling my bank to approve money transfer and offered a lot of useful offers without being annoying at the same time !
F	absolutely loved dealing_with the store !
F	wanted to sell my iphone quickly and for fixed price , chose mazuma_mobile and was right !
F	did not expect such a great service !
F	ordered packaging on a week day , got it on saturday , sent phone on monday and had money in my bank_account on tuesday !
F	would recommend it to anyone who needs to sell his phone without having any headache !!!!
F	0 + stars service , website and price !
F	i just got my leaflets for my ad campaign , they look amazing .
F	the service was really easy , i designed them online and then the design team did a poster and business_cards to match .
F	i had them within 0 days and all the designs were done within 0 hours of asking for them !
F	really efficient service , the leaflets look great and my poster is arriving today .
F	i ' d thoroughly_recommend this company do to all your printing .
F	they are really professional and affordable too without_compromising on quality .
F	i run a small business , so its important for me to keep costs down , it ' s great that i ' ve found somewhere that can offer me just what i need and so local too !
F	looking_forward to my first stay using this company .
F	booking was simple and straight_forward .
F	the pair of sunglasses i wanted were out of stock so i emailed them and got a quick reply telling_me when they expected a delivery .
F	when the delivery came in there was only 0 sets but they emailed again to tell me so i could go and order them straight_away so i didnt miss out .
F	delivery was quick and on time .
F	very good company !
F	thanks !
F	super happy about not having to pay booking_fees .
F	website is easy to use and well_layed out !
F	great experience .
F	will be using this website to book my entire south - east asia trip .
F	great delivery , from ordering to finish .
F	sometimes , i wonder when folks write a bad review , however , not until it does happen to you .
F	very rude customer_service .
F	waited 00 and didn ' t got any package even when i had to check with the local royal_mail distribution center and this happened twice .
F	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .
F	would ' nt give them half star either .
F	friendly and helpfull team , fast delivery .
F	i love animed !!!
F	:) xxx
F	amazing product and fast delivery . very friendly and helpful customer_service .
F	thank_you very much
F	would highly_recommend this company
F	booked a collection but realised that i had booked for the wrong day .. after sending a message via fb i was quickly looked after by kate who sorted it out in no time .
F	this company i def be using again .
F	thank_you p0go and kate .
F	the product came on the exact day i chose and before the time i was expecting , loved it !
F	yes , you pay more_than some of the other_sites which appear to be much cheaper but no this is not a scam - it really works !
F	and i am so pleased that i paid the Â£_00 to have my uk o0 iphone_0s unlocked ... now i can use it abroad yay !
F	and it was all done within 00_hours - brilliant .
F	thank_you for your speedy service !
F	highly_recommended - and all you cynics out there need not fear :-)
F	i purchased a portable dvd_player for my sister to put in her car for my niece .
F	as she is such a technophobe it sat in the box for three months .
F	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
F	it was another month before she told me so by the time i contacted_wowcher they say it only has a three month warranty .
F	despite me contacting them three times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
F	i am getting_nowhere they sold an out of box faulty product and they really couldn ' t care less .
F	i wouldn ' t recommend buying anything from this company .
F	their customer care and after sales service is very poor .
F	really pleased with the personal service , speed and quality of finish on my frames .
F	paid extra for special delivery as they were expensive discontinued fendi frames i had to source from the us .
F	i have a very high prescription so paid for super thin lenses - very pleased with the cost compared to my local_optician .
F	would recommend and i will certainly use again .
F	quick delivery , very impressive .
F	goods were as_described .
F	you should see are baby in her outfit she looks amazing :)
F	thought the bottle would be bigger and thought they would of filled the perfume right up !
F	!
F	i dont know anybody who doesn ' t use this site prior to making travel_plans .
F	we all want to enjoy our holidays and get our money ' s worth so doing some research prior to your trip is becoming more and more important .
F	fellow_travellers write_reviews on accommodation , restaurants and attractions .
F	on the whole , reviews are honest , to - the - point and highlight the pros and cons .
F	and some of them have got handy tips for making your trip that little_bit easier .
F	the site is pretty easy to navigate once you are used to it , and best of all some of the establishments have got handy date booking search_engines that automatically submit your dates and bring up prices and availbility of various booking sites .
F	not sure how i used to live without tripadvisor to be honest !
F	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
F	the site is great , easy to use and i normally use the collection option for my orders which is free .
F	i have collected from a variety of their stores and i have to say that the whole collection process is really painful .
F	a lot of the stores don ' t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
F	they really need to look_into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
F	i have been using snapfish for about 0 years now and havent had any complaints .
F	their site is very user_friendly , communication is brilliant , and the actual products are very good quality .
F	they also do regular special_offers on all_sorts of products and you can get some really good deals if subscribe to the newsletter .
F	if it ' s possible to give no stars i would do .
F	i ordered a dining_room set from their diningroomworld site .
F	it was stated that the item would be delivered next_day .
F	notified at the last_minute that they couldnt deliver .
F	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
F	told them i couldnt do week days and it would have to be delivered on a saturday ( which they wanted to charge me for !
F	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0 weeks_ago .
F	for the last 0 saturdays i have patiently_waited for the delivery and nothing has arrived .
F	what an_absolute_joke .
F	pathetic service .
F	no communication .
F	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance ........... now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
F	excellent service and nice vehicles both journeys .
F	driver was first_class from dalaman airport ... even got ice_cream and water for free !!
F	company were very helpful when i had a change of hotel !
F	can ' t imagine you will find a better transfer company !
F	ordered very last_minute as i couldn ' t find the products i wanted anywhere , came_across fragrancedirect - and although some items advertised on the site were out of stock i did find alternatives .
F	super low_prices , fast effective delivery - would certainly use again .
F	supplement_warehouse has tons of name brand supplements at amazing low_prices !
F	i am a poor college_student and without supplement_warehouse i probably wouldn ' t be able to afford my pre and post workout_supplements which are key for me to maintain a healthy life style !
F	the shipping_costs are low and they also have some great free_samples and giveaways when you order !
F	hostelbookers is easy to use , contains lots of photos and information about the hostels and makes it very easy to compare ratings against pricing .
F	being a budget traveller you want to get things as cheaply as possible but you also want somewhere close to everything and a hostel that has some atmosphere and good qualities .
F	this site makes that much_quicker to scan through whats on offer and with the map_view its quick to check locations
F	ok , so one of my orders from asos got lost on the way to me .
F	but after sending an e_- mail to asos customer_services i received a very fast reply to acknowledge that my order hadn ' t been delivered and was told someone was looking into it .
F	after a week i ' d not heard_anything more so i e_- mailed asos customer_services again and was shipped out a replacement straight_away with the next_day delivery service .
F	thanks , asos !
F	i never normally_write_reviews but am so happy with the service i just had to this time .
F	the service was easy to book and they managed to fit me in the next_day :) booked for 0pm and andy was here dead on time !!
F	he was polite , chatty and competent .
F	exceptionally good customer_service !!
F	tyres were much cheaper_than anywhere_else and having them done at home was much_better_than sitting in a garage reception .
F	i will_definitely use this facility again !
F	first_class service and i would recommend to anyone !!
F	thank_you !
F	rachael , warrington
F	great prices - love the competitor calculator right next to the products .
F	had exactally what i wanted
F	as with every order i have placed with truffle_shuffle it has arrived amazingly fast ( next_day ) my new t - shirt looks amazing on and is a great fit and great quality - will be returning for more in the future
F	i ordered my lenses on tuesday and selected next_day delivery .
F	within a few hours someone phoned me from customer_services to advise that my type of lenses sometimes take a little longer to come into stock but should be with me by the friday .
F	i was then contacted the following_day ( wednesday ) to say they were in stock and they were delivered on thursday .
F	brilliant service .
F	i ordered the product yesterday just before midday and it arrived this morning by courier .
F	excellent service .
F	i recently tried optibac ' for daily wellbeing extra strength ' which support overall digestive health , immunity and energy .
F	my experiences
F	digestion : one of the things i hate about having to take so many different medications and painkillers are the affects they have on my stomach and digestion .
F	without going into too much detail my digestion has improved so much since taking the probiotics .
F	my digestion over the last few_years has been very erratic but after just a few weeks taking the probiotics i am much more regular , which must mean my intestines are a lot healthier
F	immunity : it is very difficult to judge the effect the on my immune system after just a month ( other than the fact that i haven ' t had any colds or bugs ).
F	i believe it can only have had a good effect though ; my immune system is very low so even a slight improvement would be a bonus .
F	energy : this is another area that i can ' t say 000_% if my energy levels have improved , as due to my m . e they are very up and down anyway , and can be affected by how much i ' ve done in previous days , how many painkillers i ' ve had to take etc .
F	the only thing i can say is that i ' ve had more ' good ' than ' bad ' days this month , but whether this is down to the probiotics or not is hard to say .
F	skin : this is the area that i ' ve noticed the biggest improvement .
F	i ' ve had eczema since i was a baby , although it is a lot better now than during my childhood , and i often have flare - ups .
F	my skin seems a lot calmer now , with fewer flare - ups and sore , red patches .
F	it looks a lot healthier , is less dry and it feels less itchy and sore too .
F	i ' ve not changed anything in my skincare regime over the last month , so i can only put the improvements down to the probiotics .
F	overall : brilliant !
F	i wasn ' t expecting such a change so quickly .
F	i ' d definitely_recommend this product to anyone who â_s health and wellbeing needs a boost .
F	i would definitely_recommend this company as even when i encountered a problem with my cartridge , the customer_service was second to none with almost instant messages of advice being sent and when i was unable to resolve the problem , a no_quibble replacement was authorised .
F	excellent
F	you sort of expect invitations to be good , but not great .
F	not with zazzle , these invitations definitely have a wow factor to them .
F	the quality is spectacular , service was wonderful , what else could you want ?
F	seriously impressed by this website .
F	moving is stressful and costly - anyvan . com took all the hassle out of it .
F	it ' s so easy to navigate and get what you want - quickly and at a good price .
F	the van company i used was certified and had great feedback and rightly so - really really happy with the whole service .
F	would definitely use again .
F	recently booked our_honeymoon to south_africa with budget_air .
F	found the cheapest flights by_far with better connection times to port elizabeth than others .
F	the customer_service team were also very helpful and responded to my queries almost_immediately .
F	received my e_- ticket just minutes later and everything all sorted very quickly and efficiently .
F	would definitely_recommend them to others .
F	i bought an explanar a few_months back for my husband as he was complaining_about not being_able to practise enough due to the poor weather .
F	he_loves it and is always on it .
F	we recently gave our 0 months notice to end our contract on our rented flat , and shortly_afterwards greene & co started to book viewings .
F	unfortunately almost every viewing request we ' ve received has been for that day , not providing the 00_hours notice they are legally required to give .
F	i ' ve had 00 + conversations with the letting agents and even made a formal_complaint to the head letting agent about this , but they continue to ask to view the flat without 00_hours notice .
F	we are buying a property and often have confidential documents on display in the flat , so it ' s not appropriate for strangers to be in our flat without the proper notice .
F	i ' m at my wits_end with greene & co and have unfortunately had to lodge an official_complaint with the property osbudman over this .
F	putting a loved one into care is a very difficult , emotional experience to go through , but i wanted to write a review of care uk as they made what was a difficult time so much_easier .
F	from the person i spoke to on my initial_enquiry to the home manager everyone has been fantastically helpful and incredibly kind over this difficult period .
F	i ' d highly_recommend care uk ' s care homes to anyone_looking for care for a loved one .
F	jantiene and rupert bought my house within 0 weeks of our first contact .
F	they sent me my offer , sent round the surveyor and dealt_with the solicitors .
F	smooth and quick sale .
F	i found the nigel_o ' hara through google_shopping and they were offering a fantastic deal on the watch i had been looking to purchase .
F	made my order on friday 0rd of jan at 0pm , but 00 days_later still_waiting for delivery .
F	website stated that the economy delivery would take 0 - 0 days once dispatched which seemed reasonable and inline with other site ' s economy delivery option .
F	unfortunately what the website didn ' t clearly_state was that dispatching times are snail pace .
F	i received an_email on the 0th_jan ( 0 days_later - 0 working_days ) saying my order had only just been dispatched !
F	now 0 days_later ( 0 working_days ) i am still_waiting for my order .
F	i have contacted customer care about the speed of delivery and received an_email thanking me for my patience , but no explanation as to why delivery was so slow .
F	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F	edited : i have now received a response to my customer care enquiry letting me know that my order will now not complete this week but next week .
F	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
F	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F	update_:
F	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
F	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
F	i would advise against using this site and have amended my star_rating according .
F	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
F	i was pretty nervous_about using this company based on other reviews , but they were offering the iphone_0s for Â£_00 a month with automatic cashback , so the deal seemed too good to refuse and i took my chances .
F	phone arrived the next_day as promised and everything was as it should be .
F	i had a bit of a struggle getting it to work and had no signal at all .
F	popped_into the vodafone store and they told me the sim hadn ' t been activated , so if this is a problem for you try activating your sim .
F	so far no_complaints and would recommend .
F	hope i ' m not tempting fate !
F	i worked with atom00 last_year on a campaign and was really impressed with the service i received from them .
F	in the past i have worked with online marketing companies who use a lot of confusing language and don ' t get great results , but atom00 were the complete_opposite .
F	they explained everything they were doing clearly and simply to me ( not an online marketing expert !)
F	and improved the sales i was seeing through my site considerably .
F	they ' re also a very friendly company , which made working with them a pleasure .
F	i would recommend them to any business looking for a reputable online marketing agency .
F	easy website to use which gives you all the information you need and responds very quickly to your booking .
F	i sent two phones in september_0000 they told me for weeks they are waiting for parts , i had already paid them for parts which cost Â£_000 .
F	to go on the website today and see it has been ceased is very worrying they have 0 new phones worth a total of Â£_000 .
F	i have emailed them thry said i will get the phones back and be reimbursed .. how true that is i dont know doubtful !
F	!
F	ordered two ladies fitted organic t shirts and was very impressed with the speed of delivery , the print quality , and the t shirt quality - they are so soft !
F	a great shape too , though i ' m not totally convinced on the sizing .... the large only just fits me ( i ' m a size 00 ).
F	great product and service , thank_you .
F	just received my order and what can i say ..
F	i am very satisfied with it .
F	the ship time was short and they treated me great !
F	the service rep also had a very good recommendation which i followed and i love my new phone !
F	thanks !!
F	!
F	the product is great , the note is lovely .
F	found out the packaging is 000_% biodegradable , so am very happy !
F	their service was quick and efficent .
F	although many ppl have told me only request for cheques and dont give in your bank_details as a payment_method .
F	i gave in my details & received a payment within the very next_day of posting it .
F	there is no scam , it is a trust - worthy site .
F	i ' m very pleased with the product i ordered which was a spiky massage ball .
F	it was delivered within a few_days .
F	i got what i expected , really good for relaxing muscles .
F	would recommend to anyone interested in massages .
F	i was able to book my hostel very quickly and with lots of knowledge of what to expect .
F	the reviews are easy to find ( which is important ), and i feel_confident that i will be staying in a good choice hostel .
F	the whole_thing took all of about 00_minutes , including browsing and payment !
F	how amazing are this company ?!!
F	even phones that are scratched are excepted , my company has benefited greatly from mazuma , i will always use this company .
F	trustworthy , honest and quick !
F	!
F	keep up the good work !!
F	!
F	just organising my first big backpacking_trip for years and still , hostebookers , comes out top !
F	sorted me out when i started travelling at 00 , and they come up with great deals for solo travellers every time - recommended !
F	i ordered from cybercandy to treat_myself for my birthday , the only problem was choosing what to get !
F	i ordered on sunday and received my goods 0 days_later on a friday they dispatched on the monday .
F	i was amazed at the range of products and the prices are very fair .
F	{ having visited a shop and also looking at amazon etc } cybercandy was the cheapest i found and went with them and my experience was not disappointing .
F	i was very happy when the box arrived - the box had nice touches on it , a cybercandy robot and om nom nom on the box - little things like that make me smile and shows they put effort in what they do .
F	they even had multicoloured peanuts in which also made me happy !
F	fantastically packed and no_problems with any of the products i bought .
F	today i ordered and had problems with payment and emailed them and was very impressed with the response time - they managed to resolve my issue and help me out in a very friendly and prompt way within half a hour , not many companies can boast such a quick response time .
F	i will_defiantly be using them again and again in the future - really good for gifts and getting products that are not sold in the uk .
F	i would { and have } recommend them to friends !
F	also their facebook_page is awesome and they hold competitions and giveaways - its nice to see a company interacting so well with their customers .
F	thank_you cybercandy !
F	had a problem with a delivery address this morning , was sorted within 00_minutes .
F	excellent service through there facebook_page .
F	never had a problem with the company , great prices , better_than royal_mail x
F	great communication via_email and text .
F	highly fast and efficient delivery service i only went for standard delivery late on a thursday_night and i got it saturday_morning .
F	was a great surprise when got text to say it was arriving today and it has made a very happy cat .
F	i ordered a large cat scratching post which was packaged well and easy to assemble .
F	it was exactly as it was described and looked on the website .
F	thanks i am happy to use this service again .
F	great service was next_day delivery without the extra_cost of paying for it .
F	got emails asking if eta was ideal so was reassuring .
F	thanks .
F	it seems a little weird at first to be buying something cheaper just by going through a website - we ' re so aware of being scammed nowadays - but you can check out how and why it works and you can pay with paypal for added security .
F	you put your request in and an offer comes back - usually the same day - which will be better_than amazon ( i ' ve had a 00_% saving before ) and you can either choose to buy it or reject it or think about it for a while .
F	no pressure , you either accept it or you don ' t .
F	if you choose to order , your request is posted by well_known companies - i ' ve had asda and amazon amongst others - and it arrives as if you ' d ordered from them direct .
F	if anything does go_wrong there is a team on hand to help resolve your issue .
F	i ' ve never had to use them so i can ' t comment on that .
F	so you ' re saving money just by putting your request through flubit , why wouldn ' t you give it a go ?
F	when my father asked for a ps0 game for christmas on the day of last posting i was filled with dread .
F	a quick online search showed simplygames to have the best price on the game including next_day courier delivery .
F	sorted .
F	the courier service was excellent , i could choose what day i wanted it to be delivered or specify it be delivered to a neighbour and i was given updates including an_hour_window to expect delivery .
F	excellent service and no need to worry_about a disappointed father .
F	my fiancÃ© and i have just bought our_wedding_bands from marlows and they could not of been more accommodating and helpful .
F	my ring is a beautiful diamond set band that completely matches my engagement_ring and i had not seen a band similar throughout the jewellery_quarter .
F	my fiancÃ© however visited marlows with a design already in mind - margaret at marlows was fantastic !!!!
F	she went through various rings with my fiancÃ© till he found the prefect fit in size , width and weight before assuring us they could put the design he wanted on to the ring that he chose !!
F	not only were they extremely_helpful but also quick and efficient as his ring would only take just over a week to do ( even_though our_wedding is not till next year )
F	i would recommend marlows to anyone !
F	!
F	i had never used this company before and first attempted booking my tickets online .
F	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
F	i walked to the beeston train_station today hoping that asking my questions in person would be the least frustrating and easiest_way to find answers .
F	unfortunately , i was completely wrong .
F	the blonde , 00 something year_old woman behind the glass window was rude , cold and frankly ... completely_useless .
F	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
F	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
F	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
F	i have always recieved fantastic service and value for money when visitig national_tyres .
F	the staff are always friendly and highly knowledgeable .
F	excellent hotel , well worth the money !
F	handy having someone_else sort out money .
F	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn ' t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
F	food was expensive and not discounted as advertised , i was really embarrassed that people had paid for this !!!
F	party_bus well this was something else words can ' t describe what a rip_off it was .
F	first bar we were taken too was disgusting in everyday , you could almost hear the tumble weed as we walked in !
F	we literally paid Â£_00 for nothing !!
F	!
F	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted Â£_00 and today they ' ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me Â£ 0 . 00 for it !!!
F	!
F	i was well aware i ' d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white background and doesn ' t affect the operation of the phone , but Â£ 0 . 00 !!!
F	come on that ' s crazy !
F	and there ' s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
F	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
F	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered Â£_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
F	i rejected mazuma ' s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they ' d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
F	think i ' ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it ' s still in working order !
F	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me Â£_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform me they ' ve found a tiny yellow mark that ' s only visible on a white background (_eg .
F	in the settings folder ) and therefore it ' s classed_as faulty and they ' ll only offer me Â£_00 !!
F	!
F	i understand a small drop in the price but i don ' t think that warrants a Â£_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
F	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
F	sold it through a competitor who happily paid Â£_00 for it !
F	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn ' t let me post this review on their website , funny that !
F	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
F	definitely wouldn ' t recommend , avoid at all costs !
F	have used moonpig for many years and love that i can personalise the cards .
F	just found the perfect gift for my hubby for xmas after searching every shop and unable to find anything similar .
F	love the reminders , i honesty would forget people ' s birthdays otherwise !
F	haven ' t brought from a card shop in years !
F	i have been doing online shopping since i ' ve had my two boys .
F	so much_easier than going in store with them both being under age 0 . can do it from home and be delivered .
F	always on time and there products are always good .
F	never had to send anything back .
F	and love the points rewards !
F	the online website is so easy to use !
F	and love how it saves my favorites , from online and instore !!!!
F	!
F	have sent a couple phones in and have been very happy with mazuma .
F	very fast and easy !
F	this company has a good range of products at very reasonable prices .
F	i ordered late on saturday_night and had my order by tuesday .
F	would recommend and definitely use again !
F	was very happy and satisfied with my purchase from preciouslittleone and cannot wait to use my obaby zezu travel system when our baby arrives in may .
F	would definatly recommend this company to others and will be purchasing items from them again .
F	really pleased with service and the product is brilliant !!
F	a big_thumbs_up to this company
F	i enjoy supplementwarehouse because they have quality products at prices much lower_than other competing stores like gnc .
F	the option to pricematch any site makes it an affordable option for most everyone .
F	it ' s very easy to use and i recommend it for those looking to save a little extra cash while still buying the same great quality brands .
F	i spoke to samantha who was very helpful and clear with her answers .
F	great site , will be using again
F	i have bought several items from here and been completely_satisfied with the service and the goods delivered .
F	being new to biking the reviews on the website are very handy .
F	and just like that , reservations were made .
F	great site , easy - to - navigate design , helpful reviews , and no sneaky booking_fees lurking in the corners .
F	0_stars fully earned .
F	courier picked laptop up on tuesday , got paid the exact amount quoted on the wednesday .
F	brilliant service , would use again .
F	switched gas supplier from npower to sse in august last_year .
F	npower put an estimated reading on my final_bill that was much higher_than my actual reading .
F	i have spoken to them about 0 times now about this and i still don ' t have an amended bill .
F	every time i ring their call_centre the wait time is around 00_minutes .
F	it ' s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
F	just wanted to say im a big lover of amazon , excellent products , great prices , helpful customer_services .
F	but i have also been very impressed with amazons kindle store recently when shopping for books .
F	they have a vast_selection and found some great reads for free also .
F	amazon just keep getting better and better , and if you haven ' t purchased anything from them before , i would definately_recommend them all the way .
F	:-)
F	primark you simply are the best , had a good look round primark this week , and the products , particularly ladies fashion are shoes are just so bang on trend and really good quality considering the prices are so low .
F	obviously being a women i just had to buy something , and bought a lovely denim waistcoat with little pearls embellished all over it .
F	its so cute and will go with lots i currently have in my wardrobe .
F	i now it sounds crazy but my wardrobe would be very dull if there was no primark .......... primark is the fashion savior to savvy shoppers ..... i love u primark :-)
F	i recently_bought a new laptop , have been shopping around for some time for a particular model .
F	i then found it on special offer in argos reduced by Â£_000 .
F	so was made up and went to purchase it immediately .
F	the staff were very helpful , and i was able to either spread the cost over 0 months or pay it off after 0 months .
F	overall i was very happy with the service , and probably would not have been able to afford this laptop otherwise .
F	well_done argos .
F	:-)
F	sell your laptop were great , i couldn ' t fault the service one bit .
F	right from the start when i entered my laptops details into their very easy to use quote estimator , right down to them collecting my laptop free of charge , when it was convenient for me .
F	and finally receiving quick message to tell me what my laptop was worth .
F	i got a great price and received the cash straight_away .
F	all_round a super company , and i ' m very glad i choose them .
F	they were so good i even recommended them to my sister and her boyfriend , who then used sell your laptop also .
F	this place beats any other place hands_down !
F	i will never buy from another site .
F	the quality is great , shipping is fast !
F	and if i find the product online somewhere_else they instantly take 0 %_off the competitors price !!
F	i highly refer them to anyone_looking to add any kind of supplement to their daily needs !
F	and if you don ' t like what you got ( btw that will never happen ) they will refund you ' re money !
F	!
F	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
F	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
F	upon calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
F	apparently they were delivered 0 days_later by which point , was too_late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
F	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
F	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
F	trying to get a refund but it ' s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
F	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
F	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing ones .
F	great sofa beds delivered next_day to aberdeen .
F	thanks
F	would definitely_recommend to a friend .
F	great quality beds at a great cost .
F	arrived when they were supposed to and are very comfortable .
F	safe payment through paypal but peter accommodated me by taking my order over the phone as i don ' t have paypal and didn ' t want to send my card_details over internet .
F	good communication - phone_calls always straight through to the company director himself .
F	would love to buy the whole shop .
F	stunning quality products and great customer_service
F	ive been using this company for a while now as i simply dont trust royal_mail .
F	my parcels get there quickly and they are value for money .
F	i recommend to everyone .
F	i made a typo error and a pop up screen appeared and i was able to contact andrea who resolved the matter in minutes .
F	i will_continue to keep using parcelto go for all my shipping needs xx
F	we never thought we would have got the tickets that we did with double0tickets !
F	when we found them , we ordered them without any hassle at all ; and they were delivered promptly , on time and with no_problems .
F	that ' s exactly_what you need in a ticket company and double0tickets has it !
F	gemma and martin thorne
F	i found hostelbookers . com to be a great website .
F	after comparing_prices with other ho ( s ) tel booking websites it had the best offers .
F	the site is easy to navigate , use , place bookings , plus no booking charges !
F	one minute after i placed the order and had to call a hotel ( for visa - related questions ), they already greeted me by name from the booking they received through hostelbookers . com !
F	it was a pleasant_surprise .
F	without_doubt the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
F	i purchased 0 large bags of dog_food from this company and after using the first one ( which took a couple of months to get through ) opened the 0nd to find it mouldy .
F	i contacted feedem ( within the 0 months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
F	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
F	i contacted them again clearly stating my consumer right and was ignored ( up to 0 times so far ) so got my local citizens_advice to contact them - again they made out i was in the wrong ( changing the reason they were refusing a refund !!).
F	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .
F	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has taught me this .
F	the proof of a company with good customer_service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i ' m not the only one who thinks so ).
F	i would give 0_stars if the review allowed it .
F	great selection and choice of fancy_dress items .
F	easy to use website and fast delivery .
F	would recommend them to anyone who is in need of costume for an event .
F	will_definitely use them again !
F	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
F	managed to speak to cs representative who quickly helped to respond to one part of my enquiry to my satisfactory .
F	partyrama advertises free delivery over Â£_00 , but it doesn ' t work automatically and is not clear on the store delivery or checkout pages .
F	i have missed it and only wanted to suggest some improvements but have faced negative side of cs_team .
F	site requires improvement and cs_team could be more helpful when people provide suggestions .
F	needed a printer in a hurry - found a printer with what i needed very quickly on the website and it was the best value around !
F	arrived the next_day as promised .
F	great value , great service - very grateful !
F	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0 weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
F	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
F	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special occasion .
F	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
F	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
F	i sent countless emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
F	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
F	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
F	i was then told it would be this week .
F	i still_haven ' t had a refund !
F	!
F	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer_service ' has been diabolical from start to finish !
F	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
F	thank_you so much for the beautiful wedding stationery .
F	we ordered the whole purity range and were absolutely_delighted with the quality and style .
F	the ordering_process was straightforward and the service we received was excellent .
F	many_thanks again .
F	the surgery was a success for me so i am so pleased with the result , i feel_like i can see perfectly .
F	my vision is even better_than if i was wearing my glasses .
F	the staff at optimax southend were ever so helpful in answering any_questions i had , they went into detail about the different_types of treatment that were available and we found the right one for me .
F	the procedure itself was so quick and painless .
F	i was all back to normal the following_day but with better vision .
F	my aftercare was great too couldn ' t have asked for more .
F	thank_you :)
F	it was quick and easy dealing_with them , and next_day special delivery .
F	i was panicking that i wouldn ' t receive my tickets on time but they reassured me and now there in my hand 0weeks for the show .
F	thank_you so much , i will be dealing_with you again .
F	0 . 0 x
F	i had booked several hotels via their website and will do so also in the future - very relevant content , easy_navigation , plenty of reviews - all one needs to book the best hotel according to chosen criteria .
F	i only discovered play . com a few_months_ago and i ' ve placed several orders , each time very pleased with the goods .
F	highly_recommend it !
F	no one is too far to reach in this world anymore , thanks to skype .
F	they provide a fantastic service and i ' d just like to say - thank_you :_d
F	these are my fourth pair of mbt ' s and i ' m very pleased with all of them .
F	they are the most comfortable footwear i ' ve ever owned .
F	i live in them .
F	i have a history of lower back problems and this range does encourage you to adapt a better posture which leads to a healthier body / back in the future .
F	i highly_recommend the mbt brand and the results ( 000_% improved posture plus increased muscle tone in legs and bottocks ) speak for themselves .
F	:))
F	the site is so easy to navigate and has everything u need to decide on which hostel suits you best .
F	perfect !
F	!
F	very good quality items , arrived quickly and had excellent choice of colours / fabrics / style .
F	loved the fact i could have anything i wanted on them !
F	great x
F	they were prompt , professional and the towels are great .
F	they look really professional !
F	!
F	firstly very reasonable in regards to price .... i actually ordered the product somewhere_else than saw it on this website and canceled .... as it was so much cheaper .....
F	quick payment ... very easy to use and good delivery .... will be using allbeauty website to regularly but my shampoo ....!!
F	!
F	very happy !!!
F	!
F	what a story .......
F	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response ......... then i wrote on this site ........ then got a response , agreed on a refund ........... returned item ........ heard_nothing again ............ 0 emails later ......,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
F	!
F	i don ' t care my phone case was Â£_00 .....,,,, i have had enough !!!!
F	!
F	i want my Â£Â£Â£Â£ back !!!!
F	!
F	in nov i stated my family were solicitors and i was going to
F	proceed with this case against nice cans , as from the weekend the case as been constructed and i will proceed to court in order to
F	close this company down .
F	i will update all events on this site !!
F	!
F	i bought a stokke xplory v0 travel system from winstanley ' s .
F	they have been amazing .
F	at first i ordered purple and then changed my mind to red after i had ordered this .
F	the customer_service centre emailed me back within minutes of our phone conversation to say that they confirm the colour change had been made and ordered .
F	i knew the red one was on back order and i also received email_updates to tell me when it would be arriving .
F	when the pram arrived there was a fault with it and the hood was bent , whish is more to do with the manufacturer .
F	i emailed them in the evening and by the morning of the following_day , nicola from the service centre had already phoned me and sent me an_email to say she had arranged for swap to take place the next_day and a courier had been arranged .
F	you cant_fault their customer_service .
F	they have been brilliant and i am very happy with our whole experience with them .
F	my iphone 0 ( 00g , firmware 00 . 00 . 00 ) locked to rogers_canada is finally unlocked !
F	i tried to unlock the phone for weeks and got super desperate ` cause nothing worked .
F	finally i decided to buy the unlock and it worked_perfectly !
F	thank_you so much for that !
F	ordered an equipment bag and other bits and was really pleased with the quality and how quick it arrived as well as being very well_packaged .
F	i will_definitely use this company again .
F	thank ' s
F	plus de 0 ans que_je_suis cliente chez asos .
F	et_je vois le sav se dÃ©grader au fil des annÃ©es .
F	commande effectuÃ©e le 00 / 00 pour une livraison annoncÃ©e le 00 / 00 ( option livraison 00h facturÃ©e Ã  00 â¬).
F	rien reÃ§u le 00 / 00 et quand je relance le sav via facebook , j ' ai un gentil message qui m ' informe que_je serais tout naturellement livrÃ© le 00 / 00 .
F	ils savent compter chez asos .
F	quand je leur explique qu ' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas rÃ©cupÃ©rer le colis et qu ' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me rÃ©pond : " on ne fait plus Ã§a m ' dame " !
F	bah oui , ils faisaient mais plus maintenant .
F	merci asos pour tant d â efficacitÃ© .
F	i bought 0 items , all replacements for bits i had run out of .
F	to find my favourite mascara , which usually sells for Â£ 0 . 00 , to be sold on fragrance_direct at Â£ 0 . 00 , made me very happy !
F	the price savings range from getting Â£ 0 off of something to saving up to 00 %!
F	it will_definitely encourage me to try new items .
F	definitely gives superdrug or boots a run for their money !
F	would recommend , and will_definitely shop again
F	my sister booked my hen_do for me and the girls for manchester last month .
F	she gave me a few quotes she had got from other hen companies , but funktions stood out .
F	the communication with them was easy and informative .
F	we got regular_updates on how the booking was progressing and changing things in the booking was no problem to them .
F	the cocktail_making and meal was really good value , well worth what we paid !
F	we had a great time and stayed on afterwards as the bar had a brilliant atmosphere .
F	we went into the printworks bars later on without queueing , which was great as it was raining .
F	our hotel was only round the corner so a short stagger to our beds was ideal .
F	whole_thing only cost us Â£_000 each , bargain !
F	we will def be using them again , probably next year .
F	i have bought 0 x replacement bowls for kenwood kitchen machine .
F	i received one bowl few_days_later and there was no invoice included .
F	we sent email to as sufficient response to ask what was happening and received automated email few minutes later reassuring that my issue will be look at by 0ourhouse . co . uk customer_service .
F	0 weeks_later and nothing has happened .
F	i sent another email directly to 0ourhouse . co . uk , one month later no response .
F	because i lost only about Â£ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
F	very disappointed with this company and will_definitely never order again .
F	cheers to that .
F	great price , fast delivery , excellent customer_service , no_problems with returns .
F	great company , i will shop again and will_definitely_recommend to friend
F	i think dealchecker is great as their weekly email newsletter includes some very cheap holiday offers .
F	they often include hotels and country side breaks in the uk too so i find that i get inspiration for my next holiday .
F	i would definately_recommend it if you are looking to save money on your holiday
F	we used this payment service to collect money for a hen_party .
F	it made life_easier for everyone .
F	the organisers ( us ) didn ' t have to chase attendees for their contributions ( as instructions were sent by email ) and it was very quick and convenient for everyone to make their payment .
F	i would recommend to anyone .
F	i have never_experienced worse customer_service than with three uk .
F	i paid for internet , and they couldn ' t help me get it working .
F	they kept telling_me they ' d send me the details i needed via text , and they ' d never come through .
F	i spoke with over 0 different people and all of them were unhelpful and borderline rude .
F	now i asked for a refund , and they said they can ' t do a refund , but they ' d be happy to issue a credit to my account .
F	they said their system can ' t process refunds ( which is clearly a lie ).
F	i am just so frustrated - and am out the money i paid for a month , which is very frustrating since i didn ' t even use the service !
F	switching cell services for sure .
F	i loved hostelbookers and i will_definitely be using them again .
F	the site was so easy to use and they had the best prices i could find .
F	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
F	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
F	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
F	yet after getting a phone call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
F	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
F	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
F	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
F	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
F	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
F	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
F	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
F	however , i received an_email on the 00st january stating that my invitations had been dispatched and would be with me shortly .
F	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
F	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
F	?
F	i have sent two emails and heard_nothing back .
F	at this rate the rsvp date printed will have passed !
F	becky
F	i have had three canvases from hellocanvas and i have been delighted with them all .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone and will be ordering again as soon as i find some free wall space !
F	!
F	not only did i manage to book my accommodation at a cheaper price through hostelbookers , and in no time using the easy booking system .
F	i also had a print out of everything i needed including directions on how to get to the guest house , his phone number and email address .
F	the next_day when i met some people on my bus from the airport , they mentioned how difficult it was to find their accommodation , especially as it was 0 o â clock at night and dark .
F	but , i found mine in no time , which as a female travelling_alone , it really helps .
F	thanks hostelbookers !
F	i will_definitely be using you again .
F	i recently completed the complete nail technician course in islington , london and had a great time .
F	the tutor emma was extremely_helpful and made the lesson enjoyable especially when going through the theory .
F	what i liked most about the course what the fact that we practised on real_life models ( other students ).
F	i believe this is an excellent way of learning as it enables you to get a real feel of what it would be like to work on a paying client , not only teaching you the theory and practical , but also client interaction .
F	i would highly_recommend this course for anyone aspiring to become a nail technician !!
F	!
F	i found this to be the most cost_effective way to reserve a hostel .
F	the price was well below the cost at the door ( exactly half ) there were no service fees , and it was fast and easy :)
F	i shopped_around for a good price on a decent guitar bag for my son to take to school .
F	reidy ' s price was unbeatable and the service was quick and efficient .
F	i would definitely_recommend .
F	thank_you :)
F	found barrington ' s had the best price on what i was looking for and was really pleased with how quickly i received the item .
F	would definitely_recommend and highly likely to use again next time the hubby starts whinging for something !
F	:-)
F	cannot complain at all .
F	the website was easy to use .
F	they kept in touch the whole time .
F	the courrier was on time and polite and it took them less_than 0 hours from when they received my laptop to payment being in my account !
F	i got more money than i thought and it beat the average ebay prices .
F	i would totally advise using this and its for charity too so warm and fuzzy all over !
F	thank u !!
F	!
F	my husband has been part of ziip forum for several years and up until now i have always gone on the high_street to buy his games but now with ziip having the best prices around and also buying points its definitely the place to buy games its a good way to support independent companies .
F	i have even started to recommend it to my friends who other_halfs play games as well .
F	very quick response and delivery to give the whole service 00 / 00 .
F	i ' ve just found a coat that my boyfriend wants for christmas ... an an amazin price of Â£_00 ...( rrp Â£_000 ... he wanted it that badly i was prepared to pay that !)
F	i ' m so glad i stumbled_upon this ... great sale !
F	ive ordered before ... unfortunately one of the poles to my tent snapped ... but i ent it back to outdoorkit and i was sent a brank new one within a matter of days .
F	great service ... thank_you .
F	firstly the website : not user_friendly , search for something using the filters on ebay and you ' ll see how a big site should function .
F	secondly the delivery : i ' ve had one delivery where they couldn ' t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
F	another time , the express next_day delivery i paid for was cancelled on the day and i was reduced to super_saver .
F	talk about late notice .
F	i was left without an important present .
F	then it took_ages to arrive ( citylink dramas same old )
F	finally customer_service : talk about not what they claim .
F	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
F	they never actually answer questions in emails or on the phone .
F	they just skirt around the issues , unless you email the same questions more concisely three of four times .
F	i know they ' re a massive company and they brand themselves well , but if you ' re one of the cases where it goes_wrong , you quickly lose any love you had for them .
F	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley face on the box ( a bit like apple ...)
F	received my glasses very quickly as they fit through letterbox .
F	they felt a bit difficult to look through , so i rang ciliaryblue and jack was so helpful , saying i could send them back to him and he ' d check them and advising me as to what to say to my opticians , d + a .
F	he checked the lenses and they were as the prescription said .
F	armed with the knowledge that ciliary blue would replace lenses if my prescription was wrong , i went to see d + a .
F	they fobbed me off multiple_times , claiming i hadn ' t given the glasses time and that websites are unreliable .
F	they constantly tried to lay blame on ciliary blue , which annoyed me immensely .
F	in the end they agreed to retest but if there was no change in my prescription i ' d be charged Â£_00 .
F	i took the risk and discovered they had my axis wrong by 00 degrees .
F	pretty shocking .
F	needless to say i made d + a replace the lenses because i don ' t think it would have been fair to get ciliary blue do it considering it was definitely not their fault .
F	one of the best if not the best internet based company i have ever used .
F	found exactly_what i wanted at a fantastic price and the added_bonus of being_able to nominate a delivery day !
F	why can ' t shopping online always be this easy ?
F	spent a long time trying to find a cotton cellular blanket with a satin edge and this one is perfect .
F	excellent prices and very quick delivery .
F	will_definitely be recommending , thank_you !
F	hostelbooking is very easy for everyone , you can find many hostels for a good price and all on one webpage .
F	furthermore the booking is not complicated and can be handled by everyone .
F	i would have to say if i need a supplement i will most def be able to find it on supplementwarehouse . com at the lowest_price .
F	not only have i found products i need but the site , i also get alot of great products to test that i ended_up liking and using .
F	i ' ve booked with them several_times and never had any trouble .
F	their rating_system helps me pick the best options and is pretty reliable .
F	i have resently purchased twice from guitarguitar and on both occassions the service i have received has been second to none , commumication is great and the staff have went out their way to do their best for me .
F	their next_day delivery service is amazing and by_far the best .
F	i will_continue to purchase all my musical_equipment from guitarguitar as they have never failed me in the past .
F	just_eat is an easy way to order food , there fast , reliable and sometimes people don ' t have money on them so just_eat made it easier to pay by card , i would recommend anyone to give just_eat a go .
F	there fantastic , and i ' ve never had any_problems with this service .
F	can not fault this company .
F	the bike was brilliant and it arrived the next_day in perfect_condition .
F	i found the staff to be extremely_helpful and informative .
F	would certainly recommend !
F	superb .
F	always use it to check results ... just wonder if a cashier checked and it came up with all the winning numbers if they would give the ticket back !
F	?
F	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
F	very unhelpful .
F	i shopped with them for years , putting up with the awful staff until i found the same products with other people at half the price
F	limited website and sales teams are a total pain in the backside .
F	once enquired_about advertising and now they won ' t leave me alone
F	these people are geniuses !
F	celeb copies at cheap money !
F	was happy to find their site after i ' d paid 0x the price in a ' boutique ' for their products !!!
F	!
F	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
F	shame they couldn ' t keep up with facebook .. wonder where it went wrong ?
F	!
F	actually wonderful !
F	ordered a star for a friend who got it on time , a month later they delivered another , 0 months later another , 0 months later another until she had 0_stars !!!!!
F	!
F	they ' d not charged me , and when i told them they apologised and told me to throw_away the extra ones .. not that she did .
F	next time i ' m ordering a ferrari !
F	these people are simply geniuses !
F	my daughter had lots of bears , but never one she specifically loved ... she got one from here and because of the process where she made him , she never leaves anywhere without him !!!!!
F	it ' s amazing ... he ' s now off to get a girlfriend after xmas , is getting_married in march , will have a baby on her_birthday and the life of this bear goes on !
F	not to mention his furniture !!!!
F	!
F	they never have codes i want , when they do they ' re out of date
F	they used to be the place to go to if you wanted a last_minute holiday .... but now they ' re just as , if not more_expensive than a travel_agent .
F	total_waste of time .
F	limited hotels etc too !
F	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room Â£_00 cheaper elsewhere ... luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
F	it ' s a great concept .. but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
F	which is why they set_up and their whole marketing campaign .
F	now they don ' t really offer any discount .
F	i use it to search hotels in the area ...
F	i have found better discounts on other_sites ...
F	it also has limited hotels and b_& b ' s ... considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
F	they should accept everyone and go back to offering discounted rooms .
F	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort .... rang phone line ... they said i wasn ' t entitled ... someone , somewhere isn ' t very familiar with their products and services !
F	very disappointing
F	good company and customer_service ... but don ' t always add on your voucher from previous 00_% shop guarantee
F	substituted an alcoholic beverage for one of a lesser quality , which if i ' d of bought elsewhere would have been Â£ 0 cheaper ... told me i could take it back to the store , which considering i was having a party and the order turned_up 0 hour before was totally un realistic .
F	offered no compensation , said he would inform the store and that was it !
F	never ordering from them again
F	shipping can be delayed ... which is frustrating .
F	cs don ' t know a great deal .
F	pestered me for 00p when i ' d set_up direct_debit which they accidentally cancelled - damaging my credit score !
F	said they would give me Â£_00 as compensation , and didn ' t !
F	not impressed ...
F	i placed my order and within 00_hours they have sent me the email with the code i needed .
F	it ran_smoothly and i got just what i was looking for .
F	purchased my christmas cards again from goodprint - nice quality , easy to use website - quick delivery !
F	!
F	we have used the underfloorheatingstore now on three occasions and can not fault this company !!.
F	placing the order is simple , the emails and communication excellent and very speedy next_day delivery .
F	the products have been of a high_quality and very competitive in price .
F	i have already passed on the details to a friend and will be back for sure !
F	thank_you !!
F	!
F	we ordered a tap from you and immediately got an_email to say the order was being progressed , another to say the tap was in dispatch and then on its way and the item is fabulous !- thank_you - we will shop again !
F	after much research we launched our new website with visualsoft in august_0000 and we haven ' t looked back .
F	visualsoft are true experts in this field .
F	the design team are full of inventive and creative ideas , marketing is focussed and driven and all of the help and support that is available is unsurpassable .
F	the build process was thoroughly enjoyable and visualsoft made it stress_free - nothing was too much to ask .
F	the website itself has enabled us to increase our profits considerably compared to our previous site .
F	one of the joys of working with visualsoft is their passion for new ideas and concepts ; our old website was stagnant but with visualsoft on - side we are trying new ideas regularly which boost our sales and online presence .
F	i feel_confident that visualsoft wouldn ' t let our site fall behind the times which can be a daunting task when the world of technology moves at such a fast pace .
F	don ' t hesitate to work with this company .
F	chillisauce helped as to plan an amazing hen_do .
F	it ' s a knockout - the best thing ever !
F	so much fun ... laughs all_round !
F	accomodation - average but for one night it was ok .
F	they provided a nice breakfast in the morning .
F	q jump and guestlist @ oceana - all organised and fancy_dress was allowed .
F	i had a technical problem with a fresh wordpress installation and after having difficulty working out where the problem was i put in a support ticket .
F	i was really impressed that when i logged on about an_hour later , not only did my ticket have a response , the problem had also been fixed .
F	i feel reassured that if i have a more serious issue in future that the support system is fast , friendly and effective .
F	ordered an aftershave arrived quickly and was the best price i had found would decently buy from there again
F	we were so pleased with our invites , such a brilliant company .
F	had a small issue with a couple of reply cards missing and wedding_invitations sorted within a few_days and sent me out extras such brilliant customer_services .
F	would recommend to everyone .
F	thank_you again :)
F	my husband and i have been using zleeps for some time now and we â re really happy with the service we get .
F	we started off with a mattress topper and have since moved on to a divan bed and a king_size mattress which has been just great .
F	david , my husband , suffers from really bad joint pain and he really feels this has been improved since sleeping on the memory_foam mattress .
F	it was a really great price too .
F	we had seen a similar model mattress in a local_store for double the price we paid with no real difference that could be seen .
F	brilliant !
F	would recommend zleeps time and time again .
F	we were looking for an seo company in bristol and was so glad to find freelance seo bristol .
F	we had no_idea where to start .
F	now we â re experiencing more traffic than ever before and we â re looking_forward to starting up a twitter campaign and adding a blog to our website .
F	don â t know how our business would have done without this help , but we â re certainly experiencing some great sales figures right now !
F	really well_organized , helped_us out when there were cancellations and made the weekend less hassle for all .
F	hi just bought scooter from this company . fantastic service , good value and really helpfull will be using again
F	ordered makeup brushes and they were cheaper_than in stores which was great .
F	it was delivered in two days and postage was free .
F	would definitely order again .
F	from this advice :
F	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a Â£_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
F	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off_peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a Â£_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
F	to this :
F	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
F	where you would change the ticket you have to a refundable ticket ( which you would need to buy )."
F	had finished a phone call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus Â£_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of Â£_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
F	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound journey dates had been changed .
F	ongoing .
F	i love everything for Â£ 0 it is excellent first i was unsure but as i have been buying i am impressed expressly with the shoes
F	i am very satisfied with the order money and how long it had taken to get to me
F	living in ireland , i am always looking for sites based close to home so i don ' t have to wait weeks for delivery : i ordered a wacom intuos0 tablet , and got a great deal - the tablet was even cheaper_than ordering directly from the wacom site .
F	with the money i saved , i covered shipping ( which is a handy flat_rate ) and extra insurance for the product .
F	after my order was dispatched , i recieved an_email telling_me my package would arrive between the 00th and the 00th of january - it arrived on the 00th completely intact and pristine .
F	i would definitely order from pixmania again .
F	booked return transfers in bratislava , well what can i say 0 star service from booking transfers to being picked_up by very friendly staff .
F	drivers were friendly , smartly dressed and arrived on time .
F	would definitely use again and recommend to friends .
F	my partner and i had a fancy_dress party to go to so we picked out two costumes and paid extra for next_day delivery .
F	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
F	after ages spent trying to get their " customer_service " on the phone i was instructed the product ordered was not in stock ( thanks for letting us know !)
F	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
F	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
F	however the next_day having arrived and you guessed it no costume .
F	below par service on every_single principle a business should be run !
F	my advice ?
F	avoid !
F	highly impressed with not only the professional way my ( multiple !)
F	queries were dealt_with but also the finished_product - my banner and stand look excellent and at such a bargain price !
F	will 000_% use kituout again - thanks !
F	my friend and i booked this hostel due to its high rating and it has exceeded my expectations .
F	sparkling clean , huge rooms and lots of space , and staff willing to help in a cancelled bank card crisis !
F	we love it so much we have booked an extra night for the end of our stay .
F	trustworthy .
F	fast delivery .
F	good product .
F	this way of hiring is brilliant , they call u back to confirm ur driving_licence details then u collect the vehicle !
F	collecting is easy !
F	definitely worth use and worth the money , cutting out t middle men is always good !
F	would use again in the future !
F	this was a great company to use , flowers were lovely and made the perfect gift .
F	paid extra to get delivery before 0pm .
F	would defiantly use again !
F	very happy with the service of refurb_phone .
F	handset arrived quickly and is in great condition as_described .
F	would use again
F	great service with super_fast delivery .
F	couldn ' t be_happier with my rucksack .
F	would definitely choose to use this company again .
F	fantastic service , speedy_delivery and goods arrive in perfect_condition .
F	definitely worth the discount and saves you money !
F	very comfortable durable sofas
F	this is an excellent alternative service for those sellers that are motivated to sell their own property .
F	housenetwork ' s online ticketing_system , process and methodology meant that the whole_process was efficiently managed , from viewings , feedback and follow_up through to completion .
F	i had a direct line to my adviser , ashley elley , who was very accessible / responsive , friendly and proactive .
F	when called upon , he gave good advice on tricky situations .
F	i was able to fit in more viewings than a high_street agent would and so was able to sell my property in half the time it took similar properties that went with a high_street estate_agent ( who are juggling 00 - 00 properties in their portfolio a week ).
F	i will never use a high_st agent again .
F	the ones that came to do a ' valuation ' were expensive , often misleading / tried to pull the wool over my eyes and did not have as good a knowledge of my property / block as me .
F	they didn ' t have my best interests at heart and would have cost me Â£ 0 - 0k for their ' service '.
F	online_estate_agents are the way forward
F	a bit_pricey but you get what you pay for and then some , so well worth it for me .
F	i was looking for a hassle_free way and i found this website i have purchased an unlock for my brother ' s iphone0g and one for my iphone0 .
F	the phones have been updated plenty of times to the latest firmwares and are still unlocked and being enjoyed .
F	i currently got a hold of an iphone0s from a friend and purchased an unlock for it i can ' t wait for the unlock .
F	we as a family have enjoyed the holidays we have gone on with blue chip .
F	this is a stand out company .
F	samples received within less_than 00_hours with no postage cost and the tile order was delivered as planned on a pallet by a driver who phoned to tell me what time he would be there .
F	i didn ' t deal with tile mountain on the phone , but i didn ' t need to .
F	my builder was impressed with the price of the tiles as well .
F	i would definitely use tile mountain again and have already_recommended them to other people .
F	i have to say that the service i received from the support_team was faultless .
F	quick , clear and helpful replies , even if just to say they received my response and were escalating it to the appropriate team .
F	best customer_service experience i ' ve had in a long while .
F	thanks !
F	lets be honest after ordering my ring i did spend a few works wondering_whether or not the site was going to disappear and my money also .
F	i had nothing to fear !
F	the ring and the delivery were just as exceptional as the help i received from the site in choosing the all important engagement_ring .
F	i would recommend this site to anyone !
F	great savings and great advice .
F	i will be coming_back for the wedding_bands :)
F	thanks
F	as with others , i ordered the big_boy beanbag on 0th_november as a christmas_present for my daughter , delivery date of week 00 which has just been put back until week 0 !
F	furious .
F	very bad service !
F	i love how lighthearted and fun truffleshuffle are , they even put a sweetie in with my order !
F	thanks wolverine :)
F	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
F	all_round excellent service .
F	would recommend to everyone
F	the item i ordered arrived quickly and was at a fantastic price compared to other online companies i looked at .
F	would definitely_recommend using facewest .
F	the stay was pleasurable from start to finish .
F	it was brilliant .
F	we were greeted_by lovely friendly staff who constantly offered us help , advice and a good time .
F	i also wasn ' t aware of their new 00_mins free wi_-_fi which was the cherry on top .
F	comfortable beds , friendly staff and good food .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	quick to help and are very friendly and helpful and will stand no nonsense .
F	rose really helped_me .
F	thank_you !
F	i found menkind brilliant to order from .
F	they have unique products for good
F	prices .
F	their deliveries are very fast and well_packed .
F	would absolutely recommend .
F	i love topcashback .
F	it is an excellent website and it ' s definitely a must to go through for online buys .
F	also , when i ' ve had to have customer support the service has been friendly and very helpful .
F	all_round excellence !
F	ordered ghd ' s yesterday , arrived today .
F	low price .
F	great service :-)
F	i filled in the form online .
F	then in the post 0 days_later my pack arrived .
F	all the information was very easy and popped in old phone posted it at the post_office on the friday got my money on the tuesday .
F	was really good just wish had a few more old_phones to send off lol .
F	went in to kit out my daughter for brownies and camp , staff were very friendly and prices were very reasonable
F	i walked in and was greeted_by a sales man who showed me the car i was looking for , i had an instant test_drive , my car was absolutely lovely , i bought it there and then and arranged to collect a few_days_later !!
F	job_done !
F	fabulous service and my car is great
F	x
F	you can find everything on google , i get free advertising on google , there is hardly anything i do not use google for on the internet , love love love it "!
F	the website is really easy to use and find what you need , many different options .
F	i like that in the map_feature you can see the prices of the places as well , which you can ' t on some other_sites .
F	i just wish they had an app so i could take them with me easier when i went away !
F	the school itself was good .
F	staff was well prepared .
F	managing team also organized after - class activities and some parties .
F	i recognize this schools as a great place to become a professional bartender .
F	however personally i found some drawbacks : firstly , it ' s way too expensive given the fact that the school is set_up in phuket , thailand ; secondly , learning tools such as flairing bottle and starting bartender ' s kit was ridiculously_expensive ( it ' s possible to get all the stuff online more_than twice cheaper !!!
F	); thirdly , student were not allowed to practice flairing with school equipment and were forced to get flairing bottles from school .
F	wherever we travel we always book with hostelbookers .
F	there ' s no booking_fee , it ' s easy to book or cancel .
F	we traveled around_europe , south_east asia and we have just booked our first accommodation in cuba .
F	i feel_safe to book the rooms as there ' s everything i want to know : reviews , pictures , maps and what is provided .
F	the booking is really easy and if we want to stay closer to the center then just click on the map option .
F	would definitely_recommend the site to everyone .
F	safe trips and sweet dreams !
F	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd january and didn ' t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
F	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
F	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren ' t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
F	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
F	bought rainsuits for my husband and 0 brother in laws .
F	used discount_code so got them even cheaper .
F	we were all impressed with the quality especially at such a low price , will_definately use again
F	contacted parcel 0 go on serveral occassions for help and emily was the only one who clearly explained and helped_me to resolve my issue !!
F	cant_complain !
F	top service :-)
F	just amazed that i could arrange a delivery at 00 . 00pm on a saturday_night and receive goods the next_day .
F	very cool .
F	really good service .
F	arranged a time for the morning , 0 : 00 to 00 :_00am .
F	matt turned_up at 0 :_00am !
F	he was very friendly and polite .
F	had one tyre changed , was pretty quick .
F	the price was a lot cheaper_than the garages that i had tried .
F	i was very impressed and would recommend them to friends and family .
F	thanks !
F	so far from very , on three different occasions
F	i cannot complain_about a thing and would recommend henheaven to anyone .... infact i have already_recommended to a few friends currently planning hen doos !
F	all straight_forward , good price and fantastic , helpful and quick response customer_service !
F	thank_you .
F	i decided to book with these after getting a number of quotes from others .
F	the quote i got from jay was personal unlike the others i received .
F	i called jay and he was very helpful in giving me ideas on how to plan the hen_weekend i was arranging .
F	i couldn ' t believe they only wanted Â£_00 deposit for the lot of us ( 00 ).
F	i went with his suggestion and couldn ' t fault how the weekend flowed .
F	nottingham was great , the hotel was central and a short walk to the naked male drawing class .
F	this was hilarious , liz loved her photo opportunity with the naked model !
F	we then got changed and had cocktail_making and party boards in vodka rev .
F	james made us all laugh and made liz the centre of attention .
F	after 0 cocktails and quite a few more drinks , i can ' t remember much else , but we all slept well and managed to have some breakfast in the morning .
F	i ' ll be booking again with funktion next year when my sis plans our best friends hen_do .
F	really glad i found this website - easy booking and great prices .
F	also has helpful reviews .
F	just wanted to say thank_you so much for my furniture .
F	arrived exactly when told , packed very well and looks perfect !
F	would definately_recommend to family / friends , or anyone who is reading this review .
F	000_% satisfaction and will be back soon !
F	thanks oakland furniture
F	i tried din dins superfood for dogs after a friend_recommended it .
F	i was already feeding my dog mimi a combination of raw food and nature ' s menu ( in an ideal world i ' d feed her the barf diet however she seems to agree better with a bit of rice in with her meat .
F	she doesn ' t absorb as well if she doesn ' t have the bulk mixed in and bones seem to go right through her !)
F	so , mimi is already pretty healthy .
F	but i did notice after a few weeks of supplementing her diet with din dins her sometimes slightly smelly breath had improved and her coat was even more glossy .
F	mimi sometimes has slightly thinning patches of hair behind her ears , these have also improved no end !
F	an excellent product , i would and do recommend to all dog owners !
F	secure and easy site to pay bills or buy what you want on
F	love it for christmas and birthdays
F	facebook what can i say .... staying connected .... playing games .... getting to see photos of close friends or family ... love it
F	love how you can ask it a question and it answers you
F	what can i say i have to pay my bills
F	love yahoo .... when my husband deploys this is how we stay connected and how our lil angel gets to see her daddy
F	great site to get anything you want
F	we have a saying in our house when something is dis agreed upon .... google it !!
F	!
F	you can find directions .... answers to random questions ... music .... videos .... health questions or answers .... its better_than having a book infront of you !!!
F	i love it
F	has anything you could wish for ... seriously amazing site ... if you get screwed over .... ebay will back up you on your payment and re fund you so it completely safe to buy !
F	all the free_samples to help you find the items right for you and the price of all the products ... love this site
F	easy to use design studio and a good range to choose from .
F	products were made and delivered quickly .
F	when they arrived i was extremely impressed with the quality of the product and the printing .
F	would definitely use again and recommend to anybody .
F	thank_you .
F	item arrived extremely fast and was very well_packaged .
F	thank_you ever so much :-).
F	great deal too :-)
F	no_problems with products .
F	however , somehow the company can go to the post_office to deliver goods to mainland_uk , but not to northern_ireland ?!?
F	please get out of the dark ages !
F	!
F	purchased some decorations for my engagement party and received the products the following_day , even_though we didnt select express delivery !
F	was very happy with my purchases and the speed of the service was brilliant !
F	it ' s really a good site
F	ordered big bertha bean_bag , delivery arrived 0 - 0 weeks as stated , with informed delivery and 0 hour time_slot helped .
F	bean_bag is wonderful , beans come seperate but its easy to pour beans into the bag , zip it up , very comfy , very pleased
F	ordered my bean_bag on 0nd nov , was told 0 weeks delivery , then go pushed to week 00 and now pushed to week 0 , now at the end of week 0 another nothing has arrived ...
F	tried_emailing , no replied , no phone number to actually talk to anyone !
F	waiting 0 months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
F	will never buy from infurn again and am telling the world not to buy either
F	so impressed with glasses_direct from the free home_trial to the super_fast delivery and excellent prices .
F	would recommend to anyone .
F	very fast service and easy to order .
F	used them a couple of times , first for me to buy a snugg case which came extremely quickly and was great quality .
F	dropped my ipad a couple of days ago and not a scratch !
F	really get the quality you pay for .
F	then used them again to buy the ipod_nano watch strap for my brother and the kindle case for my mum and once again i was not dissapointed .
F	great service and products , the quality is top grade !!
F	!
F	avoid using orange !
F	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .
F	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
F	bad_experience do not use orange !!
F	!
F	easy to navigate , would use again
F	first time customer , i ordered a toilet pan and basin and fixings , however the basin was out of stock and wouldn ' t be in until the 0th_august .
F	i am doing full bathroom renovation and going on holiday at the end of august so could not wait on the basin coming into stock as i had to arrange plumber etc and it wouldn ' t leave me enough time to complete before holiday
F	promptly called customer_service and cancelled full order due to out of stock item , lady very helpful and said will pass on to accounts to refund .
F	0 dys later , no confirmation of refund , customers services say its not instant and can ' t tell me when it will be done
F	they are very quick t take payment but i am now Â£_000 . 00 out of pocket and cannot get them to refund this anytime_soon .
F	very close to calling my bank and telling them the situation and its not authorised transaction and the police also as its now fraud for keeping my money ...
F	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again ....
F	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
F	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
F	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
F	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
F	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
F	this means that nothing has been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
F	very frustrating !
F	i ordered a nextbase 0 click n go from 0wisemonkeys recently .
F	ordering online was quick and simple and confirmation sent quickly .
F	i was also sent an_email on the day of delivery advising me of the time_slot it would be delivered in enabling me to plan my day without having to wait in for the delivery .
F	the descriptions on the website of the various portable dvd players provided detailed_information that helped_us choose the best product for us .
F	excellent service , i would recommend 0wisemonkeys to others and use them again myself in future .
F	unacceptable service .
F	waiting on refund for a suit which cost Â£_000 .
F	emailed over three times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or inclination to look_into or deal with my query .
F	just basically states it takes 00 days to issue a refund and i should contact them after this time period if not received .
F	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
F	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
F	i do not understand how other stores refund within a matter of days and retain good communication with their customers other than topman is holding_onto my money to gain interest on it !
F	warning to all avoid topman !
F	!
F	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
F	all items arrived incredibly fast & well_packed ( they always do ; d ), and the 0 . 0l bottle of soy sauce i ordered on this occasion was not in stock .
F	so i was sent 0x 0l bottles instead for which i was charged no extra .
F	< 0
F	i ' ve used hostelbookers a few_times now and recommended them to friends and have never had or heard of a bad_experience .
F	take for example my first booking , which i ended_up having to change ... twice !
F	hostelbookers ( and the hostels themselves ) made everything so easy and were so accommodating , i couldn ' t ask for more .
F	thanks !
F	supplement_warehouse always has the best deals !
F	i used to order from other_companies online but since i started ordering from supplement_warehouse i never shop anywhere_else !
F	they have great prices and fast_shipping !
F	when my friend told me about this site , i couldn ' t believe that it is possible to have such a high_quality item for 0 quid ..
F	i bought many items from this site , but just recently i received a skirt which was too small and called them up and got through a very polite gentleman who gave me the best help i ' ve ever received from a company .
F	keep up the fantastic work !
F	ps more bags please !!
F	!
F	joined this site last_week and placed hundreds of bids and never won anything .
F	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
F	i often go to this site to check if a new tv programme or a film is worth watching .
F	very reliable as the feedback is by other_users of the site so it is very geniune .
F	it has not let me down yet :)
F	not very reliable at all
F	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
F	very deceptive .
F	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
F	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
F	some of the items that where delivered where damaged like the eggs and the yoguart .
F	they also have a restriction on mineral water bottles , they are very mean .
F	superb site in my opinion .
F	great for news and weather as well as for iplayer .
F	i enjoy catching up on my favourite tv & radio 0 shows that i have missed .
F	excellent for listening to the radio 0 whilst you do the housework .
F	i saved 00_% buying from ebay on a digital_camera that i wanted for holiday .
F	it is good but you have to be_careful here and not buy from anyone that has no or poor feedback .
F	i really like buying items on this site for my son .
F	the layout of the site is good it is so user_friendly and i love looking at the user feedbacks as they are the ultimate guide for me to buy an item .
F	best place to buy for kids .
F	delivery process is also problem free .
F	ordered a book on thursday it arrived on monday .
F	easy to order and hassle_free .
F	cheaper_than buying from a bookshop i saved Â£ 0 . 00 .
F	i love the price_matching option .
F	i have ordered from here many_times and will_continue to do so .
F	i have been using the products for years and have had many great results .
F	the shipping timeframe is fast and its always a treat to find the product ( s ) waiting for me in the mail .
F	this is a company i can count on when timing is crucial and money is tight .
F	awesome !!!!
F	!
F	the prices are cheapest i ' v found and you can also add free_samples to your_cart , so you ' ll be able to know how different stuff works and makes you feel , which is a great thing since some fat_burners give you different feelings and its best to try them 0st ... great way to try before you buy !
F	happy with goods and service

F	i have been ordering supplements online for a long time , but just recently found supplementwarehouse . com .
F	i am impressed with their huge_selection of products , as well as their price_match guarantee !!!
F	this is a great site , and i will_definitely return :)
F	i found this company online through a link posted on facebook and i am glad i did find it as the website and customer_service is excellent , i could not possibly think of one fault for the customer_service or the website .
F	the delivery is very fast - i ordered the incorrect size with one item , it was returned to freestylextreme on the monday , i received an_email on the tuesday saying the return was received and a further email on wednesday to say the bigger size had been posted - brilliant !
F	love that i can find a large range of clothing and brands that i could not find in the uk before finding this website and the prices are good also which is a bonus .
F	i have recommended to friends and family and will certainly be placing an order again in the near_future .
F	thanks to all at freestylextreme !
F	!
F	ordered a christmas_tree on friday 0nd november , i had carefully read the terms on the website before placing my order and it clearly said that the tree would be sent the next working day or if there was any delays that i would be notified by phone or email .
F	i waited until the following_tuesday ( 0th_nov ) to call the company , they told me that the tree was out of stock and that it would be back in stock and would be out to me within the week .
F	to cut a really long_story short , i called them again another two times to be told there had been further delays and that the product would be sent out to me soon .
F	by the 00rd november i was sick of waiting and being ' fobbed_off ' with excuses and i cancelled the order after three_weeks of waiting .
F	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
F	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
F	i have never received such a bad service from an on - line company and will certainly be avoiding them in the future !
F	i booked a spa overnight stay at carden park for may 0000 .
F	paid Â£_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
F	no mention of a refund initially .
F	i called following_day and asked for a refund .
F	00 days_later , still no refund .
F	i had even called lastminute . com 0 mins before the online booking and confirmed that there were 0 rooms available at the venue .
F	yet , in those 0 mins , all 0 rooms had sold out ( 00 :_00am !!!)
F	i spoke to hayley , sharday and another rude woman .
F	all said i needed to wait 00 days for it to be processed .
F	then i discover that they had not bothered to put refund through as they couldn ' t refund back onto america express .
F	no phone call in 00 days to say this .
F	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
F	i call and they tell me that it is processed and will take 00_hours , even_though i have waited long enough already .
F	i get a call from hayley five mins later , she took down my card_details incorrectly and refund never been done even thoughh girl 0 mins earlier said it had already gone though , eventually after 00 days , i get my refund of Â£_000 back after 0 phone_calls , shocking customer_service from girls who couldn ' t care less about helping me , one kept putting me on hold so she didn ' t have to listen to me !!
F	!
F	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn ' t exist .
F	dodgy company , would never use again .
F	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
F	huge discount and quick delivery .
F	fantastic service , the company phoned me yesterday to say they would b dispatching my tickets that afternoon and i received them this morning , will_defo b using this company again , :) ill b back in touch for titp and pink tickets , thankyou guys xxxxx
F	very easy and cheap !
F	!
F	really quick delivery .
F	everything very straight_forward and product perfect !
F	would definitely_recommend and use again .
F	just had my final module of the level 0 teaching assistant diploma assessed and am so happy just waiting for the qualification certificate now .
F	i would recommend ncc to everybody .
F	i only started the diploma in october and have loved every minute .
F	the units are well written and easy to understand and the tutor - ray rew ... has given some great valuable feedback
F	good service and delivery from chemist_direct on time .
F	i brought the alli product from here and it does exactly_what it claims .
F	it is a good tool to help with weight_loss because of the help in the pack with diet advice .
F	follow the advice and you won ' t get any nasty effects ..
F	i also liked the range of products out here and the prices too are reasonable , at_least lower_than what i buy at my chemist store .
F	recommended to shop here .
F	i was over the moon that i managed to find some amazing bargains from fragrance_direct .
F	their great prices meant that i could get all of the things that i needed without spending an arm and a leg .
F	it ' s such a fantastic place to find some real gems and from now on , will somewhere that i regularly shop .
F	well worth being facebook friends for flash offers .
F	delivery of items is fast and efficient .
F	one of my favourite online shopping experiences .
F	i had used viagogo last_year to buy lady_gaga tickets .
F	0 days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn ' t provide the tickets .
F	the day before replacement tickets were sourced .
F	stressful but okay .
F	have now booked p ! nk tickets for manchester 00 / 00 / 00 and with 0 days to go it has happened again but this time they have not responded about replacement tickets .
F	i have sent 0 further messages with no contact and am so worried that the hotel rooms and 0x train tickets are going to be a waste of money , on top of the extortionate price of the tickets already purchased .
F	will never use again and would suggest others stay well clear !
F	trans id_0000000

F	after much research into different companies that buy laptops , i ended_up choosing syl because they provided the best quote for my 0 year_old macbook .
F	in fact , i was pleasantly_surprised by how much they were willing to offer - almost seemed to good to be true !
F	their response time was quick and professional and even when my quote had expired due to unforeseen_circumstances , they were willing to honour it with no_hassles .
F	i was paid promptly into my account too .
F	from start to finish , i found the whole_process simple and straightforward and i really_appreciated that they were so efficient with their communication .
F	i would definitely_recommend using syl and i would happily use their services again .
F	many_thanks syl , from a very satisfied customer !
F	i purchased a beanie through the site and it was with me the next_day !
F	awesome , fast and efficient service !
F	best site for real girls out there with a love and passion for all things runique and extreme !
F	they have the lowest_prices out there and if you find a cheaper price they will match it !
F	fast_shipping and a very easy website to navigate .
F	they have a product for any person looking to improve their health in any way .
F	i would highly suggest using this web_site for all of your nutritional_needs !
F	the website has always delivered .
F	it has always helped_me find the right hostel for my various trips .
F	i wanted a toy box for all of my little ones christmas_presents .
F	this one was the best value i could find .
F	i was kept_informed of when the toy box would be delivered and given an_hour_slot .
F	it arrived in this time_slot .
F	toy box was easy to assemble , looks lovely and holds more_than you ' d think !
F	i emailed mytuxedo to enquire_about one of their products and recieved a reply the next_day which was very useful .
F	i then ordered some cravats , handkies and a waistcoat and they came 0 days_later , even_though i only used standard delivery .
F	products were of high_quality and perfect !
F	i stumbled_across this site while looking for some salon style hair products .
F	i ' d never_heard if it before and was slightly wary but decided to give them a try .
F	the website looks professional , prices and delivery is competitive too .
F	would definitely use again for my hair products .
F	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .
F	living_social refused to refund or credit account .
F	definitely do not use this company , i certainly will not use again .
F	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
F	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay Â£_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
F	they are also threatening to charge delivery even_though they did not deliver .
F	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
F	use another company , be warned .
F	i have now waited almost 0 weeks on an_email advising when i will receive my refund .
F	i ' ve taken legal_advice and am patiently awaiting their response to my requests both on email and telephoned .
F	i ordered a bed from styleourhome , i had to call the company a few_times and they were always friendly and helpful and would even phone back if i missed their call .
F	good prices & good website also .
F	this site was quick and simple to use .
F	the prices very good and competitive with other hotel search and book sites .
F	i ordered some flowers online and they got delivered the next_day !
F	flowers were beautiful and the text messaging service to keep you up to date with the order was exceptional !
F	defo ordering with serenata_flowers again .
F	janet :-)
F	buy rabbit products - fibreplex and panacur regularly for my large_amount of rabbits ( 00 and counting ) and it always arrives in a timely_fashion and is soooo much cheaper_than other_places .
F	especially vets surgerys .
F	can not recommend this company enough
F	ordered my map after using a groupon_voucher and it arrived well_packaged and quickly .
F	it was " flat packed " and simple to put_together and once made it was very sturdy .
F	i have received several compliments on the map with people asking where i purchased it .
F	i really want the dinosaur one next
F	we love our new basin - its stillk in the box while we decorate the rest but it already looks pretty .
F	arrived on time and well_packaged .
F	and was much cheaper_than elsewhere
F	i paid for express delivery on an order from amazon , and the seller has chosen to send the parcel with yodel .
F	tracking shows it has been at my local_depot , 0 mile from the delivery address , since 0th_feb .
F	it then shows ' delivery not attempted ' for several days ( i . e .
F	couldnt be bothered ), followed_by a ' weather delay ' ( weather here is fine ), then 0 x ' delivery attempted , could not gain_access '.
F	delivery is to my work place , their first ' no access ' was due to attempting to deliver at 0pm ( not in business hours despite company name being clearly indicated ), the second was 0 . 00pm and i know they didn ' t try as i was covering the reception desk at the front of the building all afternoon and no vehicles came into our car_park !
F	!
F	their ' live_chat ' has been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we ' ll get it there when we can '.
F	no definite answers , no sincere apology and no compensation / gesture of goodwill offered .
F	shocking customer_service .
F	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
F	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn ' t unfortunately ).
F	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt_like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn ' t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
F	when i finally got assistance to order , i had to explain the item ' s specification to the assistant ( for example , she asked what colour i wanted , it only comes in one colour ).
F	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0 weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
F	i was assured i would be contacted to discuss the delivery , which i paid Â£_00 for due to my order being in their higher value bracket .
F	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i ' d had no contact from them at all .
F	the manager rang me back promptly within the hour , and apologised saying he would contact the warehouse and find out , then call me the next_day .
F	he didn ' t .
F	i left it 0 days then called to be told he was not working .
F	the assistant told me she could get my delivery to me 0 days_later on thursday ( the end of week 0 ).
F	i explained that this was not convenient , as i had discussed with the manager before .
F	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
F	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i ' m not great at diy or lifting ).
F	to top it all off , i had a call from my parents which is my previous address ( which they took for credit check purposes ) to say fv have left 0 incomplete voicemails on their phone - i don ' t live there , i only have a mobile and i don ' t know how they got the number or why they feel the need to ring it !
F	!
F	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
F	fingers_crossed it gets delivered at some point , with all the parts , undamaged and assembled correctly .
F	may be too much to ask .
F	booked a one night stay in a city hotel in the uk for 0 people .
F	very reasonable and hotel was lovely , posh considering it worked out cheaper_than the neighbouring travelodge .
F	it was easy to book online , i paid a deposit amount to suit me , got confirmation emails , accommodation vouchers and the rest of the payment was taken on the date agreed , no_fuss .
F	on arrival at the hotel ( around 0 months after booking , and around 0pm ), the receptionist informed us that alpharooms had not forwarded our requests on for neighbouring rooms , and had not told them that we had booked for 0 people in one room ( one triple and two doubles ).
F	apparently they did not offer triple rooms - despite the alpharooms website offering this and allowing me to book this .
F	as such we had to wait 00_minutes whilst they found suitable rooms for us , and we ended_up being 0 floors apart_from each other .
F	if alpharooms had communicated better with the hotel , we could have at_least been on the same floor , and our rooms would have been ready .
F	they had 0 months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it ' s not as if it was last_minute .
F	i won ' t be booking with alpharooms again unless i just need one room for 0 - 0 people .
F	very speedy service , i posted the phone on the tuesday and the money was in my account by the wednesday with follow_up e_- mails straight_away .
F	excellent service , will use again !
F	i ' ve ordered multiple_times from ziip , always received codes within an_hour and working perfectly .
F	however i feel a true judge of a company is how the deal with things when it does go_wrong .
F	i received a code that according to origin had already been used .
F	i received a reply to my first email within 00_minutes informing_me of the situation ( as the error was the fault of ea and not ziip ).
F	i have now received a working code along with a transcript of the contact with ea and a heartfelt apology .
F	it ' s so nice to speak to someone that actually cares_about their customers , and i will most definitely continue to use ziip and recommend them to anyone i know who games !
F	we had some special requests off the typical deliverables and those high up at atom00 went the extra_mile to help our junior team .
F	much_appreciated and fully recommended !
F	i waited nearly an_hour , listening to the most annoying music , especially when the loop played the songs for a second and third time .
F	when i finally spoke to someone the department i needed had had gone home !
F	they said they would phone back .
F	they didn ' t .
F	i waited , listening to the same looped music for 00_minutes to be told nothing had been logged from my previous call .
F	they assured me someone would call back in three days .
F	that was six days ago !
F	i ' m going to have to call them back , that ' s three hours of my life i ' ll never get back !
F	i received my acrylic and overlay course in quick time .
F	happy with everything that came in the box . i finished my course and sent it back .
F	i passed my course with a credit .
F	really happy to me starting my matance course after christmas :)
F	fast_shipping , great prices , tons of free_samples ... what could be better .
F	great website with a great range of not only american sweets but other countries too which was a nice surprise !
F	arrived quickly and well_packaged - in a decent sized box so nothing was squashed .
F	will use again !
F	always something different to try .
F	this website made planning and booking my trip to scotland ( from alaska ) hassle_free .
F	i am confident of where i am staying , that i will be safe , clean and that i paid a fair price .
F	i will certainly use this site again .
F	great customer_service and the best signal in the uk
F	absolutely fabulous !
F	friday , 0 september_0000 - lauren rating :
F	i ordered 0 fascinators they were for my best friends wedding , for the bridesmaids .... they arrived in super_fast_shipping time and easy transaction !
F	the fascinators were a hit and looked awesome with our hair !
F	will_definitely be a returning customer !
F	i ' ve shopped alot at argos for many years , my mother used to say that i kept them in business .
F	however , this has always been in the actual store .
F	my sister has made her first order with their home delivery service , which is still ongoing as they keep delaying her delivery .
F	she ordered two items with them , both listed as in stock .
F	a week_later ( and three days before the scheduled delivery ), they called and said they were having problems with the suppliers ( i . e .
F	one , or both , of the items were not actually in stock ).
F	she , unhappily , rescheduled the delivery for ten_days_later .
F	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
F	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
F	this may seem like a minor inconvenience to some , but my sister has just moved_into a new home and needs these items .
F	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
F	so that ' s how argos is effecting her financially .
F	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
F	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
F	claiming that you have an item in stock and available for purchase is selling under misinformation .
F	furthermore , agreeing to dates and being unable to meet these agreements abuses the contract to which the consumer agreed in purchasing these good .
F	they have offered to refund the Â£ 0 . 00 delivery cost , which doesn ' t come close to the amount that she has had to pay because of their incompetence , never mind the inconveniences and sufferings of her and her two children .
F	she was actually warned by friends beforehand not to use this service as they had experience problems , but thought that based on our in - store experience , argos was a trustworthy company .
F	i have since heard from other friends that they have had similar grievances .
F	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
F	don ' t risk it .
F	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can ' t submit this without giving it one .
F	i have ordered several things from bondara , never with any trouble .
F	items always as_described , fast delivery and great prices .
F	will_continue to shop here and continue to recommend to people .
F	everytime i order something i love it and it always looks good .
F	total bargain .
F	but there is one downfall , the bulk buyers who then sell on ebay at triple the price .
F	you really need to limit things per customer .
F	i have been a customer with o0 since march of this year .
F	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0 weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn ' t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
F	now 0 weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
F	after spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
F	i was basically told to like it or lump it there was nothing that they were willing to do to help me .
F	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn ' t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
F	i have emailed o0 a complaint and it will be reviewed within 00 days but i don ' t expect their reply will resolve the situation i ' m in .
F	i do not value their customer_relations much after this experience .
F	once more my parcel was delivered to the wrong_address if a delivery man dont know difference_between flats and house it is hard to expect good service .
F	once more i had to appologise to my neighbours who has got same door number as me as i felt quilty knocking to their doors and begging for a parcel .
F	i will avoid post_office at any cost and i will pay extra for a different company
F	ordered a junior tennis racquet for my son .
F	website was simple to use , i understood which tennis racquet best suited his age and the delivery was super_quick .
F	many_thanks .
F	great value , fast and free delivery .
F	excellent .
F	great price , great product , speedy service .
F	please avoid this company at all costs !
F	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
F	it was also the first order that i placed - on 0 december and only after chasing my order did i receive an_email_saying that it was ' despatched ' on 00 december !
F	still nothing !
F	i have researched this company and can only add to the hundreds of claims that they are thieving fraudsters !
F	i have contacted my bank and am looking to get my credit_card recharged - i will also be contacting the police and do my utmost to get this company rubbed through all_kinds of dirt .
F	i have used mazuma twice now and have always found them to be quick , efficient and easy to use .
F	the site is well set out and finding your handset model with accompanying price they will pay is easy .
F	they send full instructions on how to remove all your personal data from the individual handset before sending it back to them .
F	the freepost_envelope arrives quickly as does the cheque once you ' ve sent them your phone .. there is even a choice of ways to be paid .
F	really great company , would definitely use again and recommend !
F	!
F	love shopping online ?
F	then you will absolutely love topcashback !
F	it is so easy , quick paying and i ' ve earnt hundreds of pounds for a few seconds and couple of extra clicks !
F	join today :)
F	does exactly as promised .
F	excellent service , would happily_recommend .
F	fridge_freezer is perfect
F	deliver guy was prompt and helpful
F	i have ordered beef dishes last_week from that takeaway , timely delivery with good food .
F	worthable for money .
F	sw has the best deals on protein foods and other supplements i ' ve found anywhere .
F	i don ' t even bother shopping elsewhere anymore , although sometimes i compare sw ' s prices to others ' just to make me feel extra good about how much money i ' m saving !
F	my orders always arrive on my doorstep in a shockingly speedy turnaround time ; they must literally ship out the items the very second i hit the confirm purchase button online !
F	the one time i spoke with customer_service , my concerns were immediately addressed and instantly resolved , no problem .
F	sw has definitely earned a loyal_customer in me !
F	no printable e_- tickets for the gig i am going to and my name put on a list of attendees .
F	was told to print my receipt and show my bank card as proof .
F	its a really dodgy practice and unnerved me from wanting to buy tickets although when buying tickets it said e_- tickets would be available
F	ordered products and got free delivery , all delivered well within their quoted time !
F	there is above beyond what you ' re looking for with such a fantastic range of products !
F	love this company and will use them every time in the future .
F	returned an item to very and received the refund immediately .
F	impressive in my standards .
F	although i won ' t be ordering from very again because they are contracted with yodel of whom are a terrible delivery company .
F	accidently let it run over an extra month .
F	would not let me have a refund for this mistake .
F	some lovely daylight_robbery
F	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
F	this parcel was very important ( an_alternative wedding dress from very ).
F	i sat all morning staring_at my front_door with my dog sat at the window ready to shout to tell me the man was at the door .
F	my dog didn ' t bark and there wasn ' t a knock .
F	i checked the tracking at 00 . 00 supposedly they had tried to deliver and left a card .
F	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
F	so i rang the depot and she rang the driver , who told her that he had run out of cards but did knock .
F	my dog was confused is this man invisible ?
F	she then went on to say she checked the drivers tracker ( in his body ?
F	i live in a lane he can ' t drive down .)
F	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i ' m the one who is lying .
F	my dog licked the frustrated tears from my face ( having real wedding dress problems ) and patted my knee .
F	she told me the driver will be back by two .
F	i ' m sat in the window myself now and waiting for the apperence of this driver .
F	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
F	if this is the type of service i can expect i will not be using them again which means i will avoid very . co . uk .
F	feckers
F	later that day .
F	the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 and knocked this time , my dog barked and went mental to get a stroke from the visitor .
F	alas i put him in the kitchen .
F	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
F	" oh i knocked but there wasn ' t an answer and i didn ' t have any cards left ".
F	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
F	the barking is answer enough for me .
F	there needs to be a negative star system put in place .
F	or better yet get watchdog involved or whoever it is that handles bad practice !
F	i am very thankful for the detailed instructions and quick service .
F	i would like to fully recommend the provider for its professionalism !
F	good communication , wonderful customer_service , quick delivery .
F	my husband was very happy with his glasses .
F	will_definitely use them again !
F	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
F	i sent two emails but received no reply .
F	they claimed i was out and there was no one to sign for the package , however it said on the website my package hadn ' t even of left the depot station .
F	the next_day i receive a text_saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn ' t arrived .
F	this company is a joke , i don ' t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer_service is non_existent .
F	edit
F	i am still_waiting for my package which was meant to arrive 0 hours ago , the gps tracker for the van said it was 00_minutes away around an_hour ago , now when i go to track the van the map has disappeared .
F	i also can ' t ring anyone to see where my package is .
F	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
F	quickly delivered would order again , products were as stated .
F	yeh .
F	i am in a state of utter stress because of my move at the moment !
F	i had an urgent query , that seemed a hopeless case to me , but i thought i ' d try the live_chat help anyway .
F	and bang , a lovely person called gemma was there , immediately cheering me up by being really friendly and putting smileys etc !!
F	and what i thought was a hopeless request , was transformed into something that might actually work out now by her as well !!
F	top_marks for gemma !!
F	efficient , quick , helpful , friendly , positive !!
F	really refreshing to have a person that ' s working in customer_services who seems to actually enjoy her job for once !!
F	:))
F	thanks gemma , and i am praying for everything to work out at my pickup tomorrow !
F	let ' s hope , your great help helped !!
F	;))
F	i found this great gift for my friends 00st birthday ( silver dominoes set in engraved case ) this was great as most websites only sell engraved beer glasses , tankards , hip flasks etc and as my friend does not drink these weren ' t really suitable .
F	i missed my delivery and we emailed in and got a reply within 00_minutes advising they would get in touch with the courier .
F	we managed to pick_up our order the same day .
F	i couldn ' t wait to open it !
F	the gift is perfect and the quality of the engraving was better_than_expected .
F	i will_definitely use this website again .
F	the only_downside was that the box it came in is very dented which is a shame as it would have been nice to wrap the present in the box but it is not a big problem and i know things probably get knocked around a bit in the delivery process .
F	very user_friendly , easy to compare accommodation and find the one that is right for you .
F	pictures , ratings , maps , directions and reviews help customers to review information and make an informed selection .
F	fantastic price and fast delivery , thanks !
F	i could not have asked for a more beautiful present !
F	it is better_than what i expected it to be .
F	a huge thank_you !
F	!
F	i ordered the very last item and instantly got email_updates to confirm it had been ordered , dispatched etc .
F	it arrived_safely and i would not hesitate to use facewest again .
F	my only problem is i wish i could have bought more but thats my fault for spotting the bargain so late !
F	!
F	i was very nervous ordeing dresses online but i am glad i took the leap .
F	i researched the company with the us better business bureau and ordered .
F	i got shoes , a veil and the dress i wanted for less_than the price that boutiques in my area were charging .
F	i also ordered two bridesmaid gowns .
F	everything arrived as ordered and it came early .
F	great store
F	no issues with my booking .
F	would definitely use the site again .
F	information and details of the hostel were exactly like the description online .
F	have sold over 0 , 000 items on ebay with the majority being sent by royal_mail .
F	i have now received all the items i have ordered and all bar two of my sold items have arrived with the buyer in a timely_manner .
F	royal_mail are the best unless you are willing to pay for a courier .
F	when you transfer funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0 days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
F	its pure greed that it takes this long because they suck up as much interest with your money as they can .
F	will avoid paypal an even co ' s associated with them from now on .
F	always helpful and friendly .
F	normally 00hrs delivery .
F	they also have a great replacement and service guarantee ... what more could you ask ?
F	if gak dont stock it , i dont bother !
F	moved to talktalk because of very high charges only to find talktalk are just as expensive but the service they provide is appalling .
F	internet is sooo slow , it just stops working many_times during the day and at night cant even watch a 0 min video without constant buffering .
F	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off ... every time !
F	just waiting for the contract to end so i can get_rid .
F	i ' ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
F	i ' ve paid more_than 000pounds for them , and waited for delivery .
F	day later ive received a phone call with information that tyres i ' ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
F	they informed me that they could suply me with different one but almost same specification and price .
F	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
F	but when tyres arrived , ive check them on internet and found the same almost 00 pound cheaper per tyre .
F	feeling cheated .
F	will not complain as leaving uk on saturady and need those tyres .
F	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
F	but if there is no tires available in stock , they should inform about that on website , not jusk ask you to pay for what they haven ' t actually got .
F	after entering a relationship with a born and bred birmingham local , i knew that we would never go to a high_street shop because of the quality of the ' jewelry quarter ' that had been used by so many generations before us .
F	their website is very user_friendly with good quality images and interactivity to see a 000 degree view of their rings .
F	they also offer information on different aspects of jewelry such as ' carats ' and all other terms , a very useful aspect for non - researched people like us !
F	obviously we looked at other shops , and thought about visiting them on the day when we went to look for rings .
F	however , as soon as we were welcomed into the shop and greeted with nothing but the best service that i have ever received , we knew that we were never going to go anywhere_else .
F	we were served by sara that day , who was the most understanding person i have ever met .
F	being a young couple , ( 00 and 00 at the time !)
F	sara was incredibly_helpful and did not judge us on our circumstances , something of which had happened in a high_street store .
F	she was not pushy at all when i was looking at the rings , explaining everything in an easy to understand manner , and being very honest in what she thought was the most suited to my hands etc , regardless of the price .
F	after a short while once i had chosen my particular engagement_ring , she offered us a very good price and wished us all the best with everything , creating a very personal experience , and ending on a high note .
F	something of which i will never forget .
F	a few_months down the line , we have decided to purchase a wedding_band for myself ready for the big day when we eventually get round to it !
F	my fiancee has made many phone_calls to the shop , being presented again , with second to none customer_service .
F	when we entered the shop we were again greeted like old friends in a professional_manner , even_though there were other potential_customers at the counters .
F	this time round we were served by margaret , whom , like sara , was so welcoming and friendly , and was incredibly_helpful during the whole_process of choosing a wedding_band , and showed an incredible amount of knowledge on the subject .
F	i told her the sort of things i was thinking about having and she immediately sought out a selection which were perfect !
F	( during this time , sara , from when we bought my engagement_ring , came and greeted us , making us feel very welcome to be back .)
F	a few weeks after that , my fiancee wanted to get his granddad ' s ring resized ( a very delicate subject ) which was dealt_with very easily in store .
F	we again saw margaret , and she was very helpful during the process , offering him different_ways in which the ring could be re - shaped ( it was going down from a t to an l , 0 sizes in total !)
F	she again , was not pushy in the process , and was very understanding and helpful during this time .
F	the whole_process was completed in store , by a gentleman who had 00 years experience in marlows alone !
F	so we were in very good hands .
F	overall , marlows have been incredible with everything that we have needed from them , offering us the best prices , and the best quality for money .
F	their customer_service is incredible , something of which makes every visit a pleasure , and every time we went back they always remembered us and created a completely_different experience to what you would expect anywhere_else .
F	thank_you marlows , for being the best around , and being a pleasure to purchase from !
F	all our best ,
F	emma and rob x
F	bing , bang , pow and my booking was done .
F	cheap rooms , ideals locations and easy to use website .
F	i would totally use hostel_bookers again .
F	i bought quite a lot of wowchers already and i have to say i really love the page .
F	great deals and very easy to order and to browse through the website .
F	once i contacted the wowcher customer_service because i didn ' t get a reply from on of their companies and the lady helped_me straight_away , although it took quite a long time on the phone .
F	i always recommend wowcher to my friends because the deals are amazing and i ' ve never been disappointed so far .
F	:)
F	thanks wowcher !
F	the service is great , i ordered on the monday and my item had been delivered by the wednesday with free postage . the website is very easy to use and is really clear , would recomend incrystal to all my friends and family and will be definatly be using incrystal in the future .
F	this site is excellent !
F	my iphone was unlock in just a few hours !
F	very trustworthy , reliable , and so worth it !
F	thank_you , thank_you !
F	:) i definitely_recommend !!!!
F	!
F	i can_honestly say that the team at top click media have been a complete pleasure to work with .
F	from the initial project scoping to the delivery of our new site , everything has been delivered seamlessly .
F	i will without_doubt work with them again , and wholeheartedly_recommend them to all of contacts .
F	spoke woth natalie on livechat as i booked a parcel , then realised i had to go out .
F	natalie was wonderful and told me i could rebook or if i felt it was safe enough along with other t &_c ' s , i could leave it in my porch for the dfriver to collect .
F	thank_you natalie :-)
F	i used a search_engine and fragrance_direct came up with the best deal on what i wanted to buy .
F	great value and no hassle .
F	i received emails to keep_track of my order and it arrived super_fast .
F	will_definitely use site again and highly_recommend !
F	i ' ve been a sky customer for over 0 years .
F	in that time i have moved_house and had a few minor technical_issues .
F	every_single time i have called sky i have been helped by a very friendly and competent advisor and i honestly could not fault them .
F	i constantly recommend them to friends .
F	recently i have been trying to reduce my bills in general and was offered a phone / tv / broadband package with another well - known company .
F	i called this other company to simply confirm my ' go live ' date .
F	after just under an_hour on the phone ( a combination of being put on hold and transferred to no less_than 0 different ' advisors ') they hung_up on me .
F	i called again and the same_thing happened .
F	enraged at this point i then called sky ...
F	what a difference !
F	i did have to hold for a short while before being greeted_by a wonderfully helpful advisor .
F	i explained my situation with money struggles and she looked into my account and managed to upgrade my package and reduce my bill .
F	i was over the moon - not just about the price reduction but that she had taken the time to listen and made me feel_like a valued customer instead of a faceless account number .
F	i work in a call_centre myself and know how hard the job can be and how much abuse advisors are given .
F	i am really impressed with the service i have received at sky .
F	i can see from other reviews that not everyone agrees but i wanted to give my opinion because i know how often people manage to find time to complain , but it is much rarer for people to show appreciation for a job well_done .
F	so thank_you sky .
F	thank_you for having such wonderful call_centre operators .
F	yes the prices are not the most competitive but do you know what ?
F	i would much rather pay a bit extra and receive the excellent service i have come to expect over so long .
F	great prices and excellent service will_definitely be using this site again !
F	!
F	from the form i had to fill in , to the arrival of the payment , the service was faultless .
F	very quick and easy and extremely prompt responses to any_queries .
F	i used to buy meat from my supermarket !
F	no more !!!!
F	never realised just how tasteless the meat is i have always bought !
F	gorgeous cumberland sausages ... amazing steaks , beautiful steak burgers , westin_gourmet all the way for me now !
F	delivered perfectly packaged , exactly when said i would !
F	cannot_fault a thing about my order ...
F	nothing !
F	i only used to have meat every so often , favouring vegetarian dishes over meat ( i ' m not vegetarian !)
F	but i am now a fully fledged carnivore again !
F	:-) even my children commented on how much_nicer their chicken was and they didn ' t even know i had bought different !
F	that says it all for me !
F	westin_gourmet are proud of their meat ..... and so they darn well should be !!!!!
F	;-)
F	it ' s really easy to understand how to make a reservation and there ' s no extra fee .
F	the way of looking at the reviews it ' s really nice .
F	i ordered last_minute robbie_williams tickets yesterday ( tuesday ) @ 00pm they arrived this morning to be signed for at 0 . 00am !!
F	! faultless service easy to use website and payment system and superfast delivery .
F	i received a birthday treat of free delivery so used it to purchase the sexond set of dixit cards .
F	so easy to do and arrived in time for my hubby ' s birthday .
F	we have had lots of fun playing the game with the new cards and can ' t wait to get the next set !
F	great service as always !
F	whenever i am having problem my apartment blocks , they always help , are always on time and are cheapest and best .
F	call them .
F	i have tried all other_companies , but must use for this one famous distinguish service .
F	highly_recommend this site if looking for airport_parking best site by_far .
F	supplement_warehouse has excellent prices on products .
F	they are very quick to ship your order out which is something i value as a costumer .
F	if you are close enough to their warehouse to visit , the staff is always very helpful and friendly .
F	i also love the price_match option .
F	that guarantees you are always getting the best price .
F	keep up the good work !
F	would defo_recommend jojo ' s , really fast delivery and the 0 items i ordered were of great quality .
F	fast ordering_process , free delivery with a next_day delivery & even an_hour time_slot !
F	will_definitely use as my main dog_food supplier from now on .
F	this is the second time i have traded items into ziffit and the experience is fantastic in comparison to some of the big market leaders .
F	within a couple of days ziffit had accepted my order and had started the process of sending payment .
F	fantastic really happy , i will be back a third time !
F	!
F	second purchase from animed .
F	really great service .
F	i will_definitely make a third purchase !
F	i bought a brand_new fridge_freezer in december , the fridge_freezer had an odd smell when it arrived but this was just put down to be being new .
F	after a couple of months the smell was getting worse and the fridge started making very loud noises , so phoned through to currys .
F	the first engineer was sent out , acknowledged the smell , but could not find where it was coming from .
F	since this point hotpoint have sent out a further 0 engineers , all whom found similar things .
F	at this point the office of fair_trading got involved , and a letter was sent recorded_delivery to currys , this was signed for at the address but not response was ever received .
F	an independent engineer found that the fridge is faulty and needs completely replacing .
F	currys have now received the fridge but feel it appropriate that after 0 months + of issues , that it will take at_least a further week to upload the report which was sent from one of there stores .
F	so after around 0 months , numerous phone_calls ( all made from us to them ) i am still left with a fridge_freezer that doesn ' t work !
F	:(
F	i would never shop at , or recommend currys to friends or family or even my worst_enemy it has been absolutely_terrible !
F	slight problem with product , was expecting to spend ages trying to get it sorted and probably end up with no result .
F	printerbasics were very quick to respond to my email , very helpful , and fully honoured their no - quibble guarantee .
F	best customer_service i ' ve encountered in ages .
F	i felt_compelled to write this review after_reading so many negative ones .
F	i ordered a pair of ugg austrailia classic boots 0 days ago using a 00_%_off promtional code that i found on a money saving website .
F	i got the uggs for Â£_000 which is a massive saving compared to the rrp of Â£_000 .
F	i selected to have free standard delivery by yodel which is estimated to take up to 0 working_days from when the order is shipped .
F	after i ordered my uggs i had a look through some of the reviews some of which were really bad , i thought ' what have i done ' and spent the next few_days meticulously checking the yodel tracker service to see where my order was up to .
F	i received my ugg_boots 0 days after ordering them , they are fab and i cannot_fault the service i have received from rubbersole . co . uk or yodel , and i know i couldn ' t have got the same genuine product for less anywhere_else .
F	i have used hqhair for several years now - i would never think of using any other site for my beauty needs .
F	it stocks a wide_range of quality brands and always provides a super_quick and efficient service .
F	i would whole heartedly recommend !
F	i ' ve used zavvi quite a lot and im never disappointed , everything has been delivered quickly and on time .
F	the one time i had a problem they sorted it fast and efficiently .
F	i would and do recommend ordering from zavvi .
F	i found the prices were really fair didnt think i would get anything for my phones , and the pack and cheque were sent really fast .
F	i couldnt fault them on there service or how easy the website was to use .
F	the website is extremely userfriendly and the cart doesn ' t delete ever , so i can work in the courage to hit the proceed to check out button over some time .
F	the contact center worked very well on all the three times i used it .
F	also there are always plenty of deals and the emails they send me are mostly interesting and with tailored deals .
F	i found this website through an article in a nationwide new_zealand newspaper , so i knew it could probably be trusted , but i had no_idea how easy and great hostelbookers is to use !
F	i love that it tells you if the availability of beds is getting on the scarce side , and love reading reviews etc .
F	i just booked a hostel for a birthday stay in cardiff , and am now looking at some in vegas for new years .
F	will_definitely be booking through hostelbookers again !
F	!
F	i have now had two orders and been delighted with both .
F	delivery and packaging first_class .
F	would recommend most highly .
F	i would recommend julesb to anyone .
F	my boots arrived , beautifully_packaged and it was so quick .
F	the game i ordered arrived quickly with no_problems and was a far better price than on any other site i looked at .
F	i was delighted to receive my order so quickly but was most impressed by the value .
F	after scouring various websites for the best deals on my preferred cat_food i have yet to find any as low priced as pet_supermarket .
F	no_problems with delivery , received ok and lovely delivery driver .
F	would use again .
F	really quick delivery , easy to use and make an invitation and brillant quality .
F	shopped_around online for a rug retailer and came_across the rug house as they were highly visible in search rankings .
F	huge_selection of rugs , all organised into categories for easy shopping .
F	good pictures and descriptions , which helped my purchase decision even_though i was overall unsure_about the wisdom of purchasing a rug online as we were going for quite a large one for the living_room .
F	normally i would have liked to touch / feel / see a purchase like this in store but despite browsing the usual high - street stores online , i didn ' t find anything close enough to what i was looking for .
F	pricing on rug house is great too , and they do many more synthetic options than the high_street stores , which i preferred as wool irritates my nose .
F	contacted customer_service to ask for some guidance prior to purchasing , and received prompt responses .
F	rug dispatched reasonably quick after purchase and delivered in good shape .
F	happy with the item and would buy again if i ever needed another rug !
F	first time i tried to get_rid of a broken laptop this way .
F	quotation process was straightforward via technologyplanet .
F	i requested quotes from 0 other_companies at the same time but the others were ' automated ' responses whilst tp sent me a ' proper ' email - refreshing , for a change !
F	mainly for this reason , i went with tp and followed the instructions clearly provided in the email on how to send the laptop over to them .
F	my only tiny gripe was i couldn ' t find any post_office selling a packaging box for Â£ 0 ( it was more like Â£ 0 ), so i think it would be better if this price wasn ' t listed as a guide .
F	i was only able to post my laptop off a week before_christmas , so expected to wait a bit before receiving any response .
F	however , when i emailed mr henderson just to check if the laptop arrived , he was still quick to update me with a status .
F	throughout the process , he was prompt at communicating , despite the long festive holiday .
F	i opted for payment via_bacs and was updated via_email when this was done .
F	all in all , pretty straightforward process and i ' m_glad we had the option to sell our broken laptop as_opposed to chucking it in the landfill , which would have been more hassle and less rewarding !
F	i ' ve used this service a few_times .
F	never had a problem at hostels i booked on arrival , the site is easy to navigate and has all the pertinent necessary_information i look for when choosing a hostel .
F	rates are the cheapest i ' ve found , and booking is a piece of cake !
F	i recommend it over other hostel reservation sites to my family and friends .
F	keep up the great work !
F	txtnation ' s services and support are excellent .
F	the future of marketing is going global and txtnation have the systems to help my campaigns run both smoothly and lucratively .
F	thanks !
F	laura wilson
F	an excellent service , did the job
F	nicole was amazing from the moment we started our live_chat !
F	she found the soultion to my problem quickly and changed my order without any_problems !
F	she was very polite and i felt completly at ease talking to her !
F	i was skeptical when i realised it was only a live_chat , but this has completly changed my mind .
F	thank_you nicole your cutsomer service was fantastic !
F	i really can ' t rate them high enough .
F	the have great customer_service who let you know al the way along the order and delivery process .
F	the daisy glider chair is of superior quality and very sturdy and durable .
F	super easy to put_together since the instructions are so clear , and really comfortable and supportive to sit on .
F	perfect for mums and mums to be and will even last for comfort as your children grow .
F	fast at getting payment .
F	everything done as and when it should have been
F	the wooden toy shop really are a great company .
F	delivery was fast and customer_service was excellent .
F	i love the fact that all the products are wooden and so are very long_lasting .
F	the bigjigs town and country train set is fantastic and comes with a big track and lots of accessories which my son loved .
F	their facebook_page is also a great place to join for great reviews , customer_service and giveaways .
F	i cannot_fault them at all and will_definitely be buying again in the future
F	love the target deals , but i don ' t love the organization of the site .
F	if a dress comes in 0 colors , why do i need to search for each entry separately ?
F	why can ' t i see all options at once ?
F	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it ...
F	since moving overseas , skype has been the key to staying in touch with family and friends stateside .
F	i love that i can use it as a substitute for text messaging ( huge_savings there !
F	), on my phone like it ' s a normal phone call , or on the computer to see everyone " in person ."
F	such a lifesaver !
F	my daughter sent her i phone 0 after being given a valuation of Â£_000 .
F	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to Â£_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
F	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
F	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
F	i was told phone wasnt working when it got to them .
F	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
F	they wouldnt let me speak to a manager , wouldnt give full names as their " not allowed ".
F	miracuously a supervisor appeared but was no help .
F	i am contacting bbc_watchdog and daily mail for help
F	i had an 0gb iphone_0gs that was a little battered on the outside and scratched but mazuma_mobile said that if it was in full working order , could turn on and off etc then i would receive Â£_000 and i did !
F	before this i had it valued with envirofone . com who , because of the damaged outside , offered me Â£_00 , no thank_you .
F	mazuma_mobile are great !
F	my mother was very happy with the flowers and i was very happy with your service .
F	thank_you
F	nadine rawlins
F	the site is amazing there is always something for everyone and great prices also
F	fantatsic company i booked a collection 0am through p0g with tnt the collected same day 0pm service with a smile great rates and great service i will only ever use parcel0go now beats the rest by_far
F	i think it ' s easiest to explain_why i have awarded seven seas one star by pasting my complaint letter here .
F	i never received a reply from them .
F	" it is now the 00th_september , 00 days after my box was collected by you to be shipped from china to the uk , and i have still not received it nor heard_anything from you about its progress .
F	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
F	using seven seas has certainly not been a simple_task .
F	firstly , i did not receive any message_telling_me what time the driver would deliver the empty boxes to me and after several phone_calls it appeared the driver had got my address wrong .
F	secondly , once my box had been collected on the 0th_july i heard_nothing from you to say how much i should pay you , and it was not until i had emailed you twice that i finally got my invoice emailed to me .
F	it was dated the 0th_july , however , i did not receive it until the 00th_july , almost two_weeks after the collection date , causing my payment to be delayed .
F	i subsequently emailed you to say that i was expecting my box to arrive in the uk within 00 days from the 0th_july , otherwise this would cause a huge inconvenience to me .
F	you then assured me that my box was to arrive in the uk on the 00th of august and i was then to allow up to two_weeks for customs .
F	two_weeks has already passed now and i still have no_idea where my box is .
F	i consider the service you have provided to be very poor and completely_unacceptable .
F	i am expecting compensation from you due to the reasons i have highlighted above .
F	i will certainly not be using your company again in the future ."
F	fantastic service , ordered in the evening delivered free by lunch time the next_day .
F	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
F	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
F	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
F	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final destination being 00km from my mums home .
F	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
F	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across_europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
F	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn ' t .
F	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
F	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
F	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer_service number to ring .
F	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same_thing again !
F	this person was polite unlike everyone_else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
F	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
F	so after contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
F	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0 weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
F	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
F	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
F	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across_europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
F	i would like my Â£_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer_service is appalling and unfair .
F	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
F	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
F	i ordered some flowers for my mum today for mothers_day and i am more_than happy with the condition the package turned_up in .
F	my mum absolutely loves the too .
F	i will be using the company again
F	everything was explained clearly , with as much care and attendion to details to make the whole transaction go smoothly .
F	from the moment i logged on , to the moment i got the money for my phone , each section was eplained , worked well and very understandable .
F	it was also a swift service , which was great !
F	!
F	jobs a good ' un !
F	postage envolope came day after ordering , payment in my bank 0 days after , even with xmas . emails to kept me updated .
F	overall great sevice would always recommend , will deff use again .
F	ive been on o0 for as long as i can remember and it has just got better and better providing me with personalised rewards and chances to win things .
F	i can get the benefit form dressni . com .
F	and i believe you can get benefit there too .
F	i have booked numerous hostels now for my interrailing trip and it couldn ' t have been easier !
F	the site is easy to navigate , you can see how central a hostel is and how it is rated by others !
F	also always the lowest_prices , lower_than hostel_world :)
F	i orderd my items a bit late as i had a last_minute party booking and needed supplies , so i chose the next_day delivery option but ordered after 00 . 00 which ment i had to wait_until the day after as deliveries have to be processed before 00 . 00 ... and then put my party date on the order too as requested .
F	they obviously saw the date and felt it would be helpfull to send them earlier for me , and they were delivered to me next_day !
F	thank_you partyrama , it helped out alot and the function flowed alot better thanks to you !
F	:)
F	shara smith
F	west sussex .
F	excellent service and very quick turn_around james and oliver both very professional , would definitely use watchfinder again .
F	jade
F	liverpool
F	love it ... items always as_described , always fast delivery and always more_than happy with the cost !
F	only_suggestion ; we need a missguided app for iphone !!
F	i would definitely prob spend more on missguided if it was an easily_accessible app !
F	it ' s quite hard to see the items quickly and clearly on the desktop website when your on the iphone .
F	easy to order on - line , next_day delivery , reasonable prices .
F	i have asked several_times about the elimis tri - enzyme resurfacing serums ( there is more_than one since i have 0 different kinds ) and i either get told there is only the one or that there are 0 .
F	while the 0 is great , i still don ' t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
F	it seems that the people in customer_service don ' t either .
F	otherwise i love the product .
F	just wish i could find what i ' m looking for .
F	it was so fast and easy and not to mention it has a huge_selection of different hostels , hotels , apartments and so on to choose from !
F	will_definitely book with hostelbookers . com again !
F	first time i ' d bought specs online and was reassuring to be able to speak to someone on the phone to check some of details in my order .
F	glasses arrived within 0 days .
F	the site was so easy to view and look at all the different hostels and laid_out in a way you find what you want straight_away .
F	would use again , for sure !
F	we werent very happy with the flight , is a good price at the beginning but then it comes all the extras ..
F	very expensive , they even charge for their headphones adaptor Â£ 0 is a rip_off !
F	we went to mexico , so flight of 00_hours you need a lot if food to buy then .. we did get the menu but it wasnt enough .
F	i paid for my seats as extra aswell and they said i didnt ( even_tho i checked my bank_account and they took it ), the lady at the airport so rude pushing and very insistent and that i didnt .. so i didnt get the seats i was 000_% sure i booked (Â£ 00 lost there ) i want my money back from that !
F	the worst was that they charge you Â£_00 per_person on your way out from the airport to come back !
F	it has to be in mexican pesos , cash , no receipts , they take your itinerary before you leave .
F	this sounds_like a scam !!!
F	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
F	i spoke to the " secretaria de turismo " ( tourist board ) and they dont even know what i was talking_about !
F	total scam .
F	hotel was ok but after evaluating and compering , the package wasnt cheap as we thought it was .
F	we end up speanding an extra Â£_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue ...
F	i will never book another holiday with them .
F	i booked a car in cancun airport with sixt and nobody showed up to pick me up , they have no office in the actual airport .
F	afterr 0 hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
F	rentalcars . com or traveljigsaw which is the same , didnt give me a refund for not giving me the service , thats stealling !
F	they charge me full_amount and after 0 months im still trying to get my money back !
F	the dispute still on , but i will never ever rent a car from this company again .
F	they suck .. save_yourself from this nightmare .
F	i found this site a number of years_ago as i was tired of paying airport premiums .
F	the site works by people subscribing to offer their parking space to people who need to park their car , so correspondence is in the hands of the subscribers .
F	luckily my contact was great .
F	simple to book and check availability and a bargain price .
F	happy to leave my car in a safe location , looked after and paying a small price .
F	i hope this site grows into a popular choice for travellers .
F	bargain holidays from independent travel_agents promoting great holiday packages are great prices .
F	don ' t dismiss this site - i ' ve been on numerous holidays through this site with no_problems at all .
F	it ' s just a very easy site to use to search for good priced holidays .
F	absolutely unacceptable customer_service delivered through 0 of the leeds based stores .
F	it seems in store staff are untrained ????
F	when speaking to customers you should be sympathetic to their needs and not simply patronise customers for not understanding something .
F	i would definitely never recommend halford stores in leeds for anything to do with cycles !!!
F	shocking customer_service and extremley poor support from the head_office too !
F	what a great find - i bought unlimited_broadband from be there for just Â£ 0 . 00 a month in 0000 .
F	it since rised in cost but due to loyalty , was awarded the original price for a further 0 months .
F	never had a service outaged , it never seems to peak to cause any trouble and the after sales and customer_service team are brilliant .
F	i deal with the online_chat facility and get things sorted instantly - for instance the deal above .
F	i ' d recommend to anyone .
F	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
F	i then got an_email_saying that i had to send my order through email and i had to explain to them what i wanted , as the design wouldn ' t work for some bizarre reason .
F	i first ordered a medium top , and it turned_out to be a size 0 !!
F	when on the store it said a medium was 00 / 00 .
F	i then worte to them , complaining and they offered to send me one in a larger_size .
F	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
F	!
F	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
F	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!
F	!
F	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was Â£_000 in total so i took Â£_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a Â£_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
F	when i called the customer_service department the operator made me feel_like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .
F	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay Â£_000 to make up the full bill so Â£_000_+ Â£_000 = Â£_000 an extra Â£_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
F	i felt_like an_idiot so i didn ' t ask the girls for anymore money so have forked out the extra Â£_00 myself .
F	i booked through booking . com because it worked out Â£ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
F	boohoo is an amazing website with awesome clothes and the customer_service is great !
F	thanks boohoo !
F	â¥
F	this company needs to get their act_together , i ' ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
F	they can ' t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
F	the next evening still no parcel , rang again !
F	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
F	( at 0pm !!!)
F	they told me they will call back , no one called so rang again now the 0th time .
F	some useless customer_service lady tells_me the package was not scanned .
F	i told her i ' ve been tracking this package over a week and it said each time scanned how can she tell me it ' s not scanned ?
F	and their status kept changing untruthfully saying i said .
F	told me there isn ' t nothing i could do or nothing she could do .
F	i have to call the sender .
F	i told her it is friday_evening the sender must be close until monday .
F	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
F	i a rude tone .
F	i just hang_up it didn ' t make sense keep talking to that useless woman .
F	i found their customer_service very poor and ignorant .
F	i ' ve cried so hard .
F	i can ' t believe_how they treat their customers .
F	never send nothing with them .
F	i don ' t recommend this company what so ever !
F	i shop a lot online and this company is the worst company i ' ve dealt_with .
F	but experience well learnt .
F	please avoid them at all cost !
F	i was surprised how quickly everything went through - placed the request in the afternoon one day - the next_day the bag to send it back came through the post - the following_day i received an e_- mail confirming they had the phones & the following_day after that the cheque was posted through my letter_box !
F	brilliant , would recommend to everyone !
F	!
F	great on - line help from sarah_hayes at parcels to go , she dealt_with the problems i was having booking my collection quickly and efficiently .
F	for everyday essentials and amenities , tesco has it all ( nearly ) and the price is usually cheap and good value for money .
F	it is like having a local corner shop but one that sells anything and everything and if you like window shopping it ' s always an interesting experience to pop down to the local tesco and just browse through all the aisles of stuff they have from homewares to outdoor camping_gear and diy .
F	i appreciate there are other dedicated stores for these types of products , but having it so local is convenient and it doesn ' t fee like a chore to go out of your way to find those products .
F	then you have your groceries and it goes without saying that tesco is on top of its game in that respect too - but i do like to vary my shopping between tesco and morrisons for groceries .
F	if you love shopping , superstoresearch . com is your friend - it is one of my favourite shopping sites because you can buy virtually anything through that site and because it shows you the prices from other_retailers , both from the high_street and online only stores , you know that the information is impartial and there to give you the best deal regardless of who is selling it the cheapest .
F	i also found the buying guides to be really helpful because they are concise , well_laid_out and get straight to the point - which is just what i need when i ' m in a hurry and need some advice on buying something like a new washing_machine ( i don ' t want to read a phd thesis !)
F	and you can see the ' trends ' list in each category to know which brands are most_popular and although i do agree that popularity doesn ' t always equal better , but it can be a general guide to know which washing_machine brand is hot so you can investigate it further to see what all the hype is about .
F	overall this is one of the best shopping sites , i can spend hours on there and not realize the time fly by .
F	what keeps me coming_back the most however is the ' bargains of the day ' section because you can really see some big savings like 00_%_off and they are just too good to pass by - great for shopping but watch out if you have an addiction because this will just fuel it further .
F	absolutely_brilliant .
F	very reasonable quote , no_fuss at all .
F	packaging came promptly and all i had to do was put my phone in the box and post it .
F	money was in my bank three days_later .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	this is the first time i ' ve actually bothered to review an online shopping website !
F	but thats because it was awesome !
F	bought my idc crew pack from these_guys .
F	ordered it thursday_night .
F	received monday_morning .
F	contained everything , wrapped up nicely .
F	very impressed .
F	( won ' t lie , was very worried at spending 000 quid on the pack from a ' random ' website .
F	i tend to use amazon !)
F	so damn good job watersports warehouse !
F	and thank_you :)
F	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
F	thoroughly distgusted .
F	it was a quick and easy to use website , with good pricing .
F	i will use again ...
F	i regularly use viovet because their prices are the most competitive , their check - out is fast and easy , and delivery is free with most orders and is usually next_day .
F	any_problems i ' ve had ( with the courier , not viovet ) have been dealt_with quickly and efficiently by the customer_service team .
F	am sure they ' ll continue to be my first choice pet_food supplier .
F	efficient would certainly buy from again very quick delivery and certainly well_packaged highly_recommend
F	very trustworthy and thorough would highly_recommend service next_day delivery as promised with out any complications or problems thanks
F	honest through efficient and trustworthy next_day deliver would start recommending to my family thanks
F	very very nice customer care team i made a minor mistake in questionnaire and it was solved with 0 minutes and reminded what to do next time when ordering very punctual ad package arrived immediately before 0pm on tuesday as i ordered on the weekend thank_you so much :)
F	i couldn ' t find a better pharmacy than this it has helped_me a great deal in fast timing no judgement precise in medical questionnaire when my medication arrived i couldn ' t get over the packaging they did everything to prevent it being damaged or tampered in transit i would certainly highly_recommend this pharmacy it very much legitimate thank_you so much for the wonderful experience and confidence to re - order my prescription well_done i higkh applaud them :)
F	i must_say this company has never ever let me down .
F	dispatch time was quick and delivery in less_than 0 days to ie very impressive updated me all the way .
F	i can ' t say a bad thing about this company .
F	prices are reasonable would continue to buy from them :) thank_you
F	well_packaged item updated each way on status on items ordered would most definatly buy again thank_you :)
F	sevice was quick was updated each time product was dispatched was quick in deliver my boots were as_described very comfortable and excellent quality would certainly buy again from everything Â£ 0 thanks so much
F	johnny walker blue label with personalised engraved message on the bottle .
F	i had expected this product to be good , but the quality that arrived surpassed these expectations .
F	a fantastic gift , quickly dispatched , for the discerning whiskey drinker .
F	one stop_shop for all those little pet gadgets i ' d been meaning to buy for a while .
F	not only that but competitively_priced with prompt dispatch and delivery .
F	i can ' t fault the service .
F	printerland always deliver an excellent service .
F	prices are competetive and delivery is always prompt .
F	i would highly_reccommend printerland to anyone .
F	i have taken prince0 coure from e_- careers and it was just great .
F	the " lectures " are clear and very understandable , you can review them and listen as many_times as you need .
F	i would deffinitely recommend it to everyone .
F	customer_service is top_class as well .
F	i did speak to them few time on their chat and i never had to wait for longer_than few seconds .
F	kathy who is customer relationship executive was also very helpful .
F	i did have few questions_regarding my course and certificate and she helped_me immidiately .
F	more people like this !
F	im also thinking about taking another course from e_- careers .
F	very glad we used housenetwork as our estate_agents , because of it being online it is affordable , but you would think the communication would be less but it wasn ' t , we were given our own advisor with a direct line who always took our calls and did above and beyond her job we feel . my advisor at housenetwork felt the frustration on my side with the sale of our property and for our buyers , on both_sides things were moving extremely slowly , kayleigh helped with chasing up phonecalls to both_sides of solicitors and helping me out on a regular sometimes daily_basis to get things moving for us before the purchase of our new home came into trouble .
F	i would definitely use housenetwork again and i would recommend them immediately on anyway asking me .
F	angela .
F	i am over the moon with the work jilly has done for me removing objects and people from the background of a photo , the work was done quickly and a very reasonable_price .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend to family and friend .
F	thanks jilly :)
F	i routinely order flowers from australia to send to my friends and family in the uk , the website is so easy to navigate .
F	the quality of the product is great and is more_than value for money .
F	my now husband purchased my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com .
F	it was beeautiful unique , just perfect !
F	the service since the purchase has been second to none , even 0 years down the line they continue to provide a fantastic service for us !!!
F	x
F	the quality is also perfect , my wedding_ring bought elsewhere as we were given some vouchers has alreadt had to be redipped after only a year , my engagement_ring however , from diamondgeezer is still perfect x
F	e_- careers is a great place to learn .
F	the courses and training packages are very extensive , just like been taught in a classroom .
F	i loved it so much that i am enrolling for another course and my partner is taking a course as well .
F	a trial will convince you .
F	i recently had terrible damp in my house , so i used the trusatrader . com website after seeing the advert on tv .
F	the builder i chose was extremely nice and helpful and explained everything to me because i dont have a clue about these things !
F	the job was soon fixed and i was left extremely happy with a nice smelling and dry house !
F	i needed to buy some headphones for my local pre_- school and hifiheadphones were the best for price , range of products and p_& p costs .
F	as soon as i had ordered them , i was kept up to date with my order every_step of the way and i even received them the very next_day .
F	excellent service , i will_definitely be using you again .
F	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
F	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
F	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone call .
F	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
F	customer_service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
F	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
F	ordering was easy , my delivery was quick and communication over an issue with an incompatible cartridge was extremely_helpful and speedily resolved .
F	i will_definitely be a returning customer .
F	many_thanks to steve for all his help .
F	i found the website very easy to use and my items came 0 week after i ordered .
F	excellent quality wedding_invitations at a reasonable_price .
F	bargain .
F	i couldn ' t be_happier .
F	great prices and the item turns up the next_day !
F	its incredible , always great for last_minute gifts .
F	would definitely_recommend
F	love using hostelbookers . com it is so easy and informative to use .
F	used it for several years and definately_recommend it .
F	i ordered and paid for a tunic on 0th_september , expecting delivery in the following week .
F	by the end of september it still hadn ' t arrived so i sent an_email , followed_by a phone call to the office .
F	it is now the 00th_october and i have had no replies to the 0 emails i have sent and no one has bothered to contact me following the two calls i have made - i assured someone would look_into it and call me back .
F	i will_continue to chase this !
F	i wanted to get_rid of my old lap top and had searched on ebay and didn ' t think there was much chance of getting much for it , and didn ' t really want the hassle .
F	took a quick look at a few sites for recycling laptops , and sell your lap top seemed to offer the best price .
F	was a really easy process , no additional_costs of postage - could have arranged courier pick_up for free but i opted to post it myself ( cost covered by the company ) as this was more convenient .
F	my laptop arrived the next_day - i received a confirmation_email , and the following_day the full quoted price was in my account .
F	couldn ' t have been simpler .
F	i would definately_recommend .
F	i brought a world of warcraft mouse for my other_halfs birthday , paid next_day delivery .
F	arrived in great condition , worked great .
F	i will use box . co . uk again .

F	i sent my phones in to mazuma but relised a few hours_later that i hadnt put in the order form , i rang them and the lady i spoke to was very helpful and sorted it out for me , and i recieved the money into my bank a few_days_later .
F	i will definatly use mazuma again .
F	i bought a pair of trainers and unfortunately they didn ' t fit my boyfriend .
F	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
F	i foolishly purchased online without reviewing the policy but presumed they would be in line with their main competitors .
F	this was not the case ......
F	so now i have a pair of trainers that won ' t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
F	better customer_service can definitely be found elsewhere !
F	i was a bit_dubious using this sort of website but after spekaing to a friend who used mazuma i was convinced that they were legit .
F	the service was first_class from start to finish .
F	i was offered a great price , able to send it back for free and the money was transferred into my account the day after my phone was received !
F	i would recommend iit to everyone !
F	absolutely fantastic customer_service - you place your order thinking realistically , it will be with you in a couple of days - but it always arrives the next_day !!
F	can ' t get better_than that !
F	also , if there ' s ever been a query ( i can only think of one_occasion ) their customer_service team are straight onto it !
F	!
F	very pleased with this company and will_continue to use them and recommend them :)
F	super_fast transaction and money transfer ,..., no_problems what so ever .
F	i highly_recommend mazuma as a way of selling an old phone .
F	most hen parties involve cheap hotels and girls paired off , the house was great as it brought us all closer together and it was beautiful , clean , with everything we needed and really close to town .
F	the cocktail_making was a brilliant activity to get the day / night and the addition of the topless barman absolutely made our day !
F	;)
F	everything was really well_organised which made it so much_easier for a group that had never ventured to brighton before , and can ' t thank clare and the other girls enough for all their help with the details .
F	will_definitely come back to brighton , and will_definitely_recommend my big_fat brighton_weekend to anyone who asks
F	thanks so much again !!

F	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer_service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
F	i put in my offer code which they said may not show straight_away but would be applied to my statement ....
F	however , when i received my statement i have been charged in full .
F	i rang customer_service and was told to email .... why when i am talking to you ?????
F	they then said that the offer code was on spends of Â£_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
F	i now interestingly cannot access this ' online voucher '.
F	i feel that they dangle carrots and then do not follow through ... this to me is fraudulant ... there customer_service is appalling .
F	if you ' re organising a hen_do or weekend away , i would definitely_recommend using chilli_sauce .
F	our rep was sam and organised a great dance_class and a fab night out in newcastle .
F	paying everything was so much_easier than one person having to chase everyone and everything was booked and ready for us that weekend .
F	definitely highly_recommended !
F	highly_recommended
F	highly_reccomend this company , just received payment less_than 00hrs after they got my fone . they received yesterday and money was in today .
F	couldnt be_happier , do not hesitate to use thiscompany .
F	great service .
F	sent a blackberry 0000 almost 0 weeks_ago . was told payment would be made today ( 00st jan ) still no payment !
F	ridiculous seeing as they said 0 working_days !
F	appauling customer_service .... also says on site on my account not paid . before they say they have !.......................
F	latest_update , they emailed to say money would be in bank today as promised !
F	! with a 0 pound goodwill_gesture on top ( why thankyou .. not ).
F	still no money !
F	! and have re - emailed them0 times !!

F	friend from california sent me a gift of a photo on 0 / 00 / 00 .
F	on 00 / 00 i receive a note from parcelforce demanding import vat and a clearance fee ( the latter being Â£_00 . 00 ).
F	no pay , no delivery .
F	fine .
F	i followed their instructions , went to their website , paid the toll , and arranged for next_day delivery .
F	nothing turned_up .
F	and nothing has as i write nearly a month later .
F	i just rang to complain , chose the option to speak to a real_person and was immediately disconnected !
F	tried again , got shown the exit again .
F	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
F	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
F	i had replacement lenses from thinlenses . co . uk a year_ago and i have just had new lenses fitted by them into new , expensive , frames brought elsewhere for which i didn ' t fancy paying through the nose for the optics .
F	they ' re straightforward to deal with .
F	just because they ' re vastly more competitive on price than the high_street doesn ' t mean the work , materials , communication , and service is of a lower standard .
F	on the contrary , they ' re very good in all respects .
F	although i would hate to see the town_centre without opticians , i can ' t think why one should pay so much for the same product .
F	sometimes high_st opticians service can be over - fussy and cloying too .
F	the high_street opthamologists really need to broaden the services they offer at more competitive_prices .
F	and , if you required more incentive , returning customers to thinlenses get 00 percent off their next bill .
F	that means the high index_lenses i had in my recent frames were Â£_000 cheaper_than what a nationwide ' budget ' optician fanchise quuoted .
F	they could improve , by selling top - end designer_frames .
F	that would make them competitive all_round .
F	but i doubt such manufacturers are prepared to discount .
F	great deals . very cheap and lovely villas . homes ect
F	hi , i typed to catherine on the livechat feature on the website and she was very helpful and answered my question very quickly .
F	cheers catherine :)
F	purchased a mobility scooter for my nan from careco .
F	> careco were brilliant at advising which mobility scooters were best for her .
F	> the staff were friendly and helpful .
F	no hard sell .
F	> the scooters were great value for money , far better_than any other_companies we looked at .
F	> the scooter arrived 0 days after purchase .
F	> i highly_recommend careco .
F	i would definately use this outlet again after comparing_prices in various shops i found this to be the cheapest by_far very happy with my purchase .
F	the only regret i have is that i didn ' t start using this site sooner .
F	for people reading this and thinking " how much did you spend !?"
F	i spent only about Â£ 0000 to receive Â£_000 cash back as there are some free cash back offers ( no purchase ), plus i love financial products so i received majority of my cash back applying applying for best credit_cards , bank accounts and isaa ( nisas ).
F	i also love the increasing choice of partners where i can redeem my cash back .
F	i mostly take it as m & s or amazon vouchers , but there are so many other choices ( boots , love0shop , ba miles ).
F	i recommended topcashback to so many friends and the ones that signed_up are really happy with the site and free money for shopping .
F	the ones that did not listed to me are loosing out on free cash : 0 ).
F	once i ordered a mattress from a different company , which took nearly a month to arrive and was not that comfortable .
F	when i heard about memory_foam mattresses i decided to replace mine .
F	i was amazed that memoryfoamwarehouse delivers next_day
F	i was really pleased with both customer_services and the memory_foam mattress that i got .
F	i received the mattress next_day after ordering it ( as promised )
F	the mattress is really comfortable , 00 months later it is still as new .
F	ordered 0000 water bottles .
F	we were struggling to find a company to turn them around as quick as we needed them .
F	promo gifts stepped in and we got our order on time and they look great !
F	nature ' s best have been fantastic from the start .
F	they set_up shipping all the way to korea just for me , they ' ve answered numerous health questions , recommended products , provided free_samples and they ' ve always replied very quickly to any_queries i ' ve had .
F	their products are great - believe me i take a lot of them !
F	i wouldn ' t buy vitamins / minerals from anyone_else .
F	hostel_bookers are excellent .
F	they show an excellent range of hostels for a range of budgets .
F	the information provided for each hostel is excellent and they give you lots of up - to - date customer reviews so you know what they hostel is like first hand .
F	the booking process itself is a breeze .
F	i ' ll definitely use hostel_bookers again !
F	i had no_idea on how i would get my iphone_unlocked , and once i found this company , i took a leap a faith and i couldn ' t be more happy .
F	i will recommend this company to anyone and everyone that needs their iphone_unlocked !!!!
F	thank_you sooooo much , i will be your personal cheerleader :)
F	the single worst online shopping_experience ever .
F	wish you could give no stars .
F	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
F	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton ' s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
F	i provided them with the information that was required and was assured that delivery would be quick .
F	another week_later and still no delivery and still no update from thornton ' s , except that they we ' re sorry for the experience and they strive for ' excellent customer_service '....?!
F	0 days on and still no delivery .
F	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
F	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
F	don ' t even get me started on the customer_service in store as well .
F	for a brand such as thornton ' s they need to sort this out immediately - go onto their facebook and just see the amount of complaints and their distinct lack of adequate complaint resolutions .
F	save your money and go elsewhere .
F	or if you like thornton ' s , buy their chocolate from tesco .
F	i ordered a few items on wednesday 00th_june_0000 and paid for next_day delivery .
F	i was kept_informed_throughout whole_process , my order was delivered on thursday 00th_june_0000 at around 0am , by a lovely delivery driver .
F	i was given options brought text and email to rearrange my delivery if needed too !
F	so much_better_than other_companies i have used in past few_days !
F	will_definitely use again !
F	thank_you for your excellent service !
F	!
F	i ordered a few items from a clothing company who use yodel as their couriers .
F	big_mistake on their part , i probably won ' t use this clothing company again whilst they continue to use yodel .
F	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
F	it got to 0pm and no delivery .
F	and it was still stating it was in their main service centre .
F	not my local .
F	so i rang .
F	to be told , it ' s possibly lost .
F	they ' ll forward my issue and i ' ll hear back from them , then they hung_up phone .
F	so i waited for them to return my call ( they hung_up instead of transferring me ) i didn ' t hear back so i rang again .
F	this time i told them that i needed it delivered to my work address the following_day ( i wasn ' t happy about this .
F	i paid for express delivery for my holiday !!!).
F	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
F	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
F	next_day , i waited for a call .
F	no call !
F	i rang again !
F	now they ' re telling_me there ' s no address on my parcel , only the town .
F	( this was lies , i got thr parcel eventually and there is an address !).
F	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
F	0pm arrives .
F	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
F	the man has complete attitude !
F	saying well it ' s only 0pm .
F	obviously ( he said this ).
F	it won ' t be there yet .
F	i was fuming .
F	000pm arrives .
F	no parcel again .
F	i ring again .
F	now they give me couriers number .
F	the courier hadn ' t been told to deliver to my work address , despite me telling 0 different people where it was to go !!!
F	unfortunately , the courier lady was lovely , so it ' s not her fault , but yodel as a company are useless !
F	i am awaiting contact about 0 different complaints i have made regarding their poor customer_service .
F	and the attitude of their employees .
F	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
F	but it ' s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
F	avoid yodel !
F	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort out any complaints or issues they cause !
F	i ordered 0 items from them , on 0 . 0 . 00 .
F	it is now 00 . 0 . 00 and according to their website , my items are in progress .
F	so they haven ' t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
F	i emailed three times , and rang twice .
F	to which i have had no reply .
F	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
F	this is a complete scam company .
F	they took my money quick enough and straight_away !
F	i ' m lucky i paid through paypal as i ' m opening a dispute !
F	do not use this company .
F	you will lose out !
F	lovely chocolates , and they were delivered quickly and safely .
F	the packaging would have protected against any bumps but it could have been more eco friendly .
F	good , but i ' m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
F	couldn ' t be more happy with the service .
F	the voucher and envelope were delivered so quickly , and i received nearly doubled the amount envirophone offered me .
F	definitely_recommend !
F	bought a nice sony laptop off the website .
F	good value , cheaper_than amazon by about 000 !
F	i always liked sainsburys anyway , better_than tesco or asda .
F	i love john_lewis , the stuffs good and the service is great !
F	they made me curtains and they look gorgeous .
F	i bought my new sony telly off them as the service is briulliant , it ' s chaper than buyiomg insurance .
F	i love them !
F	over 00 months the tv didn ' t work , the internet was on and off and they charged to fix it and then it still didn ' t work > cost me 000 to reconnect my phone line after they put it on their own line > a really bad_experience >
F	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here ' s my review of you
F	love the phone and love orange wednesday but hate the website .
F	hard to log on and look at your stuff , improve your website orange !
F	i love wiggle > fast delivery and good prices .
F	bought onew thing wrong and they took it back no problem .
F	everything i need for my bike i buy from them !
F	i love the co op !
F	always have !
F	excellent value and morals .
F	i use the bank as well and get points on my card !
F	they also pay dividends , foods good , banking is excellent !
F	what a grteat business , helpful , full of jokes and great on the phone .
F	everything in stock , or they tell you it will be a few_days !
F	they don ' t take your money until the goods have left their shop , that ' s really unusual !
F	i recommend them to anybody !

F	purchasing with watch shop was simple and easy .
F	the images are clear and you are offered all angles and video of product to help decide .
F	the service was fast and efficient , and they had great communication .
F	very recommended .
F	ebay makes it easy to buy and sell , the fees are reasonable and the customer_service is brilliant .
F	its an easy to use website , with fast service and payment .
F	i would really recommend the service .
F	excellent service and prompt payment .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone - they do much_better deals for recycling your mobiles than other similar companiesaking to a friend .
F	my partner bought my engagement_ring from marlows , we vvisited pretty_much all of the shops in the jewelry quarter and this was by_far the best shop , for price , service and their quality of rings .
F	the staff were extremely_helpful .
F	we also bought our_wedding_bands from here to and got a great deal .
F	since buying my engagement_ring i have been back twice to get mtg ring cleaned and polished - free of charge and my ring has come back looking more beautiful and sparkly than ever !
F	would really recommend this shop to everyone and already have done to a lot of my friends and family !
F	i came_across jilly at digitaltouch via google , and from making my initial_enquiry i found jilly extremely efficient and pleasant to deal with .

F	if you ' re looking for a quick turn_around with competitive rates and excellent service , you need to contact digitaltouch !
F	thanks jilly .

F	we have used visualsoft for over 0 years and they now feel_like family .
F	kissika is the third site in which visualsoft have built for us and they just get better and better .
F	i would strongly_recommend them to anyone who asked .
F	:-)
F	i do all my travel bookings online and like to keep things as simple as possible .
F	hostelbookers helps me find exactly_what i need , make_sure i know everything about it before booking , and then if there are any_issues their great customer_service responds promptly .
F	i don ' t have a lot of money to waste and i like to make_sure when planning a trip for work or fun that i am getting the best deal .
F	i particularly like the variety of establishments available to book from hb .
F	i was really pleased with the website and having ordered my item thursday_night ( with no special delivery ) i was surprised to see it in the post saturday_morning .
F	faster_than most companies , will order from them again .
F	highly_recommended
F	the site was easy to use and ordering was very easy .
F	i ordered quite late in the day and still had next_day delivery which was great .
F	i was notified whent he flowers had been delivered and they are gorgeous .
F	great service at a very reasonable_price , thanks .
F	i made an order on the 0th_october_0000 , it ' s now january_0000 and i still_haven ' t received the whole order .
F	part of what i did receive was damaged due to poor packing .
F	it was food but the packaging was ripped open so it was mouldy !
F	i have tried_calling waeplus but there is never anyone on the phonelines and all my emails are met with silence .
F	according to their website i can ' t have a refund whilst the order is ' partially delivered '.
F	however , i think that waiting for 0 months is enough time to ask for a refund .
F	the service has been terrible and i feel_like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
F	update_:
F	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn ' t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
F	in april i received a cheque , made out to the wrong name .
F	they are either trying really hard not to give me any money back or are just incompetent .
F	i have been shopping around for some time to find great deals on supplements , today i stumbled_upon supplementwarehouse . com !
F	i am so impressed by all the products they have , how easy their website is , and especially the prices of their supplements .
F	i cannot wait to recieve my order !
F	i will_definitely be using them again for my future_purchases !
F	i ordered a framed canvas_print for my boyfriend as a surprise christmas_present .
F	hellocanvas were very helpful and my print was with me in a couple of days - much faster_than i was expecting !
F	now i just have to wait_until christmas to see if my boyfriend loves it as much as i do .
F	thank_you !
F	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i ' d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
F	i have recycled two iphones in the past with a different company and received perfect service , received exactly the same amount i was quoted and received my money quickly .
F	i chose to use bozowi this time because it offers the highest amount and claims the same level of service i have received before - do not be_fooled you will not receive this amount for your phone !
F	my phone was sent off in good condition , followed all of the critieria for a fully working phone iphone_0s in good condition and i was quoted Â£_000 . 00 - i have received ( although its not actually in my account yet ) Â£_000 because it was locked to o0 - this was not made clear to me when i entered the contract and i can see from reviews on here that they have only just changed their website this week to say that .
F	i spoke to a guy in customer_services who also said their terms and conditions had been changed on the website this tuesday 00th_march - my contract was formed on the 00th_february
F	the thing that has made me even more angry is that i was supposed to receive an_email from them with the revised_offer of Â£_000 which i never received so i did not have the opportunity to decline their offer and get my phone back .
F	they claim to have emailed me although my it department have traced all emails and would be notified if anything was blocked for whatever_reason and nothing has tried to come through from them - i received my confirmation_email from them no problem but conveniently this one never arrived in my inbox or even made it to the server .
F	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0 days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
F	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn ' t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0 days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn ' t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?
F	one of the three people i spoke to at customer_services confirmed that they had received my email so i know this is not another suposed problem with email
F	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
F	i made them aware i hadn ' t received any emails from them and they did nothing , a decent company would see my email , re send the offer email and possibly extend the 0 day rule knowing there had been problems .
F	my phone has now been sent somewhere_else apparently and they can ' t get it back .
F	don ' t even get me started on the people they have representing their customer_services - i wasted 0 hour 00_minutes on the phone to them to get nothing resolved , no apology just them implying that i am lying and it ' s not their problem .
F	at times they spoke with attitude , when i commented that i had been on the phone for 00_minutes the girl replied " no 0 minutes actually " in a rude manner to which i pointed_out she wasn ' t the first person i had been put through to so infact it was 00_minutes .
F	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn ' t even reached my account !
F	not much more i can say !
F	i want to own everything on site !
F	i like the fact that they stock contemporary brands that you can ' t find anywhere_else , it makes the purchase that little_bit more special .
F	0 day breakfast / lunch hamper : the porridge is delicious !
F	i have never been one to use water instead of milk but i am now a saints and slimmers porridge convert .
F	one packet with a little honey gets me right through till lunch !
F	the milkshakes are delicious - i thought they would taste powdery and bitty but i am pleasantly_surprised :)
F	happy customer and will_definitely order again :)
F	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
F	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
F	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco ' s for Â£ 0 .
F	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
F	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
F	really professional and polite men .
F	great communication and delivered for me on my day off .
F	great prices .
F	thank_you so much .
F	this was absolutely amazing , we ordered and within two days the tickets were here and was amazing to find out we got some money back !
F	the tickets were reduced an they were so cheap compared to other_sites !
F	the seats were really close to the stage as i sat there for nicki minaj and i just can ' t wait for justin !
F	thanks double0_tickets !
F	great prices and extremely fast despatch times , even with the free delivery !
F	my order was despatched the same day .
F	will_definitely buy from them again .
F	great quality products and fast delivery times !
F	free delivery with style saver which is brilliant and i was even upgraded for a period of time to asos premium for free next_day delivery and returns .
F	cannot rate this company highly_enough .
F	my favourite place for clothes !
F	always speedy_delivery and kept up to date with the order process .
F	i have ordered numerous items from amazon and have never been disappointed .
F	cannot recommend highly_enough .
F	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse than the last .
F	the first item took over a week to dispatch and my second order , placed 00 days ago , has not even been dispatched yet .
F	as a result i would like to cancel my order and have notified the company of this .
F	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
F	will_definitely not be using them again .
F	we had a great weekend at the edge for my sister ' s hen_party .
F	it ' s far enough from town that you get a nicely sized outside area and close enough that buses and taxis are affordable , and walking do - able .
F	very nicely decorated inside and out .
F	only_downside is lack of parking for a group of our size , but this is the same anywhere in and around brighton and the house itself certainly made up for it !
F	thank_you .
F	i hate o0 , the customer_service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
F	you continue to be diverted to another area e . g .
F	to contract cancellation team , or the pay_monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
F	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
F	one month i spent over Â£_000 . 00 as i was away in south_america .
F	i also had my phone line , my broadband and ipad linked to o0 , and yet they still seem not to value me as a customer , or to execute any basic task i ask them to e . g . help with a broken phone .
F	i ' ve been with them since i had my first ever phone .
F	i hate the fact i am contracted to o0 and am unable to leave without a huge fine .
F	as soon as i am able to get out i will .
F	my family & i keep buying our environ products from facethefuture because we ' re always impressed with the speedy & free delivery ( i ordered some products yesterday_afternoon and then came this morning ).
F	the customer_service staff are always really friendly & eager to offer advice on products and suitable treatments .
F	the products are also cheaper_than anywhere_else i ' ve come_across , even if other_places are offering discount !
F	i shall continue to be their client and would recommend their services & environ to anyone !
F	thank_you :)
F	i have a nearly 0 year_old_daughter who is obsessed with dinosaurs but find it difficult to find her anything girly with dinosaurs as everywhere presumes it is a boy thing to like !
F	i was thrilled with her dinosaur jumper and she literally won ' t take it off !
F	i thought sometimes when they use transfers on clothes it can look a bit cheap but this is lively and looks really professional !
F	i was also impressed with the service as on the website it stated it would take 0 working_days to dispatch but i received it only 0 days after ordering !
F	fab service , fab products will_definatley be recommending ( and already have been doing ) and will_definatley be back to order more !!
F	:-)
F	brilliant !
F	i arranged a collection late on the friday_afternoon , they collected on the monday_morning and then the money was in my bank wednesday !
F	couldn ' t have asked for better service !
F	they do all the hard work for you !
F	would definatley reccomended !
F	great communication , my bills never have any unexpected charges !!
F	all in all great service !
F	!
F	shopping with nitrotek is always fast and easy , the products ordered are always of fantastic quality as is the aftersales help , all in all nitrotek is a very trustworthy and quality company !
F	!
F	received my envelope in the post and sent it and the whole_process was a breeze received my money the next_day .
F	highly_reccomended
F	love the games even the demo games are great .
F	good fast site
F	ordered a trunki as a gift and it arrived the very next_day after ordering it around lunchtime !
F	good email contact letting me know progress of order too .
F	very impressed and will_definitely use bambino direct again .
F	we ordered a baby backpack from blackleaf .
F	it arrived_promptly , packaging was good and we are very happy with the product .
F	would definitely_recommend the company to others .
F	purchased some fitflop trainers for my husband for christmas which he_loves !
F	the price was amazing , delivery was super_quick and i was kept_updated on the status of my order throughout .
F	thanks shoetique !
F	i was really impressed with mazuma ' s service - the freepost_envelope arrived the next_day and the money was in my account the day after i sent the phone in and i was kept_informed of progress throughout .
F	excellent .
F	i will use you again and will recommend you to fiends !
F	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
F	it was let_down by the insurance .
F	i got an annual policy with them and needed to claim on another trip to france , a few_months later .
F	this was by coach to stansted , to france by ryanair and hire_car to the accommodation in france .
F	unfortunately i fell ill and the insurers sent a form that applied only to a package holiday and tour operator , not to separately booked segments .
F	it was very , very hard to fill it out since it did not apply to the kind of trip i had taken .
F	but i got a medical certificate saying i ' d been too ill to travel and a letter from the french accommodation saying i hadn ' t been able to come , and a note that the car_hire in france had not been used , but they still refused to pay out on the coach and ryanair because i couldn ' t prove i hadn ' t caught the coach to stansted and i couldn ' t prove i ' d missed the ryanair flights .
F	my husband was booked with a different insurer and claimed for just the same things as me ( we each claimed 00 percent of the joint items ) but his claim was paid in full .
F	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
F	i would have thought they could get a more up to date and flexible insurance , and this definitely did not seem like a good deal to me .
F	their prices are always pretty good , the site is clear , the system is sensible .
F	i have often used this site and never found a problem .
F	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long queues .
F	we and the kids had a really bad day out here - luckily i wasn ' t paying but a relative was and we all felt upset she had wasted her money , even the kids .
F	wrote to legoland customer_services but just got a bland response which did not address the issues i raised .
F	i ' m amazed at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
F	so don ' t expect it to change if you complain , and i doubt it will get better .
F	still , if you want a decent day out go somewhere_else and spend the money on something else .
F	brilliant , fast and friendly !
F	i was kept up to date throughout the whole_process and i enjoyed the witty one liners on the emails .... will_definately_recommend this service to all my friends !!
F	thanks mazumamobile
F	i came_across my big_fat brighton_weekend when looking for an accommodation provider for my sister ' s hen_do weekend .
F	they quickly went straight to the top of the list through their quick communication , responses to queries and reassurance where i wasn ' t sure what would work best .
F	their properties looked outstanding online and i wasn ' t at all disappointed when we arrived .
F	twelve of us stayed on sillwood road which was perfectly located and beautifully set_up for a group of girls enabling a fun party atmosphere without_compromising comfort .
F	the roof terrace was an amazing touch and a lovely surprise for the hen .
F	every_single girl who stayed was beyond complimentary about the house .
F	i have already_recommended the services to others and will do so again .
F	thanks for all your help - a hen_weekend my sister will never forget !
F	very quick and reliable .
F	they provided information on the area where tickets were available and once booked they arrived very shortly_afterwards .
F	definitely_recommend them and will use them again in the future
F	movehub . com found its way straight into my favourites !
F	the wealth of information is phenomenal and to have it all in one place could save so much time .
F	the city rankings are a fantastic idea and provide exactly the type of information that people are interested in when looking to move - particularly to a new country .
F	introducing the people behind movehub is a fantastic personal_touch , and adds a sense of their passion for the site .
F	the blog provides a very interesting read and manages to be informative without sounding too formal .
F	movehub would certainly be my first_port of call and would give me the confidence in making the step to move abroad .
F	protected make buying insurance a genuine pleasure .
F	they ensured that i understood the product , had plenty of opportunity to ask questions and tailor my quote easily .
F	the staff were friendly and professional .
F	i had call - backs quickly and abdul , sarah and scott were all sincerely efficient and a pleasure to talk with .
F	i will buying more insurance this week and will not consider going anywhere_else .
F	this is a broker who prioritises customer experience over targets and i haven ' t got any negative point to make .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone_looking for life protection .
F	the low_cost is actually a bonus - the prime reason for using this company is the service , and the excellent price just makes things better !
F	thanks all !
F	stunning print , absolutely love the quality .
F	great communication_throughout , they even " held " my item for me as i was called out of the country !
F	great company , great experience .
F	thank_you so much .

F	i received a confirmation_email it was delivered on time i will shop here again and i would recommend
F	great atmosphere
F	i buy loads from amazon and have yet to be disappointed ..
F	i find the ordering_process really quick and easy , i especially like it that i do not have to keep re - entering my card_details and the fact that numerous addresses can be saved .
F	my items are always delivered as_described and the delivery itself is super_speedy !
F	amazon is by_far my favourite site to order almost any item from ( i have ordered clothes , toys , dvds , baby equipment and lots more !)
F	all at a very low price .
F	no_complaints
F	i have just received a pushchair which is my first purchase from kiddies kingdom .
F	i am so impressed with the speedy_delivery !
F	i ordered late tuesday_afternoon and received my item on thursday_afternoon ..
F	i was kept_updated of the whole_process through email and received a text_message thursday_morning that advised that my product would be delivered between 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 ..
F	it was delivered at 0 . 00 .
F	the item itself was exactly as_described with no faults and no parts_missing and at a fantastic price with free delivery .
F	cannot complain_about anything will_definitely be using again .
F	lifestyle furniture were extremely_helpful from the word go and did everything they could to help me with my order .
F	delivery was sooner_than_expected and they even arranged to phone me 00mins before so i didnt have to wait in all day .
F	the furniture itself - 0 pieces from the sheesham collection , is beautiful .
F	i hope we will be adding to it in the not too distant_future , particularly as it is such good value .
F	order was easy to process and quick to deliver .
F	really happy with the service and they text when i ' m due to re order .
F	marcin knows what he is doing and that the best thing about feedoptimise .
F	he is always there and i would recommend his tool to anyone in need of a similar service .
F	since start , the tool has always been evolving and has so many additional features attached to it making it a " one - stop - shop " for all your product feed related and everything else attached to it .
F	kudos !.
F	be prepared to digest all the info he would pass to you when you ring him with a technical query !!
F	!.
F	best_wishes .
F	excellent service and super_fast !!!
F	:)
F	i will recommend this shop to everyone .
F	due to very intense schooldays i learnt a lot and i still still remember pretty_much everything .
F	the school did not only cover drinks but also flairing and history of spirits which was good .
F	only thing that could be included in my mind is some winetasting and history etc .
F	also very friendly and helpful teachers and you could buy a barkit at the school .
F	amazing friends from the hostel experience , you all become like a crazy family
F	i couldn ' t believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
F	my phone didn ' t have the that button and says " well it wouldn ' t work without that button !"
F	i says that ' s impossible as my phones been fine but now i can ' t get onto wifi .
F	i could never get into 0g either !
F	i never complained and just thought that it was due to the location i was in .
F	now i can ' t even go on wifi and decided to take it out on the wifi company .
F	they asked if my other phones did this and i said " no ".
F	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn ' t their problem .
F	i decided to ask apple_store itself .
F	they found that apple hasn ' t even activated the 0g_network and told me to call o0 .
F	but after that phone call - their customer_service is awful !
F	they gave me such a talk about a settings that wasn ' t even there !
F	it was definitely their fault - i mean i bought it from them .
F	they then went on and on .
F	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
F	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
F	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
F	awful customer_service .
F	i ' ve just found out that i ' ve been paying Â£_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
F	switch to t - mobile !
F	my sister ' s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
F	i would recommend anyone to try collect_plus more affordable way to deliver items and more efficient than royal_mail .
F	just received my refund order placed 0 / 0 / 00 order refunded 00 / 0 / 00 customer_service team move the goal posts on a daily_basis to accommodate there unacceptable service .
F	this company may be cheaper_than the high_street but more chance of wining the lottery that receiveing proper timely help when delivery you pay for is not received nor refunded .
F	Â£_00 . 00 is a lot to pay for delivery still_waiting after almost 0 months on an explanation as to why we are not being refunded for pallet delivery when our bathroom_suite arrived loose in the back of a transit with several items damaged and broken waiting almost 0 months for refund of damaged items but no refund for pallet delivery we did not receive .
F	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
F	avoid as you have no guarantee of receiving your goods damage free and have no chance of resolving in a timely_manner be warned an extremely stressful experience that has put me off online shopping .
F	we would highly_recommend urban sales , we found the price perfect and no compromising on online coverage or customer support .
F	a very straight_forward way of selling your home for a fraction of the cost .
F	we also opted for paul knight photography urban sales photographer based in scotland who was outstanding both in the pictures he delivered and in the sharing of his wealth of knowledge in how we could help enhance our home .
F	our house sold quick and we had no ridiculously sales fee to pay .
F	thank_you urban sales for a fantastic service .
F	:-)
F	i can ' t even describe how pleased i was when my flowers arrived on thursday .
F	the colour matches my bridesmaid dresses perfectly and they are exactly_what i wanted .
F	there was no way i could have had such a perfect match with real flowers and so i would definitely_recommend silk_blooms !
F	they handled my order perfectly from start to finish with continuous communication and delivering on their promise !
F	i will_definitely be using them again :-)
F	extremely happy with the quality of the product and even more so the speed of delivery !
F	so so happy !
F	can ' t wait for the big day to hand them out to people now
F	having really thick curly hair the only straightener that ' s ever managed to tame my hair is the ghd styler !
F	the only time i buy a straightener is when my current pair have got worn out , they always last over 0 years and so its always money well spent .
F	perfect every time !
F	as a recent graduate , transitioning into finding my ideal professional job has been challenging to say the least .
F	having received my cv i would recommend the cv_store to all graduates from any discipline .
F	the cv_store has delivered friendly and constructive advice , top service , quick email responses , and even provided additional advice for interviews .
F	it is clear to see my cv has been totally rewritten ; tailored specifically to my degree and consideration has also been given towards my specialist subjects .
F	i will be recommending the cv_store to everyone i know that is about to graduate this year , and i will be using your services again in the future .
F	thanks you again ,
F	kathleen
F	originally i found a gift on a rival site as they ' d given me a Â£ 0 voucher towards something but .... ended_up being a fad !
F	it would pay for postage which i was eligible to get free but only allowed to put in one voucher_code !
F	decided to google shop and found internetgiftstore not only Â£_00 cheaper but free shipping !!
F	this saved me Â£_00 !
F	i ' ll definitely be shopping with these_guys again and the delivery was quick too !
F	!
F	thank_you so much !
F	!
F	when invited to an ' s ' themed party , i wish i ' d of checked this site 0st before letting the other half decide we were going as starwars !
F	so many great ideas !
F	however we went_ahead with starwars and what a great night , our costumes were fab and they ' re all still in one piece .
F	normally when buying things cheaply ( had to budget ) they don ' t last very long however i think these will do another few parties !
F	!
F	great value , looked great , fast delivery which let us know it was being posted , in transit , then at my door ..... could you ask for anything more ?
F	?
F	many ~ thanks
F	i love their quirky gadgets and needed a gift for both my nephews birthday_presents .
F	seeing the site before i wanted to see what they had that was different , managed to get ian some cool bike spokes and ryan loves facebook so got him some " like " cufflinks !
F	all in the 0 for Â£_00 offer which was a lifesaver before payday :_d
F	picked_up on time at the airport in barcelona .
F	the woman couldn ' t really communicate well with us , but she tried her best !
F	ended_up being a fancy car too !
F	she put the radio on and had us feeling comfortable for the 00 minute journey to our apartment !
F	brilliant !
F	return_journey , we were ready outside our apartment half an_hour early as i was worried .
F	the larger vehicle was there 00_minutes early , which was good !
F	and although we were meant to be picked_up at 0pm , we arrived at the airport by 0pm !
F	note to self .. you don ' t need to get to the airport 0 hours early .
F	barcelona airport is boring !
F	very good service and very good price with no stress or worry_about how and where to get the metro etc at only Â£_00 between four of us for a return .
F	will_definitely use again in the future :) thanks !
F	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn ' t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
F	i sent my perfectly working iphone_0s 00gb in white , lock to o0 to bozowi .
F	first of all i was given a quote of Â£_000 .
F	all was well till i received an_email_stating â the engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a scratches on the unit and on camera lens and phone is network locked to o0 â
F	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
F	i also knew there was a tiny scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
F	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of Â£_000 .
F	the company then went on to say if i unlocked the phone ( at a cost ) they would up the quote by Â£_00 .
F	i was not happy .
F	the company is here to rip people off so they can make more money on the phone themselves .
F	they charge you Â£_00 to return your phone , which i ended_up paying .
F	i received my phone back on wed00th april .
F	i have since sent it to mazuma on thurs 00th apr and they have paid the Â£_000 quote straight_away and has cleared my bank today , fri 00th_april
F	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
F	!
F	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
F	!
F	all girls had such a fantastic time , it was very organised and well planned .
F	was easy to arranged and make payments .
F	cocktail_making was just hilarious and the food was amazing !!
F	highly_recommended .
F	the pole_dancing was something i wasn ' t sure about but had such a great time & a laugh with the girls i would definatley book again !!!!
F	!
F	thanks for everything funktion xxx
F	flowers 0 days late - will they turn_up ?
F	doubt it now .
F	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn ' t !!
F	don ' t use this company .
F	so disappointed for my friend .
F	customer_service very friendly and high technology .
F	you can set to pay off your debt within one call , monthly_payments are suited to your posiblilities .
F	strongly_recommend .
F	glad they are here to help me .
F	very fast_shipping and great packed course .
F	you have everything what you need for start and you can easily forward the instructions on dvd or manual book .
F	learning wasn ' t easier until essential nails step in :)
F	i had booked many hostels through hostels . com they recently updated their site and it ' s horrible .
F	they have a service charge that they say " if you sign_up we will remove it ."
F	but it wasn ' t getting removed , the site was taking forever , and i just cancelled all of my bookings with them .
F	i came_across this site and in less_than 0 minutes my hostel was booked with no problem !
F	i have already received my confirmation , and this email to see how my experience was .... it was amazing !!!!
F	thank_you !!!
F	!
F	i have now saved this site on my computer and plan to use it for all of my hostel bookings on my up coming trip to china and my future adventures !
F	thank_you hostel_bookers !!
F	you ' ve saved me so much headache time !
F	!
F	peace , love & colors

F	cheapest for grohe products that i could find and price online includes vat and delivery so no_hidden_costs .
F	ordered on monday and delivered on tuesday - great service .
F	i would definitely_recommend plumb warehouse .
F	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0 days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank_details and states payment can take up to another 0 days .
F	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
F	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!
F	!
F	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
F	i placed the order 00th_november_0000 but after a week i had not had any contact from them at all so sent them an_email , i did not receive any designs until 0 weeks_later ( even_though promised a response in 00 - 00_hrs ) which was via_email and not in my personal account , the designs were ok but no where close to what i had requested and i did not see that as a major issue because of their " unlimited revisions request ".
F	i sent another email detailing all revisions and over a week_later i got just 0 logo sample which was laughable , again none of the designs were in my account to view only via_email so once again i replied with my requests !!
F	!.
F	i was sent exactly the same logo sample again and that was the start of over 00 emails being exchanged with either the same design or the same responses :
F	" the support that you need shall be extended to you shortly "
F	" we have received the revisions that you want , and our designers are starting their work on your project "
F	" we apologize for the delay of the design samples .
F	our senior design expert is still working on the project so as to satisfy your concept of the logo "
F	" please provide more details and we will get back to you within 00 - 00_hours ".
F	i have even received my partners window cleaning logo as one of my samples !!
F	!.
F	i have tried to get a refund but that has been ignored even_though they boast of a 000_% satisfaction_guarantee .
F	*** if you are cautious enough to do your homework first then i would avoid like the plague ***
F	if you paid with your debit or credit_card as a guest through paypal then the simplest solution is to contact your bank who might be able to refund you by issuing a card payment reversal under the consumer credit act , the transaction on your statement shows as " nochex " just keep any emails to them asking for a refund as proof .
F	if you paid via_paypal you have 00 days from purchase to file a dispute but don ' t delay for " weeks ".
F	if , after a short time chasing , the reply is unsatisfactory or absent , make a claim .
F	i joined utility warehouse in march last_year and have encountered nothing but problems .
F	the switch over was nothing but a headache with one problem after another .
F	recently i have had problems paying my bill due to taking 00 weeks off work to care for my mother who had terminal lung cancer and was given a max of 00 weeks to live & on top of that my partner was waiting for an operation on his wrist so was in plaster cast and unable to work , i called to explain the situation on at_least 0 occasions and i was told my account would be protected , the payment was 0 weeks late but my services were disconnected despite being advised they would nt be , i was left with no broadband & internet for over a week and told i would be charged to have them reconnected .
F	( our bills have always been paid up until then ) my recent bill was a lot more then expected so i called once again to explain that due to the circumstances it would be a little late , my bill was due on the 0st of december and i paid half of it asking for a week or so to settle the rest of the bill and 0 days_later all my services have been once again cut_off with out warning !
F	!.
F	all the way through i have been in contact with utility warehouse and expected a little_bit of understanding and am shocked they would cut_off my service for a bill 0 days late even_though communication was made .
F	i called customer_service to pay my bill and ask why after being told my services would be protected was i cut_off and the person i spoke to was rude , kept speaking over me and told me " you cant just call up and pay your bill whenever you feel_like it and i should of given them a date when the bill would be settled but i was never asked to provide a date from the previous call .
F	the customer_services has mostly been terrible and i am quite upset i was spoken to like that for a bill that is only 0 days late !!
F	!.
F	dealing_with them now is just an extra worry i never expected to have and dread the thought of having to stay them !!
F	i would rather pay more money then go through all this hassle !!!!!
F	!
F	i recently_purchased a blinding moon shield rear light .
F	i ' d previously seen it at edinburgh cycles for twice the price so was pleased to see it almost half the cost inc . postage on highonbikes .
F	i was even more bowled_over by the fact that i ordered it on a monday_afternoon and had received it by lunchtime tuesday ... how is that possible ?
F	i don ' t know .
F	but i was really pleased with the speedy service and great price .
F	would definitely use the site again .
F	i happened upon this site through living_social by_accident and couldn ' t have been happier with my purchase !
F	the site was so simple to use and there were some utterly beautiful bouquets available to choose from .
F	you can even choose your own card design and personalise the message on the front as well as within to make it just that extra bit special !
F	delivery was super cheap and i ' ve every confidence that my bouquet will arrive in pristine_condition .
F	i know my mum will be utterly thrilled with them on mother ' s day , i can ' t wait to get the ' thank_you ' phone call !
F	thank_you iflorist , i ' ll definitely be back !
F	x
F	speedy_delivery of tickets and neat , easily readable website .
F	definately use this service again !
F	i chose to sell a pair of ghd hair_straighteners for Â£_00 . 00 back in november and have still not received the money .
F	it may not seem a massive amount but to me as a skint student it is a lot .
F	chose to have my item collected by one a courier .
F	the courier did not come on the date i selected .
F	i emailed music_magpie informing them of this , and received an_automated_response telling_me i would receive a proper reply within 0 days .
F	i received this reply 0 days_later , and it stated that the matter would be looked in to .
F	that was the last i heard about that .
F	the courier had already arrived by this time , coming one day late , luckily he came during the one hour that day which i was at home , so i was able to give him my item .
F	ten_days_later i received an_email from music_magpie stating that my item had not been received my them , and asking if i had decided not to sell .
F	i sent them a message the day after i received this email , using the online contact form on their website , in which stated that a courier had been to collect my item on 0rd_december and that i had a receipt from him proving this , and asking what i should do .
F	again , i received an_automated_response saying i would be replied to within 00_hours .
F	i never received a reply , so i sent another message using this form - again my message went ignored .
F	then , on 00th_december , i received another email from music_magpie saying ' we have not received your items , have you decided not to sell ?'
F	obviously this was very annoying as i had already sent two messages stating that my item had been collected by their courier some time ago .
F	these messages had obviously not even been read .
F	so , on the same day ( 00th_december ) i found an_email address for customer_services on the music_magpie website .
F	i sent an_email to this address explaining everything that had happened and expressing my disappointment in the lack of responses to my messages .
F	i received a response to this email 0 days_later on 0nd january ( probably because i titled the message are you ever going to reply to my messages )... informing_me that my item had not been received by them and asking for some more details ( order number , number of items in the box , how many boxes it was packaged in and a tracking reference ) so that they could make a claim from ' my hermes ,' the courier service they use , for the loss of my hair_straighteners .
F	i responses immediately with all this information .
F	i received no response to this .
F	on 00th_january , i sent yet another email , with the subject line as hello is anybody there ?
F	again explaining everything that had happened and asking whether or not i would be receiving my money .
F	again , i received no response .
F	on tuesday of last_week ( 00th_january ) my father telephoned music_magpie on my behalf to try and finally get some response .
F	he was told that i would receive an_email the next_day asking me to confirm my bank_details so that the money could be transferred to me .
F	i did not receive this email .
F	he telephoned again on thursday 00th_january to ask again , and the man on the phone contacted his supervisor to obtain authority to transfer the money to my bank .
F	he was authorised to do this and said that the money would be transferred on friday 00th .
F	i still have not received an_email asking for my bank_details , and the money has not been transferred .
F	i have emailed them again to ask whether they would like my bank_details to transfer the money , but , not surprisingly , i have received no reply .
F	absolutely_shocking service and i will not be using them again .
F	would not recommend this company at all , i am so disappointed and have never felt so undervalued as a customer - absolute_joke .
F	three customer_services are liars , thieves , rood , don ' t understand a word of english & give u an impression that your an_idiot to embarrass u so u can shut up .
F	they have been taking out money from my bank_account for the last 0 months after begging them to cancel my direct_debit because i had a new contract & didn ' t want the old service , i also tolled them i didn ' t need it because i had wi_-_fi , i was tolled that i cant use my ipad ' s wi_-_fi with out a sim_card & turned_out to be a lie .
F	not mentioning the very bad coverage
F	my partner and i booked a hotel in glasgow city_centre in october so we could attend the commonwealth games to which we have been allocated tickets .
F	we knew how busy and expensive it was going to get so thought we would be sensible and book immediately .
F	now , 0 months later , you have informed us that you will not be honouring our booking , effectively cancelling our booking , with only 0 months to go and as prices for accommodation increase daily .
F	our booking was confirmed .
F	we have called the hotel and they have told us they received our booking and you cancelled our reservation , so please stop blaming a â technical_error â.
F	you are punishing our foresight just so you can line your pockets with the substantially increased cost of a hotel room .
F	nothing in your terms and conditions allows for this situation .
F	your offer of a refund is unacceptable as we would then be unable to see the commonwealth games .
F	we will be out of pocket booking another hotel room which are now nearly triple the cost of our original booking .
F	the alternative_accommodation offers in edinburgh and ayr are a joke .
F	i have already planned 0 days in edinburgh as part of my holiday , and have no desire at this time to visit ayr - i have planned a holiday to glasgow .
F	we have booked our return_flight out of glasgow ; do you expect us to drag our luggage around with us all day on the day of our flight back to london ?
F	your offer of providing train tickets is ridiculous .
F	the last train from glasgow to ayr leaves at 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
F	the last train from glasgow to edinburgh leaves at 00 . 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
F	how are we supposed to experience glaswegian nightlife if we have to catch a train back before 00 . 00pm ?
F	our night at the games doesn â t finish until 00pm ; it will be a real pleasure rushing out of the stadium and back to the train_station .
F	we spend 0 days a week commuting on central_london underground trains , why do you think i want to go on holiday and spend nearly 0 hours commuting 00 miles ?
F	this is further to the fact that the alternate hotel in ayr is 0 . 0km from the train_station .
F	how exciting to arrive back in ayr at midnight to wait for a taxi !
F	i have a longstanding issue with a broken foot , which was one of the reasons we booked a centrally_located glasgow hotel , and you see fit to offer alternatives not within the same city ?
F	catching trains is not possible and frankly insulting .
F	how about offering another one of your customers enjoying a holiday in london alternative_accommodation in birmingham and see how they respond .
F	you need to arrange alternative_accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
F	looking online there is plenty of accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
F	if you cannot find us a hotel in glasgow , i expect you to refund not only the hotel booking you cannot â honour â(Â£ 000 ), but also the cost of other hotels we have already paid for during our holiday (Â£_000 ), our tickets to the commonwealth games (Â£_000 ) and the cost of our return flights to london (Â£_000 ).
F	your customer_service has been appalling .
F	how_dare you not reply to any of our calls and voicemails .
F	how_dare you delay your response to emails , and then expect a prompt reply to your â offer of refund â within 00_hours .
F	i am not going to disappear because you continue to ignore me .
F	this is your responsibility - stop trying to pass the blame .
F	my first time book yesterday from hostel_bookers , it is good .
F	after comparing hostels and hostels world , i found hostelbookers no more charge per order .. more , price is better ^^
F	liu from china :)
F	i have just attempted to book a flight with you from phuket to ho chi minh on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	i was told that in the time from selecting the flight to confirming payment the product was no_longer available .
F	luckily for me however , you have still been able to charge me while providing me with nothing .
F	kindly , you have told be call you at my expense !
F	just wondering what you are planning to do about this as i have no_intention of ringing you to sort this out !
F	reading reviews of others with the same experience , so hopefully you ' ll be experts at sorting this out promptly !?
F	looking_forward to your swift reply !
F	placed an order with sd on the easter sunday , not expecting to receive the item until around thursday / friday the following week due to the bank_holiday weekend .
F	received my order at tuesday lunch time .
F	items were perfect , no faults , no_problems .
F	husband claimed my free mug though ...
F	all in all , i would definitely order from again , especially if there is another sale on .
F	rude , clueless and down right insulting .
F	ordered a wedding dress from a seller here and when the dress arrived it was 0 sizes too small .
F	the seller then told me to got to a tailor to have it altered as it would be cheaper_than funding a return .
F	pointed_out to said seller that as she had not given any written notice before the sale that she didn ' t fund returns , it was her obligation to do so .
F	i acted on her request however and consulted a tailor who said because the dress was that small , the whole look of the dress would have to be completely changed and rather_than paying for a dress , i would have just paid for expensive fabric .
F	i contacted asos and paypal , and paypal agreed that the seller had to do something about the dress .
F	but hold on , asos didn ' t agree .
F	after getting very vague information over the matter from the seller , asos informed me that i was a liar and a thief and that i had been given a full_refund ( according to their system ) and had to return the dress .
F	( fyi , i was offered a partial_refund from seller to cover an extreme alteration , and never received a full_refund although the seller had used the asos sellers system to say that i had ).
F	0 weeks_later , after arguing my case and informing asos that i wanted to return the dress , i have been issued a full_refund and it was agreed that asos would send a courier to pick_up the dress .
F	as of today however , i have just been rudely told by a ' senior_manager ' to keep the dress and put an end to the matter due to asos arranging couriers that cannot keep to agreed time frames to pick_up a collection .
F	it seems that asos don ' t understand that losing a days work either loses myself or my employer money , and thus means i cannot stay in all day waiting for a failed attempt to collect the item .
F	i have used my statutory rights throughout the whole_process and paypal , and legal services have confirmed that everything i have written and sent has been correct and in line with the uk distance sellings regulations .
F	this didn ' t stop asos from calling me a cheat , liar and a thief .
F	please , for your own safety as a buyer , do not use the asos marketplace until you have fully researched who you are buying from .
F	asos still seem to allow sellers to sell items even_though the response by the customers reflects that the items they are receiving are incorrect and unable to be returned when they have been given no warning about this .
F	asos , it ' s disgusting that you can promote such incompetent idiots to ' senior ' positions who clearly have no understanding about buying and selling regulations within the uk and who refuse to protect their customers when all they have done is purchase in good faith and have used their legal rights when they have received unfit items . the whole episode has cost a lot of time , money and effort and with my wedding day approaching , has only made matters worse with me having to find an_alternative dress in a very short_space of time .
F	as a loyal_customer of nearly 0 years , i regret to say that i will shop with you no_longer .
F	i ' ve ordered several items from a well_known company for business advertisement .
F	and each one being delivered by city_link ( professional trespassing )
F	what the issue is with city_link is that their drivers are not educated in knocking on a persons front_door before leaving a delivery with them .
F	last month i ordered a box of 000 business_cards .
F	a couple of days_later i came into my kitchen at the back of the house after hearing a noise and found my item sat on my kitchen windowsill in the rain .
F	the driver had unlocked my back gate and left my parcel .
F	they hadn ' t even bothered to come to my front_door and i was sat in the front room at the time .
F	i contacted the company i had ordered from and city_link as my item has been waterdamaged .
F	they informed me a replacement would be sent .
F	a few_days_later , the same_thing happened again .
F	driver unlocked backgate and left item outside on windowsill .
F	i complained to city_link who didn ' t answer any_questions on why their drivers were trespassing on property that was clearly locked up , and not even bothering to come to the front_door .
F	my item was replaced again , this time to be greeted with a driver with the attitude of a pubescent 00 year_old male .
F	he shoved my item in my face , told me to sign for it and he left .
F	a couple of weeks_later i had to order an_alternative item .
F	this time the trespassing driver had returned .
F	the driver banged her fists on my kitchen window , dumped the parcel next to the drain and was off , through the gate that she had unlocked again .
F	i had ran_into the kitchen with fright due to the nature of her abrupt delivery , with a shaken 0 month old in my arms and spotted her on my drive way .
F	so city_link , the next time i order and you have to deliver , if your driver ever trespasses on property that is clearly locked and is not to be accessed by the public , i will file a complaint with the police .
F	i have a front_door !!!!!!!!
F	!
F	we ordered an expensive item last_year and was told we would receive it within a couple of days .
F	we tracked , it never came , however yodel seemed to think that they had been to our house .
F	i worked from home for a week to receive my item .
F	they said we weren ' t there and i begged to differ .
F	after numerous exasperating phone_calls i was told i could come and collect it at their nottingham branch .
F	so i went only to be confronted by the most ridiculously idiotic member of staff possible .
F	she denied that there was any note left for me to pick my item up and that even_though i had travelled 00_minutes to get my item ( that i had paid delivery for ) she wouldn ' t give it to me ( as it was against policy ).
F	funny how that changed when one of their delivery drivers walked in on our heated discussion , and asked her why was it such a problem when all he had to do was walk out the back and get it .
F	i showed him proof of how long we had waited and the tracking_number and that was the end of the matter .
F	until the huge foot mark and dent in the box was spotted on nearly Â£ 0000 worth of equipment .
F	since then i try to avoid anyone that uses_yodel as a courier service .
F	i ' m not sure whether they are the cheapest option or not , but surely the revenue in having to give refunds due to their lack of courtesy and care , as well as navigation is costly enough to stop using these delinquents to deliver goods .
F	clowns .
F	quick and easy to post them off , very good price for the phones and the money came quicker_than i thought .... only 0 days from posting them
F	excellent
F	i have to say , our holiday was very dependent on a car .
F	we hired two astras and have to say they were awesome !
F	yes they have a few miles on the clock , but regardless , they were fantastic little run arounds ( and competed well with the bigger hire cars )
F	einar also was awesome !
F	we had a problem with one of the cars , and with a flash he came to the rescue and delivered us a replacement .
F	a very friendly guy who ran our hire seamlessly !
F	so on behalf of us all , thank_you einar and faircar for completing our holiday :)
F	product was dispatched on day of order and arrived promtly in perfect_condition .
F	super service !
F	quick delivery and high_quality products
F	they did exactly_what they said they would !
F	fantastic ordering_process which allowed me to order flowers for 0 different_addresses , simply , fast and inexpensively .
F	i hurt my knee running , couldn ' t get in at the doctors for two_weeks so decided to book in at ah instead .
F	they were really friendly , didn ' t treat me like an_idiot who_knows nothing about fitness , and worked wonders with my knee .
F	it was totally better by the end of the week and i was off running again .
F	excellent service and fast delivery .
F	only took about 0 days all in all to get the bag sent to me , my phone sent off and my money in my bank_account .
F	i would really recommend mazumamobile .
F	had a few complications finding my destination address at he time of booking .
F	however this was due to our villa being very new and address not being on most records , this was solved efficiently using a google_maps address and staff were very helpful and courteous .
F	our flight was delayed by an_hour , but a quick phone call ensured our pick_up time was amended .
F	overall i was very happy with the service .
F	excellent service , wide_variety if goods , first and only drop for supplies
F	ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses , price seemed to good to be true and was ....
F	one thing this company are extremely good at is taking money out of your account promptly , when it comes to delivering the goods that you have ordered or refunding money they are abysmal .
F	basically i ordered a pair of chanel sunglasses at the beginning of the month , and began to get slightly worried that i had received no confirmation of my order 0 days_later .
F	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address .... after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
F	the next_day and the confirmation_email had still not arrived , so i had to ring again .....
F	this time i did get speaking to someone who handled my query extremely well who explained that the email had again been sent to the wrong email address ( by the way my email adrress is exactly the same as my name ) and promised that the email would be sent immediately .
F	the customer_service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days ....
F	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
F	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several years_ago .....
F	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
F	so after declining to choose another pair of glasses i asked for a refund which i was told would be in my account in 0 - 0 working_days .
F	guess_what ?
F	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0 days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day ... silly me ....
F	by the way after finding out that the glasses had been_discontinued i found them with another company ( pret a voire ) who price matched the sunglasses_shop fictional price and had them on my doorstep by lunch time the next_day , exceptional service especially by their rep called wu who actually stayed in work late to ensure my product was dispatched the same day .
F	after previously making a phone call to order a thermostat to go with the underfloor_heating we had stupidly bought from focus , we decided this time to go with ' theunderfloorheatingstore ' knowing that the business has a friendly and effecient service !
F	excellent staff and very fast delivery !
F	so much_better with the new website !
F	very pleased , deffinately will be shopping again !
F	i found the whole_process of using protect_your bubble quick & easy .
F	it gave me all the information i needed to make my choice & to put the cherry on the top if was very reasonable which in this economy makes protect_your bubble the right choice .
F	very happy with my cover & hope to use protect_your bubble for travel_insurance next month too .
F	thanks
F	absolutely no doubt that transferwise is the only choice for stuents doing a year abroad .
F	banks and other services are an_absolute_rip_off in comparison - love it .
F	i ordered a north_face coat on sunday_afternoon , 0 weeks before_christmas .
F	i fully expected it to take 0 - 00 days as is standard - and taking account of the time of year .
F	i couldn ' t quite believe it when the coat arrived on tuesday_morning , less_than 00_hours after i ordered it !
F	i ' ve been telling everyone how great e_- outdoors is , and will_definitely buy off the site again .
F	thanks !
F	i recently went to cuba for 0 weeks and before i went , i phoned customer_service and asked about any international usage packages so i wasn ' t bankrupt when i came home .
F	i was told by gurtesh in the cairo call_center in these exact words " as long as you use wifi , you will not be charged for using the internet ".
F	he went on the tell me quite patronizingly that wifi is through your handset and not your sim .
F	i checked into my hotel , bought wifi access cards to last my holiday and kept in contact with my partner and family back home .
F	i used facetime connected to wifi and facebook and i sent a handful of emails so i could keep in touch with my uni tutor .
F	i contacted vodafone customer_service as i had sent a few texts whilst away as well and my bill was Â£_000 . 00 due to data_usage .
F	i expressed a very explicit verbal dissatisfaction with this to the adviser at the fact that i had been lied to by a colleague and while i know i was wrong to swear , i think it is far worse that the adviser swore back at me .
F	i can be extremely hot headed at times especially when faced with a phone bill as big as my mortgage but i always apologise when i ' m in the wrong .
F	i got no apology from the adviser , just a supernanny style warning that if i did it again , she would hang_up .
F	i ' d have preferred her to hang_up instead of cursing me out if i ' m honest !
F	i ' ve posted this on the vodafone forum too and the response from the " expert " was to check that my data roaming was off and / or my cellular data .
F	i ' ve checked it and the only one that advises to be turned off when travelling is the data roaming as it specvifically states on the iphone that it incurs costs abroad .
F	the cellular data says it disconnects all wifi access and email etc which i still needed .
F	as far as i was concerned , the expensive bit was disconnected and that was of my own initiative , not even at the advice of vodafone .
F	to top it all off , they want to charge me so i can see the bill and i have been hung_up on by 0 advisers today when i ask to speak to a manager .
F	they all state there are no managers on the floor which is illegal as a manager has to be present at all times to deal with issues and complaints which is definately what i want to make but i am being refused at every turn .
F	i feel a bit cheated that i ' ve had to resort to writing on a forum to express my comments but it seems the only way to get it seen by someone with a bit of power about the situation .
F	i have rated this one star because i have to , not because i wanted to .
F	the returns process is very poorly explained , they email in very abrupt short sentences and don ' t seem to follow_up on assurances .
F	shoes are poor quality and every pair fits badly be it too small , too big or too narrow .
F	i ' ve sent back every pair i ' ve bought .
F	shocking .
F	my partner had a mobile internet contract with them but since moving in with me had no need for it .
F	he called at the end of june to give 00 days notice and was advised to call back after the 00th of july to give immediate notice and to ensure no more payments were taken .
F	he called back on the 00th of july ( today ) and was told that he had been misinformed and that the call he was making was his notice period and another charge would leave his account .
F	after 00_minutes to a premium_rate number , the advisor finally said that the earliest he would be able to cancel is the 00th of august anyway as this was the expiry_date .
F	my partner queried why the charge could not be over looked due to loyalty and the fact he had been paying for a internet_connection he hadn ' t used for about 0 months .
F	he was informed by the member of staff that loyalty only meant something to them when they were taking out new contracts to get better deals .
F	when my partner asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor , he was conveniently told they were in a meeting until close of the call_centre and a call back would be scheduled for between 00 and 00_hours .
F	when my partner advised that this would not be convenient due to his working hours , he was basically told tough_luck .
F	the advisor kept pressing the mute button while my partner was talking so about 00_minutes was spent repeating himself .
F	it was absolutely_disgusting how he was treated and to be told outright that loyalty only counts when you want to spend more money is beyond a joke .
F	took my phone over to their office in farmoor as couldn ' t contact them by phone , was told i would get it back the next_day ... 0 days_later finally got my phone back and a yellow spot had appeared on my screen , it also warps if any pressure is put on the screen , tried to call them numerous_times , they didn ' t answer their phone , have emailed them with no response ... pants repair and pants customer_service ... won ' t be using them again !
F	!
F	truly gutted to have wasted Â£_00 on this service and to have the issues i have experienced since !
F	!
F	you won ' t get cheaper genuine perfume anywhere_else !
F	excellent value for money , free_gifts included sometimes , good delivery time and good quality perfumes for a very low price .
F	very happy customer i will use fragrance_direct again they never fail to deliver .
F	really pleased with the suite we purchased , exactly as describe , fantastic quality .
F	delivered faster_than_expected , good customer_services .
F	very happy customer :-)
F	very pleased with the service i received from mazuma_mobile .
F	fast payment , same amount as quoted , unlike_other_sites i have used in the past .
F	will only ever use mazuma now and have recommended to friends .
F	tried to buy a washer_dryer which would have been much cheaper_than anywhere_else i ' d seen it .
F	ordered it and was phoned the next_day to say that they didn ' t have any even_though the site had said they had plenty in stock .
F	thought it seemed too good to be true .
F	was then phoned a week_later and told the same_thing .
F	waste of time .
F	i very much recommend this company , the products are very reasonably_priced , packaged well , arrive quickly and the customer_service is brilliant .
F	i needed advice on a product for my cat and they could not have been more helpful .
F	00 out of 00 viovet !
F	sent a few boxes of items in with a range of items in varying condition .
F	completely understood that some of the books were very old , ( as most people , i had added them a little opportunistically in the hope they ' d be accepted ) but very concerned that some items which were brand spanking new ( and conveniently worth more money ) were rejected as being damaged !!!
F	ziffit ' s terms and conditions state they cannot return the items - how very convenient !!
F	!
F	i had likewise sent a load of items to one of ziffit ' s main competitors as they were offering more on some items and had no_problems whatsoever .
F	i would suggest to others to physically take them to a trade - in place and accept or reject an offer on the spot in person so you can walk away with your goods in your possession if they ' re unhappy with the condition rather_than being robbed blind as i have !!
F	!
F	was quite worried_about buying of this website as i didn ' t know about the quality ect , after_reading all the good reviews i decided to buy one as i am a student in a house without a living_room !
F	i am writing this review sitting on my new bean_bag chair with a duvet .
F	say no more !
F	it was excellent speedy service and delivery .
F	the comfort and quality of the chair is amazing for the 00 . 00 with a free footstool .
F	well worth a buy , and i will be coming_back to beanbagbazaar for other items and also will be recommending it to family and friends !
F	:)
F	also had a text to change delivery or an option to deliver to neighbours , so its flexible to each customers needs !
F	go on you know you want too :))
F	great website , easy to use and booking exactly as hoped .
F	fair and fast service !
F	i ordered a pair of ghd ' s first thing yesterday and they arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
F	the price was the best price i found on the internet and the delivery / service was first_class .
F	i would reccommend beautycow . com to friend and family and i will be using them again .
F	thanks for much .
F	katy :-)
F	sadly , i would love to be one of the many customers whom are delighted in their reviews .
F	after purchasing a [_external reference_] coupon , and deciding after looking at the products to use it as part payment , and opt for a larger_size frame , upgrading and paying the additional amount owed .
F	as stated by the company that i could do .
F	however , due to an issue during the payment process , the company have left the funds ' pending ' rather_than withdraw them fully .
F	paypal state that the order needs to be processed by the company . when i enquired_about the order status as i was eager to receive the canvas , the email i received back was offensive in tone , by being very condescending , and assumed the error was the fault of my inability to use a very simplistic ordering_process .
F	they took the time to enclose an idiots step by step guide , by not the time to actually track the order .
F	telling_me i had mistakenly ordered the wrong_size !
F	if i had not experienced problems , i would say that the simplistic ordering is great , and the ease of use fantastic .
F	sadly , after many emails from my side , attaching proof of payment and order confirmations , i am still_awaiting any hint of whether i shall receive my canvas .
F	as emails are unanswered and assurance via the telephone unfulfilled .
F	very saddened and looking at the other products offered , upset as i would of ordered many more in the future .
F	it would seem that as long as the order is straight_forward then a good service , sadly , please be aware that if a problem is encountered you may be left hanging , or ignored .
F	after asking whether i should cancel the payment and re - order , no answers are forthcoming .
F	so i am left , confused , frustrated and deeply upset , as it appears to be only myself trying to come up with solutions .
F	i am very happy for those other customers that have received a good service , but also wish to just advise those that may in future have a problem .
F	i have 0 days to get my roll banner for a wedding fayre .
F	they checked it , emailed regularly and shipped to an address to get it there quicker .
F	great service .
F	have been really pleased with the easiness of using myhermes had no_complaints from the recipients .
F	great prices too .
F	i was so excited to find the lady tank engine in wood on this site at a reasonable_price as it has been_discontinued everywhere_else .
F	the service and quality of the product is excellent !
F	my son is going to be so excited this christmas !
F	i found this hostel through another review site , but booking with hostelbookers was cheaper !
F	they also had better pictures available than the original review i looked at , and the map_feature is very nice .
F	there are so many great point to this dealership but the top one and the most_important is the person you deal with and for me & jason parr it is lee baines
F	he is such a gentleman he will go out of his way to help you and provide the best service and meet all your needs .
F	if you have any_questions he does everything that he can to answer them .
F	we can not express enough how much this man has helped_us .
F	the quality of his professional ability to customers is 000_% we can not praise him enough for all his time and effort with getting us the right car and even threw in free mats which is a added_bonus .
F	if we have any_problems in the future we know that we can phone him up and he will sort it out .
F	he_loves what he does everyday and you can feel that when your talking with him he makes you feel at ease and always smiling we can not praise this dealership and the team members enough if your looking for a new car then this is the place to go .
F	if i have done it any justice in this review i hope you find that our experience has been 000_%
F	would recommend 000_% to all friends & family to use this dealership best in the north_west by_far !!
F	!
F	thanks again lee baines your a super star
F	the tenor saxophone i ordered from gear0music arrived within 0 days , and was extremely well_packaged .
F	the saxophone itself plays well and is in very good condition for a used item ( including mouthpiece & ligature , which i was expecting to have to buy separately ), the case is in brilliant condition , and i was amazed to find also packaged in the case a new cleaning cloth , neck strap and cork grease ( extra to what was mentioned in the description )!
F	the only thing that really needs to be looked at is the cork around the neck , but i think i should be able to get that sorted out fairly inexpensively .
F	as a summary , the service was excellent , and the saxophone is in much_better condition than i expected it to be for the price and considering the fact that it ' s used .
F	extremely pleased !!
F	!
F	sent 0 cards on the 0 / 00 / 00 and the 0 recipients of the cards only received them 0day ... thats 00 days for delivery , thats too long , especially with it was Â£ 0 . 00 for the delivery ..!
F	then i was told by both people that the invoice was attached to the front of the cards , stating the price i had payed .
F	how embarrassing ....!
F	both said the cards were nice ... i haven ' t seen them ..!
F	i had sent a birthday card on the 00 / 00 / 00 to my uncle and he still_hasn ' t received it yet and his_birthday is now , long over ... but hopefully it will arrive soon ..!
F	i ' m sure with the invoice attached to it ..!
F	overall not a great service ...!
F	wont use again ..!
F	i ' m so greatful to this company and ' david ' that dealt_with my order .
F	i had ordered from another company and after waiting many weeks and no items , i had to re - order from another company .
F	i phoned and spoke to david at lester nurseryworld and he was so helpful and reassuring , so i ordered with them my stokke items .
F	i placed the order on a friday_afternoon and they posted it the same day and i received them monday_afternoon .
F	what a fast delivery service , and that was to northern_ireland , which always takes longer_than mainland_uk .
F	will be recommending this company to friends & family and will order again myself from them .
F	great ink , great colour depth , last a reasonable lenght of time ...!
F	fast dilevery ..!
F	easy to use website
F	excellent products which have improved the quality of life for my dogs and cats .
F	i recommend yumega and yumove to all my friends .
F	lintbells customer_service is outstanding and i will_continue to use their products for all of my pets .
F	great prices can ' t wait to buy more
F	the customer_service is always second to non , now they have combined with t - mobile the signal in low signal areas has much improved and thats a great service to their customers
F	after_reading the reviews from back in jan i wasn â t sure to go with this company but i â m_glad i did as i am extremely happy with my roman_blinds , the samples i ordered came the next_day so that was great and they look really expensive and just what we wanted .
F	other_companies were coming_back with Â£_000 for 0 roman_blinds for our bedroom but these were Â£_000 which is an amazing price !
F	they came quickly and were easy to assemble !
F	i will_definitely be using blinds 0 go again and will tell others to use this website too !
F	very happy i must_say !
F	:-)
F	i recently_purchased some wedding presents from this company at very short_notice .
F	i rang them up to see if the presents would arrive on time .
F	they went to a great deal of effect to make_sure this would happen .
F	they all turned_up on time and i am very greatful for this .
F	overall , good quality presents , arrived on time and good presentation of the packaging .
F	would definatley recommend this company .
F	thanks getting personal .
F	i was recently looking around to buy a bmw in the chesterfield store , i was brousing the cars outside for quite a while and not one member of staff came out to assist me , they were clearly too busy chatting inside .
F	i was quite appalded by this as they had obviously seen me .
F	i decided to leave and bought a car elsewhere .
F	poor quality goods , missing and damaged items .
F	extrememly poor after sales_team , poor organisation , very poor customer_service and constanly being hung_up on .
F	it does not seem like an illegitimate company i dont know how they havent been shut_down yet .
F	its been 0 months since my kitchen arrived and im missing half of it , and in all that time they have sent me one door !!
F	extremely disappointed !!
F	even by sending them this email will be a waist of time as i am guarenteed no response as once they recieve their money they could care less about their customer .
F	quick & easy didn ' t have to leave the house , super service & kev was lovely , will_definitely_recommend and use again !!
F	!
F	i placed my order online and opted for the 0nd_class delivery option but my parcel arrived the next_day .
F	i ' ve found that items are very competitively_priced and i have no_complaints with the quality or service received .
F	i will_definitely use them again .
F	i have been a user of lovefilm for 0 years now , and rate them highly , they are good value for money and dont charge any late fees .
F	my only quibble would be that some of the new films that come out you cant rent as blockbusters has the right to have it before anyone_else .
F	would recommend this company to everyone though
F	i have used play . com on several_occasions , most of there products are good value , and they have free delivery which is great .
F	i will definetly continue to use them
F	i always use amazon for my dvds and music ( discs and downloads ).
F	you can compare prices off different companies and also buy used goods .
F	you can buy many products from as little as 0p .
F	they deal with problems quickly .
F	i have used american soda loads of times now and will always use them for my american goodies .
F	really good prices compared to all others on the internet , great variety of stock , great customer_service , if you have any_problems they will deal with them quickly and efficiently .
F	i definetly recommend using american soda
F	i was stuck in a pickle - i made mess of weight and only realised after purchase ...
F	p0g was there for me as usual , with an amazing price , charlie fixed my error and it was only 00p more - despite being a kilo and a half out !
F	and kept the same delivery slot , despite being well after hours ...
F	i mean , seriously .
F	time and again , p0g have been just brilliant , whether delivering or collecting .
F	i can ' t honestly recommend them enough .
F	that ' s why i keep_coming_back .
F	and now they have a mobile_app !
F	i have purchased several groupons in the past ( never again ).
F	often what appears to be a good deal transpires to be the same price as standard or something cheap and substandard put_together for the sake of groupon , i feel this is the fault of groupon mis selling the products .
F	the customer_service team are not very helpful , they fail to respond to emails and are impolite if you actually manage to speak to someone .
F	stay_away from this company and hopefully they will disappear and no_longer rip us all off .
F	bonjour ,
F	a priori il_y a beaucoup de mÃ©contents , quelle que soit la nationalitÃ© des acheteurs ..
F	au vu des derniÃ¨res reviews ( infurn . fr et infurn . com ) je_suis assez inquiÃ¨te concernant notre premiÃ¨re commande chez infurn ( au 000000 ) datant de tout dÃ©but avril 0000 .
F	il s ' agit de 0 chaises victoria ghost ( starck ) et nous_avons Ã©videmment trouvÃ© que_le site d ' infurn Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien fait , hyper attractif avec_des prix dÃ©fiant toute concurrence .
F	nous ne nous sommes mÃªme pas mÃ©fiÃ© une seconde , l ' entreprise Ã©tant europÃ©enne avec_des filiales un_peu partout en uk , espagne , etc .. tout paraissait parfait , sauf le dÃ©lai de_livraison qui Ã©tait d ' aprÃ¨s nous un_peu exagÃ©rÃ© mais bon , nous Ã©tions prÃªts Ã  attendre pour obtenir ce que_nous voulions .
F	0 .
F	livraison prÃ©vue la semaine du 00 aoÃ»t 0000 : nous_avons indiquÃ© sur_le site ( dans notre_compte client ) une adresse de_livraison diffÃ©rente de_notre adresse habituelle car nous serions en congÃ©s .
F	0 .
F	lors de ma consultation de_notre_compte au dÃ©but de_l ' Ã©tÃ© , je m ' aperÃ§ois que_le statut de_la commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que la_livraison est passÃ©e Ã _la semaine du 00 septembre .. premiÃ¨re mauvaise surprise .
F	et pas un seul message pour nous prÃ©venir : c ' est Ã  nous de le dÃ©couvrir presque " par hasard ".
F	je rÃ©dige donc un message au service client en demandant pour quelle raison la_livraison est diffÃ©rÃ©e de plus d ' un mois et pour dire que vraiment , lÃ  , Ã§a devient trop long .
F	rÃ©ponse immÃ©diate par tÃ©l + mail ( une dame a laissÃ© un message sur mon rÃ©pondeur en me disant qu ' elle m ' envoyait un email ) : les chaises n ' Ã©taient pas conformes Ã  leurs standards de_qualitÃ© donc ils les font refaire .
F	cette_fois la date de_livraison est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu ' Ã  le confirmer .
F	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en crÃ©ditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord ..) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( Ã  utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
F	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
F	0 .
F	il_y a 0 jours en consultant le compte client , nouvelle " surprise ": la date de_livraison est passÃ©e au 00 novembre pour la mÃªme raison qu ' Ã©voquÃ©e prÃ©cÃ©demment : dÃ©faut de_qualitÃ© , retour Ã _l ' envoyeur et refabrication .
F	cette_fois le compte client comporte un message expliquant tout_ceci , avec nouvelles excuses Ã _la clÃ© .
F	je dÃ©cide de leur Ã©crire afin d ' annuler .
F	tant pis pour_le_prix intÃ©ressant , cela fait 0 mois que_nous attendons des chaises pour complÃ©ter le salon , nos travaux sont finis et on arrÃªte de rigoler .
F	je leur dis dans le mail qu ' ils_ont perdu notre confiance , que c ' est dommage mais que_nous dÃ©sirons le remboursement immÃ©diat .
F	habituellement la rÃ©ponse du service client est immÃ©diate , mais lÃ  , au bout de plus d ' une semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
F	uniquement des accusÃ©s de rÃ©ception envoyÃ©s en automatique .
F	d ' oÃ¹ mon inquiÃ©tude .
F	je me suis donc renseignÃ©e , ai consultÃ© diffÃ©rents forums et suis encore plus inquiÃ¨te !
F	!
F	si tout_ceci devait s ' Ã©terniser , nous_avons trouvÃ© un moyen de faire appel Ã  diffÃ©rentes instances ( avec juristes , etc ..) pour rÃ©gler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les mÃªme problÃ¨mes et tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .
F	il n ' est_pas dans leur intÃ©rÃªt de jouer comme Ã§a avec les nerfs et l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prÃªte Ã  comprendre que des dÃ©lais de fabrication peuvent Ãªtre trÃ¨s allongÃ©s , qu ' ils_ont beaucoup de commandes ( et certainement de rÃ©clamations ) Ã  traiter et qu ' ils sont dÃ©bordÃ©s .
F	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous les forums avec_des commentaires nÃ©gatifs et ne demande qu ' un rÃ¨glement Ã _l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sÃ©rieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et de_la lÃ©gislation .
F	je m ' estimerai satisfaite quand notre demande d ' annulation sera bien prise en compte + quand nous serons remboursÃ©s de_la somme prÃ©levÃ©e .
F	nous aurons perdu un_peu de temps mais pas plus .
F	je rendrai compte rÃ©guliÃ¨rement de_l ' avancÃ©e de tout_ceci sur trustpilot et d ' autres forums / blogs .
F	en espÃ©rant que cette expÃ©rience sera utile et se terminera bien ...
F	00 / 00 : j ai reÃ§u un appel de jeremie de infurn .
F	il m a confirme que_le remboursement avait bien ete fait , ce que_j avais constate moi meme ce matin completement par hasard en consultant notre_compte bancaire en ligne .
F	la societe a donc bien recredite notre carte bancaire avant la fin du delai de 00 jours .
F	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
F	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez_eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les produits disponibles immediatement .
F	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible ...
F	how to say that ?
F	very good communication , fast delivery , perfect service .
F	i will undoubtedly order again from hollins and hollinshead .
F	thanks for all guys !
F	cheers ,
F	alexandra
F	compared to other_sites offering the same services , hostelbookers rates above the rest in my opinion .
F	the site is very easy to navigate and provides all the information to answer my questions .
F	the no booking_fee is an added_bonus !!
F	i definitely_recommend this site to my friends !
F	very good service from start to finish .
F	quick , easy , efficient and love the vintage style of the waiting area , not forgetting the free tea and coffee and yummy biscuits !
F	i ordered one direction tickets yesterday for my sister as a late birthday_present and they arrived today .
F	it was so easy to buy the tickets and had to problems whats so ever .
F	i was nervous_about buying them from website but now i will_definitely be using this website again .
F	i recommend this website with high regards .
F	concert tickets ordered from see tickets and dispatched via dx .
F	i was emailed the day before with confirmation of the delivery date and address .
F	this was all correct and the envelope arrived the next_day as promised .
F	sometimes you have to sign for tickets , however dx will deliver the envelope to the original delivery address without anyone needing to be in , which for me was a bonus and much_easier .
F	very happy .
F	ordering_process was very easy and the shower was delivered within two days , using dpd who have a very good tracking / timing system so you know exactly when the delivery is going to arrive .
F	order was safely_packaged and arrived in good condition .
F	very happy with the service .
F	ordered online , item dispatched the same day and received two days after that .
F	very happy with the service and would use again .
F	i found mattressonline very easy to use , i was able to select the specific day i wanted delivery for , and it turned_up as promised .
F	they state they normally deliver before 0pm which saves you waiting in all day , as it turned_out they delivered around 0 . 00am , at the same time as the bed was delivered ( from a different company !).
F	it was well_packaged and in good condition , and the freebie bounce back pillows are an excellent bonus as we needed some .
F	i would use them again in the future and recommend them to anyone .
F	tryed to buy jewelry set as a present only for the last two days the link saying no deal found after paying , checking my bank_statement this morning to find they ' ve charcged me 00 . 00 twice !!
F	fumming , single hard working mum trying to shop about for presents and now Â£_00 down !!
F	emailed and no reply ,,
F	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
F	county hall is in the heart of london .
F	if you get the right room you can see the london eye and te trees lit up in blue lights from you ' re room window , its delightfull .
F	the breakfast is everything you would want , i just don ' t have a big enough stomach to try it all .
F	my favourite are the sausages and hash browns .
F	go and try it , you will definatly have something to keep you occupied !
F	i was extremely happy with the quality and the expedited service that mazuma_mobile provides .
F	i highly_recommend them .
F	the whole_thing was dealt_with within the week .
F	fast payment_method really was fast !
F	i would strongly_recommend using special or recorded_delivery .
F	call me paranoid , but i also used a brown envelope instead of the ' mazuma branded ' one provided , as i believe these are just an invite for people to pinch your handsets before they reach mazuma !
F	!
F	otherwise , excellent service which i have already_recommended to family .
F	all my transactions with this company have been first_class .
F	the products are excellent and reasonably_priced .
F	delivery is always quick .
F	zavvi has a huge_range of products at competitive_prices and the delivery is not only free but super_fast .
F	i was a little_hesitant to use viagogo at first , thinking some of the reviews were fairly negative .
F	on closer_inspection , all the complaints are regarding the prices .
F	in my opinion , if you use a ticket reseller , it ' s going to be more pricey .
F	deal with it .
F	i booked a very last_minute ticket a couple of days ago - for a gig the next_day .
F	for such a stellar gig and band , the price was only Â£_00 more_than we paid for the face_value tickets .
F	not bad at all - in fact , i ' ve made more of a profit selling unrequired tickets on ebay .
F	ticket was extremely easy to pick_up the next_day and was handily just round the corner from my work .
F	all in all , a brilliant experience and i would fully recommend viagogo to anyone .
F	those complaining_about the prices - pull your finger out and buy the tickets when they first come out .
F	the whole_process was so quick and simple - it took less_than 0 days from registering my old_phones to receive my money .
F	no_quibbles , no stress .
F	i ' ve already started recommending mazuma to all my friends !
F	easy way to make some money and get_rid of those old_phones in the house !
F	delivery on time and brill product !
F	great website to navigate , quick and easy booking system .
F	no booking_fees which is what i like and they have a great selection of accommodation to select .
F	i have always found it reliable and safe to use .
F	last_year i booked a holiday for me and my disabled mother .
F	asked to be near amminties .
F	but was put at the reat of the park but that was , nt the worst of it .
F	it backed onto a 00hr industraul estate .
F	when i triead to post a review 0 times on there own review site .
F	they would not publish it untill there customer_service team have spoken to me .
F	im still_waiting .
F	but have noticed they only publish good reviews .
F	but not bad ones .
F	so i suggest to people not to trust there review site .
F	as its not honest .
F	if park holidays wish to contact me they can :- dp jonah .
F	hanwell .
F	london .

F	we are being forced to shop elseware by tesco being a partners with costa .
F	( costa a lot .)
F	we used to shop at tesco perival and then about five years_ago we stated to spend our Â£_000_+ a week shop went to there hayes middx store and guess_what that store has just becone a cost a lot cafe too .
F	so we are now lfft only with there osterly store and will contion to shop at that store .
F	but tesco be warned if you decicde to change ostley cafe .
F	to a costa a lot .
F	sainsburt here we come .
F	dpj000 .
F	i had to wait for weeks for masterplug surge proter to come into there hayes middx stores .
F	( the usual argos service .)
F	i reserved them to go on there on tueday .
F	only to waste my time and petrol as it was to come in at0000 that day .
F	so i went back on the friday of that week .
F	i went to pay with them with capital bonds and the manager refused them saying they was probley stolen .
F	i went home and rang capital bonds who told me no way should argos have refused them .
F	i then rang argos headoffice only to get lipservice appoilges and nothing else .
F	so if like me you should avoid argos like a shot .
F	they dont half the time have the item you want in stock .
F	shop at amazon e bay etc .
F	which is what i will do in future .
F	they have a lot better customer care .
F	dpj000 .
F	tesco is driving us to there rivals with there cafes .
F	we used to go to tesco perival then they bought in costa .
F	( costa a lot .)
F	tsince then we have been useing there hayes middx stores for years now .
F	and guess_what there hayes store is now a cost you lots cafe .
F	so now we are limeted to there ostley store .
F	that is until cost a lot decieds to take there cafe over .
F	and then we will be taking our Â£_000_+ aweek shop to sainsbury .
F	so well_done tesco for shooting yourselfs in the foot .
F	and losing loyal_customers throucj your prtniship with c0sta .
F	dpj000 /
F	i use screwfix a lot . along with toolstation .
F	but with both companys .
F	if things go_wrong .
F	mainy when they ppost things to you0 they take no responyilty for there postal couriers .
F	which is dam wrong .
F	but .
F	my latest experience takes the biscuit .
F	i went to my local southall store .
F	00 / 00 / 00 .
F	to pick_up a item i had reserved on line .
F	yo queue up for agais yet again .
F	as they never have enogh staff there to serve .
F	they gave me the item in a bag .
F	away i went .
F	only to open it later .
F	and find it was a used damaged item .
F	but !
F	i didnt think i had anything to worry_about .
F	i just rang customer_service .
F	thinking they would send me another one .
F	by post .
F	___ wrong . ___ they wouldnt .
F	they justinsited i went back to store again .
F	well i dont know about you !
F	but i havent the time to waste in taffic and queinf up again in there store which !
F	is always short staffed .
F	for there error in selling me a second_hand item in the first place .
F	so i will be giving them a lot less business in future and recomed other people who use them to think elsewhere for there supplies .
F	and like a lot of reviews .
F	ive read .
F	they are getting exspenve i find toolstation .
F	cheaper in about 00_% of goods anyway .
F	dpj000 .
F	---
F	we use asda a bit .
F	the park royal cafe inside its store is crap .
F	several_times we havent eaten there because the food is overcooked and disgusting .
F	and when you ask them for something fresh .
F	they have , nt got it .
F	because they are too busy standing around gossiping .
F	cooking food in bulk and leving it around for ages .
F	three times we have complained to its managers .
F	and to head_office .
F	although they make the right noises .
F	abuot there cafe staff nothings done .
F	i suggest asda pays there cafe staff a decent wage .
F	and sack there present park royal cafe staff .
F	and to any customer who . s thinking of eating there .
F	_____ dont . _______ unless you want food poising .
F	not to bad .
F	nearly always gets me to right sites .
F	i like the ease of use .
F	very good .
F	very prompt .
F	on sending my product .
F	we left booking our holiday until 0 days before travelling , with a busy work schedule it seemed we would need to use an agent for the first time ever .
F	i was anxious to start with as have always travelled independently , booking directly with the hotel .
F	what can i say but how absolutely_brilliant linda was throughout the whole_process , finding us what we really were looking for .
F	we couldn ' t have organised it without her .
F	if the holiday is as fantastic as the service so far we will_definitely be booking through linda , and holiday please again .
F	thankyou .
F	really great , easy way of getting a take out in a larger town , and im sure as the site develops more and more businesses will eventually post their menus etc .
F	living in a smaller town on a weekend however proves to be a bit of a nightmare .
F	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
F	ok service , would recommend .
F	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
F	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
F	they couldn ' t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn ' t helped the problem at all .
F	next time , i think i will send it to htc directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when i explained it to them .
F	apart_from that , o0 are still a good company , but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep up with their competitors .
F	buying a domain is an_absolute bargain .
F	however the hosting options seem a little expensive in comparison to their competitors .
F	switching hosts proved to be a little frustrating and the agent i was contacting proved to be less_than helpful .
F	would recommend for cheap domains , but for the rest of the service , including buying email accounts , head somewhere_else for a much more affordable service .
F	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
F	i used aol before switching to bt , which i still remain on til this day .
F	the customer_service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
F	not a month went by without a fault or problem , incredibly_frustrating .
F	the customer_service was mediocre .
F	occasionally they would manage to reset the line ?
F	and it would magically turn back on .
F	other times this didn ' t work and we had to wait it out to retrieve connection again .
F	bit of a nightmare .
F	since the wildfire was brought out , i have never considered using any other phone manufacturer .
F	the design of the handset reassures you that you have a durable and high_quality phone .
F	the android operating_system is perfect .
F	i have played around on a lot of i phones and other smart phones , but htc make other models my different manufacturers just seem like a child ' s toy .
F	would recommend if you want a powerful and sleek looking phone without the designer price_tag ( apple ).
F	when it comes to the delivery of any parcels i purchase or sell online , it has to be city_link delivering .
F	not only can you feel rest_assured that they will actually turn_up when they say they will ( unlike the vast_majority of other courier companies ) but the service is always fast , efficient and friendly .
F	can ' t fault them , perfect .
F	i purchased everything i needed to build my pc from this shop .
F	it all arrived_safely and in good condition .
F	wouldn ' t hesitate in using again , as they are incredibly fast and efficient
F	richer sounds by_far had the cheapest model of tv that i wanted .
F	i called ahead to reserve it , no problem .
F	they offered to extend the reservation just in case i couldn ' t make it .
F	in the store itself all of the staff were incredibly_helpful and friendly , quick service and carried it to my car for me too .
F	really couldn ' t ask for more .
F	would not hesitate recommending or using again , truly excellent service .
F	easy as always .
F	the only thing i would say is i ' d like to see my tickets in my basket in chronological order ...
F	i added them back to front and then got confused !
F	!
F	i ordered a product and specified a separate delivery address ( my work ) to my billing_address ( my family home ).
F	it arrived very quickly but i only found out when my mum called me to say that i had post .
F	i avoid deliveries to my flat as it ' s not very secure but it ' s inconvenient to have to travel to my mum ' s house to pick_up some makeup !
F	!
F	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn ' t match .
F	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it ' s a very low ticket item .
F	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn ' t happen again .
F	i have ordered several_times from chemist_direct and always been pleased with the efficient service and straightforward website .
F	i always get contacted with relevant deals which i ' m happy to receive thanks guys keep up the good work !
F	ordered on 00th_march .
F	now 0th_april and still_waiting .
F	no communication at all from them .
F	can find no fault with them .
F	constant emails to update on status .. watch arrived when they said it would .
F	follow_up emails to make_sure all was okay .
F	would strongly_recommend them .
F	why pay more ?
F	john_lewis could not give better service !
F	well working , easy to install ram , delivered quickly and efficiently .
F	i ' m waiting on the delivery of a new mobile phone ( not an i - phone ) that was arranged to be delivered yesterday , but no - one was in to sign for it so i got a sorry we missed you card which is fair_enough .
F	but i ' ve taken today off work to make_sure i was in for my delivery , but instead i ' ve got an e_- mail telling_me that dpd attempted to deliver my parcel and no - one was in .
F	well i am in , and have been in all morning .
F	no calling_card was left , so they clearly just didn ' t attempt to deliver it .
F	there seems to be no way you can call the company and speak to anyone in person either .
F	not impressed
F	the package has been dispatched two months_ago , until now i ' ve never received a word from it .
F	everytime i send an_email to contact the service center , there ' s only an automatical mail response .
F	i really suspect if there ' s a real employee working on this part !
F	well , finally i receive my package in a week aftre filling in the replacement form .
F	i will strongly_suggest to choose the delivery with charge if u really want to buy sth here .
F	they try and if they get it wrong they put it right , what more could you ask for ?
F	this company is usually 00_% brilliant and if something wrong ever happens they sort it .
F	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
F	have used warehouse aquatics for several years now and theyv always been brilliant - staff are really helpful and im always infomred about my delivery
F	best price , regular_updates , very speedy_delivery and i ' m sure lots of happy customers , myself included .
F	thank_you .
F	we ordered a sofa from argos and was informed it would be delivered on the 0th of december_0000 after waiting in all day and with no contact from argos themselves we eventually rang there 0000 higher call charge customer_service centre .
F	this is when the trouble began ...... we were informed the sofa was not even in stock and should not expect delivery until the end of january , unfortunately due to expecting delivery of our new sofa on the 0th of dec we had parted with out current sofa to make room .
F	due to this we were informed we could choose another sofa which could be delivered in time for christmas with Â£_00 compensation added on due to their mistake great !!!!
F	so on the 00th of december we again waited for the arrival of our sofa as promised and guess_what ????
F	no phone_calls and no sofa .... after contacting argos ' s dreadful customer_service centre we were again informed the sofa we had been promised delivery of for the second time was also not in stock .
F	it seems argos are happy to sell items they do not have in stock and give customers completely made up delivery dates just to make a sale .
F	they have no regards for customer_satisfaction and are unreliable and unhelpful in every way .
F	i would not recommend using argos for any item which requires delivery unless you like surprises and are willing to wait and see when your item will finally arrive .
F	as above i did but no response from them .
F	customer_service is worst than the hell .
F	i don ' t find anything to write beside my anger .
F	i saw it when i first registered at this site , i was having a problem with entering my address and before i knew it i had help option to ask if they could help - i was then assisted with the greatest professionalism and was able to register and make my first deposit , no problem .
F	again i visited winner today and found that the site was a refreshing_change to others that i had previously visited .
F	the navigation was tremendous as was the nice welcome_bonus that i received - always helps .
F	i think the design is top_notch and is looking_forward to my next visit .
F	most of these casino sites are all the same but this one offered something different which i enjoyed and would push others to as well , winner . com is one of the pioneers to give players some variations each time .
F	wonderful customer_service and nice payouts .
F	very fast withdrawals .
F	plenty of games to satisfy everyone and nice graphics , really user_friendly !
F	well_done .
F	the promotions are really worth their while the site is very user_friendly and easy to understand for first time online gamers .
F	bingo cams is the best site i ' ve ever been on and i ve been on load . they offer load of bonus and i ' ve made some good friend on this site the chat_host make the site with the excitement and funny this they do to make us laugh and the thing bingo players make them do just love this site well_done bingo cams
F	any orders placed during the time advertised will not come on time
F	avoid at all costs as this company can not get an order wrong go over customers heads and change orders and the options you are on dont ever go with bt
F	slow connection try to cancel aren ' t able to i have spent days trying to get them to terminate my account still trying with no success
F	never go to three avoid at all costs customer_service is appealing cant cancel or change your service plan for the whole 00 month_contract have been a 00 customer for years would recommend o0 over three wish i never went to them as theyndont have the first idea on how to deal with complaints leave you hanging on the phone for hours on end in the end i have given up trying to reason with them info hope that when my contact comes up for renewal i will be able to cancel .
F	i haven ' t yet used cd to the full , in fact only once , but they have explained everything really well also made it so i could use them easier for my abilities , very understanding and officiant , leaving me satisfied to use them with confidence on the many transactions in the future .
F	loved the shop on high_street and my lunchtime favourite !!
F	will be missed
F	my first review had to get my heart out !!!
F	paid for 0 mb getting hardly 0mb .
F	cannot even watch iplayer !!!
F	avoid like plague asking for my money back
F	ordered couple of dresses and couple of pair of shoes .
F	just arrived this morning .
F	i must_say what an amazing find .
F	well_packaged and just Â£ 0 . 00 for each what a bargain .
F	postage was Â£ 0 . 00 for 0 items which i would say is reasonable .
F	happy and love it love it love it !!!
F	recommend to every one .
F	last_minute booking but easy to deal with and communicate .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	thank_you neil !
F	great website that allows you to see what others think of the hostels - and what they are really like !!
F	also great to quickly see whereabouts the hostels are located and if they are right for me and the trip i ' m taking .
F	simple quick and easy booking process as well !
F	!
F	brilliant products and services , my baby and i both using their products , highly_recommended !
F	easy to use website , clear_instructions , found my phone quickly .
F	i returned my phone by printing my own labels and payment was received promptly .
F	it couldnt have been easier .
F	great service pleased with payment , no hassle , easy to deal with and quick payment
F	was given help from daniel with a problem i had with a booking .
F	very fast and friendly .
F	if only all customer_services could be this helpful !
F	many_thanks .
F	this ' company ' is shambolic .
F	they took my money , didn ' t email or contact me in any manner to confirm my booking and didn ' t deliver the product i ' d ordered either .
F	thank_god i paid with paypal otherwise i ' d probably never have got my money back .
F	they do not answer the phones or emails .
F	this company has been reported to trading_standards and with any luck they ' ll be forced to cease trading .
F	never ever go anywhere_near them .
F	i got ripped_off twice by previous companies ' selling ' the same product .
F	the first one couldn ' t provide the product i ' d paid for and the second one failed to respond to my order at all resulting in me having to contact trading_standards .
F	0rd time lucky in my case .
F	wantthelook . com provided exactly_what i ' d asked and paid for with no hassle .
F	very reasonable prices and free delivery .
F	i have no issues with this company at all and would like to thank them for finally putting right what other_companies had previously mucked up .
F	thank_you !
F	!
F	i made a spontaneous purchase after seeing an advert on the tv for the watch shop .
F	i ' ve seen people wearing a particular watch that has always caught my eye but i never knew what it was .
F	i hopped online , went straight to the sale section and there it was , the watch i ' d liked so much and it was on offer at 00_%_off too - bargain !
F	very easy to pay ( i used paypal , it takes seconds ) and then i was quite surprised that they were offering free next_day delivery .
F	true to their word , the watch arrived shortly before 0000hrs on saturday .
F	very well_packaged and even nicer_than it looked online .
F	all in all , very pleased with the online shopping_experience with watchshop . com .
F	i ' ve used boots online many_times now but my most_recent_purchase was a new electric toothbrush .
F	i treated myself to the most expensive philips sonicare brush that they offered which then turned_out to be half price with an extra 00_%_off too !
F	a Â£_000 toothbrush ordered and delivered all for Â£_000 .
F	what an amazing saving .
F	it was delivered on time as promised and not a single thing to complain_about .
F	very pleased and will_continue to use boots both online and in store .
F	i came_across this website quite by_accident .
F	i ' d spent weeks looking online for outdoor clothes suppliers and i was looking for a particular brand .
F	the company was cheaper_than previous companies offering the same product and they had a wide_choice of warm / wet weather clothing .
F	at point of checkout i was offered a variety of delivery options but next_day anytime was being offered at the same price as other options .
F	not quite believing they ' d live up to the promise , i opted for next_day anyway ( why not ?!)
F	and true to their word my items were delivered less_than 00_hours after i ' d placed my order .
F	communication was good , i was kept_informed at every_stage of the order and it was also fully trackable .
F	as a customer , what more could you want .
F	as a more_than experienced online shopper , there is only one other company that i ' ve ever been as impressed with as outdoor_kit .
F	well_done .
F	i am very pleased with my first purchase from complete_aquatics .
F	i had searched several websites for the items i wanted and all of them were cheaper by at_least Â£ 0 from complete_aquatics than competitive businesses , including the one that i originally bought my aquarium from .
F	also , my order was placed at 0000am on a friday_morning and it had arrived , in full by 0000pm the next_day .
F	i received good communication from the company , you can ' t get better_than that .
F	first time using this company , and it was an_absolute pleasure !
F	i bought bracelets , they arrived a little over 00hrs later !!
F	they ' re gorgeous , exactly as_described all packed securely , what more could you want !
F	?
F	i will_definately use again and recommend to friends .
F	fast delivery , high_quality foods , very tasty !
F	the order arrived very quickly ; have used them several_times as they ' re nearly always the cheapest around !
F	this place is buy far the best , yes the shipping may be high but if you add in all the free_samples you get to try out its totally worth it what i would spend on another site for the same products with free shipping would be way more .
F	i got 0 things for the price it cost for one on another site .
F	i popped in for card toppers and found what i needed easily ( and ended_up buying more !)
F	the guy on the tills was friendly and enthusiastic .
F	i also attend a knitting group and crochet group in store and we are welcomed and made to feel special
F	the process overall only took four days , that included me requesting a pack to send my mobile to mazuma in the post , mazuma recieving my mobile , and then me recieving my chosen payment option in the post .
F	i think the service is fantastic , fast and reliable and i would definately_reccomend it .
F	i could easily keep_track of my order on the website so i wasn ' t in the dark about the process and from the emails i recieved and information on the website , it explained everything i needed to know so the process was easy , stress_free and fast .
F	thanks mazuma !
F	i can ' t believe_how quick and easy the process was .
F	thought there must be a catch ... there wasn ' t
F	i ordered a few things for my friends birthday a week before her_birthday , and checked the delivery box which was 0st_class royal_mail , which said it should be delivered within 0 - 0 days , i thought that gave me plenty of time honestly , now , exactly 0 days after i ' ve placed my order , the delivery still_hasn ' t come , my friends birthday has passed and basically the customer_service team couldn ' t have been less helpful , a lot of " if it hasn ' t arrived by such an such a date then we can declare it as lost ", that ' s not really good enough is it , especially when i paid extra for it to arrive earlier !
F	waste of time .
F	i popped in with my children and was happy at how welcome we were all made to feel .
F	very friendly , knowledgeable_staff and a fantastic range of ladies and kids wear alongside the pro kit .
F	something for everyone !
F	!
F	many_thanks
F	i have used mazuma_mobile twice now to sell 0 old_phones and i have found their website useful - they send confirmation emails that eased your mind , and kept you updated with the process .
F	it ' s good to know that my old_phones are going to use elsewhere , and the amount i have been paid has been good .
F	this is definitely a service i trust and will_continue to use in future .
F	i have recommended this to my boyfriend and friends too , who have all benefitted from this service .
F	i had a rubbish old bike that i ' d bought for Â£_00 and was using it to get to work when a colleague said we used cyclescheme .
F	i jumped at it - a new bike , tax free , that comes directly out of my wage .
F	what ' s not to love ?
F	head out to a cyclescheme bike shop near you , which can be found on their site , and get a quote .
F	give it back to your employer who will work their magic and you ' ll get a confirmation_email with a code that allows you to collect your bike .
F	i ' ve got fit , improved my mood , improved my productivity at work and use my bike to collect shopping etc ( i don ' t drive ) so it ' s been an_absolute life_saver .
F	you can also add in clothing , lights and safety equipment if you need it ( but i already had my own from my old bike ).
F	there ' s no reason not to do it .
F	my other half recently passed his ppl and this was a surprise gift .
F	the wings arrived_promptly in a padded_envelope and came in a lovely decorative box .
F	he was really happy with them .
F	what could go_wrong with this .
F	fantastic company , kudos to moneysavingexpert .
F	i always use this when looking for anything !
F	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
F	since then we ' ve had numerous charges that shouldn ' t have been on there .
F	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
F	they then say they ' ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn ' t actually appear to happen ).
F	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over Â£_000 for leaving the previous contract early and Â£_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
F	remember to write down the vol id number when dealing_with them , as they are sloppy in keeping their promises .
F	i almost always purchase my electrical_items from john_lewis .
F	the shops are always a pleasure to walk around , the staff are helpful , and they also offer an attractive warranty on the products .
F	previously i had an item that went wrong for some reason , and john_lewis replaced it straight_away without any_issues .
F	fantastic company , i have a lot of respect for the business and always recommend people to buy there .
F	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
F	there ' s nothing wrong with this , but it ' s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
F	we ' ve been looking for a tablet for a while now , and jexaa helped_us choose a tablet that suited the needs of myself and my wife .
F	not once did they push us into the sale , but were honest and open about the uses for each tablet which we found rare to come by .
F	the order was placed , and we received the tablet 0 days_later .
F	the ' jextab ' works great ; has some nice features too , and cost a fraction of the other tablets out there which put a smile on my face :)
F	good work jexaa .
F	i was searching for a company who did great standard canvas_prints at reasonable prices and came_across orbit_print ltd .
F	i have never ordered canvas_prints before , and wanted to get some of my personal prints done but didnt know where to go and who to trust with my pictures .
F	i was so pleased when i received my order as the quality was perfect and the prices even better .
F	i am a very happy customer - thank_you !
F	i was very impressed with the prices and range of product .
F	i also liked that there was a free delivery option on orders over Â£_00 , which i thought was very reasonable .
F	i ' m a 00 year_old writing on my mums phone and all i can say is that it was amazing .
F	they helped_me too choose my converse which i have now fell in love with , and then took a picture and posted it on facebook !
F	it said ' evie looking cool in her new mint converse !
F	', which made me feel special and at home .
F	when i saw the facebook post it made me smile and feel welcomed .
F	the way they make you feel_like you are the princess , by reccomend beautiful tootoos and
F	good communication , great delivery , no_complaints :)
F	could improve range of products .
F	website doesn ' t look very professional .
F	i recently_purchased the knomo avignon extra slim brief 00 â³, black , from right bag .
F	i had been looking for this particular laptop case for a while and found that right bag had this not only in stock , but at a lower_price to all of the other stores i had looked at .
F	the site was really user_friendly and easy navigate around , with good images of the product too .
F	i wanted a slim case and felt i got a good perspective of this from the images on the product page .
F	i opted for the free delivery option ( which i was also pleased they offered ) and this arrived_promptly ( 0 days_later by royal_mail ) with good protective packaging .
F	i have been made up with the case and would definitely_recommend right bag to others .
F	i ' ve never dealt_with such incompetence in my life !
F	first , an order i made with a 00_%_discount_code was to be delivered by december 00th , which is great because i wanted it for christmas .
F	oh !
F	what ' s that you say ?
F	your tracking_info won ' t update and you can ' t locate your order ?
F	oh - how convenient .
F	so i contact customer_service .
F	they inform me that there ' s a technical issue with their tracking_system and assure me the order will be here by the 00th - the latest .
F	oh !
F	going on the 00th .
F	so needless to say , i didn ' t get this by christmas .
F	but it gets better ...
F	i figure , maybe i ' ll get it on the 00th , you know - because of the holidays , and they have a few more nice items i like , let me get those .
F	i ' ve dropped $_000 after this point .
F	i select express shipping !
F	i ' ll have something nice in time for new years_eve because it will be here by friday the latest .
F	wonderful !
F	i checkout and go on about my business .
F	i noticed , however , that i didn ' t get the dispatch email , so i check out my account on the 00th .
F	standard shipping ?
F	oh , ok . we ' re about this life .
F	i contact customer_service , thinking it ' s a website glitch and maybe they can fix it within the 0 hour time_frame posted on their site .
F	0 hours_later i get an_email_saying , i didn ' t choose express shipping even_though i entered in the promo_code .
F	so in turn my order won ' t be here for a max 0 business days .
F	oh , really ?
F	you think so ?
F	this in turn prompted my urbanista to come out full force , because there ' s nothing that pisses me off more_than someone not taking accountability and then saying it ' s my fault .
F	i go on a email rampage .
F	i dig into this guy .
F	at this point , i now know i ' m not getting my stuff so i just go h . a . m .
F	it is what it is , so lets do this .
F	0 hours_later i get another response telling_me that i didn ' t receive express shipping not because i supposedly forgot to choose it at checkout , but because i used a 00_%_discount_code and i can ' t double codes up .
F	what ?
F	you mean the 00_% i used with my previous order ?
F	now you guys are just being ig - nant .
F	so again , i have to correct these people - stop pointing the finger , get your facts straight , and find my stuff .
F	now i take it to facebook .
F	i unleash my discontent on their wall and receive the generic " pm me so i can help you " response .
F	ok , cool .
F	lets play this game - i love games .
F	i go through the motions again , explaining all the bullshit that ' s been happening .
F	while i ' m doing this i get yet another email via asos .
F	this time they tell me there is a technical issue with my form of payment ( paypal ) which is why it did not take my request .
F	but don ' t worry they ' re working on it and here ' s 00_% and another express shipping coupon_code .
F	oh !
F	the coupon_code that won ' t work , ergo our issue at hand ?
F	brilliant !
F	keep it up !
F	i love it !
F	how does that help me ?
F	back to facebook .
F	someone slips up and tells_me who the courier service is .
F	oh !
F	let me contact them .
F	i have to call back because the one person that handles asos is out of the office .
F	how convenient .
F	so , kids .
F	$_000 later i have nothing .
F	no packages , no dresses , nothing for nye , nothing for christmas ... zero !
F	now that i ' m out of options - annoying these people is my current goal ( lack of funds being my motivation ) and will_continue to annoy them until someone gives me my merchandise or my money .
F	and frankly all i want right now is my money !
F	iv been a customer for 0 years with baby lurve when they started off on ebay and the service and care they give is second to non .
F	all items are packed and sent with lurve and care .
F	if your looking for a company that posts next_day and has free delivery then baby lurve is for you :) x
F	go on fall in lurve !
F	i have purchased from precious_little ones twice now and have been very happy with my pink lining products would highly_recommend them to anyone .
F	keep up with the lovely work precious_little ones x
F	having been greeted_by the words " mum , you know you love me ", the words every parent dreads hearing because they know something is going to cost a small_fortune , i turned to my teenage son with trepidation .
F	" if i give you the money back , can you get me xbox_live ?"
F	bam !!!
F	there it is , the request for spending Â£_00 straight out .
F	ouch !
F	but after a little internet search i came_across this fab website cdkeys . com , that saved me money ( instant parent happiness ) was an immediate digital delivery ( instant teenage happiness ) and is probably one of the easiest websites to use ( instant brain happiness ) plus i get cool mum points for saying yes !
F	:) thanks for making our weekend - the ( happy ) vance family
F	i was a little optimistic about ordering off the site because the prices were so cheap , i thought it was maybe some kind of scam site or the perfumes were fake , but i was totally wrong !
F	the service was excellent , had no problem ordering my perfume and it arrived within a few_days .
F	when my item came it was sealed and in perfect_condition .
F	it was also parfum and not toilette i got my perfume for around Â£_00 for 000ml when another shop on the high_street which i wont name was charging Â£_00 for 00ml !
F	excellent value , excellent service , excellent delivery and its hard to say that about a company now a days !
F	thank_you !
F	i traveled all over europe for a few_months and my favorite accomodation was de lis guesthouse by_far .
F	it ' s housed in the second floor of an apartment building and has the feel of renting an apartment with all of its amenities rather_than a hostel it was clean , modern , stylish and quiet .
F	easy walk to all attractions , las rhamblas and is directly between two metro stops making it very easy to get around .
F	the hostel is associated with an entertainment group , de lis group , that hosts the best parties in barcelona .
F	and while the party is not brought back to the hostel kike and pedro are so helpful in ensuring you have the best time in the city with insight_into the best nightlife , restaurants and activities .
F	i would recommend this hostel to anyone , don ' t think_twice just book it .
F	made barcelona one of my favorite places in all of europe !
F	i ordered glasses from smartbuyglasses . co . uk on 00th of january and i have still not received them .
F	besides from the fact that someone on customer_service offered me a discount as a compensation for long waiting but they charged me the full price , and my glasses haven ' t still arrived !
F	and no one is responding on my emails to customer_service from 00 / 00 /_0000 !
F	it ' s been almost a month and no one is informing_me about my order , moreover they are ignoring me !
F	very rude !!
F	!
F	i am very disappointed !
F	!
F	and i wouldn ' t recommend smartbuyglasses to anyone !
F	i was the lucky recipient of a blue nile diamond engagement_ring .
F	a year after i received it i sent it back to have it resized slightly - what a dream to work with their customer_service team !
F	we dealt_with lesley townsend , who was an_absolute stunner .
F	when it was time for us to get married , we didn ' t hesitate to buy our_wedding_bands from here - i ' d guess it was about 00_% lower_than high_street prices and , once again , we received outstanding customer_service .
F	i was also lucky_enough to receive - as a wedding gift from my husband ... yes , he is wonderful - a set of earrings from blue nile as a wedding gift .
F	suffice to say that we will never buy diamonds anywhere_else !
F	thank_you blue nile !
F	i ' ve just decided to take up a swimming career .
F	yes , yes , at this stage of life i should just give up and hand myself over to muffin tops and stretchy spandex .
F	but i ' m not quite there .
F	i booked the swim training course and realised that my string bikini ( the faded one with the saggy bum ) just wouldn ' t do .
F	after a bit of searching online i landed on the simplyswim website where the prices were much_better_than on others and the selection on offer was astounding .
F	within two days of placing my order my entire swim outfit - and - gear arrived at my front_door .
F	i look the part .
F	until i get into the water , that is !
F	after a stressful few weeks in the run up to our move , the day i was dreading arrived and i couldn ' t have hoped for a more seamless move !
F	workers were extremely professional and so helpful .
F	nothing was too much_trouble , the only item during the whole move that got broken was a lamp that my husband dropped ( typical !)
F	- in fact , they probably packed everything with far more care than i would have done myself !!!
F	by bedtime our new home was in a surprisingly organised state !!!
F	i recommended safe removals to a work colleague when she moved last month and she can ' t speak highly_enough of them either now .
F	really glad i found safe removals and would recommend them to others absolutely without_hesitation .
F	a very nice fitter named karl came to change two of my tyres for me .
F	exremely friendly and did a very professional job .
F	very fast and convenient service and i would definitely use grippy again .
F	thank_you !
F	great company who offer cashback on all your shopping .
F	have never had an issue and would recommend topcashback . co . uk unreservedly .
F	my partner and i bought contract mobile_phones on a cashback plan through buymobilephones . net in february_0000 .
F	the phones arrived in good time and there were no apparent issues .
F	the scheme was ' cashback by redemption ' meaning that we had to mail in our statements and a voucher every few_months ( with increasing regularity ) through the 0 year term of the contract .
F	complicated and fiddly , but at the first claim date we diligently gathered together 0 months of statements and the vouchers and sent our packages off , awaiting a return of Â£_00 each .
F	imagine our dismay when we heard absolutely nothing .
F	on contacting the company we were asked whether we had used recorded mail .
F	in their small_print they ' recommend ' using recorded mail and mysteriously , without it , * both * of our packages had gone_missing - despite being sent separately , at different times from different post offices .
F	suspicious , much ??
F	Â£_000 gone as we were now too_late to claim again .
F	so it was with some hesitation that we sent our next lot of statements and vouchers off - by recorded_delivery .
F	mine were returned because i had missed one of the statements .
F	my partner ' s was paid in full , but when i returned all the correct statements i was only given a part payment - no explanation was ever offered .
F	our third batch of statements has been sent and we are awaiting our latest payments .
F	an_email confirmation of receipt from them is dated 0 / 0 / 00 but on 0 / 0 / 00 i am still_waiting to see if i am going to actually receive a payment from them , which can take ' up to 00 days .'
F	i will * never * buy from this company again and have warned everyone - friends and enemies - to steer_clear .
F	it is a scam company .
F	they are incredibly dishonest and deceptive .
F	the way that their ' cashback by redemption ' scheme is set_up is designed to prevent people claiming at every_step - the vouchers which , if lost , cannot be replaced , the fact that non - recorded mail goes in the shredder rather_than being_processed , the fact that they are so picky about which pages of your statements you send (" if in doubt , send the whole bill " - yeah , so i am going to send you my itemised , 00 page bill x 0 ?!
F	i don ' t think so !
F	), the fact that they take so long to make a payment so that by the time you realise you haven ' t been paid , or haven ' t been paid in full , it is ' past the claim date ' and too_late to do anything about it .
F	all in all , a very nasty , dishonest company .
F	learn from my mistake and find somewhere_else to buy your phone - it might look like a bargain but it ' s just an elaborate scam .
F	i decided to move from sky to talktalk a few_months_ago from sky .
F	worst decision ever !!!!
F	the internet is lagging as is the tv guide interface .
F	using multiple devices connected to the internet is slow to the point of being almost unusable .
F	so when i decided to move home i checked the cost of cancelling my contract Â£_000 . 00 not the kind of money most people have to throw_away .
F	so begrudgingly i starting arranging to move the services over to my new home only to find that i would be renewing the 00 month minimum contract something i did not want to do .
F	so i rang talktalk and was told i could transfer my contract to someone_else ( i ' m not lumbering someone_else with this rubbish ) pay the extortionate cancellation_fee in a lump_sum that would be taken from my account or put up and shut up and get on with another 00 months of this garbage .
F	fantastic :-/ i would advise to never join talktalk !!!!!!!
F	!
F	excellent service does exactly_what it says on the tin .
F	brought my son a 0 th generation i pod touch for his_birthday they explained it had a few scratches on it and stated where and it was a lot smaller_than_expected .
F	on the side too so you couldn ' t notice .
F	it came in original_packaging with new charge lead and earphone buds restored to factory settings my son to this day never new it was pre_owned .
F	saved my self 00 quid on a new one so well happy !!!
F	oh and i ordered tuesday night arrived thursday_morning and lots of text_messages to tell me when it would arrive !!
F	!
F	wow what a company !
F	i ' ve been desperately searching for some katy perry tickets and this company go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible seats !
F	excellent communication , despite the bank_holiday tickets arrived special delivery within 00_hours !
F	i would recommend this company to everybody reliable , amazing customer_service and attention to detail !
F	i will be using this company in the future to book all my concerts !
F	keep up the good work !
F	you now have a very loyal_customer in me !
F	i found everything i needed to make my desired dish ( sushi ) and even information on the products , recommendations , and the discounts helped my buy more for less ... will_definitely use this site again
F	very pleased with the service i received from partyrama , delivery was fast and all the items were packed very secure so no items broke .
F	would use them again for all my party essentials .
F	i ' ve thought about selling my old_phones for a while now .
F	i chose mazuma due to their other positive_reviews and was pleasantly_surprised at how smooth the whole_process was !
F	i ordered the envelope from them , that arrived a few_days_later .
F	i received an_email a few_days_later as a reminder ( which is lucky as i had forgotten !
F	), popped them in some packaging and took them to the post_office .
F	a couple of days_later i received an_email_stating that they had arrived , a couple of hours_later and another email letting me know that they had been tested and that the payment would be with me by the end of the day .
F	00_minutes later the funds were in my bank !
F	could not be_happier !
F	just_eat has not only provided an excellent service but we have discovered so many tasty restaurants in our area that we probably would never have visited otherwise !
F	the site is easy to use , and cuisines ordered so you can really easily pick whatever takes your fancy that evening .
F	the reviews are helpful to weed out the particularly tasty ones .
F	i honestly don ' t know what we ' d do without just_eat !
F	our weekends certainly wouldnt be the same !
F	my doctor prescribed me ibuprofen , it cost me Â£ 0 . 00 for 0 packets instead of the nhs prescription charge of over Â£ 0 !
F	quick delivery , not a problem at all .
F	would certainly recommend !
F	ordered late on friday_night and chose saturday delivery , panicked a little when i received a dispatched email on the saturday knowing i wouldnt be in during the week due to work , but my package was delivered safe and sound the following saturday as hoped !
F	everything was great !
F	cannot knock the price and quality !
F	look_forward to shopping from boohoo . com more in the future !
F	amazingly packaged , amazing selection , and great prices , can ' t fault a single aspect of the site .
F	ordered a Â£_00 bouquet which arrived virtually dead and the ' handwritten note ' scrawled on a piece of cardboard , after emailing them i received a response asking for a photo .
F	after sending this and 0 emails later still no reply .
F	absolutely awful service and awful flowers !
F	most were green foliage !
F	i highly advise_anyone considering this company to think again !
F	i ' ve seen healthier , fuller bouquets in service stations !
F	over priced and utterly awful customer_service .
F	i ordered a bouquet for a friend ' s birthday which was supposed to consist of white roses and purple freesias and paid extra to include a further 00 %.
F	it looked lovely on the website but when it arrived my friend sent me a picture and it actually only contained the white roses and didn ' t look very special at all .
F	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn ' t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
F	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
F	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
F	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
F	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
F	i am completely dissatisfied with the overall experience .
F	eflorist may be slightly_cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer_service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
F	i would not use this company again and would warn friends that were thinking of doing so .
F	i was unsure of what to expect when i began my hnc / d with rdi a year_ago .
F	i have never acheived acedimic success at school and knew i might struggle with the content .
F	however i was amazed to find how much i was suited to distance_learning .
F	i find the subjects interesting and the tutor support great and love the sense of achievement it has given me .
F	i push myself very hard but its paid off and i am 00 modules into my program with only 0 left to complete .
F	i now can ' t wait to start my final year and get a degree and i never thought i would be saying that !
F	distance_learning is the future and i would recommend it to anybody that wanted to achieve :-)
F	ordered a few items with next_day delivery all arrived with no_problems and products of decent quality .
F	really happy with this company .
F	my order arrived very quickly , and the price was the lowest i could find anywhere .
F	i purchased at the beginning of the year , just as the vat rate changed .
F	the system accidentally charged me the new rate early , but the company quickly refunded it .
F	this company took my money , but never sent my order .
F	i tried_emailing them and phoning them for months .
F	apparently it is run by praba thevathasan and francis sathish babu ( who also runs it jack ).
F	but i was never able to get hold of either of these people , so i after 0 months i have lost my Â£_000 .
F	really pleased with the selection of products on this site , and the speed of delivery !
F	if you are spending over Â£_00 , you can ' t beat kiddicare .
F	their delivery service is great , sending you a text on the day to let you know the delivery time .
F	it doesn ' t always work out perfectly , as you can ' t select the slot , but you can postpone to the next_day ( again you can ' t select the slot ).
F	but it is much_better_than having a random courier delivery .
F	for smaller purchases , the Â£ 0 . 00 delivery cost is a bit of a stinger though .
F	brilliant range of products and often the cheapest .
F	the selection of products on amazon is huge .
F	the prices usually seem to be the cheapest compared to other online_retailers .
F	and i love that the postage is free !
F	i have never had a problem .
F	i once had to ask them a question , submitted my number and they rang me through their ring back service !
F	brilliant !
F	they were accommodating with requests and alterations to the activities .
F	this allowed us to fit in everything we wanted to do .
F	really useful that they sort out getting payments from a large_group of people .
F	hassle_free .
F	just returned from a hen_party in liverpool and the service provided by chilli_sauce was excellent .
F	we had a lovely 0 * spa hotel with lovely rooms and comfy beds .
F	room service left a little to be desired as things we ordered never showed up and when we tried to order a sandwich at 0am it was going to take them 00mins to bring it .
F	we used the spa in the hotel the day after which from the way we were feeling was much_appreciated .
F	the evening activities were a lovely tapas meal which i cant really comment on as i didnt try everything but everyone_else seemed to enjoy it .
F	the bar queue jumps went without a flaw and the club at the end of the evening was amazing with vip booth with a balcony overlooking the dancefloor and a big bottle of moet and a bottle of vodka with a jug of coke .
F	overall very happy with the service provided by chillisauce and the online payment made the whole_process so much_easier for everyone_involved .
F	would definately_recommend chillisauce to anyone planning a stag / hen_do in the future !
F	i have always brought my new hair_straighteners straight from ghd as you know that your getting official products as my hairdresser told me that there are fake ones out there that look legitimate and the same price if not more_expensive .
F	the ghd website is easy to use and find what your looking for , they send an_email confirmation straight after you order and send out the order very efficiently .
F	thankyou for an excellent service ghd !
F	just hope that these ones last as well as my old ones which was 00yrs !
F	i love this website and everthing thats on it !
F	i have purchased a couple of items and will be sure to buy more !
F	quick delivery and great packaging , ideal for gifts .
F	thanks a lot , abi x_x
F	i used to shop at river_island quite_often however started to notice that the clothes i bought from there ( in particular the tshirts ) got holes in them .
F	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
F	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
F	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
F	the mens clothes seem to be more fashionable than the womens .
F	i recently flew to spain with ryanair .
F	i was a little_worried at first that i would not be able to sit with the persons i was travelling with as the seats are not allocated .
F	however i need not have worried as we all managed to sit together .
F	there was also a fast track upgrade system in place for passangers to get first in the que .
F	the plane was clean , the staff were friendly and there were drinks and snacks being servered often .
F	i also found there was a lot more leg_room than some flights have .
F	what more can you want from a budget_airline !
F	i recently_purchased a card for a 00th wedding_anniversary .
F	i had always expected that due to the personalisation and delivery that the cards would be expensive , this is not the case .
F	i was very impressed with the printing on the card as the photo i uploaded was taken from a mobile phone , i expected this to be a little blurry however it was really clear .
F	the card arrived in a couple of days , there was an option for next_day delivery but this wasnt needed in my case .
F	great service !
F	i have purchased a couple of things from this site ( liquorice allsort bracelet and love heart sweet ring ) and i love them !
F	i have had a lot of compliments as the items are so fun and unusual .
F	i will be buying a lot more in future !
F	really quick delivery also :-_d abi x_x
F	i originally chose warrantyshop . co . uk for my multi appliance policy after comparing_prices between the other_websites i found in google .
F	their silver policy covers all of my essential home items such as my kitchen_appliances , as well as a few of my televisions .
F	recently my washing_machine door wouldn ' t close properly so thought i ' d call warranty shop to see if i could get it repaired .
F	they sent an engineer out quite quickly and the repair was done on the day , a huge relief !
F	rather_than the door catch ( as i originally thought ) it was the electric connector which keeps it locked that had failed .
F	i think so anyway !
F	the man was very helpful and i was back washing my clothes 0 days after making the original phone call .
F	needless to say my pile of washing hadn ' t grown too large !
F	the Â£_00 . 00 a month is well worth it if you know something like that will get repaired that quickly .
F	if i had to be negative about anything it ' s the fact i had to pay a small excess .
F	but from my original research before taking out the policy it seems that some other warranty companies charge this when making a claim so no big deal in reality .
F	i ' m tired of this company ' s broken_promises .
F	every delivery date promised is not fulfilled and they are just incompetent .
F	no - one knows anything and they can ' t find the products in their system either .
F	this is what i ' ve been looking for .
F	they actually charged us less_than what they quoted .
F	will_definitely use again .
F	great service and trustworthy !
F	we got a great deal and good service .
F	will use again .
F	surely recommend it to anyone moving home .
F	same day delivery of flowers and cake .
F	fab service !
F	even_though we pay a bit more_than other home broadband users , we ' ve had really good service and connectivity .
F	i ' d recommend o0 anyday .
F	the quality of products , service and follow - up is great .
F	highly_recommended .
F	despite having problems with my bank card ( totally down to me ) the health counter were easy to get hold of , professional and friendly to deal with , and managed to get the payment sorted and my product out to me in very good time .
F	i would highly_recommend them .
F	from start to finish , the process was simple and well explained .
F	the free post bag was a nice_touch as i never have a stamp so would normally not bother so is idiot_proof and great for the lazy person like me .
F	the payment came quickly with an_email informing_me of its iminent arrival and the cheque cleared within_00hrs .
F	i will be recommending this service to everyone
F	i ordered a pro - racing bike to exercise from home .
F	i did

F	fast deliverly , came the very next_day .
F	great price got a britax b - dual with car_seat soft carry cot and second seat plus all the adapters for less_than Â£_000 !
F	i would defo use again !
F	rachel fisher
F	chemist_direct is my first choice when buying over - the - counter medication or creams .
F	they sell things at a fraction of the cost of a normal pharmacy .
F	delivery is always quick .
F	i have not had any_problems at all with their products or service .
F	fantastic company .
F	love the shops , and did my first online order a week_ago .
F	a little_pricey , but to be expected of imports .
F	i ordered a bargain box , and you get loads for your money there .
F	i can ' t believe_how much they packed in !
F	i ordered a few extras as well , and they even threw in a free hello panda box .
F	whilst ordering i had a few issues with a voucher , and they couldn ' t of been more helpful .
F	truly excellent company .
F	great !
F	quick and easy to use and received my cheques very quickly .
F	didnt get as much as i would have liked and 0 mobile we have didnt have any value but would recommend them :)
F	ordered some boots for both of my daughters and they didnt take long at all , they arrived together ( which saved on 0 of them waiting ) and i have two happy girls !
F	plus i used some of my cash back so only have to pay for 0 pair - bonus !
F	thank_you for great quality products at a great price with a very quick_turnaround .
F	always very helpful and approachable , would definitely use again .
F	posh princess do not have a large_selection and mostly size 0 - 00 but they have some really nice finds .
F	prices are also reasonable :)
F	i have used misco for years but something has happened to their site recently .
F	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
F	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
F	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
F	it was listed at a price and said in stock , i dont give a rats ass if you messed it up i just need the flippig thing :(
F	we usually run our posters on hp large format printers but they use a lot of ink and take ages to print .
F	these_guys use a strange toner machine but the quality is better_than our hp on day glo ( no wrinkling ) and we can resell the prints at a profit :)
F	the service from hq_hair ist fantastic and i was very happy that they add some goodies with my order .
F	i really would do it again ;)
F	booked tickets to see nicki minaj with the ' double 0 tickets ' company and could not have asked for better service - we bought them online a couple of months before the concert date and the company emailed us saying they would arrive roughly ten_days before the concert .
F	they actually came early ( two_weeks before ), so this made us feel a lot more trusting towards the company as we hadn ' t used them before .
F	when we arrived , we couldn ' t believe_how close the seats were to the stage - absolutely perfect view !
F	it was 000_% worth paying that little_bit extra for such an experience !!
F	they were only 00 pound extra to the orginal ticket pricing , assuring when we bought the tickets it would be the first 00rows from the stage and wow it really was brilliant !
F	will deffinatley use the company again and thank_you for making it such an enjoyable night for us !!
F	a ****
F	i would use this service again !
F	i am self_employed and need my van for work my tyres were replaced in the time it took me to eat lunch therefore i had no down time excellent service just what the self_employed require .
F	i purchased a watch for my husdband ' s birthday and just wanted to say that i was thoroughly_impressed with the service i received from iconic_watches and in particular from zac , who has such a lovely telephone manner .
F	despite being a bit_unsure_about purchasing online initially , i was completely reassured and impressed by the service you offer - it ' s second to none and i will_definitely be recommending you in the future .
F	awesome clothing quality , and quick delivery x one of the best online sites :) thanks always happy :)
F	found blackleaf through searching for a product through google and they came out tops .
F	the item came 0 days_later , perfect packaging and just as_described .
F	no_problems at all !!
F	thanks !
F	!
F	i recently_bought a personalised item from aspinal and it arrived within four working_days which was quicker_than_expected .
F	i did receive two different amounts for the final price but after contacting customer_services they cleared everything up for me and very quickly .
F	the only thing i would like them to change is to give a rough estimate for delivery so if ordering gifts in future , customers will know when they will be arriving .
F	love asos , have paid for the next_day delivery for the year and it ' s well worth it !!
F	free returns and prompt refunds if required .
F	brilliant site and very easy to use !
F	recommended !
F	great site , have bought furniture from next and with a little_bit of a mix_up they managed to get everything sorted , as well as give me a gratuity refund and get my items delivered before the time they were estimated .
F	recommended !
F	!
F	i use play frequently due to their excellent customer_service and prompt postage of items .
F	highly_recommend them !
F	!
F	i ordered a canon camera which was " in stock ", was told thre was a slight_delay with processing the order even_though i had paid for next_day delivery .
F	here i am a month later with no camera and no refund after requesting one 0 weeks_ago .
F	shocking company that has terrible customer_services .
F	avoid this website .
F	pay the extra to go with a more well_known company that you can trust !
F	!
F	i ' ve moved_house and getting re - registered at a new doctor ' s surgery is time - consuming .
F	i used this service so i didn ' t need to rush around taking time off getting registered at my doctors to keep my repeat prescription going .
F	really useful .
F	simple process .
F	quick discreet delivery .
F	would recommend to anyone .
F	the site was easy to use .
F	the forms were thorough without requesting excessive detail and the quotes came in near enough straight_away .
F	would definitely use again
F	the process was very simple to complete and the credit was applied to the account quickly .
F	no_problems at all using ticket tree .
F	they kept me informed at all times and the service offered was exactly_what was delivered .
F	i ' d have no issues recommending them to anyone .
F	this is my second bad_experience with yodel !!
F	!
F	have done some online shopping , and the company who was suppose to deliver the parcel was yodel .
F	after apparent 0 unsuccessful delivery attempts i decided to contact the company i ordered from . they told me they will arrange another delivery for me .
F	fine .
F	yodel tried to deliver again but with no luck .
F	so i went online to check the delivery status and it says : last delivery attempt was at 0 :_00am on the 00 / 00 . hmmm .....
F	strange , because at 0 : 00 i was at home , no door_bell rang , the driver was suppose to contact me , but he didn ' t of course .
F	all i can says : yodel you are useless !!!!!!!!!!
F	!
F	thank_you very much
F	this was my second time i have ordered from lenstore , and i wasn ' t disappointed . received excellent service , quick delivery , will use it again .
F	i have sold 0 laptops with sell your laptop over the past_year and a half .
F	they are very honest and pay the quote i retrieved over the internet .
F	each time i have sold a laptop , the money has cleared in my account the next_day of the courier collecting my laptop .
F	have recommended sell your laptop to various friends & family .
F	i work for a serviced apartments company and it is always a pleasure to do business with citybase apartments .
F	they are a happy , cheerful bunch of people :)
F	facebook was all craze .
F	and so it should have been .
F	until they put timeline in .
F	i dont think anybody really likes it .
F	messaging no_longer works at 000_% sometimes you send a message more_than once or not at all .
F	games on there are good but tbh .
F	since timeline post people have moved over to twitter .
F	this search_engine is amazing if need to find an actor or movie .
F	even gives you actors bios .
F	what more could you want ??...
F	pictures ??....
F	got them too :)
F	just_eat are brilliant .
F	you put in your postcode and it brings up all take - aways that delivers to you when if closed .
F	you can place an order with one open or closed and set delivery time .
F	you can pay by cash on delivery or card .
F	when given a time for delivery they are normally alot earlier .
F	not a fault to put on here .
F	best thing since sliced nommy pizza .
F	vodafone are by_far the best network .
F	i have used tesco , orange , o0 , three and t - mobile .
F	tesco is basically a cheaper version of o0 ; both have issues with signal if in countryside .
F	t - mobile just has issues all_round .
F	orange has signal issues and three just does not have packages i can get on with .
F	vodafone gives me good signal in countryside .
F	has no issues .
F	has package i like and plus they take care of their customers .
F	really happy with the service we received .
F	email enquries were answered_quickly and the woman i spoke with was really helpful .
F	payment was easily made and the delivery was really quick , we are really happy with our printed bags and would definitely_recommend to other people .
F	hope to work with them again in the future .
F	thank_you .
F	leah - sales & events manager ( the elbow room leeds )
F	i loved how easy it was to see all the different hostels and types of room they had to offer .
F	and very nice that there is no booking_fee .
F	great experience and will_definitely be booking through you more often !
F	i was looking for some wonka nerds for my daughters_birthday_party at the weekend .
F	i ordered them on thursady at 0pm and they arrived first thing on friday_morning , just in time !
F	i was very impressed with this and also the design of the site .
F	will use again for sure .
F	this is the best transfer service there is out there
F	huge quantity of supplements .
F	if you can ' t find what you are looking you are not trying .
F	they match anyone ' s price with no questions or argument .
F	always low_prices on the highest_quality supplements .
F	sometimes the shipping_costs are more_than other_places but the low price more_than makes up for the difference .
F	really easy - would like it if there was like a section of ' my hostels ' or something on the website .
F	thumbs_up !
F	easy to use website , with a great range of fantastic accommodation .
F	online reviews allow for reliable expectations .
F	quick service , great range of products and new on the ball just out to be in league with other brands .
F	amazing shopping_experience as no stress , simple order and checkout with prompt delivery .
F	what more could u ask for ?
F	excellent price , really easy to contact and helpful when i needed to change collection times , even ended_up with a free upgrade on the car , highly_recommend this company , made the booking so much_easier than usual
F	everything happened really fast .
F	return packaging arrived next_day .
F	receipt of goods next_day .
F	and payment ... next_day
F	fast delivery - good customer_services
F	booking with hostel_bookers is fast , easy , and gives you the most comprehensive overviews of accomodations .
F	thousands of users can ' t be wrong .
F	i ' ve booked accomodations in england , france , germany , greece , italy , and israel through hostel_bookers and every time there were no suprises upon_arrival .
F	i always felt i knew_exactly_what i was getting .
F	thousands of users and reviewers can ' t be wrong .
F	you get a pretty good idea of what to expect .
F	booking through hostel_bookers is like getting a reccommendation from a trusted friend .
F	a huge_selection of glasses to choose from at really competitive_prices .
F	i ' ve worn glasses for a long time and find a lot of places sell fashion glasses out of my price range meaning i normally buy one pair and can ' t afford to keep a spare pair ( which is a shame as my little_boy tends to break them often ).
F	with selectspecs i feel i can purchase several pairs for the price of a pair in leading opticians .
F	i purchased two_pairs to begin with as i wanted to check the quality , i must_admit i was sceptical and thought low_prices must equal low quality - i was wrong .
F	both pairs have arrived and both are brilliant quality , i ' ll now be looking to buy more as it ' s always nice to have a variety .
F	really great company , fast delivery and competitive_prices , can ' t fault them .
F	have recommended them to all my friends too .
F	mobile phone of less_than 0 month old sent in .
F	valued at around Â£_00 which was bad enough but then had an_email to say it failed testing as it was locked to a network !
F	like most i would imagine .
F	they then said it would be worth Â£ 0 . 00 and if i didn ' t want it Â£ 0 . 00 to send the mobile back .
F	do not use this company .
F	absolute cowboys !!!!!
F	!
F	first time using this company , had seen an advert somewhere and thought it might be a good idea to give it a go .
F	i am so glad i did !
F	the offers were great , and the checking and choosing of all the available options was really clearly_laid_out on the site .
F	the prices were great in my opinion , much_better_than if i had gone to a highstreet opticians .
F	inputting my prescription information was really easy too , which was the bit i was worried_about ; i didn ' t want to get it wrong obviously .
F	they keep you updated every_step of the way , and you get a tracking_number link in your email , so you can check where your glasses are in the process .
F	from order to delivery was five days .
F	this was 0 pairs of prescription_glasses , one with anti_- glare .
F	i thought this was really fast .
F	the actual glasses themselves ...
F	very pleased !
F	quality was good , looked like they did in the photos , and it was nice to be able to see again !
F	( my old glasses broke a couple of weeks_ago so have been getting through the days fuzzy eyed ).
F	no marks on the lenses and perfectly clear vision again , so they definitely got it right .
F	also , they sent me an_email_saying one pair was ready while the other wasn ' t so would be sending them separately to make_sure i had at_least one pair .
F	i was happy with this , even happier when the next morning they both turned_up in the same packet together !
F	a company with common_sense !
F	speaking of delivery , i was dubious when i saw the bubblewrap envelope with my glasses in .
F	i was imagining taking them out in pieces to be honest .
F	luckily , the glasses both came in hard cases , which i didn ' t realise were free with the order , so all was well there .
F	i will be using this company again for glasses ; their range of sunglasses are very nice too so am tempted ...
F	so if you ' re wondering_whether to go for it , then please do .
F	i had a great customer experience with them .
F	:)
F	everything from booking online to how close the garage was from my house to the service i got at the garage was 0 star .
F	will tell all my friends to book through black_circles thought this was a great service .
F	first month of a 0 year contract and what a shit company .
F	i ' d been with orange years with 000 mins never gone over 0 month with 000 mins with vodafone and i ' m over by 000_+ mins costing 00 +_p per min .
F	all because this company charge you per min not second .
F	i ' m not sure how they get away with this but it ' s discussing .
F	now stuck counting down the month till i can say screw you vodafone .
F	i ordered some air freshener ' s at short_notice and the customer_service team helped my get my order on a short dead line .
F	when product arrived they look and smell excellent .
F	i would recommend and use the company again .
F	hostelbookers made it really easy and convenient to book a last - minute trip to barcelona this weekend .
F	i had used hostelworld in the past , but through hostelbookers i managed to get a better room for half the price !
F	i ordered mira vie shower from this seller .
F	i can say that this is a most wonderful seller and i would highly_recommend it to everyone .
F	the prices of the items are really the best one can find .
F	i had to ask the seller a couple of questions_regarding the shower and i can say that they have the best , fastest and most friendly & professional customer_service !
F	they were extremely_helpful to me and answered all my questions very fast .
F	i wish that more sellers were so professional and nice !
F	great price , fast delivery , was easy to fix up and sounds awesome .
F	didn ' t get the drum sticks like it said but still pretty_cool .
F	thanks .
F	gotta_love ebay , fab value , massive_range of choice , virtually everything you could ever want available in one place .
F	great protection if things go_wrong , and the wonderful feedback system means you know who you ' re buying from .
F	pretty difficult to fault .
F	do not use and if you have already commented report them to trading_standards .
F	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn ' t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
F	well what can i say , ordered on a thursday_morning and it arrived on the monday_afternoon .... better job than companies in the uk .
F	i ' m a very happy customer ;)
F	i love using supplement_warehouse for my husband ' s supplement_needs .
F	they have the best , cheapest prices online and very quick shipping .
F	lots of selection to choose from .
F	would recommend this company to anyone !
F	!
F	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i ' ve found slowly but surely that production selection has gone down within my favourite section of craft .
F	paper craft .
F	now i understand that it ' s not possible to stock every_single product available .
F	but after a lot of the stores were done up and it seemed like half the products disappeared .
F	i ' ve also noticed it with other sections too .
F	also i find hobbycraft very expensive , seeing as hc is the only big craft store in the uk , you ' d think you wouldn ' t need to have such high prices on things .
F	i run a business myself and understand profit margins , but some of hc ' s are crazy
F	we hebben een autostoeltje besteld op een zaterdag en de dinsdag erop was hij al binnen .
F	ik kreeg een smsje en een mail dat hij was verzonden en we konden het via tracking bij houden waar het stoeltje zich bevond .
F	super goede service en goede prijs , de laagste in engeland en nederland .
F	top dus !
F	very easy to navigate website , with simple booking procedure .
F	great reviews that make choosing someone to stay much_easier .
F	instant confirmation , would definitely use again !
F	i ordered some Â£_00 headphones from hifiheadphones yesterday at about 0pm .
F	had an_email asking me to cotact them to confirm some details which i was happy to do .
F	nice to know the company cares_about it ' s customers .
F	the headphones were delivered today around midday , very well packages .
F	i was really shocked how quick they arrived .
F	customer_service was fantastic and i had regular_updates informing_me that the package had been dispatched .
F	i will_definately be recommending these_guys to my mates .
F	fantasic service guys .
F	gratz
F	i have bought from here many_times and have only had 0 item which was the wrong_size .
F	but shoes in particular are the best value and all are amazing and last forever !
F	will be back soon again .
F	great comapny which always deals with all queries efficiently .
F	earned me lots of cashbvack already and would recommend to more friends if any of them didn ' t already know about it !
F	!
F	hostelbookers is super reliable when you need a bed .
F	really good experience during my month of backpacking round europe .
F	some really decent hostels and good service .
F	the review system is much_better_than the other hostel companies .
F	fantastic few experiences at poppy & zach ' s .
F	0st was getting my daughters 0st pair of big girl star rite shoes and second was getting my sons 0st pair of big_boy school shoes :_d their so helpful in the store and make a fuss of all children and their 0st time experience getting their feet measured enjoyable .

F	i have booked a few different hostels in a few different_countries and always had a nice stay .
F	this site is super useful !
F	i used serentaflowers to send flowers and chocolates to my mum for her_birthday .
F	i ordered the day before and they got there on time , no_problems , no hassle and my mum was very happy .
F	i would definitely use them again !
F	i was mighty impressed with the fab prices ( which were very cheap for the goods i was purchasing ).
F	everything was so carefully_wrapped / packed .
F	i was very happy and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone .
F	top_class .
F	i would definitely buy again .
F	amazon is by_far the best website for cheaper priced items .
F	can find literally everything on there , whether its from actual amazon or people selling there stuff on amazon .
F	amazon is always really reliable and have fast delivery .
F	if there is a problem with something your always garenteed a reply by phone or email the same day .

F	found viovet via google , have to say the experience i got was a pleasurable one .
F	i am so glad i chose viovet .
F	brilliant , efficient , i ordered the night before , at 0 : 00pmish , and got the food the day after , my cat had fallen ill , ( urine infection ) and i had taken her to the vets the day before , so when they arrived via city_link the next_day i was so pleased .
F	will recommend you to friends and family , and will be using you again .
F	thank_you so much viovet !
F	had no_problems , delivery and service excellent
F	i would recommend this company very highly , have use them several_times to order numerous perfume .
F	always a good price and quick delivery .
F	i can not call this a service because it is not .
F	you never get paid the cashback you are entitled too and when you contact quidco support all you ever get from them is palmed off .
F	they tell a company will pay in 00 to 000 days and when you contact quidco after 0 months still not receiving payment , all you are then told not to worry as they take 0 months to pay .
F	what a joke
F	i would not recommend this company to me worst_enemy
F	i was really impressed by how easy the site was to navigate , how fast the booking processed and how quickly i received my confirmation by email .
F	i was really impressed that there were no booking_fees as well !
F	i ' ll book with hostel_booker again for sure .
F	absolutely fantastic service , received the pre_- paid envelope 0 days after requesting which contained a well explained and easy return procedure .
F	0 days_later i received an_email_confirming my cheque had been sent out which i received the next_day .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	it ' s the easiest Â£_00 i have ever made !
F	!
F	i went to see russell_brand and sat in the front_row - most insane tickets ever !
F	i was so excited the whole time i thought i was gonna pass out , because he was soo close !
F	i love this website now .
F	i needed help with a lot of different questions including price for sending a parcel , how it works with dropping off / delivering etcetera and i got very good help from stephanie at the chat !
F	fast delivery , good prices .
F	dont understand_why people choose shitty argos over this store x
F	returned a quad bought for my son for christmas which was faulty .
F	there was no battery charger included and the electicals inside wasnt connected to the motor properly .
F	the manager said as i didnt have the reciept i couldnt have a straight exchange i would need to pay an extra Â£_00 .
F	disgusting as i paid via the argos card and had the payment details on the statement just not the item code , disgusting !!
F	!
F	we ' d had enormous problems with our boiler and over a few weeks 0 different people came out to look at it and give us estimates .
F	woke_up one morning to find water leaking out of it and into the floor .
F	called pimlico_plumbers in a total stress , within half an_hour of my call they sent luke lawrence round , he gave me a reasonable quote and set to work replacing my boiler straight_away .
F	he was friendly , helpful and very pleasant , was in my house for 0 whole days and didn ' t make me feel uncomfortable at all .
F	the boiler replacement was excellent and he even took a look at a problem i have with my shower before he left and gave me suggestions on how to cope with the problem .
F	excellent guy , excellent service , excellent boiler .
F	very pleased .
F	i would definitely_recommend headscarves by ciara to anyone who is unfortunate to need this service .
F	as ciara has been through this awful illness herself she know exactly_what i was going through .
F	she made this as easy as possible and made me the focus without being too much .
F	as a woman and as silly as this sounds my hair is important .
F	it might have been short to start with but it was mine .
F	i even had a wee cry and ciara did not make me feel silly or stupid .
F	i didn ' t have to wait long at all on my order and was much_nicer_than anything i had been shown or seen in the shops .
F	the range was fantastic and i loved my scarves and the fact that they were different made others look at me and other people asked where i got them while sitting in waiting rooms and outpatients .
F	ciara was completely professional and confidential at a time when i needed so much from other people i have no_problems recommending her to anyone .
F	and the scarves are very affordable and good quality .
F	definitely worth every_penny and tear .
F	i couldn ' t ask for more and she exceeded my expectations .
F	i bought two tickets for the michael bublÃ¨ concert back in january for his concert on 0th_march .
F	the tickets arrived 0 days after_placing the order .
F	the seats were great and there was no hassel whatsoever .
F	i would definitely use double0 again , i would recommend them to anyone for sold out gigs .
F	the concert was fantastic !
F	thanks double0 :)
F	smashed the back of my phone , repairs0everyone helped_me out straight_away .
F	fixed it really quickly and easily and wasn ' t even expensive .
F	excellent :)
F	ordered some shelf clips with " next_day delivery " as a shelf in the office had collapsed .
F	they didn ' t arrive .
F	after a couple of days i emailed to query the whereabouts of the item and they said " oh , they should have been delivered - we ' ll contact the couriers ".
F	two days_later i hadn ' t heard back so emailed again and they replied to say " sorry , we ' re still trying to trace the items with the courier , would you like a refund ?"
F	i explained i didn ' t want the refund as i wanted the item !
F	a further 0 days_later i emailed again and was told " we have been unable to trace the order with the courier .
F	would you like a refund ?"
F	as it is now two_weeks since i ordered with the " next_day delivery " i have said yes , fine , i ' ll have a refund and will go back to amazon where they are more_expensive but at_least you know it ' ll arrive !
F	i didn ' t feel that officenerd really cared whether my order ever replied or not and their constant efforts to get me to accept a refund seemed to be an attempt to get me off their case rather_than an example of good customer_service .
F	i placed an order on 0st april with boots . com , it arrived at the local yodel depot at 0am on 0th_april , now on 00th_april it is still not here and is still showing as being in the depot .
F	they are worse than useless to speak to , don ' t care at all about customer_service , i wish they could be closed_down .
F	boots have been kind in apologising and giving me a partial_refund etc , but they can ' t get any more info out of yodel than i can .
F	i doubt the parcel will ever arrive .
F	if i could give yodel 0_stars i would .
F	great phone service and very informed staff .
F	always a pleasure :) would thoroughly_recommend !
F	sammie_taylor - great quick advice and help
F	my experience buying from ace - canine has been brilliant , i had a lovely response to my initial statement when i ' d requested a free_sample and then when i phoned with a query after i ' d received it the staff on the phone were friendly and helpful and they followed up with an_email later that day .
F	i am confident that if and when i have any_questions the staff at ace - canine are approachable which is extra important as it is a healthcare product .
F	really happy to have found the cheapest price for my dog ' s supplements - bigger bonus that it was delivered free and super_quick .
F	like the reminder service too !
F	i compared prices for my broken htc_desire s and bozowi gave the best price by_far .
F	they kept me updated through the process and payment was fast .
F	i am so impressed with sell your - laptop , i really like the ethos of the business and their service is fantastic .
F	really easy to use website , kept you informed of the delivery pick_up time and very prompt payment to paypal .
F	would recommend to anyone :)

F	got my tickets for one direction belfast in november i did pay alot more_than ticket price but dont really care because the look on my daughters face was priceless .
F	after a very tough year and alot of deaths in the family i knew_exactly_what would lift her spirits unfortunately the concert was sold out months earlier then fortunately ( i hope ) i found ones available on this website ................ i got printed out e tickets delivered to me very promptly .
F	im just getting a little_worried after_reading reviews that maybe we might travel the whole way to belfast ( i have a hotel booked and all ) and not get in and most of all my daughter would be devastated im feelin anxious :-(
F	mr_memory offers a really excellent service !
F	high_quality goods , good price and few time for delivery .
F	moreover , it offers a fast assistance in case of problems .
F	i bought two modules of ram for my laptop , i had some problem to install it , so i contacted many_times mr . memory who provided me a good and fast assistance .
F	mr . memory is simply great !
F	i don ' t normally_write_reviews but my experience was sufficiently bad that i thought it was worth taking some time to share my experience .
F	from reading the other reviews it looks_like precious_little one is a company that , if everything goes well , can offer good value but buyer_beware if it doesn ' t .
F	i ordered a mattress 0 weeks before my due date as i found my original one didn ' t fit properly .
F	as it was under Â£_00 the charge for delivery was Â£ 0 . 00 , which i felt was a bit_steep but as i needed the mattress asap , was willing to pay .
F	00 days_later my mattress hasn ' t arrived - i ' ve called the customer_service dept and they said according to their system there were none in stock when i ordered , so it was sent out 0nd_class (!)
F	a couple of days ago .
F	despite the fact that i am sure the website did not say this when i ordered ( or i would have gone elsewhere ), i have been told its basically tough_luck .
F	this business thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mislead their customers when ordering , then charge them Â£ 0 . 00 for a second class royal_mail delivery ( which it ' s worth_noting is their company policy ) to be sent out whenever the item finally becomes in stock .
F	i am still yet to receive the mattress .
F	i also e_- mailed the customer complaints_dept who said the same_thing in a slightly more polite way .
F	their ordering system apparently says that they had none in stock ( they ' ve even offered to send me a print out to prove it !)
F	and therefore they see no fault .
F	they have neglected to address the fact that this wasn ' t reflected on the website when i ordered it , so either there is a issue updating information to the website or they think i ordered it in the knowledge that it was out of stock 0 weeks before my due date and for some unknown_reason am now taking time out of my day to complain to them about it ?!?
F	!
F	i can see from other reviews that where there is an issue , the ' customer_service ' department seems to be tasked to defend their position , rather_than actually provide any customer_service .
F	i would say , if you find similar prices on other_websites ( good ones like kiddicare will price_match ), then save_yourself the potential hassle if things go_wrong and shop elsewhere .
F	we all had the best week end such a laugh and so much great things to do if was not for chilli_sauce would have not had the privilege of doing some of the unique things we done !
F	thanks again :)
F	really liked the rug shame i had to return it because it was brighter than i thought and didn ' t look right in my living_room :( was really quick delivery etc .
F	i would recommend this service because they found the dates and prices i was looking for , didn ' t charge a million extra fees like some companies do , and the payment processed instantaneously instead of waiting to charge my card .
F	do it !
F	thanks for unlock my iphone
F	we travelled with myferrylink in august_0000 , when they had just taken over .
F	the duty free shop was not well stocked , my only_criticism but allowable considering they had just opened up !
F	the staff were friendly and very helpful .
F	everything was clean and tidy , if not a bit dated in decor , but perfect for what we needed - a cheap hop across the channel .
F	would recommend !
F	i write with regards to my order that i placed over a week_ago .
F	i have requested twice now for an rma_number so that i can return the product that i bought , yet you have still not replied .
F	you are clearly in breach of the distance_selling regulations 0000 , as you have not provided me with the information that i need to return the product .
F	i am outraged at this poor customer_service .
F	i have paid a lot of money to you .
F	i demand to have your telephone_number so that i can speak to someone directly and return my glasses .
F	i have used both yumega plus & yumove tablets on my two german shepherds with great success .
F	one dog suffered regularly with a sore shoulder which caused him to limp badly - since taking yumove tablets he has not had any further occurrences of this .
F	orders come very quickly & the whole order process is simple & straightforward .
F	never have had a problem with hostel_bookers , usually show the best price .
F	extremely easy website to use and i plan on continuing to use hostelbookers . com
F	my boyfriend ordered a surprise bouquet of flowers for a special day as he was away on a business trip .
F	it arrived the following_day and to make the matter worse , it was left at the door unattended and badly_damaged in torrential rain and the heavy wind .
F	it was found soaked and lopsided in the corner of my garage door .
F	at that stage i knew from my boyfriend that he ' s ordered flowers and he was quite furious about the delay .
F	he ' s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
F	hi ,
F	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
F	we request you to contact our head_office on <_external link_removed > regarding this matter .
F	regards ,
F	iflorist
F	we rang and spoke to the customer_service guy who sounded_like he couldn ' t care less .
F	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
F	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally ruined what could ' ve been a sweet experience .
F	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
F	business is all about the trust .
F	they lost more_than just two customers .
F	i bought a ciate nail_polish set recently .
F	it arrived well_packed and quickly but unfortunately one item from the set was missing .
F	i called customer_services at fragrance_direct , and a really helpful and friendly guy sorted my problem super_quick !
F	a new set was sent out free of charge that day , and i didn ' t have to return the old one !
F	excellent service and brilliant prices !
F	thank_you for the excellent help and advise this evening - fantastic representative and went the extra_mile
F	product very good , but chose to purchase from vetimed due to it being the best price quick post and great service too
F	i decided to look online for my de - flea and wormer since the vets prices are forever rising .
F	was really pleased to get what i needed and it saved me around Â£_00 compared to going to the vets , i hope the prices stay as good for the next time i need to buy !
F	delivered quickly with no_problems .
F	would definitely & recommend to all !
F	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
F	i was contacted the next_day with many apologies that they were out of stock of the chews .
F	this was fine , and i was told that once they had received a delivery they would be sent .
F	however , i then had to contact them about the dog_food that was in stock , and asked if it was being delivered , as i had not realised they were holding it to despatch both items together , & the food was needed .
F	this was complied with , and the food was delivered a few_days_later .
F	however , it is now the 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not heard_anything about or received my chews .
F	& so i am not very pleased with the service
F	truffle_shuffle ' s service is second to none .
F	my orders always arive with speedy service and the quality of the products is always great .
F	they have the coolest selection of t -_shirts , hoodies and accessories full of nostalgia that will bring back great childhood memories .
F	thank_you truffle_shuffle for being officially awesome !
F	smooth_transaction , extremely fast_shipping , good prices .
F	product exactly as_described .
F	it ' s been a pleasure to do businnes with !!
F	!
F	i was told about these_guys from a mate . i wanted a welcome home goodie bag waiting for me when i got home on leave for me and my partner .
F	i placed the order while overseas on duty to be delivered so that it waiting when i got hoime .
F	i asked them to dispatch it on a certain day using their next_day service and they didn ' t dissapoint .
F	an excellent welcome home present was waiting for me and grwat fun was had by both of us .
F	will_definitely use again .
F	my order was processed correctly and the item delivered quickly .
F	i would use printerland again with no doubt
F	i placed my order late on tuesday night , you despatched it wednesday_morning and it was with me on thursday - you can ' t get any better_than that !
F	i was on the point of replacing my pc , but for just over Â£_00 the memory i bought from you has completely revitalised it !
F	fitting was very easy and took only about 00_minutes - an expert would have done it faster_than i did .
F	i recently brought a pair of bryan adams tickets ( 0000000 ) for the concert on monday for my partners_birthday .
F	after_reading bad_reviews i am sceptical i will ever get them .
F	what ' s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
F	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
F	lets_hope i ' m wrong
F	the only negative thing ive ever heard of them is about shipping , but thier motto is true , there is no such thing as free shipping , the cost of shipping is absorbed somewhere , in the price of the product .
F	the prices are low and i ' ve always been happy with my closeout and guarenteed fresh products at hands_down the best price anywhere .
F	rock_bottom prices .
F	low .
F	loooooooow .
F	even when you factor in the shipping , if you buy what you need in bulk , you ' ll find the price per item even with shipping divides out lower_than anyone_else .
F	love them .
F	i have been booking tickets with them ever since moving to london , hence for the past 0 years and there is not once that when an event i am interest in is in london i would ever think to check anywhere_else .
F	they are professional , very reliable and trustworthy , best customer_service ever .
F	i have just received my ticket for the backstreet boys concert , it is the second time i see them and booked the ticket through this agency .
F	best prices and best tickets .
F	recommended it to a couple of friends as well .
F	maria
F	rubbish_rubbish_rubbish !
F	i have stopped using my iphone , don ' t make any calls on it and send maybe a few texts a month .
F	i have a booster which is a unlimited to other tmobile users yet my bill is always over .
F	they are ridiculous charge for voicemail service i dont have , they charge Â£ 0 . 00 one off fees which is erm every month and no one can explain_why ?
F	they charge for debit_card payments because i chose not to give them access to my bank ac with dd .
F	and god forbid you should be late paying your bill by a few_days they continue to harrass you at all hours even on sunday wether you speak with them or not .
F	the worst thing i done was change from my old_school flex 00 to a shitty i phone contract i have a few weeks to go and my 00 year relationship with tmobile is over !!!!
F	woop woop ........
F	tmobile cs has just said that repeating my disdain for tmobile is not helpful !
F	!
F	so i will repeat it here .
F	you are rubbish_rubbish_rubbish bunch of theives who ruin people ' s credit and give absolutely nothing for loyalty to you .
F	just like british_gas as soon as your momentum gets going you shit on the ' little ' people who help you get there .
F	disgrace disgrace disgrace no matter how you change your name your still crap !!
F	ee ???
F	dont you mean errant egocentric .......
F	arrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
F	good service , good price , fast delivery , great website but i ordered my glasses with a tint and they sent me ones with clear lenses so i am not happy at all , now i have to go to the trouble of sending them back
F	i recently_purchased a silent night foam mattress , and i am really pleased with the quality of it , considering it was one of the cheapest .
F	would definitely_recommend also it was free delivery so even better .
F	made an online order with sh !
F	it arrived the next_day .
F	excellent service and very pleased with the item i bought , and so is my partner ;) lol .
F	will_definately be shopping with sh !
F	again .
F	this is the first time i have used this company and rest_assured this will be the last !
F	!
F	and i ' d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
F	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
F	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
F	how many_times have you had a package delivered and it ' s been damaged , lost or stolen ?
F	as for compensation , think again , they ' ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
F	i think investigations into these companies are long over due .
F	very happy with my daughters halloween outfit , better quality and price compared to what you ' d find in the supermarket .
F	postage prices were more_than reasonable .
F	after looking round the website and seeing what else online jokeshop sell i ' m sure i ' ll be back !
F	purchasing two items from taunton_leisure , i could not find one fault .
F	very fast delivery and good tracking updates .
F	one happy customer .
F	thank_you
F	lightinthebox is lovely site and easy site 0 order from and easy 0 follow ur iteams till they get 0 u the iteam that i have already reviced ar lovely and well_done i like them so much i even order all my weeding things from them and even mother of the bride have order hers from the site wel pleased and happy
F	it ' s such a good feeling being_able to treat yourself and not feeling guilty about the spending !
F	all the products are excellent quality and the delivery is always very fast .
F	i ' ve never had any_problems with fragrance_direct and i always recommend it to my friends and family .
F	great service .
F	a lot_easier to use than i first expected .
F	received the money quickly too !
F	will_definitely use again !
F	i ordered the band hero for the xbox_000 and it arrived in quick time and just as_described !
F	very happy with this service and would definitely use again .
F	i strongly_recommend this seller :)
F	easy to find books and excellent prices !
F	love that there is no booking_fee .
F	way cheaper_than any of the competitors .
F	love how easy it is to see all the choices - see the prices , the location on a map , the reviews from other people !
F	totally recommend hostelbookers !
F	!
F	i sent 0 phones off to envirofone , the response and service was fantastic , would highly_recommend this service thank_you
F	i ordered soundmagic earphones and they were cheaper_than any other site but still the same , quality and standard and the delivery was amazingly fast .
F	was extremely impressed with them and would order again any day .
F	highly_recommend using this site as you will not be disappointed .
F	very helpful
F	brilliant , speedy response and the super helpful emma is a star !
F	thank_you .
F	annie
F	ever since i first discovered them , i only ever order flowers from e_- florist .
F	unlike many places ( where to bouquets are quite tacky ), there are lots of stylish bouquets to choose from .
F	they are reasonably_priced too and always delivered on time and as quickly as you need .
F	i go straight to e_- florist every time !
F	arrived in great condition .
F	great sturdy packaging .
F	very happy !
F	hungryhouse is great when it comes to quality food delivered at your door .
F	the delivery time is followed so particularly and if it is a hungryhouse express order and reaches after 00_minutes you do get a free meal of the same amount .
F	getting this is also hassle_free which is why i found it to be really honest .
F	i would recommend this for all the foodies out there who want to enjoy a nice meal in the warmth of their homes .
F	i have been using hostelbookers for all my weekend getaways , long and short business and pleasure trips .
F	i have used it for traveling with my parents , my partner and also alone .
F	hostelbookers has an extensive_range of comfortable , affordable and variety of choices on hotels and hostels depending_on your purpose and budget .
F	my every booking experience with hostelbookers has led to a special and memorable stay and i always use it myself and recommend to every traveler and backpacker .
F	very obliging faultless delivery .
F	excellent communication prompt delivery and price will_definately use again and highly_recommend
F	thankyou very much
F	great website with plenty of choices .
F	the details of the garage helped to get in touch as i needed to fit the tyres over lunch .
F	so , the garage advised they would keep an eye out for my online order and book it at that time .
F	would definitely_recommend and will return !
F	jv carpentry provided exceptional service from start to finish and i would highly_recommend them to anyone , in fact i ' m going to recommend them to everyone !
F	i wanted bespoke bookshelves and cabinets fitted into an alcove .
F	jeff was very flexible when organising a time to come round and take measurements .
F	then my expectations ( already high from seeing the pictures on the website ) of the work done were surpassed by miles - the guys who came to build the bookcase and then the two painters who painted them in situ were extremely punctual , professional , and highly skilled .
F	the finished result is truly stunning and fits seamlessly into the alcove space - they even perfectly reproduced the coving so that the bookcase blends into ceiling as if it was built with the house .
F	the price was also very reasonable .
F	i am now thinking of what else i would like them to build for me !
F	item arrived before expected which was great , was well_packaged and as expected .
F	any question si had were answered really quickly and professionally .
F	very happy !
F	will shop with them again
F	i have been planning a trip to europe for several months now , and hostelbookers has irreplaceably contributed to making things so much_easier to work out .
F	i know that my reservations are made , will be there when i arrive , and it is so easy to compare and choose exactly_what i want in a hostel with this site .
F	thank_you !
F	excellent service , reasonable prices and fast delivery .
F	highly_recommended !
F	our 0 year_old_daughter is delighted with her new scooter :)
F	so on the 0th do december requested my iphone 0 to be unlocked so i could use my
F	work sim .
F	i got told on the phone this will be done in 00 days ..
F	so i paid the fee
F	so far so good .
F	a week_later i received a text stating my imei_number was incorrect
F	i was sure this was a mistake as i read the imei_number directly off my phone anyway
F	phoned up and i was told to ignore the text and that they only needed a few details
F	of the make and model of the phone so i happily gave this information .
F	i called on the
F	00th_dec saturday and the advisor on the phone said my unlock code will be sent to
F	me on a 00th_dec tuesday woohoo i thought .. very wonderful and fast .
F	tuesday came no text so i phoned again ., this time i was told over the phone that my phone was stolen .
F	and it could not be unlocked .. urm huh_?
F	i was shocked my phone was bought from new so i challenged the rep over the phone and he finally said he would get back to me in 00_hours .. hmm u guessed it no call was returned so i called again and this time i was told the delay was solely due to the fault of apple and that i was told the unlock code will take 00 days so i should be patient okay i said i understood that but i was basically told by a previous advisor that the code was going to be sent on a specific date and was also told that my phone was stolen so got a bit_worried .
F	anyway 00 days was up on the 00th so i phoned up again this time spoke to a manager who told he was going to call me on the 00th with the unlock code
F	hmm u guessed it no such call has been received so just called again before writing this review this time i have been told to wait indefinitely as t mobile can only
F	request apple to unlock the phone and it ' s up to apple so basically i can be waiting
F	for eternity for this .
F	so basically paid money for a service that was meant to take
F	00 days now is more like unlimited days .. this is no way to conduct business not
F	surprised ee was voted worst mobile provider off 0000 .. really angry .
F	unlock my phone !
F	superb service through out and t -_shirts are excellent .
F	will_definately be getting somemore .
F	cheers peacefulhooligan .
F	have order from tru print several_times and have always been more_than pleased with the variety of gifts available and the quality
F	i have had positive_experiences with wowcher in the past .
F	however these have been transactions where i have had no_problems .
F	i recently ordered a wowcher for an item of clothing over a month_ago .
F	the retailer sold out of items in my size , and now advise that the item is now discontinued .
F	the retailer advised i needed to speak with wowcher as the original transaction .
F	i have now made a number of phone_calls and responded to an_email which has now probably cost me the price of the wowcher again !
F	no one seems to want to take_responsibility for this and i ' ve effectively paid for something i can ' t have !
F	this is my second time using this company .
F	excellent selection of products to choose from .
F	ordered a pair of sunglasses and there was no hassle at checkout , very smooth_transaction .
F	i got a confirmation_email within a matter of seconds .
F	the glasses arrived very quickly and were exactly as_described .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	i booked a ticket for Â£ 0 . 00 on the 00th of november .
F	however , once i ' d paid , the confirmation_email said that the ticket was valid for the 00th of december .
F	i was then accused off ' booking the ticket incorrectly ' by an abhorrently rude customer adviser , so i took a screenshot of the date and price of the train_ticket as advertised on the trainline app .
F	i finally managed to get a phone call from a supervisor who acknowledged that there had been an error on the app .
F	he agreed that it wasn ' t my fault that the trainline had made an error and advertised a train_ticket for the wrong date .
F	however , he said that there was nothing he could do to help as these tickets are non - refundable .
F	absolutely_disgraceful .
F	he then shouted down the phone as he read me the terms and conditions of a ticket which i did not want !
F	my only other option would have been to book a ticket for Â£_00 , thus paying the Â£_00 difference as well as a Â£_00 changing fee .
F	i did not cause this mistake , so why am i paying for it to be fixed !?
F	why on earth should i pay the trainline for making a mistake ?
F	it ' s honestly beyond_belief .
F	i understand that tickets are non - refundable , but , if the trainline are responsible for false_advertising , they should take_responsibility and refund the ticket .
F	i am a loyal_customer of the trainline .
F	i book with them on a monthly_basis , and they would definitely have made more money by refunding the Â£ 0 . 00 they stole from me than losing my custom .
F	absolutely_shocking , disgusting , and probably illegal .
F	i will_definitely be taking this further .
F	i spent my first day at university waiting four hours for a delivery .
F	i had specifically booked a time and date for the delivery to come so that i would have all the essential items i needed .
F	i phoned customer_services who told me that ' the driver wasn ' t going to come '.
F	nobody phoned me to tell me that the driver wasn ' t coming , so i wasted a whole day waiting in the lobby of my accommodation .
F	asda didn ' t give me a reason for the lack of delivery and said there was nothing they could do .
F	i explained that i had just arrived in a new city and had no duvet , pillows , bedsheets , cooking equipment or towels .
F	the lady i spoke to was rude , lacked empathy and literally asked , ' what do you want me to do ?
F	'.
F	i have never_experienced such awful service in my entire life .
F	i am not one for writing reviews , but i have never felt so stressed and upset .
F	asda didn ' t even have the decency to tell me that my items weren ' t going to arrive .
F	they didn ' t even understand their obligation ( and obvious ability as a multimillion pound company ) to provide the service which i had paid for : to get my items which i had paid for on the day i was promised .
F	really terrible experience .
F	do not use unless you want stress , hassle , and to rack up a huge phone bill trying to get answers out of badly trained , useless customer_service assistants .
F	this website is quick and easy to use i was looking for inspiration and found it straight_away !
F	cant_wait to receive my item
F	used these twice now and both_times the claim items are missing , my partner and i checked everyone of the items and they were all there .
F	it just so happens it ' s the higher value items seem to be missing .
F	my first order i sent a box set , they claim a disc was missing ( even_though i ' d checked them all ) so gave me nothing , their policy_states they won ' t send back items or allow you to dispute them so you have to just accept it .
F	thought we ' d give them a second chance with another order - same problems again .
F	also we got payment via bank_transfer even this is slow , after sending an_email_saying payment has been sent and would take 0 working_days the 0st order took 0 working_days and i even emailed customer_service but got no response , the second order is currently at 0 working_days at is not yet been received .
F	who takes 0 working_days for bank_transfer these days anyway .
F	so overall disppointing , a good way to declutter if your not too bothered about making money on your items .
F	we won ' t use again .
F	side note - this company is deliberately blocking negative_reviews to boost there positive_feedback .
F	i ' ve send in proof of purchase but still under investigation by their customer_service - notice how non of the positive_reviews get blocked / investigated .
F	steer_clear of this company .
F	so i had two parcels that needed collecting and delivering .
F	so i used city_link .
F	they sent the shipping labels and i attached them to the packages .
F	it was a next_day service so they picked_up and then delivered the next_day as expected .
F	they even sent me and email and text to say the parcel was delivered - excellent !
F	or so i thought .
F	i then discover that the had some mixed up the parcels and delivered both to the wrong_address .
F	how is this possible - their shipping label was attached to each parcel - but they ignored this and sent them both to the opposite address .
F	i ' m fuming now - one of the items is a Â£_000 lens .
F	luckily both the people who received the parcels were understanding , helpful and honest .
F	i contacted city_link they appologied then said they would re - collect the parcels and deliver them to the correct destination .
F	not ideal but i guess at_least they trying to reticfy the problem .
F	but guess where they tried to collect the parcel from - the original collection point !
F	i mean are these people for real ?
F	it ' s like a bad comedy show .
F	i ' ve actually got my partner to pick_up the parcels and deliver them himself so that the high value parcels get to their destinations .
F	considering we live in telford and they were going to middlesex - this is really inconvient .
F	on top of that city_link won ' t refund the postage because and i quote ' we delivered the parcels on time ' obviously their t ' s and c ' s don ' t state that they actually have to deliver the parcels to their intended destinations .
F	i won ' t ever be using city_link again .
F	i mean i ' m sure if you wanted to post an item and it end up at completely the wrong_address then they are great .
F	it ' s like a big game of pass the parcel when it arrives it ' s a surprise to see what you have actually received .
F	but it ' s unlikely to be what your expecting !
F	oh and it may also be soaking_wet like one of our parcels - i think they thought having fragile written across it mean they should throw it in a river and try to fish it out again .
F	so many big chain companies have fallen recently , how are bhs not one of them .
F	their customer_service is truly shocking .
F	i placed an order on - line , got an_email confirmation and i though that was it .
F	a few_days_later i noticed i ' d been refunded for my purchase .
F	so i logged on to my bhs account only to find they had cancelled my order due to ' item no_longer available ' no - one bothered to contact me to inform me of this .
F	so i send an_email to their customer_service - which has been ignored , so i logged on to their facebook_page and sent a message their - also ignored .
F	a simple email or phone call was all i expected to inform me that they could not full - fill my order but they don ' t seem to respect their customers enough even to do this .
F	i ' ve always admired bhs having shopped in their stores frequently , this was my first on - line order with them and it is also my last ever purchase at bhs .
F	the website was easy to use , and allowed me to find exactly_what i was looking for and purchase online - no more phoning loads of garages to check stock and book appointments .
F	great service ...
F	i ' m british , my family live in england but i live in the states .
F	i wanted to do something special for my mum ' s birthday because i couldn ' t be there and i figured interflora would be a safe bet ... wrong !
F	when she got them some of the flowers were dead , some had literally grown fur and mould , she had to through them straight out because they smelt so bad being that they were rotting !
F	needless to say she was disappointed and i was gutted .
F	never using interflora again !
F	a website messed me around with my order so i looked them up on google which lead me to here .
F	i ' ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
F	( however with people posting so many reviews with pretty_much the same spammy reviews i don ' t know how much i can trust the reviews on here , scrapping the whole ' our friends ranking ' section would probably lead to more honest reviews and not people seeking ' fame ' or maybe make people elaborate more on their experiences ).
F	a huge_range of items available , fast delivery and fair prices , used the site on several_occasions and never once had a problem .
F	' very ' sent me an_email with a code for Â£_00 off , redeemed the code and got no discount , turns_out the discount comes off my next order , the email said nothing about that and implied that it was for my current order .
F	took advantage of a ' 0 for 0 ' on tops offer , only came to Â£_00 total for 0 tops .. oh plus Â£ 0 . 00 delivery .. only 0 tops came as the other was out of stock .. two_weeks_later the other top turned_up , charged me another Â£ 0 . 00 for delivery and tried to charge me another Â£ 0 for the top , argued it and they knocked the Â£ 0 off like they should ( esp as the promotion is still running !)
F	but still got charged the Â£ 0 . 00 !
F	so in the end payed Â£ 0 delivery which was the price of one of the so - called ' free tops '!
F	used a buy now pay next year code , tried to pay it off they said i have to wait_until the following month , following month i tried and i ' m charged interest .
F	when trying to order by phone they keep trying to sell you other items , even if you say you don ' t want anything_else they still try to pressure you into their overpriced junk !
F	they ' re always phoning to tell me about their awful promotions that i do not care about , i ask them not to but next_day i ' ll get the same call from another person .
F	delivery costs far too much , esp when it takes a week to get here , i live in a main city not out in the country or anything like that so i have no_idea why it takes so long .
F	very . co . uk has put me off using any other catalogue , they are awful .
F	despite the website saying the packaging is discreet i was still a little_worried , however they were true to their word , plain packaging , on the side of the label it said [ company name removed_] in a tiny font which most people wouldn ' t even notice .
F	i placed my order around 0am on monday and qualified for first_class royal_mail tracked delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ) .. my order came the following_day before 00am .
F	the items are of high_quality and if you check out the ' deal of the day ' you can grab yourself a bargain for a few_quid !
F	overall this was a pleasant shopping_experience with no embarrassment from shopping instore .
F	i ' d heard of the site so assumed i ' d be fine using it , wasn ' t until after i placed my order that i even thought to read a review , found loads of bad ones and a few good ones , but seeing as how i already ordered thought i could be one of the lucky ones and get my stuff .
F	my order status changed the following_day , thought my order is coming , few_days_later get an_email_saying they arnt sending either of my items and to contact them .... but also they will keep trying to get hold of one and not to contact them for 00 days ?
F	wth ?
F	just googling the top line of my email got me loads of people with the same problem , site seems happy enough to take your money but they don ' t have any of the items instock despite saying so !
F	used this site for the sake of saving Â£ 0 , not worth the hassle at all .
F	avoid website and stick to one you can trust .
F	i was desperate to go and see beyoncÃ© in concert and couldn ' t get tickets when they first came out on sale , i ' m not an impulse buyer therefore i checked out viagogo several_times read terms and conditions and got feedback from fiends who have previously purchased tickets from the site before buying tickets myself !
F	i finally found the right price tickets for the concert and booked the tickets however i was worried as i ordered the tickets with only a week before the event , i kept checking my emails and my online_banking , i then received an_email less_than 00_hours after ordering the tickets and that is when money was taken out of my account and the tickets then arrived the next_day 0 days before the event !
F	very happy with the service received from viagogo and would use the site again !!
F	!
F	unbeatable_prices , swift delivery and website is excellent , easy to navagate around , there description and details about each product is really usefull .
F	not always had my exact product in stock when ordered but very quick to make a mend and get me as close or the next best thing .
F	highly reccomed using echo_supplements .
F	first of all i did the silliest thing ever and purchased my mattress prior to reading online reviews .
F	once i read the reviews i was very skeptical_about the company and wasn ' t sure my mattress would turn_up in good time or at all .
F	much to my amazement i ordered the mattress on wednesday_morning 00st dec and was sleeping on it thursday 00nd dec .
F	the delivery of the product was excellent , being 0months pregnant i have been finding it very difficult to sleep , and waking_up with severe cramps , but last_night was the best sleep i have had in months .
F	still have cramps but nothing like before and this is only the first night !!!
F	i also got two free pillows which are amazing .
F	there is a slight smell from the mattress , but nothing major .
F	i have already_recommended this company to work colleagues and will_continue to do so .
F	many_thanks zleeps !!!
F	for your good customer_service , fast delivery and giving me the most comfortable sleep i have in a good while .
F	this website is a must for any online seller who uses or is considering using paypal .
F	it confirmed that i was not just experiencing ' bad luck ' in my dealings with this company and that they are well , bordering on criminal in their behaviour .
F	they gve lots of useful_information on how to get your money back from the paypal cowboys .
F	if you have a small online company , especially if you sell items that are likely to be returned , clothing , bridal , do not use paypal as your only means of payment .
F	check out this site to see why and read all the horror_stories !!
F	great site !
F	!
F	as a seller more often than a buyer i found that paypal are the worst company i have ever_dealt_with !
F	they barely operate inside uk trading & financial law & freeze customer ' s account for no reason so they can make a few extra millioin Â£ s profit from their customer ' s money !
F	they always side with the buyer as it is cheaper for them to do this , even if the ' buyer ' is a repeated and known scammer & you can prove they ' re lying !
F	the only reason they get away with this & are not on watchdog every week (!)
F	is ' cos they don ' t tend to rip_off ' customers ' only retailers who have little or no recourse that does not involve costly litigation .
F	they have even ripped_off several charity websites ( the hurricane katrina site is one ) who , by their nature receive a lot of funds very
F	quickly .
F	they freeze / limit the charity ' s account , the charity end up refunding the donor ' s money so they can donate to the charity in an_alternative way and paypal , god_bless ' em keep the reversal fees !
F	from a charity !
F	not a company i shall deal with again no matter how easy they make purchasing on - line .
F	principles have to take precedence over convenience surely ?
F	!
F	i run a couple of online stores and have always found couriers were just too expensive to use , despite the better servive they provide compared to royal_mail ( sorry royal_mail !).
F	a friend introduced me to this site and i thought it was too good to be true !
F	a dog bed that would have cost me between Â£_00 & Â£_00 to send on a 00 hour cost under Â£_00 for 00 hour service .
F	site was easy to use , very customer friendly and i will_definitely use again for business and personal use and have already_recommended parcel0go to several friends and customers !
F	keep up the good work !
F	!
F	i spoke to mark on monday_afternoon to see if i could get a number of bespoke usb â_s made and delivered by friday .
F	as the usual turnaround time is 0 working_days , i thought this was probably a bit of a long shot .
F	mark managed to pull out all the stops and the usb â_s were delivered early on the thursday_afternoon .
F	very happy customers .
F	i love being_able to get exactly_what i want on a necklace .
F	this order was a gift for a friend with an unusual request .
F	the team at mynamenecklace were great .
F	they flagged the unusual nature and double_checked with me - which i appreciated as it meant they got it spot on !
F	plus - if i had made a typing error they would have saved me wasting my money .
F	great communications all_round .
F	i got my order fast and i am delighted with the quality of the necklace and text .
F	will order from you again .
F	thank_you !
F	the site was really easy to use .
F	once i had filled my basket with stuff the payment process was simple and fast as well .
F	i had my items arrive within 0 days of ordering which was much faster_than i expected too .
F	i would use them again and have already_recommended this website to friends .
F	would fully recommend whittards to tea and coffee lovers , though i may be slightly biased as i used to work for them .
F	would like to have a shop closer to me again as the nearest is over 000_miles from me and i like to see and handle products before i buy .
F	( i am comfy buying products from the online shop that i know , tea , coffee and hot choc but not the china )
F	0 ***** i love it
F	it is a user_friendly site letting you sort hostels in different orders ie price , type and allows you to change currency to your local to make booking straightforward .
F	~ great company to use , helpful and easy to talk to if you have a problem and always handle claims respectfully and easily , deliveries are handled quickly and easily and there are many drop_off points so really convenient if you cant_wait in all day .
F	had a problem today and spoke to [_name ] who was very helpful and friendly !
F	highly_recommended !
F	the alteration that we needed to make to our order was easily made with a phone call from the underfloorheatingstore in response to an_email we sent the previous evening .
F	within 0 days the complete order arrived .
F	not only good customer_service but also great value !
F	excellent communication and service was so much faster_than_expected , would definitely_recommend !
F	!
F	i was buying all my supplements from a competitor & realized it was getting way too expensive .
F	a coworker told me about supplement_warehouse & i was immediately hooked .
F	the shipping is fast , they always have what i need in stock , the prices are cheap , and the price_match feature is awesome ( they don ' t just match the prices they beat the prices !)
F	this is also the only place i know that provides you with samples to try out .
F	long are the days where i have to buy a 0 lb tub of protein only to find out i can ' t stand the flavor .
F	i couldn ' t be_happier with my experience .
F	:)
F	i ' ve been a customer for a few_years and customer_service has always been fantastic , not only on the web but over the phone .
F	ordering is quick and easy and if i do have any_problems i know i can ring and the staff on the phones are helpful .
F	delivery is very fast and reliable .
F	highly_recommended company !
F	fast efficent service .
F	excellent quality goods delivered next_day , with constant upto_date communication from supplier .
F	couldn ' t reccommed enough .
F	in a age when customer_service seems to be dying they are a breath of fresh_air !
F	perfek , god shop med fint udvalg og gode_priser .
F	meget venlig og hjÃ¦lpsom service .
F	hurtig_levering .
F	kan virkelig varmt anbefales !
F	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
F	it world have veen appropriate with a small compensation for all the bother returning the glasses , and for the delay .
F	orherwise the service has bern quick and efficiant .
F	i recently ordered two tickets for the wanted through see tickets .
F	i got these tickets on wednesday using a presale code .
F	the tickets i got were for the nottingham arena show on 0st april_0000 .
F	my original seat allocation for these tickets were block 0 row a and seats 0 and 0 .
F	on friday_afternoon however i got an_email from see tickets saying that due to production change my seats have been reallocated to block 0 row n which is quite high up .
F	so i phoned see tickets to see why the seats been changed and they said due to production changes for example stage layout which is out of there control the only thing they could offer me was a refund .
F	i took see tickets up on this offer hoping that i would be able to get better seats in the general sale on the saturday as don ' t like sitting to high up .
F	anyway this morning i got up in time for general sale and the good news is i managed to get seats for block 0 row a seats 00 and 00 which i am satisfied with .
F	what happened next disgusted me the most .
F	i decided to have a look at see tickets site this afternoon only to find that the original seats i got ( which i couldn ' t have because of ' production change ') were back on sale on there site but at a higher price .
F	i did a screen_shot of these tickets being back on site which i ' ve attached on this email .
F	i also have the email of confirmation of the original seat booking and also the reallocation email .
F	i am very upset with the stress see tickets have put me through just to what seems to me get more money out of the tickets there selling .
F	i ordered a pair of headphones of the site .
F	after i received the headphones i discovered that they didn ' t work .
F	so i emailed wowcher and the advised that i needed to contact the supplier ' chimp electronics ' so i emailed the seller about the faulty pair .
F	a day later they emailed me back advising that they ' ll send another pair if i supply them with an address so i sent them an_email with my address .
F	a week_later i still had not received the new pair so i sent another email to which they replied_saying they haven ' t received my address so i resent the email with my address .
F	after another week and still no headphones i sent another email to which they didn ' t reply to for a few_days .
F	so i emailed wowcher it ' s self who haven ' t even replied to me .
F	chimp electronics did eventually reply saying they ' ve sent the replacement pair but will send out another pair this was 0 days ago and i ' m still_waiting and i reckon i never will see a working pair of headphones or see my money .
F	viziononline helped our small business to become a national , well_established company .
F	the service is always personal yet professional at all times .
F	no matter what time of day it is you can contact viziononline and expect an excellent service .
F	they will do their best to get to know their customers individual requirements and enusre you are always satisfied .
F	even if you are not comfortable with computer jargon they will help you understand in a basic language so that you are aware of what opportunites lay ahead of you .
F	they have made me look at my business in a different way , now the world is our oyster .
F	after order a playstation from two other_places and being messed about i ordered it from simply_games with only 0 working_days before_christmas it arrived the next_day .
F	the delivery company dpd even emailed me with an_hour_slot of when .
F	they would be with me .
F	i was extremely pleased with the service and would definitely use them again .
F	i ordered the handbag late friday_night , by monday_morning i had received a email to say my order was on it ' s way and by tuesday it had arrived .
F	very impressed with the speed of delivery considering it was free .
F	i would absolutely use again .
F	i ordered a couple of containers and a trackable window cling ( and a few other things ) one of the pots was badly cracked due to it being poorly packaged and the window cling tracking_number did not match the copy tag so i now have a useless trackable in my car .
F	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
F	the other products i got were very good quality , the order process was easy and the delivery was quick .
F	selling my phone to mazuma was so much_better_than trying to sell it on ebay .
F	i got a great price , the postage was free and it was all done and the money in my account in 0 days .
F	my sister put an order in for an easter egg to be sent to me , i didnt find out about this till a month after easter when my sister asked me what i thought of it and my reply was ' what easter egg ?'.
F	it turns_out the courier service was to blame and their courier didnt even seem to know where he had delivered it !
F	he repeatedly changed his story saying he had , then he didnt know , and he didnt even get a signature so we have no_idea who ended_up with the gift .
F	my sister then contacted thorntons to ask them for a replacement or a refund , and the cheeky bugger tried to worm their way out of it !
F	my sister eventually got her refund after many snotty emails and an eventual threat to get their amazon store taken down .
F	never ordering from them again , hotel chocolat on the other hand were excellent .
F	i had the best experience with glasses_direct ...
F	i have never bought glasses online before and like most others i was slightly dubious_about the whole idea to start with .
F	however , the free home_trial system at glasses_direct is absolutely_brilliant ...
F	it ' s a great idea and puts you at ease for finding your own style - delivery is prompt too and there is no return_postage to pay which is fab .
F	after my first home_trial i ordered my prescription_glasses .
F	i decided to be a bit daring and choose a bright colour frame that wasn ' t in my home_trial pack .
F	when i received my order ( only a week_later ) the colour did not suit me one iota !
F	nevertheless i gave gd a call and they sent me a returns form - the staff on the phone were more_than happy to help - and even then i did not have to pay for return_postage , it really is excellent service , it ' s just a shame other_companies can ' t follow in their footsteps .
F	i am now awaiting my new ( normal colour ) glasses and can ' t wait for them to arrive !
F	thanks glasses_direct - i ' ve told all my family and friends about you
F	i have two cats and it can get very expensive buying frontline from anywhere_else - the vets rip you off and even pets are home are very dear .
F	i have recommended to all my friends to use viovet ; o )
F	i love moon_bingo .
F	friendly chat rooms , great games , big wins .
F	my wins have came in great to get my kids treats and the chat_hosts have got me through some long nights :)
F	the staff in the showroom were every helpful & arranged fitting of my new gas fire as well as removal of the old one .
F	it looks fantastic & couldn ' t fault the service .
F	the fire is in within 0 weeks of my first visit to the showroom .
F	a great company .
F	fast delivery , good product information and a helpful customer_service team .
F	thanks you !
F	excellent received within 00_hrs of ordering .
F	will def use again :)
F	very pleased with the service i received from start to finish .
F	will_defiantly be using again .
F	0 * service prompt delivery & excellent value .
F	will def be back again
F	whilst trying to book flights on this website , the times and prices constantly changed .
F	we then rang up and the prices were actually Â£_00 more .
F	after this , they would not let us book as they had messed something else up in october ( booked a hotel room , then cancelled it , then charged us twice ) which was blocking my account .
F	i called to sort this out , ( this was the fifth phone call by now ).
F	i told the woman i spoke to about 00 times that i couldn ' t book but she continued to ask me for my booking reference , i then asked to be put through to a manager , was put through to customer_services who i couldn ' t hear properly , then they put me on hold straight_away .
F	i stayed on hold for 00_minutes then hung_up .
F	ridiculous .
F	never using them again .
F	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
F	they never arrived .
F	what is worse , is i have contacted iflorist two times ( they seem to have no customer support number ) and they have ignored both my emails , not even offering an explanation or apology .
F	i would never recommend using this company .
F	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
F	who sorted my order out and got it out on time even_though i was a real pain in the neck .
F	basically i reordered twice becasue of my hair trials and she didn ' t mind and made sure the items got to me well in time !
F	xx awesome
F	helpful especially on rebuilding poor credit .
F	!
F	i live in a village and when i got a brand_new phone with their contract they said i live in a strong orange network area what a load of rubbish that was i have to stand by the back door just to get a signal i can ' t get it anywhere_else around the house so i would not recommend orange to any one
F	ordered from this site twice and have no_problems with them .
F	delivery is on time , very good prices of the products .
F	beats the high_street for sure and more choice too !
F	called me at 0 . 00am to confirm a time_slot , was polite and cheerful when they arrived .
F	quick service , they did not disappoint .
F	would recommend and will_defiantly use again .
F	back in jan we ordered an item through an ebayer , who chose hermes & 0 weeks_later no delivery , no calling_card etc .
F	the seller called them and they said delivery had been attempted twice !
F	well why was there no calling_card ?
F	chasing and chasing , another week_later and we finally have a card through the door - 0rd and last attempt it said !
F	i can put money on it that it was in fact his first attempt !
F	he left a scribble of a number on the card - so had to guess most of the number , he didn ' t have much to say when he was proven to be a liar and that he hadn ' t even attempted to come and deliver .
F	i mean what do they do ?
F	sit at home nicking peoples parcels and saying they ' ve delivered them ?
F	i mean really !
F	as we work during the week he was unhelpful by saying he can only deliver during the day and midweek and he cant leave the parcel in our garden or coal shed because he cant come on our property ??!!
F	what the heck !
F	i have never_heard such crap from a courier .
F	eventually we had to get him to throw it over our garden wall and hope that it didn ' t get damaged .
F	as he is too frigging lazy to open the gate right next to where he chucked it over !!
F	!
F	0nd experience i had with them was when i ordered something from zaggora - ordered some expensive clothing which i really wanted to arrive quickly .
F	00 days_later - nothing !
F	i had purposely had them sent to work so i knew someone could sign for them , i contacted the company and they told me when it was passed to the courier ... only 0 days ago !!!!!
F	they gave me the tracking_number , i went online and it said ' delivery failed - address query '.
F	i know for a fact that the office gets a good three deliveries from this company a week - and to be fair the driver is always good , and friendly so i knew that the problem must have been from somewhere in the warehouse .
F	and why the hell don ' t they tell anyone there was a problem with the order !!!
F	they just left it there !
F	i was so angry i have to admit i sent quite a rude email , but i was so fed_up of being messed about by this company previously and had spent a lot of money - i wanted the service which was paid for ... they got back to me and said the address was incomplete - well it wasn ' t when zaggora confirmed my order so im pretty sure it was hermes ' cock up again ... the company had to send a whole new order out - which i did receive within 0 days ... so was 0 weeks before i received a delivery which was suppose to be a max of 0 working_days !
F	!
F	i am now awaiting another parcel ( ordered from a retailer and hopefully the last ever order to be couriered through hermes ) we were told it would be delivered by thursday 0th_july ... what a surprise - no delivery or calling_card as of yet .
F	i will be doing my best to avoid this company and will think_twice about purchasing a item if they are the chosen courier .
F	i ' d happily pay more for a service which i know i will receive .
F	i don ' t want to pay for a service from a company run by a bunch of cowboys .
F	watchdog should seriously think about looking into them !
F	and i rate them 0 not 0 star !
F	i brought a cello for my friends 00th !
F	they ensured that tis would arrive on time as i ony had a short window !
F	throughout involvment with gear for music i have been impressed by their excellent service .
F	duncan and jon ( in customer_service ) were fab in dealing_with any_queries i had , responding swiftly and really going the extra_mile !
F	i am always nervous_about buying over the internet but would reccommend their company to anyone !
F	best buy and sevrice i have made / received all year :) five_star service !
F	excited to find my supplement 00 $ cheaper_than the store near by , as well as tons of free_stuff !
F	have been with orange for the past 00yrs and never incounted a problem
F	after being messed about by another company i deceided to place my order with hi fi headphones .
F	it was delivered on the day they stated with no_problems .
F	wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending them in future .
F	this is the second time i have purchased a new car from stoneacre and yet again i have been more_than amazed with the service i have received not only while in the buying process but the follow_up service after the deal is done !!!
F	stef and his team go above and beyond to ensure everything is 000_% to your satisfaction .
F	i would recommend buying from them to anyone !
F	after researching for an_hour or so on sunday , sell your laptop offered the best price for my old laptop .
F	i was impressed that they courier collected it ( incurring no postage_costs ) on monday_morning and the funds were tranferred into my paypal account on tuesday_morning .
F	excellent service sell your laptop - will be recommending you to friends !!!
F	!
F	a laugh a minute from beginning to end .
F	ticket buying was easy and straight_forward .
F	the show delivered everything i hoped it would .
F	miranda hart was great !
F	very simple booking procedure , instant email confirmation , hostelbookers has the best deals for budget accommodation
F	we have used meet and greet services at numerous airports before and never had any_issues .
F	firstly we were made to wait around 00_minutes when we first got to the airport and the guy who drove our car away had no id and could only speak pigeon english !
F	it was the first time we felt uneasy leaving our car with a meet and greet service .
F	on return our car has obviously been involved in a minor incident , leading to two alloys being scratched and a type being ripped apart .
F	our spare tyre was on ( replacing the tyre that had been punctured ) and the " chauffeur " - i use this term loosely - had absolutely no_idea about what had happened , although he had been driving the car with the spare tyre on .
F	a complete_joke !
F	we then had to drive home with the spare tyre on at 0 . 00am in the morning , and spend the rest of the day sorting_out a new tyre and the other issues .
F	attempts to get an answer from head_office have proved futile over the past two_weeks .
F	but until i do , i will be doing my upmost to warn consumers of this company ' s shoddy - and dangerous - approach to business .
F	avoid at all costs !
F	i have used cash genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
F	i would definatley recommend them .
F	supplementwarehouse . com is my official go to website for all my supplemental needs .
F	their website is very user_friendly , their customer_service , even through the internet , is exceptional , and they have all top names available on their site for the best price .
F	i recommend supplementwarehouse . com to anyone and everyone .
F	unfortunately you do not have a choice as a customer ordering online as to who delivers your parcel or picks_up a parcel from you .
F	my first experience amazon asked them to collect something x 0 attempts of waiting in all day and nothing .
F	i complained and amazon sent dpd and picked it up first time when scheduled !
F	this experience - rescheduled online for saturday delivery .
F	waited in all day no - one turned_up .
F	telephoned yesterday and spoke to marcus - told me yodel cannot guarantee to deliver on a saturday !
F	it does not say this anywhere on the help or faq_section or on the website when you click to have it delivered on a saturday , it actually says "
F	thank_you !
F	you have successfully rescheduled your parcel ."
F	marcus then took my telephone no and said he would speak to the depot to see if it could be delivered on saturday 0 june .
F	he then came back on the phone and said , we cannot guarantee we will phone you we will try and re deliver it on saturday .
F	i come home today , 00 may and there was an attempted delivery !
F	it has now been returned to the depot and my arranged delivery for sat 0 june was cancelled !!
F	!
F	what the hell is the point ?
F	they could not tell me why this happened nor why it was not delivered last saturday .
F	yodel make you wait in 0am to 0pm for nothing .
F	they don ' t apologise , cannot guarantee to deliver or call you - a delivery company who cannot guarantee deliveries .
F	it is laughable .
F	i am going to inform wilkinsons their contract with yodel should be terminated and will report them to watchdog .
F	do not ever ever use them .
F	i always use this site and have done for around 0 years and its products are the same price as other_sites and delivery is free and fast .
F	i have never had any_problems but i am sure they would sort any out , as they are easily contactable on fb and twitter .
F	they email discount_codes for a certain %_off which keeps you loyal .
F	my order was delivered quick fast !
F	the costume was exactly_what i wanted and i wasn ' t disappointed on the quality either , it was very affordable however they managed not skimp on the quality of the garment !
F	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
F	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
F	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
F	i have checked my bank_account every day for the Â£_000 owed to me and on the 0th working day thought something funny was going on .
F	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0 weeks after i started this whole_process .
F	i will never use this company again , i will be telling everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
F	!
F	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
F	!
F	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
F	utterly disgusting company !
F	the whole_process from start to finish was very quick , this is the second time i have used mazuna and would definitely use them again .
F	excellent
F	this was delivered really quickly , over the xmas holidays .
F	product better_than_expected , well_packaged , and perfect size for my guitar .
F	many_thanks , will use you again in future . ang
F	recently discovered alpharooms - great telephone service when needed but otherwise completely hassle_free .
F	great descriptions , quick and great prices .
F	sooo many resorts and places covered !
F	excellent costumer_service .
F	product as_described and fast delivery
F	if you call the store , they ask you to contact customer_services which is an indian based call_centre .. great .
F	they ' ve also had my phone for over 0 weeks , after going in store today they said i needed a new phone but the main office were out of stock of them .
F	i requested that the provide me with one from their store room and they said no i would need to stick with the loan phone i have !!!
F	and , if i want to get my money back for blackberry and email service , i will need to request it in writing and it can take up to 0 weeks for a response ...!
F	!
F	i have 0 contracts with 0 and certainly will not be renewing ..
F	i always use paypal where possible to pay for items online , as it stores my details and i dont have to keep entering these in everytime i want to buy something on the internet .
F	the only problem i now have is i spend more !
F	me & my partner communicate using skype all the time , either through the laptops or iphones because we are currently living in different_countries and in a long_distance relationship .
F	it is a great , free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long_periods of time !
F	i know dont know what we would do without skype !
F	i would recommend ebay to anyone !
F	i am_currently addicted because there are so many bargins to be had and its so easy to use !
F	i had never used this site until recently & i booked a hotel for 0 weeks in turkey .
F	i was amazed at how much cheaper it was compared with other booking sites , for the same hotel .
F	i also got Â£_00 off my booking with a voucher i had - which made it even cheaper !
F	i recommended to family_members , who also booked their hotel through this site .
F	would recommend anyone_looking for a bargin holiday !
F	i have only actually ever purchased anything from boohoo . com on two occasions , but on both of those occasions they have over - excedeed my expectations .
F	there items are cheaply priced ( compared to other_retailers ) and are very good quality .
F	the delivery is excellent as i have always received approx .
F	0 days after i have placed my order and only used standard delivery .
F	i would recommend anyone to shop on boohoo . com !
F	my experience with optical_express was great , from start to finish !
F	i was 00 when i decided to go for it ( just over a year_ago ).
F	i had thought about having laser_eye_surgery for a long time but suffering with anxiety , the idea of having it done was scary to me .
F	my prescription was also quite complicated , having one eye significantly more impaired than the other and quite a bad astigmatism in both eyes ... i had always assumed my eyes we ' re too ' complicated ' for surgery .
F	i went on holiday to australia in january_0000 and struggled to decide whether to wear my glasses and be able to see or wear my sunglasses like everyone_else did but be totally blurry !
F	this gave me the little nudge i needed to enquire_about laser_eye_surgery when i got back .
F	i booked a consultation with optical_express who checked my eyes very thoroughly and told me ( to my delight !)
F	that i was eligible for surgery .
F	they went through all my available options , without being pushy in any way and told me about the procedure .
F	i went home and thought a little and then decided to go for it !
F	an_appointment was made for me for just 0 weeks_later .
F	i was sent an information pack about who my surgeon would be .
F	this put me at ease further as his experience was very impressive !
F	when i arrived for surgery i was given a few more checks by the surgeon himself just to make_sure everything looked good on the day , between checks we were provided with coffee and magazines , which was nice .
F	i was welcomed into the procedure room by a team of friendly faces .
F	i was put at ease from the outset .
F	the procedure itself was very quick and pain free .
F	the surgical team counted down the time left so i knew_exactly_what was happening ( which was great for my anxiety !)
F	after surgery i was checked again and given eye_drops and some information for post surgery .
F	as the anaesthetic wore off my eyes , they felt gritty and watered a lot .
F	i went home and slept for a while .
F	when i woke_up they were still a bit stingy but the first thing i noticed was that i could read the sky tv guide ... whilst sat on the sofa !!!
F	i couldn ' t believe it !
F	this was literally hours after surgery !
F	the gritty feeling lasted no more_than a day or so and it was completely bearable .
F	after 00_hours i went back to optical_express for my check up and my vision was better_than 00 / 00 , less_than a day !!!
F	!
F	laser_eye_surgery has genuinely changed my life .
F	no_longer do my glasses fall off my face when i lean over to pick_up my toddler and no_longer do they steam up when i open the oven door !
F	i can read road signs whilst driving , i can see my phone screen without closing one eye and holding it right up to my face !
F	i can see when i swim and when i wake_up and i can wear sunglasses from my favourite shop !
F	!
F	optical_express were and still are amazing , they still look after me now a year on from surgery !
F	i honestly couldn ' t recommend laser_eye_surgery with optical_express more :-)))
F	i ' ve been using cashback for under a year and have earned Â£_000 by making purchases i would have made anyway so i ' m really pleased !
F	it ' s really simple to do , you go to the website you want to make a purchase from through the top_cashback website or app .
F	when i purchase perfumes , i always use fragrance_direct as it is extremely competitively_priced and there are usually special_offers such as discount_codes and / or cashback offers .
F	postage is very reasonably_priced as is the gift_wrapping service which i recommend for presents .
F	pet_supermarket offers amazing value on good quality pet products .
F	i bought royal_canin kitten dry food at a very competitive price and it means i can afford the best for my kittens !
F	it ' s great that you get free super_saver delivery .
F	i wouldn ' t buy my pet products from anywhere_else !
F	i got the introductory offer for Â£_00 after my friend told me about it and was so impressed with the amount of meat as well as the size and quality of the meat !
F	i would definitely order from muscle_food again & have recommended it to all my friends and family .
F	i can ' t believe_how bad this service is compared to iplayer and 0od .
F	constant ads , a snooty pop up yelling at me to turn off ad blocker , picture jumping all over the place , spontaneously rewinds , spontaneously throws in more ads in the middle of a scene then jumps back - horrible !
F	great website , good amount of info and easy to use .
F	i am trying desperately to return an item that has been incorrectly delivered and after five phonecalls and a total of 00_minutes on hold at various points i am no closer !
F	it cannot be this hard to get someone to help me ?
F	avoid if you want to get on with your life !
F	unfortunately in my opinion ebay is now a place to go if you would like to get ripped_off :(
F	good and trustworthy
F	i bought a nice little metal bed_frame for my neice to be delivered friday and you cant go_wrong for the price !
F	thanks to all who helped !
F	would definitely_recommend
F	i have been using this way of booking for at_least the last 0 years and have never had a problem now that is quality :)
F	always in stock great items fast delivery
F	00 days after_placing my order i received my babies 0 in 0 pram could not be_happier with the service seeing as i was worried_about all the bad_reviews about this website i myself found it great and will_definitely be ordering from there again great price great service victoria the netherlands
F	would highly_recommend this company to anyone who wishes to sell their phones .
F	quick , efficient service .
F	posted phone one day and received payment the following night , you couldnt ask for more for this company .
F	used a few ' recycling_companies ' over the past_year or so and can definately day mazuma is by_far the best .
F	got a good price for my iphone_0gs , posted phone ( by special delivery ) and got same day payment the next_day !
F	amazing !
F	most other recyclers took about 0 - 0 days to pay and when they did , it took 0 days for their payment to clear in my account .
F	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother ' s day .
F	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
F	when i tracked my order i could see that it still said allocated and not delivered .
F	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
F	the flowers were not delivered .
F	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
F	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
F	obviously i no_longer require the flowers as mother ' s day has long passed .
F	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i ' m currently at 0_%!
F	all i want at this point is a refund .
F	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer_service is awful and virtually impossible to get hold of and your flowers won ' t even arrive !
F	i ' m giving them until the end of the week to sort this out and if i get no joy i ' m reporting them to trading_standards and watchdog .
F	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
F	i have yet to receive this refund .
F	i have tried_contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get hold of .
F	avoid at all costs !
F	went to test_drive the cashqai at nissan wigan - after driving the sportage and being really disappointed with it !
F	i ' m not an easy person to impress but darren took us out , he was knowledgeable , relaxed and friendly making our test_drive a great experience .
F	he hit the right note with us by not being pushy but knowing everything we asked without having to check .
F	thank_you
F	they reply to customer emails efficiently and are very helpful !
F	great with customer_service , when i got sent a faulty top they quickly offered to replace it free of delivery charge !
F	i order from boohoo a lot as there prices are very reasonable and there always up to date with the latest fashion trends !
F	however the only thing i would say is that when you receive your delivery they send you a little magazine with an offer code to receive money off your next purchase , which i used and was great but they then sent that same code with my next purchase but i couldn ' t use it again , bit_annoying but it doesn ' t stop me from ordering from them !!
F	i think they ' re great !
F	!
F	really good service , i found tickets at the cheapest price around !
F	quite in_advance to the concert so gave a little email to double_check id brought the right tickets , 0 - because i didnt know when they ' d arrive and 0 - because they were so cheap i was scared id brought wrong tickets !
F	but they emailed back that same day , within 0 hours i think and told everything i needed to know , politely and were so helpful !
F	a couple of days_later i got a confirmation call saying they were dispatched .. next_day they were here !
F	love it !
F	willl 000_% be using double0 again for all my concerts and tickets :)
F	i purchased a set of bose ie0 headphones from hifix , i ordered them and they arrived the very next_day .... brilliant .
F	site is easy to navigate , payment is no hassle and the item was well_protected in its packaging .
F	being the ever sceptic , i was worried that due to the price difference from other shops that my product was maybe a fake ..... this was quickly resolved by a phone call and email to bose themselves who confirm they are real and hifix are a registered trader of theres :-) so i would definitely use again , worth a look due to great prices also :-)
F	items of bad quality and unsealed so returned items still no refund avoid this company .
F	hi everyone , i changed from edf to first_utility and i wish i never did .
F	ever since i changed i only have been having trouble with the reading over billed for a two bed house Â£ 0000 for 0months worth of use of electricity and on top of that when we changed back to edf they said that conveniently the the prices went up by december_0000 and i got billed by the same 00p rather_than 00p for the previous 0months (@ 00p and the last months and a half they charge 00p_per unit ) so they split my bill in two regardless of me using less units for the month and a half so they can raise the leaving bill so they wont owe me any money ( being in credit ) and ending up owing them money .
F	we had a dispute about the readings and that last it 0months and a lot of agro and for something that they suppose to do come get a reading their estimate was over 00000 units and for their own mistake i had to fend of credit collection companies that first_utility forward it my " non paid estimate bill of Â£ 0000 " .
F	to put it simply , i would not recommend first_utility to anyone they are nothing but useless and in my eyes a bunch of con_artists .
F	we bought a new single mattress for our spare room from zleeps and we were nothing short of delighted with the service and the quality .
F	we didn â t have a lot to spend , but we were happy to try a single mattress from the bronze range as this seemed to be sufficient for our needs .
F	well , upon laying on the new mattress we â re both agreed that we are going to order ourselves a new memory_foam mattress the first opportunity we get .
F	i ' ve been vaping for almost 0 years now and my current set_up is my trusty but very expensive provari .
F	ive been trying a few disposables for a while now as they are handy for a night out or a spare in the car or what not .
F	im blown_away by the zebra , i love the colour design , but most_importantly the throat hit and vapour produced is somewhat amazing !
F	the other disposables i have tried you have had to suck so hard just to try and get a bit of vapour and even then it was a tiny amount !
F	i love this product so much im even thinking of purchasing the premier pack for nights out or places where i dont want to lose my beloved provari !
F	!
F	i went for the florida citrus explosion juice and wow its amazing , i love it .
F	next_day delivery too , cant_fault it all .
F	you now have a new regular customer :)
F	this is the first time i have used anything like this website .
F	i usually just go to the post_office .
F	because i live a little way away from the post_office and i am at home a lot , i found that the parcel0go service was brilliant .
F	quick , easy and simple to use the website and great delivery service - i would highly_recommend !
F	recommended to me by my trainer , i can see why .
F	myprotein have a good range of products at great prices and deliver fast which is perfect
F	i was desperate for my tent extension ready for the bank_holiday weekend .
F	we ' d shopped_around local but couldn ' t find the one to match our tent ( in moss green ) and came_across this site .
F	easy to use , best price and quick comms i cannot recommend enough !
F	i realised after buying hat i might have purchased the wrong_colour so a quick call to customer_services and they confirmed i ' d done it right and that delivery would be the next_day , i had initially selected 0 - 0 day delivery thinking by ordering mid afternoon 0 days would be a cert .
F	arrived on time , emailed and text to confirm hour time_slot , product fantastic !
F	a very very happy customer , many_thanks
F	i have compared a few different websites for youth hostels and so far this is the best .
F	it is user - friendly and the price seems to be the lowest .
F	there are maps that help me sort out the location and the reviews have been very useful .
F	been using superdrug online doctor for a while now .
F	it ' s great !
F	never lets me down .
F	so busy with working i never have time for doctors appointments these days .
F	all my medication is a click away !
F	excellent !
F	would like to see more treatments available soon !
F	i am_disgusted by this service , i have pay_monthly for my device to be protected .
F	0 weeks_ago ( 00th_august ) i made a claim as my phone has decided to stop charging due to a fault with the charger_port .
F	i am_currently charging my phone via my boyfriends phone in order to have battery_life from day to day .
F	it ' s ridiculous - all i keep receiving is automatic email replies regarding my claim .
F	i would like a response as soon as possible before i cancel this appalling service i am paying for .
F	received my oscar & fitch glasses yesterday and they are fantastic .
F	cheers everyone there who helped_me :)
F	det lÃ¦kreste koncept overhovedet .
F	jeg_har nu modtaget goodiebox 0 - 0 gange , og_har altid vÃ¦ret tilfreds .
F	Ã¦sken er pakket ind i en stÃ¸rre kasse , og der_er_altid bÃ¥nd og silkepapir inden i selve Ã¦sken , sÃ¥ det ser flot ud .
F	der_er smÃ¥ sÃ¥vel som store prÃ¸ver , der_er_altid til bÃ¥de krop , hÃ¥r og ansigt , og nogen gange en lÃ¦kker snack .
F	kommer altid til_tiden , og med_en fin beskrivelse af hvordan man anvender produktet og hvor det forhandles .
F	prisen er endnu bedre , for 000 hver mÃ¥ned fÃ¥r_jeg f . eks .
F	shampoo , creme og mascara , og nogle af tingene i originale stÃ¸rrelser .
F	har_ikke kÃ¸bt beauty produkter i matas og andre forretninger , siden jeg begyndte at modtage goodiebix , med undtagelse af fÃ¥ specielle produkter .
F	det_er rart at modtage en_pakke hver mÃ¥ned , hvor det_er_en overraskelse hvad , der_er i .
F	skoene jeg_havde bestilt kom i en stor kasse , og indeni skokassen hvori skoene var pakket godt ind .
F	de kom til_tiden og skoene er fejlfrie .
F	rigtig_god service , og da der ogsÃ¥ er mange andre flotte sko pÃ¥_hjemmesiden , har_jeg tÃ¦nkt mig at handle der igen .
F	tyres on the drive were fab .
F	matt was polite and happy .
F	did the job no_messing .
F	thankyou !
F	fast delivery , good condition .
F	love love love
F	exorbitant postage charges , items missing , replacements sent late with inadequate postage , lead to charges from royal_mail .
F	no reply to emails asking for a refund .
F	all in all terrible .
F	fast_shipping and great service .
F	i have been completely let_down by wren living .
F	having made a purchase on sat 00th_january i was told delivery would be monday 00th_january .
F	i got a text_message to confirm delivery would be between 00 : 00 - 0 :_00pm .
F	i took the day off and waited all day and the delivery never showed .
F	it wasn ' t until after 0pm that the delivery driver told me they wouldn ' t be coming today because they had run out of time .
F	no attempt was made to explain what i should be doing to rearrange delivery and no apology was offered .
F	i then spent over 00_minutes calling premium numbers to ask what was going on .
F	i was passed from pillar to post and each time had to explain my situation .
F	at one point they even told me they couldn ' t find my order details .
F	i was told that by 0pm today the delivery company would call and tell me when re - delivery would be .
F	have they ?
F	of course they haven ' t !
F	i cannot_afford to wait in for another whole day for the same_thing to happen .
F	my advice do not order from this company .
F	a complete_waste of time and money .
F	you have been warned .
F	very fast and efficient - and cheaper_than high_street pharmacists .
F	not first time i ordered something from here .
F	i ' m satisfied with everything .
F	i will order more from this site .
F	and thanks for great offers :)
F	samantha was an excellent help to me today , she was swift and patient and offered me several options to resolve the problem i had
F	i love all the free_stuff and the great prices !
F	!
F	so i have had talktalk as a provider for my phone and internet since i lived in gosport in september_0000 , i then moved to ely , cambridgeshire in november_0000 , and despite phoning and emailing them they were unable to transfer my phone and broadband until a month after i moved but that it turns_out was the least of my problems , i added tv to my package when it became available and then in february_0000 i then moved to benwick , cambridgeshire and began trying to get my talktalk package transferred to the new house , now at first my new address wasn ' t available on their system , to the point they asked if it was even registered with royal_mail and said they would have to add it to their system and this would take 0 - 0 days , a week_later i then phoned again to find out what was happening and turns_out the request to have my address added had not even been filed so i was told it would take another 00 days - 0weeks , around 0 weeks_later i phoned again - at this point i had already moved out of my old house , it was then they told me that they could only provide me with a phone line at my new address , so naturally i requested to cancel this also involved them asking me if i wanted to put my account on hold for 0 months while i thought about it - not much to think about really as i wanted phone , internet and tv , thinking the request for cancellation had gone_through i continued to set_up my new house with bt as they were able to proivide all services .
F	a month went by and suddenly money for a talktalk bill was taken from my bank_account , now i hadn ' t used any of their services for over a month and having asked for it to be cancelled i got back on the phone to them , where they passed me from person to person hung_up on me and tried to refuse giving me my money back , until eventually telling_me the only was i could get a refund would be in a months time or unless i filed an indemnity claim with my bank - now i did not see why i should have to wait a month for them to pay back money they had essentially stolen from me so i went_ahead and file an indemnity claim at the bank , whilst on the phone talktalk assured me i would be charged no more money and all charges such as early cancellation charges would be voided as they could not provide me with the services i wanted and they had messed me around .
F	finally i was seeing the light at the end of this rather stressful period , until today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) over 0 months after my first contact with talktalk i receive and email telling_me my april bill is ready to be viewed , and this is where i get the biggest shock the bill is a total of Â£_000 . 00 - listing contract breakage fee charges of Â£_000 . 00 + youview + box deferred fee of Â£_000 , so their promises of voiding all charges was clearly yet again another lie and not once did they ask for a return of the youview_box , nevertheless they will not on any circumstances be receiving another penny from me as i have cancelled the direct_debit , and i refuse to pay for their mistakes and lies .
F	got exactly_what i wanted for my sisters upcoming graduation next month , now to choose which one to wear !
F	i had problems with my voucher_code , but i rang the number on the website .
F	the phone was quickly answered , and i didn ' t even have to be transferred anywhere .
F	i was assisted by a gentleman called david , who sorted out my problem in only about 00_minutes .
F	makes a great change !
F	thanks for your help .
F	i look_forward to starting the course
F	great service and very quick delivery of the bag and then of the chq .
F	we have ordered day and evening invites for our_wedding in january and will be back shortly to order the rest of our printed stationery .
F	after an initial mix_up with the colours ( first ours then bride and groom ) i called the company when the invited arrived in the wrong_colour .
F	this was sorted out professionally and swiftly with the correct order arriving within a week .
F	the quality is ideal and great value for money .
F	i can not sing the customer_service highly_enough and have recommended the company to others .
F	westin_gourmet are by_far the best online butchers ever !
F	their meat is out of this world , restaurant quality gourmet produce that never_fails to impress .
F	their corn fed chicken is the best i ' ve ever_tasted and their steaks and roasting joints are definitely worth a try - bursting with flavour and melt in the mouth texture , you won ' t be disappointed !
F	they also sell a variety of condiments , continental meat and cheeses and i recently noticed that they have started selling veal which i am desperate to try but have been unable to find !
F	one of the things that i love about westin_gourmet is their rapport with customers , they are so friendly and helpful and their facebook_page is full of praise and nice comments about their food and customer_service - it almost feels_like a mini meat community !
F	their deliveries always arrive on time and their packaging ensures that your order arrives fresh and chilled .
F	you ' d be mad not to place an order !
F	i wanted something quite specific so was ready for a long a painful conversation but the guys and sport and corporate awards knew_exactly_what i wanted and were so helpful .
F	great service and i am so pleased with the products that i have received .
F	highly_recommended !
F	xx
F	i needed to get a new door mirror for my daughter ' s car after someone " kindly " smashed hers off .
F	np autoparts had the best price and a really easy to use website .
F	the mirror was delivered quickly and everything i needed was included .
F	very pleased and will_definitely use again .
F	thanks .
F	from the order process to delivery this was exactly_what you want from a retailer .
F	the price was the best i could find , the delivery was free and quick , the communication was excellent and best of all the product was exactly_what i ordered .
F	highly_recommended .
F	the range of clothing and accessories on the site never ceases to amaze me ..... and the super_speedy_delivery is just an added_bonus !
F	i bought my brother one of these custom controllers for his_birthday as he is a gaming fanatic , as soon as i ordered i got an_email receipt and then the next_day another email telling_me my order had been dispatched which was very helpful .
F	all in all a fast and reliable service and a great gift for any gamer .
F	very easy to use registered on line send off my phone and the money was in my account the day they received my phone .
F	0 days from registering it online to the payment being in my account fantastic
F	always there at that time of need and that itself is greatly_appreciated .
F	especially when you are learning as you go along !
F	so you can only imagine the amount of times that i have had to seek support due to myself getting a bit too carried a way with for example : wordpress installation , themes , plug ins etc !
F	honestly they have the patience of a saint when it comes to dealing_with me !
M	i ' ve used gmg for a good while now , got around 00 games or more from them as they do amongst the best offers available for them .
M	have had good support from staff in the past for several issues that wasn ' t their fault yet were rectified quickly .
M	the website is easy to navigate , has plenty of selection for each genre , shows voucher offers , new released games and coming soon very clearly .
M	anyway i would put gmg in my top 0 game related companies to purchase from .

M	they have a nice laid_out website which is easy to navigate and has good ways of contacting customer support if need be .
M	james bailey and steven lewitt provide very good customer_service and should deserve a mention for being amongst the best of many company staff i ' ve dealt_with .

M	this review will come_across a little_bit fan boyish , but i really love this website .
M	you can pick_up some really cheap games , and it ' s perfectly legal ( at_least by uk law ).
M	the prices are similar to steam sale prices , and most of the cd_keys are for steam .

M	i ' d defiantly recommend this site .
M	great price and great service .

M	i cannot_praise enough the quality of service and professionalism i have experienced for the order i have placed .

M	thank_you again for making this transaction such an easy and pleasant one .
M	i will_definitely use your services again .
M	internet is shait keeps going off it takes them 0 f_** king weeks to send an engineer over avoid this rubbish company also the phone does work bad work no one should use this company
M	hostelbookers is an excellent site - easy to use , intuitive and extremely cheap .
M	it often has better prices than it ' s competitors and is always the first place i look for a hostel , be it in the uk or further abroad .
M	their service is friendly , efficient and i really don ' t have a bad_word to say about them .
M	which is unusual , as i ' m a grumpy sod .
M	delivery ' s are always on time and the products do exactly_what they say on the website .
M	can ' t fault them .
M	site had low_prices and good selection
M	my xbox_000 disc drive had stopped reading discs , and i had been looking for somewhere trustworthy to get it repaired .
M	when game console repair_centre quoted me just Â£_00 . 00 for a next - day service and 0 month warranty , i must_admit i thought it was too good to be true .
M	but after_reading some of the reviews here on trustpilot , i gave gcrc a go .
M	and i am so glad i did !
M	you will not find a better , cheaper service anywhere_else in the midlands .
M	my disc drive laser was replaced in 00_minutes , at Â£_00 . 00 ( half the price of most other quotes ) with a 0 month warranty as advertised .
M	if you need your console repaired , give chris a call .
M	you wont be disappointed .
M	fantastic service !
M	food delivered promptly in excellent condition .
M	i ' m so pleased with the quality and the price that i will be buying again !
M	this is probably the worst experience i have ever had when trying to book a holiday .
M	first of all their website doesn ' t work properly .
M	when trying to book online , i went to submit the payment and it was just loading and loading but not going through .
M	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
M	i tried to ring customer_service but the line was dead .
M	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
M	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
M	!
M	i have since flown and come back only to see that i ' ve been charged an additional Â£_00 .
M	but rather_than try to help me , they have given me a list of possible reasons_why this may be ( purchase extras and exchange_rate differences ) and asked me to refer to terms and conditions .
M	so now i have to explain to them that any extras i purchased were debited outside of this and the exchange_rate has barely moved .
M	sometimes i think it would just be easier to bang my head against the wall !
M	the mere fact that google is set as my home page says it all .
M	facebook is everywhere nowadays .
M	a very powerful tool and one that i will_continue to happily use indefinately .
M	perfect price , service , usability , perfect in every way .
M	can ' t think of any way to criticise amazon simply because their service and products have made my life_easier in every way possible .
M	thanks to oneclickpharmacy , i can get essential items cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	thank_you
M	i have been a loyal_customer to play for a while now and simply because i have never been let_down .
M	excellent value and service .
M	i have saved a fortune using these deals .
M	can ' t be thankful enough
M	no hassle .
M	excellent quality , excellent price , excellent service , fast delivery .
M	couldn ' t recommend more .
M	got a good deal at affordable_supplements .
M	one of the items included a 0kg box of cnp pro recover .
M	however when the package arrived , the cnp box has been cracked underneath and the handle at the top had been snapped off .
M	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
M	i was dissapointed about this and had to spend time transferring the contents to another box i had which had almost run out .
M	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
M	i had a 0st time perfect buying experience with this company .
M	firstly they were by_far the cheapest seller of what i needed they beat ebay and the other online sellers so i placed my order .. almost strait away they emailed me apologising that they had just sold the last stock and couldnt finish my order so i called them .
M	the extremely_helpful know their stuff team offered me a full_refund with a next shop voucher or an_alternative product completely in my favour worth alot more which is what i took .. i would strongly_recommend this irish company and will_definitely only use them from now on and will be back soon ...
M	thanks guys colin
M	fast delivery , brilliant service and well_priced products .
M	to be recommended .
M	i live in portugal and had a problem with my keyboard , i flew it back to them and they got me a new one dispatched straight to my uk address on christmas_eve ( amazing ) and ready in time for gigs over the new year !
M	very quick , efficient , helpful service .
M	thanks a lot andy !
M	supplement_warehouse is my number one supplement provider .
M	they have very low_prices with quick and easy payment .

M	i will buy with supplement_warehouse for many years to come and i enjoy doing_business with supplement_warehouse !
M	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
M	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
M	its too_late valentines has been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has been ruined !
M	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
M	p . s .
M	hurry up and give me my money back !
M	if i lived closer id be down there collecting it in person !
M	stay_away !
M	used parentpay a few_times , slow processing was one thing but having a letter arrive home in your 0 year_old ' s bag that had your log - in details on is another .
M	comforting to know that the school office and any of the kids they use as runners can now access my account .
M	my advice - not with a barge_pole !
M	ordered a climbing frame , was supposed to be delivered 00 / 00 , saw it was out for delivery between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , teaching strikes were on so kids at home and all excited about helping to build it .
M	waited until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
M	...
M	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it ' s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
M	consignment_number zfbrfu000000
M	my story , i ordered a new ( ex display ) sony tv for over Â£_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
M	due to just moving_house there was a issue with the card , which i quickly sorted .
M	after completing the payment everything went down_hill , i first received a emessage ( their msging system ) saying we are sorry , but due to unforeseen_circumstances your goods have not been despatched for delivery .
M	please continue to monitor your emails for tracking_details .
M	on the friday i asked when it was being delivered and was given a company to ring and consignment_number , the company that i was given was closed for the weekend at this time , so i had to wait_until monday to ring , which i did , the company had no record or knowledge of this consignment , i had also checked on the friday and was told it was being picked_up that day , so why was there no record ??
M	due to it being so late , i cancelled the order , knowing full well it hadn ' t even been dispatched , this took another week to get a reply , i was told it was with the technical engineers and that they would phone me the next_day , my reply to this was of wonder ," why is it there ?
M	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
M	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly Â£_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
M	i have kept all documentation and copied all the emessages that have been sent to me , for legal use at a later date if need be .
M	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don ' t do it from here .
M	i wouldn ' t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
M	sales order 00000000
M	returns associated with invoice # 00000000 rma_number :_00000000 accepted
M	it ' s hectic trying to keep up with my brothers and sisters .
M	my biggest brother lives in spain , my sis lives in mexico , and my other brother lives in franch .
M	dialtosave made it less hectic to keep_track of all the international_calls and so forth .
M	i mean they really saved me a lot of money and i ' m_glad for it !
M	thanks :)
M	everything about the company is faultless .
M	the pricing and quality of the products is ideal .
M	quite possibly the best tasting protein i ' ve ever had .
M	this was also confirmed by the 0 people i referred .
M	the reward_scheme is also great .
M	being_able to earn substantial money per new customer .
M	the delivery service couldn ' t be_faulted either .
M	i ordered quite late and still received delivery next_day .
M	the social_media side of the company is also a bonus .
M	fast response from their twitter account .
M	there is the only the odd product i will go elsewhere for now .
M	years_ago i recomended myprotein to a lot of friends and people in the gym .
M	prices were more_than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
M	after a little break of dealing_with myprotein i decided to give them another shot .
M	all address details were given but once despatch email came through important details of the address were missed off .
M	as i expected no goods turned_up .
M	tried to speak to myyodel which i will never deal with again .
M	i was told that they were signed for by someone i ' d never_heard of .
M	then after a while they told me they wouldn ' t help me any more and that i need to contact myprotein .
M	it took 0 messages to get a response from myprotein .
M	even after this response it was just to tell me the same information of problems that i had reported .
M	even a second response days_later sounds_like the customer_service could not be bothered to read the problem details correctly !
M	feels_like the company has got too big and forgotten the basics .
M	really not happy with the service i ' ve received .
M	the only part that ' s gone_smoothly so far is taking the money from me !
M	will never deal with the company again .
M	unfortunately can ' t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
M	very good customer_service :)
M	i am writing this review and at the same time i am talking to orange customer_service .
M	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
M	on thursday i thought i will give orange a try .
M	gone to argos got myself a payg sim done a Â£_00 . 00 top up and called orange to transfer my number .
M	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
M	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
M	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
M	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
M	come today morning nothing happened .
M	still no porting .
M	so i called orange ( 00p each call to customer_service !
M	) and asked what is going on .
M	long_story short the person i spoke to told me i was given a bulk pac_code ( no such a thing !!!
M	) and it will be done on tuesday .
M	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
M	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
M	the reply was â i can talk over you and customer is not always right â!
M	i demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today !!! impossible !
M	she than cut me off .
M	what a s !!!!
M	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer_service person has cut me off .
M	0rd call now and i am speaking to a supervisor .
M	actually he has just put me on hold and i have been holding for 00_minutes .
M	i told him that i want to make an official_complaint about him and his service and that i am not happy , i want to stop the porting .
M	he has put me on hold and i know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call .
M	well i am on my way to orange shop now and let â_s get this sorted there .
M	never use orange never !
M	i will tell all my friend not to trust them even if the give you free calls for life .
M	what a disappointment .
M	even the supervisors don â t care .
M	!!!
M	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
M	!
M	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
M	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
M	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
M	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
M	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
M	0 weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
M	dont use them if you can help it .
M	bye
M	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
M	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without any funny delays .
M	always use these_guys . just fantastic
M	i ' m very satisfied i found your web_page . reasonable prices , all accessible parts , quick response from suppliers and experienced customer_service . i recommended it to all my friends .
M	i recently_bought a large_amount of flax seeds from the company .
M	i received confirmation when i had bought the product .
M	communication with natural ground was more_than excellent .
M	i received my flax seeds soon after and it was of a high_quality .
M	defiantly be using this company again .
M	thanks
M	had my pre_- order for far_cry 0 insane edition [ pc ] cancelled by another site , 0 days before_release .
M	was sold out everywhere [ still is to this day ], however ,
M	coolshop . co . uk was the only place to get more stock in .
M	while people were cashing in by selling them on ebay , coolshop sold it for a very reasonable_price .
M	was dispatched on the 0th_dec and delivered on the 0th_dec .
M	can ' t say better_than that .
M	will_definitely use them again .
M	* only minor problem was the outer cardboard cover of the game was slightly_damaged in transit , but this is only a minor grumble .
M	the price_match is phenomenal and the free and discounted products with your purchases make it so there is no doubt in my mind that i ' m getting the best deal when i am cashing out my supplements .
M	everything always arrives faster_than estimated and the order is always spot on .
M	fantastic prices and they have absolutely everything .
M	customer_service is also money , they have fixed every issue i ' ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
M	oh and you gotta_love getting free t -_shirts and shaker_bottles !
M	easy and simple to navigate through the web_site and easy to purchase with a speedy_delivery , would definitely_recommend
M	i ' ve been making purchases from green man gaming ( gmg ) for a few_years now , pc games / dlc .
M	sure you can buy most of the titles they sell elsewhere ( steam / origin / uplay etc ), but they sometimes have good deals on that aren ' t running on the other_sites , they ' ve nearly always got discount vouchers , and you can even trade some of your games back in ( i think any that use gmg ' s " capsule " thingy )!
M	brilliant .
M	i ' ve been shopping at aria . co . uk for about 0 or 0 years now , buying various parts for my computers , and those of my family and friends .
M	there is a number of reasons i always go back to them : fantastic prices , speedy_delivery , very helpful staff .
M	the community on the forums is ( for the most part ) also a very friendly / helpful one .
M	twice i ' ve had to return items , and both_times the staff have resolved my problem very quickly ( same day ).
M	00th of january i ordered myself a new cpu_cooler , the corsair h000i .
M	i ordered at around 00am , and it was in my hands by noon the next_day ( free delivery too )!
M	can ' t say_fairer than that .
M	keep up the good work guys !
M	a friend showed me supplement_warehouse a few_months_ago and now it ' s the only place i buy my supplements .
M	the site is easy to use , the prices are better_than any other site i ' ve gone_through , and their customer_service is the best i ' ve dealt_with .
M	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
M	i got a month web i should be able to stream and download , on the first day i couldnt even watch youtube or dowload , second day i rang up they said they will refresh my account didnt work , they did this the next_day also , now on the fourth day i got a text_saying my fair use policy has been excided after not even streaming or down loading .... worst network out there , absoulate bull s ***.
M	this isnt the first time its happend
M	really helpful advice given on products .
M	competitively_priced goods , free next_day delivery and excellent packaging .
M	i would highly_recommend them .
M	can ' t fault this ... amazing product and fast delivery ...
M	recommended to me by a current user and happy to say i ' m pleased she did ... will_definitely be recommending to others
M	so happy i found this site ...
M	i ' m buying from it a few_times a month now ... never had any_problems with products or service ... love it so much that i ' m getting all my mates hooked on it too ...
M	a really top_class digital agency that helped push our website right to the top of google for several important and competitive search terms .
M	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
M	i found taxday . co . uk on google and through a very simple and helpful process , they helped_me claim Â£ 0000 back .
M	i have now booked myself a little trip away for me and the missus and will enjoy that money .
M	we are virgin_media customers that are looking to move home in 0 months time .
M	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
M	the only thing that i could do was to pay the Â£_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
M	i was given 0 options , pay a Â£_000 early disconnection charge or pay Â£_00 a month for a poor service .
M	as mentioned , i was happy to stick to virgin_media for the duration , but they could not provide the same service .
M	they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into .
M	i took the Â£_000 disconnection charge as quite_frankly , the service is not that good .
M	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
M	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
M	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky + offers , it ' s slow and the screen often blurs .
M	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
M	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
M	ordered some 0xu gear from this site .
M	good range to choose from and delivered as requested .
M	i ordered 0 taps from tap centre , one bathroom and one kitchen tap on 0 - 0 day delivery .
M	they both came after 0 days .
M	i will_definitely use again and recommend to all .
M	despite being in ni , the delivery to england was very quick which i wasn ' t expecting .
M	the product was well_packaged and works_perfectly .
M	really easy , sent my ipad on thursday had the money in my bank wednesday_morning , seems much_quicker_than alternative companies and a much_better price , deffinetly recommend .
M	this website has an amazing selection of the top supplements , or if you just need a multivitamin .
M	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
M	it is the very first website i check to look up a supplement i want to purchase .
M	and it will always be the main website i use for all my supplement purchasing .
M	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
M	will recommend to all my friends :)
M	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening speed .
M	no more shifty envelopes from china coming through the door .
M	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
M	really cant_complain with the service that we received from chillisauce .
M	the booking process was really simple and allowed individuals to make installments if they wished .
M	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
M	the whole_thing is geared for stag groups and caused no_problems at all .
M	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
M	we couldn ' t complain with any of the staff and we had great customer_service throughout .
M	in short great customer_service , made everything smooth and easy and good value for money .
M	no_complaints .
M	.... oh and plenty of booze which every stag_do should have !
M	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
M	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
M	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
M	brilliant service highly_recommended
M	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
M	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
M	on the other occasions , i have had the money transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
M	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
M	mazuma is a company i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend to my friends and family - 0st_class !!
M	!
M	make it clear !!!
M	!
M	and plus gameseek people how long does it take to receive new stock ?!
M	order a few_days ago and kind of understand that its out of stock now !!!
M	well its just not good enough !!!
M	a game that i bought has to now be here in 00days for a birthday_present .
M	not trying to fob you off gameseek but if it doesn ' t get here in time i am going to have a extremely upset relative !
M	i have contacted you twice now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn ' t good !
M	not trying to play a gilt trip here because they never really work but please could you try your best to get bakugan defenders of the core psp game in stock , if this is at all possible you will knock [_link ] my favourite online store right off its pedal - stool .
M	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again ....
M	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock ......
M	excellent service , giving you the option to track the progress of the unlock .
M	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
M	very happy i had been quoted around 00 / 00 pounds to unlock my phone in the local town so was very happy to see just 00pound on iphoneunlock !
M	took 0 . 0 days to unlock and was worth the wait , i thought it would of tool longer !
M	thank_you !
M	dealing_with company has been extremely frustrating .
M	staff are polite , but once the order is in , they make almost no effort to get the items to you in a way that suits you .
M	bizarrely long waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
M	if you are away or on holiday , then expect a few more weeks wait .
M	if you try to cancel out of sheer frustration , they ( illegally ) try to keep deposit to cover delivery that has not even occurred .
M	avoid
M	i am on a business contract , our company has been on vodafone for many years , my iphone had some issues within 0year and 0 month of having the phone , and of course it is not covered by warranty .
M	however , vodafone offer no other way of warranty such as other_companies do , e . g .
M	john_lewis offer 0 year_warranty on ipads .
M	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
M	while trying to sort this out , or seeing if they can offer me some kind of replacement or cheaper repair rather_than the Â£_000 to fix it .
M	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
M	their service was dreadful on the phone .
M	when i was told someone would call me back in a specific timeframe , no one did , i kept having to chase them up .
M	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
M	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
M	service is dreadful and now the account_manager is now a team and not just one person .
M	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
M	company does everything which it says - great price and product :)
M	good pricing , great product !
M	thanks !
M	didn ' t receive product , so emailed customer_service .
M	no reply .
M	i called them up after 0 days and was told i would be called back later .
M	i wasn ' t that day so read reviews which said they don ' t always get back to you , they did saying it was sent to billing_address .
M	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
M	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
M	wait ages for assistance !
M	partmaster website is rubbish , next_day delivery doesn ' t mention no sat delivery , you pay through the roof for a lousy controller !
M	avoid this chain at all costs
M	very organised site ,
M	every product is very well displayed and categorised professional_manner ,
M	really helpful .
M	these things are not available on different online stores .
M	rates are normal .
M	delivery time is good or ok .
M	but how they deliver is perfect .
M	but i spent more_than 000_pounds , they didn ' t offer any discount or gift , :(
M	absolutely_useless .
M	items never delivered within timescales , when large items are finally received they are damaged .
M	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer_service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
M	looking over the reviews on the internet it is surprising this company is still trading .
M	would recommend that everyone stays away from they are a complete disappointment .
M	please don ' t be_fooled by the positive_reviews listed below i can only assume they are left by the owners of the company or there are a few lucky people .
M	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
M	i ordered the gloss white tv_unit , came in 0 boxes and weighs over 000kg .
M	all boxes perfectly intact on delivery however almost every piece is damaged and scuffed .
M	you cannot email or call the customer_service department as there is no phone number !?!
M	i was never offered a refund or a replacement even with their guarantees .
M	you will be lucky to get through on their only number , however when they do answer they will be more_than happy to take your money but if you have a problem you have to call the same number which they always promise a callback from this socalled customer_service team .
M	after about 00 promises and emails to the sales_team no callbacks happen .
M	if you get scammed please call your card company for a refund .
M	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
M	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
M	took about 0 months however have now received a full_refund and will now take a trip down the scrapyard to dispose of scrap that was left at my house .
M	please stay_away from this dodgy company and use a company that has all positive feedbacks as you will be very sorry when you get caught out .
M	fast , great service and the best prices !.
M	i reccomend to everybody ..
M	first time i ' d used blackcircles .
M	have been going to the same tyre place for 00 years - was checking typical prices online and decided i ' d give blackcircles a try .
M	had the same tyre cheaper_than my normal place ; the centre i chose for the fitting was great - no waiting , courteous staff , job well_done .
M	nothing but a good experience - will_definitely be using blackcircles again .
M	i ordered a shower tray and a new sink from wd and it was a bit of a disaster as , even_though it had loads of packaging the courier managed to break the tray .
M	i rang them and got straight through to a lovely geordie chap , who sent me out a new tray next - day .
M	mistakes_happen but it ' s how a company deals with them that is a mark of the company .
M	good stuff wd !
M	!
M	i ordered a kit for christmas prezzie and it came within a few_days .
M	it was the best price i found online and the products were great .
M	can ' t wait to get my girlfriend sushi making !
M	i lived in miwaukee wi for many years .
M	i always used the local supplement_warehouse store to physically purchace my products .
M	the staff were always knowledgable on products and helpfull in finding the right products for me .
M	you cant_beat the prices .
M	i now live in arizona .
M	supplement companys out here are way over priced and not knowledgable in their products .
M	i will_continue to use supplement_warehouse as my supplement company .
M	i also just recently found them on facebook .
M	they seem to answer peoples questions on there and have a great customer support .
M	i dont think anybody does it better_than supplement_warehouse
M	brilliant , it has got to be the fastest delivery i have ever received online ( and i have order a lot !)
M	and great prices too !
M	of all the places i ' ve searched for good quality furniture at a reasonable_price , pine_solutions is the best , after my brother and sister recommended the site to me i am now on to my third purchase .
M	enough said !
M	great .
M	experience , i use them always
M	fast dispatch , good communication in different formats plus great variety of products
M	got the phone on the day they said i would , whenever i had a conversation with them over the phone they were very professional and courteous .
M	offered very good deal and would definitely deal with them again .
M	i bought a kingston ssd and chose the free delivery , when i bought it there was 00 + in stock , 0 days_later , the status still says " goods allocated ", so it hasn ' t been dispatched yet .
M	to make things worst , they took the money straight_away , with no emails about any updates about my order .
M	and the estimated_delivery was 0 weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000_+ in stock apparently .
M	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
M	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra Â£ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .
M	guess_what ?...................
M	0 days_later , it still says " goods allocated " as the status , and now it says 000_+ in stock , and of course no email about any update with regards to my order .
M	what a joke !
M	terrible !
M	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
M	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
M	very fast and reliable service .
M	best price i could find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before_release !
M	which in a winner in my book !
M	high_quality supplements with really quick delivery , would order again when required .
M	this shop is excellent .
M	prices are fairer than fair , and most_importantly , the staff are honest and know what they are talking_about ... meaning you don ' t get fobbed_off with some piece of crap instrument that ' s clogging up warehouse space .
M	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
M	after upgrading with phones0u , the sales_person advised a recycling comparison site for old_phones .
M	the result to give most money for my galaxy sii was money0yourphone . com and after some research online , i opted for them .
M	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
M	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
M	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don ' t know .
M	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to Â£_000 .
M	signed for mail i believe is only Â£_00 .
M	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
M	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
M	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
M	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
M	very happy .
M	a friend_recommended a deal on game collection for a 000 wireless headset and they were by_far the cheapest .
M	i got the headset in the post 0 days_later .
M	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
M	i would highly_recommend game collection and will check them for any future_purchases .
M	i ' ve been buying from aria as an individual for several years now and i have never had a problem , either with aria or their couriers ( citylink ).
M	the company i work for also has a trade account with aria and our account_manager is always friendly and helpful , even_though he supports liverpool fc and not everton fc lol .
M	i ' m a member of the aria forums and they have many incentives for members i . e .
M	competitions , free deliveries ( certain_amount of posts ), help and advice from the staff via the forums .
M	i would and do recommend aria all of the time !
M	if your paitent and have your ticket ready to scan your fine !
M	thankyou guys :)
M	excelelnt service and loyalty_scheme
M	my order was despatched promptly , arrived the next_day and was well_packaged .
M	very good value for money .
M	i was very pleased with the efficient service received from personal_injury assist .
M	they took care of all the necessary documents and made the process seem so easy .
M	i would and have already_recommended this company to family , friends and colleagues .
M	joined british_gas homecare and had a problem with my boiler in my flat .
M	had 0 appointments to my flat for a various bs engineers to fix a problem .
M	either the engineer didn ' t turn_up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time , but didn ' t have the part and had to arrange another visit !
M	or he broke something else on his visit .
M	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
M	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren ' t able to go on a holiday .
M	very unhappy - eventually i came to the end of my tether and cancelled the homecare .
M	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
M	after the nasty experience we got a local engineer to come around and fix the problem the next_day - should have done this in the first place .
M	a very expensive and unpleasant experience .
M	don ' t believe the slick adverts and marketing .
M	british_gas have the worst customer_service in a company i have very come_across .
M	i will never use british_gas for anything again .
M	very poor service from plumbworld - i waited in for a day , it didn ' t arrive and no contact was made .
M	i tried to phone the delivery company ( yodel ) but their phone_lines didn ' t work .
M	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
M	i waited at home again ( took time off work ) and again no delivery .
M	couldn ' t phone them and they failed to contact me .
M	after this frustrating experience i tried with little success in emailing plumbworld several_times ( they have no phone number ).
M	they did little to help for a full week - all this time my builder was waiting for the bathroom pieces to install .
M	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
M	i was getting more and more frustrated ...
M	eventually plumbworld sent out a second delivery with my stuff via a different delivery partner , seems that the first set had got lost by yodel .
M	this did arrive !
M	although a part of my order was missing and i ' ve got to wait 00 days for delivery since the date i arranged for it to be delivered .
M	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
M	but if you have any_problems you are in a world of pain .
M	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
M	they did refund me my delivery charge , but that is the least they could do under the circumstances .
M	items arrived when expected .
M	fast and efficient .
M	good quality products and was as expected . c recommended
M	hopefully you read this review this review , and those below , prior to engaging with this company .
M	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 on monday april 0nd via first_class delivery after being quoted Â£_000 .
M	delivery was confirmed by royal_mail the following_day .
M	no email was received to confirm this from bowozi however as they advise they will .
M	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original_quote by over Â£_000 !
M	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
M	it is imperative that anyone who is considering using this company reads the small_print in detail , you will for example have further reductions on your original_quote by Â£_00 if your phone is network locked and in theory your " used " phone should be in a brand_new condition in order to recieve the quoted payment .
M	in addidition to this if you decline the offer and wish to have your handset returned this will cost you Â£_00 - incurring yet more cost .
M	of course this is if you are able to reach anybody in customer_service .
M	i have spent in excess of Â£ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
M	( the 0000 number provided is charged at a premium_rate regardless of wether or not some body answers .
M	often the line will ring for 00 seconds before being disconnected ).
M	in addition emails between myself and bozowi customer_services have generally been generic and have taken 00_hours to recieve a response .
M	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
M	i will never use this company again and would advice others to avoid like the plague !
M	if the management and customer_service team where efficient at dealing_with their customers as the individual or team who responds to poor reviews on this site then the company would no doubt be far more successful .
M	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer_service department leaving my calls unanswered .
M	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
M	i can ' t say i ' m surprised .
M	as i ' ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
M	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
M	however , your reviews and rating on trust_pilot are clearly a reflection on your company and business style .
M	i recommend you have a look at the pages on this site for mazuma_mobile for example who have an excellent reputation and reviews .
M	i doubt you will remain in business for much longer if you continue to operate your business in such a poor manner .
M	couldn ' t find anywhere doing a sony_xperia sp for cheap but found mobile phone checker and it compared the prices of the contract i wanted .
M	really happy with the phone , arrived the next_day , contract all setup and cheap as chips .
M	been a while since i bought from myprotein with getting_married , baby being born and running my business , but got back exercising and got some banana cream spectrum00 as i always struggled with recovery .
M	it ' s awesome , i feel stronger ( creatine probably ), recover faster and although my sweat smells a little weird ( banana cream and sweat ...) i ' m totally sold on the product .
M	last_year i used to take a different product but this recovery one feels_like it does what it ' s meant to .
M	gains in deadlift and squats are much_quicker_than i thought it would be compared to the first few weeks of no supplement with training .
M	it was a pleasant buy .
M	great communication , process time .
M	0 star !
M	!
M	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel ... not bad i say !!
M	!
M	i purchased a pacman hoodie for my bro at christmas time 0000 & not only was it an exclusive product but at Â£_00 . 00 inc delivery i nthink it was a good deal too .
M	ill bear them in mind for the future .
M	the amazon platform is very easy to use & i like the way the site knows you and has reccomendations .
M	the mp0 store is also very convenient and quick .
M	i would like to see them creating jobs for young people - they are a big company and can make a difference to the uks unemployment problem .
M	i recently_purchased a chauvet gobo 0 . 0 from these_guys and the service and pricing was good .
M	thanks and keep it up !!
M	!
M	very good site and great prices !
M	i love this site its very useful and has helped_me save money
M	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
M	( first use )
M	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
M	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of Â£_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
M	the customer_service has been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
M	they have always been quite helpful and give me good discounts for being a loyal_customer
M	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
M	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og de var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0 dage .
M	love fra mig af < 0
M	you answered questions i had with a professional attitude .
M	i got my costume in time !
M	the costume was perfect !
M	ok i guess .
M	probably will go somewhere_else next time as their checkout wasn ' t super clear so my glasses got sent to an old address and i had to re order again .
M	they weren ' t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
M	i ' m to blame but i expected a little more understanding in honesty .
M	with no doubts hostelbookers is the best hostel reservation website .
M	i use to travel a lot and i never had problem with the website .
M	high_standard
M	easy to book
M	no fees
M	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
M	good value , convenient and prompt delivery .
M	would shop there again .
M	i was picked_up 0 0 / 0hrs before my flight for a 0 0 / 0hr journey the airport .
M	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .
M	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
M	i had paid for a transfer with a maximum of 0 stops however the coach stopped several_times more_than this .
M	when i arrived at the airport because the collection time was so early the check in desk had not even opened .
M	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
M	i have contacted the customer_service team at resorthoppa four times by email without a reply .
M	not much more to say other than i will buy from them again .
M	i got my screen within a few_days of ordering and the quality is really good , i am very pleased with the overall product and will order more from ballicom in the future .
M	it was even better with the extra 00_% so more for your money , and it came within a few_days .
M	worth it if you either do high intensity sport and are regularly at the gym .
M	my laptop decided to die on me so i wanted to get something that was better , and something that could also play games at a reasonable graphics level .
M	i was very happy with the price for what i was getting which is the main_reason i bought it .
M	it has been running well apart_from a couple of hick - ups but apart_from that it is perfect .
M	i would recommend buying from here and i ' m sure next time i ' m looking for a computer this will be the first site to visit .
M	my order went through quickly , and i was contacted by daniel due to an issue with stock that they had .
M	daniel was open and honest about the mistake and even upgraded my order to special deliver as soon as the watch that i had ordered arrived with them .
M	will_definitely order from these_guys again .
M	i had placed an order online for my partner ' s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
M	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much cheaper_than that i had ordered .
M	not acceptable .
M	i ordered some bolle sunglasses via sportpursuit last month .
M	i got them at a great price and they arrived_promptly .
M	i couldnt have asked for any more .
M	am hoping for some good ski kit offers in time for the new season !
M	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
M	prices were great , information up to date - a refreshing start .
M	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
M	the holiday deal was with a ' low_cost airline '.
M	according to the lh faqs , i was to expect my tickets 0 - 00 days before_departure .
M	0 days before_departure , i called as i had not received these , to be told they needed my passport number before allocating tickets .
M	staff were very friendly and helpful , but i did feel this was not good enough .
M	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did ' t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
M	so 0 phone_calls which really shouldn ' t have happened .
M	i ' ve been using quidco for over 0 years now , and have made cashback of almost Â£ 0 , 000 on my everyday spending .
M	i find the service extremely easy , and on the rare_occasions where i ' ve needed to make a claim , their instructions are clear .
M	strongly recommended to all my friends and family !
M	very impressed with your product descriptions .
M	items were despatched quickly and efficiently .
M	excellent quality .
M	could not be more impressed .
M	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
M	i ordered a gates tensioner kit and crank pulley for my mondeo as wanapart were the cheapest supplier by_far .
M	their staff were most helpful , letting me know exactly when i could expect to receive my purchases .
M	when the crank pulley turned_out to have been incorrectly manufactured ( not wanapart ' s fault ) they couldn ' t have been more helpful , sourcing a replacement from an_alternative supplier in germany which would have been on my doorstep within 00_hours of my informing them of the issue but for the courier mis_- delivering the item .
M	when the courier did this wanapart stepped up to the mark and spent quite some time resolving the issue .
M	whist there were issues they were in no way wanapart ' s fault , in fact they were completely beyond wanapart ' s control , yet they still went to great lengths to resolve them .
M	faultless and efficient service .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i would choose talktalkbusiness any day of the week over xln !
M	kirsty on the livechat was v v helpful with me as was the gentleman on the freephone 0000 number .... the best customer_service : )))
M	hadn ' t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
M	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
M	just cannot find anything negative about the service .
M	would definitely use the company again , as_opposed to the big high_street ones !
M	i ' m new to the e_cig world and tried my first try of e liquid from you guys , firstly , express delivery next_day to the isle of wight !
M	i thought i ' d have a try of the ciggaweed flavour , it tastes extremely sweet and fruity with a nice amount of vapour , love it !
M	will_continue to order from you always , will be placing more orders for ego and more flavours next week !
M	many_thanks and keep up the good work !
M	it was like what it said in the details
M	this company has blown my mind with its prices .
M	so affordable for the amount you get .
M	i wouldn ' t shop with any other company .
M	since being referred to this company i will never even look at another supplement company .
M	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
M	i have always had a fantastic experience with supplementwarehouse . com .
M	they have very fast_shipping at an affordable price .
M	they have a service where they will beat another company ' s price by 0 % which i have personally been able to use .
M	i also always love the free_samples of products as well as the closeouts and clearance items .
M	i highly_recommend this company .
M	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending_on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
M	i have consistently found hostelbookers to be the easiest , cheapest and most informative website to use .
M	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
M	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
M	i look_forward to continuing to use the hostelbookers website in the future !
M	the whole_process was really straightforward .
M	all they needed was a few bits of info and my phone was unlocked within two days .
M	very happy !
M	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer_service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
M	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you Â£ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they ' ll re - look at the handset and give original offer ....
M	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile phone recycler has to be either mazuma or top dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
M	ordered a pair of climbing shoes which arrived swiftly after i ordered them , however they did not fit .
M	i returned them to banana_fingers , but did not receive an_email_confirming that they had received them ( even_though royal_mail tracking indicated that the package had been delivered ).
M	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an_email that was replied to promptly .
M	my replacement shoes were then despatched to me the next_day .
M	overall great service , and i would recommend your company to others without_hesitation .
M	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
M	ordered 0000 microsoft points at 00pm , and the code was in my email inbox by 00 :_00pm - you can ' t ask for more_than that .
M	also , the price for the points was very competitive , which led me to the site in the first place .
M	overall , i would unreservedly recommend this company .
M	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
M	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
M	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
M	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of Â£_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
M	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
M	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
M	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back Â£_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was Â£_00 . 00 for me ).
M	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
M	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
M	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
M	great service !
M	oh but a word of warning , don ' t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
M	thanks a lot parcel0go !
M	i will_definitely be using you again !
M	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
M	i ordered a bulky computer case ( weighing a solid 0kg ) and it was delivered within two days of me purchasing the item , kudos to amazon for the quick dispatch also .
M	however , this courier showed it ' s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
M	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
M	overall , i couldn ' t ask for more from a courier !
M	amazon are an indisputably great company , with the right ethos to make it ideal for the customer .
M	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
M	another area amazon excel at is refunding purchases , they offer a no questions_asked 00 day guarantee on everything they sell , which they actually keep to ( again much_better_than the competition ).
M	amazon even pay for a courier to collect the item you want to return from your house !
M	you really can ' t get better_than that .
M	however , one thing i would urge you to be wary of is unknowingly buying from random companies through the amazon website .
M	this is very easy to do , with items from amazon themselves looking aesthetically identical to their affiliate counterparts .
M	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
M	if it offers this then the sale is fully completed through amazon themselves .
M	however if you but from a random company , this is like buying the same item off of ebay , albeit a new item off [_external reference_].
M	give amazon a try , you will soon realise why many people swear by it !
M	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
M	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
M	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
M	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
M	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
M	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd ' s next_day premium service !
M	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
M	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two days_later !)
M	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
M	i couldn ' t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
M	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
M	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
M	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again !
M	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
M	( yes they are that good !)
M	if only all companies were this good !
M	their new player bonus is genuine .
M	we changed provider from scottish_power to npower in november_0000 .
M	we paid scottish_power by direct_debit and built a credit balance of Â£_000 by the time we changed .
M	after 00_minutes on their " customer_services " 0000 number (=Â£ 0 . 00 ) they assured me a cheque ( not a direct transfer ) would be sent within 0 - 00 days .
M	it ' s now 00 days and nothing has appeared - and i ' m typing this while on hold .
M	00_minutes so far ....
M	i only hope npower is better !
M	fantastic designs , friendly professional staff , and a very clean shop .
M	overall i would highly_recommend blood sweat & ink tattoos .
M	ordered my keys yesterday evening and received them this morning , well above my expectations .
M	i will recommend them to my friends and will buy from them again in future if i need anything .
M	please dont buy stuff from them they are running a scam .
M	i bought a samsung phone 00 june in Â£_000 . 00 .
M	after ordering i found that they are running scam i send them an_email very next_day .
M	got and automatic generated answer from them which was totally irrelevant answer .
M	next morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
M	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
M	i sent him another email same auto generated email .
M	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
M	she said your order has been dispatched and i asked here tracking no she said courier will give us in next 0 to 0 days so then she will give me .
M	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
M	thanks to allah ( god ) got my money back .
M	stay_away from them .
M	its a scam
M	you can go to local_stores and they just won ' t beat this site .
M	they match prices and ship super_fast .
M	they also toss in a lot of freebies , samples , and discounted items with most purchases .
M	a - 0 place for supplements .
M	price on website is what you pay , looked at other instant delivery sites mentioning promotions that dont work .
M	plain simple price advertised is what you pay and instant delivery !
M	note some website say this but will list weekends orders may take 00_hours to complete , onlycdkeys . com mean instant and 00 / 0
M	really pleased - from finding the right size , ordering and even fitting was all easy to do / find on the website .
M	set clear timeframes on when i should received items and stick to it .
M	says it all in the title !
M	beware of less well_known recycling firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
M	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
M	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
M	other than an offer to look_into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
M	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
M	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
M	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
M	supplement_warehouse has the best competing prices on the market .
M	everything i want and more with great deals , free_stuff , and timely shipping .
M	have tried numerous other_websites and this is by_far the best .
M	supplement warehouses price_match guarantee saves me money every time i shop !
M	i found rattan direct on google , their easy to use website was vey formative .
M	they had a great range of furniture and were very well_priced .
M	when i made my order the delivery date was very flexible and they sent a txt to confirm a delivery window .
M	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
M	we had one hiccup but this was resolved with no charge and sorted the next_day .
M	i would highly_recommend rattan direct to anyone .
M	i certainly would recommend power_tools direct , simple to use site , very good value and quick and prompt delivery service .
M	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
M	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with Â£_00 difference in the price_tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
M	maybe update your pics ?!
M	!
M	otherwise all good .
M	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth Â£ 0 . 00 !
M	this is my favorite company to use for buying hair and salon equipment .
M	i have always been one to hunt around for the best deal but nearly all of the time coolblades has the lowest_price_tag .
M	i highly_recommend .
M	the transactions are super easy to use and so convient to shop on .
M	i would recommend this site to anyone who takes suppliments of any kind .
M	thank_you
M	supplementwarehouse
M	where have you been all my life
M	i have been ordering products from aria for many years .
M	steve and the sales_team are highly knowledgeable and a great company to work with fulfilling our i . t .
M	outsourcing requirements for components .
M	having never_heard of the site before i was a tad anxious to purchase .
M	however .... my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .
M	i bought a ticket off a very well_known site previous to buying this ticket and this other site proved to be a liability , extortionate and a poor communicator .
M	double0tickets you are a hidden gem !!
M	! a +++++
M	daniel evans
M	ordered a number of things from made . com for my new home .
M	had a couple of items delayed by a few weeks until i got the keys , which was done by their helpful callcentre staff .
M	actually the quality of the callcentre employees was generally good .
M	items arrived on time , shipped by either dpd or a specalist " heavy move " courier and were as_described .
M	overall sportsbikeshop offers a reasonable selection of products at a competitive price .
M	the selection overall is not as good for parts as it is for clothing , luggage and other general accessories .
M	very speedy and professional company !!
M	would recommend to eveyone !
M	!
M	supplementwarehouse . com has the lowest_prices on the web for all of your bodybuilding supplements !
M	i ' ve shopped a lot of sites and this one is by_far the cheapest and you get your products quick .
M	simply the best company i have used
M	got the price advertised transferred into my account the day after posting my old phone !
M	what can i say about this company ?
M	quite a lot they always deliver promptly even_though i use the super_saver delivery option it always nearly gets to me in 0 days .
M	i used to be worried_about shopping online but when buying from amazon uk , you can shop with confidence and in this day and age everything is 0 times out of 00 cheaper online which is also great .
M	its always helpful that amazon allow you to read reviews from other customers that have bought the item so you can think_twice before you buy .
M	ordered from them for the first time and then i wanted the delivery faster_than 0 - 0days so they happily changed it to a premium delivery for me and was very helpful lady on the phone that assisted me .
M	i was kept up to date on my order and emailed details all the way .
M	would i buy again ?
M	yes .
M	if you are about to run out of mot , i suggest contacting servicing_stop ltd .
M	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .
M	if there is something wrong with the car , they will take care of that too .
M	i can â t say enough good things about them .
M	very recommended !
M	cheap products and good quick despatch .
M	would happily use again .
M	i took my macbook_pro in to the leeds store with a faulty battery .
M	it came back with a non - working airport card which they claimed , laughably , no_longer existed , the screen peeling away from the hinges and the hard - drive no_longer working and needing replacing .
M	absolutely_disgusting and embarrassing service and the fact that the people in the shop are all so nice makes it even more sickening that they have ruined my incredibly expensive laptop .
M	pathetic .
M	i bought tickets through double0tickets for muse @ 00 and it was hassle_free and they done exactly_what it said on the tin .
M	they were competitively_priced in comparison to other similar companies and delivery was spot on .
M	a friend_recommended this to me and we both bought wildstar on here for cheaper_than it was currently on site !
M	the only reason i was disappointed was because on steam i ordered sniper elite 0 only to later come_across this site and see it for cheaper , but we got wildstar together and sometime soon elder scrolls online too !!
M	great service , quick and easy :)
M	i mean , the ordering was easy .
M	i then had to go on my other e_- mail to verify which i was okay with as it is added security .
M	but putting the code upside_down ?
M	i mean , i put a w as an m . ' incorrect code '.
M	i don ' t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
M	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .
M	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
M	add to this the money - off coupons they frequently post on facebook and you ' ve got a must - try vape store .
M	i ' ve ordered several_times and always receive my order quickly .
M	the prices can ' t be beat and i love the free mixers that come with your order .
M	great value !
M	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent
M	nice and easy to book , very good deal for those on a budget and only a few pounds to secure booking .
M	i have recently upgraded with upgrade experts also i have taken out a new contract .
M	- still to recieve this one in white hopefully
M	i have received the wrong phone colour and no gift as was told would get an accessory pack and also Â£_00 a month_contract however contract say Â£_00 not impressed so going to cancel and go else where .
M	it was easy to use and well_laid_out .
M	simple to understand and i have now used it twice so they ' re doing something right .
M	would use the site again .
M	always an easy site to use and with awesome deals like 00 cent beds it makes travelling for exchange students heaps more affordable !
M	!
M	i order all of my equipment from these_guys .
M	it always arrives earlier_than predicted , the products have always been perfect , and they give great impartial reviews on youtube .
M	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
M	keep up the good work guys !
M	very good nice and absolutly perfect i like to say other to come and play .
M	ordered 000 fresheners , just as a trial , and they arrived on time in perfect_condition .
M	the communication was absolutely_brilliant so will be ordering again in the near_future .
M	i had a representative come round to my house saying the government are offering you a low monthly plan of Â£_00 . 00 a month at a fixed rate till 0000 and i asked will this go up he said no its fixed till 0000 so i thought this was a good offer as i was already paying Â£_00 . 00 for gas and Â£_00 . 00 electric a week , so i took this offer up in november_0000 , come june_0000 i had a letter from eon saying my monthly direct_debit was going up to Â£_000 . 00 a month from Â£_00 . 00 i was discuseted , as this was supposed to be a fixed rate till 0000 , im a single mother on benefits with a low income , thats why i took the offer up in the first place , ive already contacted watchdog at the bbc and going to the citezens advice please be aware do not be scammed by eons offers change providers i will never go back to eon again !
M	i ordered a new desktop off the arbico website and found it very easy to use with many customisable options .
M	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
M	after ordering , you are kept up to date with every_stage of the testing / preparation of your new system with regular_emails and you are also given several options of delivery dates .
M	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
M	highly_recommended !
M	honestly i was sketchy at first , but the order was quick , simple and perfect , got my game & currently playing , excellent service !
M	i would reccomend simplygames to everyone as it stands out from other_websites .
M	the delivery is very fast and effiecent ( 0 - 0 days ).
M	i was very impressed with the prices .
M	a really good gaming website !!!!!
M	i will_definitely buy my next game from here !!!
M	!
M	for over a month , i have a horribly slow sometimes disconnecting internet_connection .
M	i ' ve called customer_service three times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
M	i had to buy bt wifi access for 0 quid a day for the last 0 weeks , because they can ' t even tell me when the fix will be available !
M	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .
M	for what ??
M	how can a fix take a month ??
M	as soon as my contract_ends , i leave three to never come back and tell this to all my friends !
M	havent got anything , will be getting a refund asap
M	in the past i ' ve always gone with various manufacturers laptops but could never get one with the specs i want until i discovered pc_specialist .
M	i ordered a optimus 0 laptop with exactly the spec i wanted but none of the usual fluff ( i had my own copy of windows , security software and didn ' t want a dvd drive )
M	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
M	i ' ve been using the laptop for around 0 weeks now and have upgraded the ram and swapped one of the harddisks for an ssd ( pc_specialist maintain the warranty too with user installed upgrades ).
M	the laptop runs warm whilst gaming so a cooling pad is recommended .
M	overall a good experience and will_definately buy my my next laptop from pc_specialist .
M	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for a number of years now .
M	i have nothing but praise for the the quality of products and customer_service i have received each and every time i have ordered from them .
M	i have yet to find a supplement company that even comes close to the selection offered by supplementwarehouse . com .
M	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
M	further , i have the piece of mind that there will not be a lower_price , thanks to their price beating system .
M	i would recommend supplementwarehouse . com to any and everyone looking for high_quality products at the absolute best prices .
M	helt suveren service , og meget gode_priser !
M	kommunikasjonen underveis er_det heller ingenting Ã¥ si pÃ¥ .
M	svarer like godt pÃ¥ kveld og helg som midt pÃ¥ dagen .
M	en ekstra verbal rose til geir ove lilleng !
M	anbefaler koed til alle som trenger bmw - deler og ekstrautstyr til_en flott penge .
M	have bouhgt two times no .!
M	very fast delivery to norway !
M	will buy there more because it ' s so cheap !
M	easy to pay via_paypal .
M	no registration :)
M	i bought brakes and protective gear from merlin and they were cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	i ' ll be using them from now on .
M	i have been buying from supplement_warehouse for about 0 years now .
M	i have not found any other place that has such great prices or delivery .
M	it ' s also awesome that they have a lot of free or discounted offers when you go to check out !!
M	!
M	i can ' t get netflix where i live and it annoyed me that thousands of streamed movies and tv_shows were so close within my grasp but so far away .
M	strongvpn allows me to connect my computer to the us and get netflix !
M	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer_service is amazing .
M	i am talking to someone within 0 - 0 minutes on their website and i love that they will let me switch to other cities or even countries when i want to watch something else .
M	i have recommended strongvpn to a number of friends who have gotten the service and are also very impressed .
M	i can ' t recommend them enough !
M	i order a few cd ' s at the beginning of december as christmas_presents , they hadn ' t arrived after a couple of weeks so i emailed there customer support .
M	i heard_nothing back but a few_days_later i had my cd ' s on my doorstep with the word priority written all over them , make of that as you will .
M	don ' t think i would be using this site again even if they are a few pounds cheaper .
M	i have used this site a few_times and every time the order arrives quickly and with out fuss .
M	having had trouble ordering the same product with dell i gave uk digital_cameras a try .
M	they did not disappoint it arrived the next_day well_packed and i am very pleased with the service i have received , plus it was the very cheapest price on the net .
M	no_complaints here .
M	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .
M	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
M	everything went_smoothly and you have the option of choosing cash or argos_voucher with a higher value .
M	i ' d recommend them .
M	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
M	failed to turn_up before_christmas
M	highly_recommend - we ordered 0 00kg bags of dog_food and they arrived the next morning
M	my iphone works very fine , this service is very fast .
M	thank_you very much ...!
M	!
M	regards .
M	francisco quiÃ±ones .
M	my new blomberg oven was recently_purchased from and installed by buywise , it arrived with no issues on the agreed delivery date .
M	i am very pleased with it and with the service provided .
M	i was also impressed with the competitive_prices offered .
M	i have used supplementwarehouse . com multiple_times for my supplement_needs , and i ' ve never been disappointed .
M	fast price_matching , great freebies , and excellent shipping make this site a true winner for anyone_looking to pick_up supplements .
M	my only_suggestion would be to make the website a little more streamlined for product ordering ( the scrolling through supplements and multiple pages is a bit tedious , but it certainly isn ' t a deal_breaker ).
M	overall , this is my go - to site for purchasing supplements .
M	don ' t hesitate to use it !
M	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .
M	i ordered an item from amazon on saturday and chose the free super_saver delivery option . on sunday i got an_email_stating that the item had been dispatched to yodel for delivery and i should expect to receive my item on thursday .
M	having never_heard of yodel before i googled them and came_across this review site . after_reading the mostly one star reviews i got worried that i might never see my item .
M	monday came so i thought i would check the tracking_number . the parcel had moved about 000_miles but in the totally opposite direction from me , this concerned me a little .
M	tuesday_morning i checked the tracking_number to find the parcel was in my area and out for delivery . i thought , great . around 0 :_00pm knock at the door . it ' s here problem free .
M	this is my first experience of yodel and i have found them to be perfect in every way , even receiving my parcel two days earlier_than_expected . big_thumbs_up from me .
M	i have been using amazon for years . usually the cheapest on the net for most things , quick to dispatch and always keep you updated on your orders . the free delivery service is a big plus if you don ' t mind waiting a couple of days extra for your items .
M	always first_class service from my local dominos ( kilmarnock ). very easy to order either online or by phone . very quick delivery and always hot and delicious . i love the money off vouchers i get through the mail , makes the prices quite reasonable .
M	even_though this was a low value order it was still dispatched very quickly , was well_packed and free delivery . highly_recommended . a ++++++
M	i ordered some flavours for plain e_- liquid , which is hard to find at a reasonable_price with a trusted company .
M	liberty_flights had an array of flavours to choose from , at a surprisingly cheap price considering the quality .
M	topped off with a fast delivery , it ' s now my go - to website for e_- cigs .
M	highly_recommend this site !
M	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
M	the first " attempted delivery " according to yodels tracking was 0pm ?!?
M	the following_day .
M	this is stupid enough but it claims a card was left .
M	no card was left .
M	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
M	first lie from the driver .
M	yodel confirmed that the driver had not been in the area .
M	the next_day , i ring up express my displeasure .
M	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
M	no call .
M	second lie .
M	i call back to find out what is going on .
M	i am told , that they will message the driver , the parcel is on a van and i will have it before 0 : 00 that day .
M	third lie .
M	there was no attempted delivery that die .
M	day 0 - i ring up .
M	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm deadline ( for a secret santa ).
M	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
M	what do they not understand !.
M	a card was supposedly left - it wasn ' t .
M	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
M	yodel are a joke .
M	twice booked a hotel in oxford and got a booking reference e_- mailed .
M	twice , a few hours_later , the booking was cancelled by alpharooms .
M	no explanation .
M	you can ' t do business like this .
M	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
M	waited in all day .
M	then saw note .
M	they couldn ' t be bothered to call .
M	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
M	0000 numbers won ' t let you speak to a human .
M	had to call a collection number and tap in a false account number ( obviously not recognised ) so system would transfer me to a human .
M	couldn ' t deliver parcel that day .
M	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
M	i said front doorstep will be fine ( secluded house ) they said they couldn ' t do that .
M	i would have collectd in my town ( northampton ) but to save cash they are located in rushden so nowhere_near the main population of the county .
M	catherine very polite & helpful service will use again .
M	i have t - mobile connection ( sim ) and i have been a long time customer .
M	what i like about t - mobile connection ?
M	good connectivity and decent customer_service .
M	ordered colonial marines on the friday and received on the monday , which is day before_release_date .
M	extremely pleased at getting day before .
M	bought a graphics_card from them , about Â£_000 at the time .
M	had no issues with purchase and delivery and was pleased with the company at the time but when the card developed a fault after about a year ( 0 year_warranty ) so i had to post back , at my expense with no offer or refund there , and the replacement time was 0 weeks with zero word from them during .
M	i find zero communications really bad for such a long repair / replacement time .
M	when i phoned up 0 weeks in i was told a replacement was sent out same day so waited a week only to learn i was lied to .
M	disgusting for a company to lie to it ' s customers !
M	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
M	fair_enough , this sort of thing happens but i ' ve been told that i should expect it to be 00 days due to time of year .
M	not ' up to ' 00 days but the full 00 days .
M	i am so appalled about this companies after service i will not purchase from them again and i recommend the members in my gaming clan to do the same .
M	netflix is brilliant for me and perfect that you can restrict access for the kids .
M	i have always had brilliant service from netflix !
M	the very few_times i have contacted customer_service they have been on the ball .
M	tonight i spoke to a lady ( katya ) on the live_chat team and she was brilliant , extremely friendly and definitely made me feel a valued customer .
M	with 0000 ' s of hours of tv_shows and movies where else would you go for the low price .
M	keep doing an awesome job guys .
M	regards ,
M	a delighted customer :)
M	great site for flogging your bits and bobs , picked_up a great membership deal !
M	really enjoying how easy it is to sell things , great community .
M	this site was advertised on my facebook news feed so i clicked to view as me an the other half have recently developed a like for cooking " different " tastes in the kitchen .
M	i ordered wok the book to start with as , as far as i can tell this was a fairly new site .
M	it took 0 days for the book to arrive after_placing my order on a sunday at 00pm , i was very please with the fast service and will be placing future orders .
M	i have noticed that within a week of visiting the site the variety has almost doubled .
M	recommend to anyone whos go ( ing ) spicey in the kitchen !
M	:)
M	thanks again
M	other than what is stated in the title i think the site and company provides great marketing to it customers and gives them great deals on products needed for those who are trying to get into a better shape then they were .
M	over all great website and business .
M	very simple and easy process !
M	huge_selection of products and the prices are very competitive with the other supply stores .
M	the ordering_process is easy and quick .
M	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for a while now and will_continue to use them .
M	merlin had a great deal on .
M	they answered a question i had before i made the order and delivered quickly afterwards .
M	supplement_warehouse has great prices and a quality selection , they will match prices on anything and give you an extra discount .
M	fast_shipping i have no_complaints .
M	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
M	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
M	they were a beautiful bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
M	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
M	the service was great and professionally presented .
M	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
M	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
M	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our lives easier and the beautiful flowers helped make our family ' s day a little_bit brighter .
M	i book a hostel with them , went to the property , paid cash , and everything went well .
M	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
M	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
M	i contact their customer care to find out , and they totally ignored me .
M	they didn ' t even bother to reply my messages .
M	so did the hostel .
M	in the end i could only get my money back through my bank in a long and painful process , since hostelbookers failed to provide any of the documents the visa company requested :-(.
M	i never had a worse experience with a booking system !
M	previously bought_battlefield_0 limited_edition , just bought shogun 0 ... cheaper_than steam and instant service .. what more can you ask for ?
M	to be honest , i am very new to the supplement / workout arena .
M	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
M	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
M	i can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively .
M	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
M	who_knows , maybe in a couple weeks my view of this company might have changed for the worst , although i hope that is not the case .
M	however , in comparing different sites and different companies , i believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront , direct , and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making_sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it .
M	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
M	yet , what they claimed ( and was true ) was that the price that other_sites / companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping_costs was lower_than the $_00 shipping + price of the products on their site .
M	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
M	another thing that i really_enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
M	but the greatest thing was , if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping .
M	why not get all these free things when you have to pay the same amount for shipping anyways ?
M	anyways , i am happy with this company and i hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that i can continue to purchase from this company in the future .
M	superb !
M	cheapest by_far of any retailers .
M	happy for us to return item if not satisfied .
M	receieved within two days of order .
M	fantastic overall exeprience of using this company and would definitely_recommend .
M	good customer_service .
M	fast delivery
M	i was so impressed , i knew there would be extra shipping as i was in the channel_islands but as it turned_out the vat refund was more_than the shipping cost so i woke_up to find a refund in my paypal account already !
M	excellent communication from the store , would recommend to anybody !
M	i was acturely put off after_reading the bad review on this page but i decided no i will go for it .
M	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
M	have allready recommendid to all my mates and will definetly use again many many_thanks .
M	i ' ve bought a few items from bureau direct and had great service on every occasion .
M	they stock some really nice & unique products and they remain as one of my favourite online stationary suppliers .
M	just received the charles eames style rar rocking chair for kids .... the chair looks brilliant and the finish is outstanding .
M	what a great welcome present for the arrival of my niece .
M	as you can see from the picture my cat has taken ownership of the chair and i might have to get a second one !
M	we also bought a charles eames hang it all a few_months_ago ...
M	quality and customer_service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
M	:)
M	bought some nike roshe sneaker boots .
M	0 star service !
M	turned_up a day before the expected delivery date .
M	will use again !
M	took months to get a reply back after having a pair of gazelle og trainers fail after 0 hours of use .
M	support_team where unhelpful and not interested in listening to the problems i encountered .
M	i won ' t buy anything adidas again after this , they don ' t seem to be bothered about losing long_term loyal_customers !
M	customer_service is non - existent !
M	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
M	going to contact trading_standards and see what can be done about it .
M	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd sports .
M	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!

M	good company .
M	if you have not heard of the steam sale get on it !
M	( only runs for two_weeks a few_times each year ) last time i got twelve games for around twenty pounds .
M	some of those were recently released games as well .
M	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
M	so my stuff can go missing in the post again huh_?
M	to cut as long_story short i bought a steelseries keyboard that had faulty keys , they offered to send some new ones in the post that never turned_up !
M	after writing a few more angry messages and promising to never use / buy steelseries again they sent me a better keyboard than the model i had .
M	this was more_than a fair compensation !
M	can ' t complain !
M	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !
M	won ' t use again !
M	very good service !
M	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer_service team !
M	i love the prices and the freebies that go with the order !
M	will buy from again !
M	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
M	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
M	love yesstyle !
M	i always order from them !!
M	!
M	this site has the lowest_prices of any other site i ' ve came_across .
M	although the shipping can be expensive it usually still comes out cheaper_than most competitors .
M	i ' ve never had a problem with supplementwarehouse , it is always the first place i look for supplements and usually the only one .
M	first_port of call when i order new gear they stock the best dj equipment and the prices are very competitive !
M	great service and speedy_delivery would definitely_recommend to anyone_looking to get new kit
M	i wanted to take my girlfriend on a trip for christmas and expedia had all the options that i wanted to check out , gave fairly straight_forward options for changing my search parameters and the flight & hotel option was exactly_what i needed .
M	changing flight times , airports and booking the hotel , checking suites , different costs etc was extremely easy and to be perfectly honest expedia made me feel_confident about what i was purchasing .
M	on top of this i had some credit_card issues and the call_centre was extremely_helpful .
M	i placed an order and was told it would take 00days to be delivered .
M	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
M	the women i spoke to ' cat woman chloe ' was as unprofessional as her name .
M	she basically argued with me that it is not late at all because it has arrived at customs in my country which is what the delivery day estimation is about .
M	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don ' t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
M	i assume happy people on this site are from america because uk orders .... pointless .
M	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no complications or delay .
M	after a few_years of getting my protein from this company i was very happy until i had a missing product .
M	i had an attachment to my order saying it would be shipped when in stock .
M	after a while i tried to contact the company to see when my product would come .
M	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
M	thankfully it wasn ' t of high value but i will be sure to no_longer use this company encase something else is not in stock as you seem to get charged for the items but never receive them .
M	shocking .
M	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
M	y does it take a review like this to get a response from the company ?
M	get in contact is all they have done also as they informed me they were resolving the issue by sending me my products , however after waiting 0 weeks for an order which should as informed by them take no_longer_than 0 - 0 days i realise it was a lie to shut me up .
M	i have again contacted them but as usual there is no response !
M	!
M	the site was great and the process was easy from start to finish .
M	follow this up with quick delivery and an ecxellent case - i really can ' t fault my experience .
M	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is ........ but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
M	been using them for 0 years now , and never had a problem !
M	really love being_able to collect , and use the seeds year after year without the phenotype lottery of using f0 seeds .
M	this company has many hard to find transistors , ic , and valves for your audio needs .
M	service was so good iv place 0 orders in the last 0 weeks , and they saved me weeks of tracking down vintage parts .
M	very helpful staff , could not recommend them any more highly
M	ordered a epiphone the dot eb ch as a gift for a friends birthday , dissipate being in germany the price was the lowest i could find even with paypal exchange_rate !
M	only got here in 0 days , and was extremely well_packaged .
M	i plan to use them again , and would recommend to a friend !
M	have used musikding 0 times now , and each order has got from germany to england in under a week , well_packed and with email_updates !
M	they also have some hard to find value capacitors .
M	would certainly recommend !
M	ordered a box of jars that were very competitively prices , received them on - time and well_packed .
M	will_definitely_recommend and use again !
M	i use rapid at_least once a month and have yet to have a problem with any aspect of their service .
M	postage is fast and free ( on orders over Â£_00 ), and very well_packed !
M	ebay is a wonderful website that i use every day , thinks to the site i have been able to start my own business with very few overheads , and find their pricing very reasonable as a seller .
M	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
M	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page ........ in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
M	switch over to tesco for my weekly_shop a couple of months back , and have not had a single problem with delivery , alternatives or damaged goods .
M	the drivers have always been really helpful , even helping to carry the good up to my third floor flat .
M	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest .... but perhaps they are included features i ' m just missing how to use ?
M	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
M	would be happy to used them again as the competitive_prices out weigh deliver times !
M	iv used amazon lost over the last couple of year from physical goods to downloadable content and have yet to be let_down in any way .
M	prices are competitive , delivers are secure and refillable and customer_service were helpful and informed !
M	also like thire free application for kindleoooks making the reader free across all the main platforms !
M	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
M	each time no hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
M	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
M	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
M	i have used mazuma a long time and will do for a long time to come ... excellent
M	the prices are a little high , but considering there is major under - provision of japanese food products in supermarkets in the uk , it ' s not a big deal .
M	the delivery was fast , the items good quality , and website / transaction smooth and simple !
M	will be ordering again .
M	why not to buy from cpw
M	i am interested in learning more about the 00 days refund / return_policy with cpw and what the implications are of a forced repair service .
M	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
M	as far as i know the supply of goods_act ensures a manufacturer ' s warranty and the sales of goods_act gives use time to accept goods of satisfactory quality .
M	when purchasing a brand_new phone , things such as durability cannot possibly be tested and if a touch screen becomes unresponsive in under 0 months of initial purchase it is up to cpw to prove it was not faulty from point of sale .
M	does any act or law give cpw the legal right to change what i thought was six_years ( reasonable time ) to 00 days ?
M	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
M	do cpw have the right to unbox , activate and flick through menus ( demonstration ) at point of purchase with no consent from buyer ( may want to leave it boxed )?
M	situation is being sold a phone in just over four_months_ago that did have a laggy screen but not wanting to be a " naggy " customer - put up with it and eventually saw the screen deteriorate over time and become unresponsive .
M	when going to the store i was told i have to accept a loan phone ( shared by most of uk ) which was not even a smart device ( no email / apps ) - both unhygienic and inconvenient for me .
M	this was insisted upon but i refused .
M	i expected to be offered a replacement instead but this did not happen .
M	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
M	when calling complaints , the advisor i spoke to told me he was the head trainer for consumer_law in the department .
M	he spent 00_mins telling_me how he could offer refund / replacement if he wanted but did not want to .
M	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
M	advised i have no legal right to " not accept " or " reject " the goods based on the fault as the warranty superseded my statuary rights .
M	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
M	quite a horrible experience but now waiting to hear back from them .
M	if you have struggled to get a replacement / refund in the first six_months of purchase , it would be interesting to know how cpw dealt_with the fault .
M	it seems like cpw profit from insisting on using manufacturer warranties as_opposed to using the contract entered ( soga ) then forcing customers into repairs , not having to replace or refund the item or even offering it as an option past the first 00 days .
M	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
M	bought a hsf a short while back and cant_complain_about the service and goods .
M	picked it up off their d0t which offered it at a better price than its competitors .
M	it arrived quickly and the site is simple to nagivate along with a great community .
M	cant_fault them and would highly_recommend .
M	really good service , was quick and easy to use , saved me Â£_00 as got quoted Â£_00 before hand but so relieved i had found this site as it was such a simple process
M	i would love to recommend simplygames as their prices are extremely good and they appear to run a very tight ship but this simply isn ' t the case .
M	after receiving my product code to be activated on origin i was surprised to find it didn ' t work , so i thought i ' d just send them an_email asking if they could maybe sort this out for me .
M	that was over a week_ago , they haven ' t got back to me , what they did email to me however was this chance to submit a review about them .
M	so yeah , thanks for stealing my Â£_00 simplygames .
M	always been used to using steam , but now i think i ' ll go to cjs_cd_keys first before i go anywhere_else .
M	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i ' m really happy with my purchase .
M	once you ' re verified and get used to the purchasing system which is not complicated by any means , you ' re all set to go .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	thanks cjs !
M	:)
M	everything you ' d expect and more .
M	i ordered the television on boxing_day , and had no less_than 0 phone_calls between then and delivery ( on the 00th_december ) to confirm the order and delivery timeframe .
M	the product arrived as advised .
M	it was a great deal and i am thoroughly pleased with both it and the service received .
M	would definitely buy more from their site .
M	great product selection , sales people are very knowledgeable and always willing to help .
M	i shop in the store and online and have had nothing but positive_experiences .
M	would highly_recommend them to anyone - best cycling / triathlon store in the uk
M	very good product , with very fast delivery .
M	one of the best companies i ' ve bought tech from , wouldn ' t buy from any other else .
M	they have some of the best customer_service i ' ve ever used , and they ' re very quick at replying .
M	can ' t rate them highly_enough .
M	lily dressed in her " where ' s wenda " outfit made us all giggle and she wants to wear it all the time now .
M	may have a professional comedian in training .
M	the quality was reasonable and delivery arrived the next_day after ordering .
M	highly_recommended .
M	based on a single order this site is excellent , good price and timely delivery especially given i ordered on a weekend nothing but good stuff to say .
M	i received an e_- mail about a monitor that had gone on offer and when i had a look it was too good to pass up and if i ordered that same day , there was the option of free , next - day delivery
M	i would fully recommend signing_up for the promotional emails at the very least as there are some very good offers being sent out
M	placed an order friday_morning , by friday_afternoon i got a message_saying that my order had been processed and was being dispatched .
M	arrived on monday .
M	by purchasing from this site , i have found a better and easier way to purchase video_game codes .
M	its great !
M	just a few_clicks of a buttons and bam , i ' ve got the code .
M	no hassle , just plain quick deliverly .
M	great deal , quick delivery .
M	definitely_recommend .
M	they ' re really helpful and they even phoned me up to help me pick the parts that i needed .
M	they gave me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any_questions that i had .
M	i ' ve just started using aria but i will be sticking around !
M	00 / 00
M	will certainly be making use of cjs_cd_keys again , it ' s a piece of cake to order and get your key and the prices are a bargain ...
M	by_far the cheapest quality supplements i ' ve find anywhere !
M	i would definitely refer a friend !
M	i love love supplement_warehouse and get all my supplements from them
M	ordered my playstation 0 a few week before official launch in uk , got mine on the release day and didn ' t have to wait a month to get one , had no issues with contacting them when i needed help , they always contacted me and got to the point , no excuses that were given to me , they just replied very fast and was very happy with my order !
M	!
M	thank_you simply_games !!!
M	epic company
M	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home cinema kit Â£_000 . 00 .
M	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
M	get an_email late last_night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over Â£_000 .
M	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
M	i could have got it from another supplier for Â£_00 more .
M	i ordered a product on december 00th .
M	after not receiving it by early january , i contacted the company via e_- mail and they replied_saying it would be despatched that week .
M	the following week , the order ' s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
M	i e_- mailed again to find out what was going on and had no reply .
M	i e_- mailed once more and , again , had no reply .
M	luckily i had paid via_paypal so was able to open a dispute with them .
M	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn ' t argue against the dispute i had raised .
M	however , there wasn ' t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
M	i wish i had checked out sites like this before i ' d made an order .
M	looking at the recent reviews , i wouldn ' t have gone anywhere_near them if i ' d known beforehand .
M	don ' t waste your time .
M	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .
M	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .
M	the delivery was excellent and quick .
M	overall a very good experience .
M	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
M	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
M	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
M	after looking for an official_iphone_unlock company i have found them an i will be doing more unlocking with u guys very soon thanx
M	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
M	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
M	i will_definitely use again !
M	it ' s hard to trust a cd_key website , but when i decided to order after seeing so much positive_feedback about this site , i thought i ' d try it , purchased 00 months xbox_live gold for Â£_00 ( bargain ), ordered through paypal , within a minute i received email with the cd_key which shows on the back of a card like you would get from retail .
M	i simply redeemed the codes and right away , it worked .
M	legit website , superb prices , awesome job !
M	after going down to my local dreams store i had no_idea what i wanted after half an_hour i had purchased 0 beds and one tempa mattress .
M	i opted to have the beds installed as they have the storage underneath and i never wanted all the hassle getting it right .
M	come the morning of delivery had a call to say the guys would arrive at half 0 and they was here on the dot .
M	dave and seb was the installers and i could not fault them at all very polite and professional and cleared up all the mess they made unlike some company ' s .
M	overall very satisfied !
M	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
M	fast and reliable company , good quality cables and great value
M	hey there !
M	i highly_recommend you to do not worry to deliver your iphone blindly to official_iphone_unlock ....
M	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
M	one was swtor , the other bf0 .
M	both deliveries were quick , cheap prices , and no hassle .
M	will be buying all my cdkeys from here
M	i ' ve never found any other hostel booking website to be as efficient , cheap and easy to use as hostelbookers .
M	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
M	excellent selection .
M	reasonable prices .
M	and cracking customer_service when required .
M	definitely buying here again .
M	i am not sure how i came_across this website , maybe a google_search and i found the amazing , money saving deals .
M	the main and most_important thing on their website is the competition pricing .
M	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn ' t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
M	great website and company , will recommend to friends and family , and use the service again !
M	usually deliveries thats say they are next_day to northern_ireland from england are not , this was , i was quite happy .
M	product arrived in perfect_condition and i got a very polite email which i will quote , " thank_you for your business and of course if i can help further , please don ' t hesitate to get in touch .
M	kind_regards .." so you can see why i gave this 0_stars
M	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
M	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
M	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
M	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
M	couldn ' t find a better price online .
M	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
M	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
M	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
M	easy to use website , fast and secure .
M	collection is easy to organize
M	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
M	not parcel0go ' s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
M	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
M	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
M	trustpilot is a flawed system .
M	you can overide the authorisation code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
M	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .
M	i cannot understand_why companies are paying good money for such a system .
M	i bet after a few seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
M	only if it is in the interest of trustpilot .
M	i ordered my canvas from hellocanvas , it came two days after it was shipped , and it is top quality !
M	add that to the fact it worked out at Â£_00 - Â£_00 cheaper_than i could get anywhere in shrewsbury .
M	will_definitely be going back to this group as i redecorate my flat !
M	definitely support these_guys , they ' re a great bunch and always very helpful .
M	ordered shower doors .
M	arrived within a couple of days and very well_packaged .
M	very grateful .
M	will_definitely_recommend !
M	this company is so cheap and them delivers of the keys is so fast .. i am so happy with the servies of this company ... " like "
M	very smooth pleasant_transaction
M	00 days to deliver 0 product due to a " new system "?
M	jokers !
M	no wonder mp are getting a bad rep
M	had a great weekend cheers_guys
M	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
M	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
M	his products are excellent and the quality is perfect .
M	services also very friendly .
M	wanna save a hella good amount of money use this website bra .
M	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
M	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
M	the perfect website for anyone who_likes to have a bet .
M	odds from a wide_range of bookies and best prices are clearly highlighted .
M	also really useful for checking things like historical price changes and statistics for the prices of different bookmakers .
M	i mainly bet on football and horse racing and just about every market i need is on there .
M	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !
M	never rated a company before on the web .
M	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
M	only_downside no instructions for the drum stool and hi hat stand was packed in brown paper and not boxed .
M	got my 0 pair free_trial which took no time to come , was happy with 0 of them so ordered them .
M	easy online form and as soon as i had my prescription they took no time to send them out .
M	very happy with the service .
M	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .
M	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
M	i stumbled_across elitekeys the website looks professional and not all buy gold buy gold cheap price ect like the other_sites i was looking for game keys from , i came to here also and read the reviews before purchasing and everything seemed legit .
M	i ordered my copies of the game and after 00_minutes i got an_email with attached photo ' s of my game codes which is a more satisfactory idea as you know they are more then likely to be legit and someone hasn ' t just copied the code into an_email and maybe got to code wrong .
M	personally i will be ordering from this website again it is a good reliable source to buy from professionally set and hassle_free .
M	plus from what i see delivery time is quicker_than the estimate of 00_mins - 0 hours , thats always a bonus !
M	!
M	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .
M	i ' m dealing_with human beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
M	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .
M	easy to contact , fast and reliable
M	better_than ebay
M	easy to contact , great products , friendly staff
M	i would recommend this to all my friends , easy , reliable and easy to contact .
M	great wesite
M	barry ' s an excellent employee who provides his service thoroughly and seems to be the type to go out of his way for a client , that ' s the type of attitude needed to make organizations work .
M	thank_you world bound
M	needed some bankruptcy advice after my debt management plan failed and found them to be very helpful and sorted my bankruptcy application out for me
M	very easy to use - genuinely the cheapest we found .
M	their customer_service through the online " chat " function was excellent and ensured we got just what we needed .
M	very trustworthy and will_definitely use again .
M	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
M	one simple phone call was all it took .
M	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .
M	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
M	the day of the fitting came .
M	i received a call from the fitter promptly at 0 . 00am who said he would be there at 00am and at exactly 00 . 00am he turned_up .
M	the fitting was done quickly and efficiently , he even took away my old tyres !
M	" all included in the service ," he said .
M	he then asked for my signature , showed me how to tighten my bolts properly and was on his way .
M	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick fit .
M	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
M	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can ' t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
M	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
M	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
M	other than that delivery time was great and i ' m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
M	i have used quite a few cd_key websites and without a shadow of a doubt simplycdkeys is the best out there by_far !
M	my pre_- order was delivered the day before_release so that i could preload the game which is perfect for my under par internet_connection .
M	other orders i have placed also arrived around 0 minutes after making payment at the checkout .
M	if you have any sense at all then you will shop with simplycdkeys and never buy your games from anywhere_else again .
M	do not use this website .
M	they have taken a lot of peoples money and do not send you any keys .
M	they never reply to any support chat or support emails .
M	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
M	stay_away !!!!!!!!!!
M	!
M	i was very surprised at how fast and simple ordering from go0arena was .
M	the delivery was so fast .
M	i received the cd_key within 0 minutes of placing my order !
M	always a good price and rapid delivery service .
M	great selection of gear and at a good price , annoyingly i ' ve experienced issues when trying ( and paying ) for next_day service , they havent sent the goods out and havent let me know why until i have hassled them .
M	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
M	fantastic service , they really know their stuff helped_me get the right replacement parts for my v0 vantage at a reasonable_price .
M	would definitely use them again .

M	i recently_purchased the simcity 0000 serial_number online .
M	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
M	my friend_recommended cjs to me via a link on facebook .
M	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
M	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game ...
M	happy days !
M	:)
M	i would recommend cjs to any gamer that does not want to pay full price for a game !
M	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !
M	we chose nortlander in the first place out of all of the other travel companies because of how cheap the package was .
M	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn ' t do for us i . e .
M	they didn ' t bitch about the other_companies and just gave us the best deal they could .
M	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
M	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
M	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign_up numbers , they allowed us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
M	during the trip , all of the reps were well liked by everyone .
M	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
M	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
M	overall , from my own experience and from speaking to anyone on the trip , nortlander helped make this the best trip to date for dcu snowsports .
M	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
M	have been advised it would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 between_0am - 0pm .
M	hopefully this will happen and i will have a happy birthday girl on saturday : )
M	thanks again rowan .. excellent service
M	having moved over to shopto after game ' s demise i ' ve been impressed , the prices have been the cheapest and the service is excellent
M	ordered 0no .
M	0 phase mcb ' s from the website , received the confirmation_email and the money left my account all Â£_000 of it .
M	i went to the website to chase up the order and find out that they have ceased trading .
M	thanks for ripping me off !!!!
M	!
M	my delivery came as expected in a special insulated box with ice packs .
M	we ' ve only had two of the steaks so far but i ' m very impressed with the quality , we ' ll be ordering meat again from westin_gourmet .
M	highly_recommend
M	my order came quickly and i am very pleased with my watch , the glow from it at night is the deciding_factor that made my mind up to buy it and it doesn ' t dissapoint .
M	highly_recommend the company and it ' s watches
M	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn ' t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn ' t .
M	the worst thing about them was the endless calls from 0 trying to sell me another phone or contract , they would go through periods of ringing me four times a day for a week until i answered it !!
M	!
M	even when i answered it and said i don ' t want another phone they would carry on saying i could give it to a family_member or friend .... why the hell would i want to pay for someone_elses phone !
M	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one .... rediculous .
M	i ' ve used mazuma countless_times and the service is always faultless and fast .
M	this is the fastest , most accurate and most useful search_engine out there .
M	don ' t bother with others , you ' re just wasting time .
M	never had any_problems with amazon .
M	items arrive on time 00 . 0 % of the time , the one time i did have to return an item ( which wasn ' t to do with amazon ) i simply e_- mailed them and they sent me the paperwork necessary to send it back and i got a full_refund .
M	amazon is the first_port of call whenever i need ... well , anything .
M	as it was my first order , they informed me that my item was going to be delivered to my billing_address rather then my shipping address .
M	i explained that i was a student and would like it to be shipped here ( shipping address ) and david wood contacted me personally and simply asked me to email from my university email and he would make_sure it was sent here .
M	very helpful .
M	this is all i can rate the company on as i haven ' t received the order yet but very good customer_service .
M	i would definitely_recommend and reuse dolphinmusic .
M	the album looks fantastic , it looks and feels similar to the price , quality paper .
M	in all a very good product worth the money
M	great value product delivered next_day delivery which was a lovely suprise .
M	exactly as_described and works_brilliantly .
M	very good company !
M	!
M	been using as for 0 years now wouldnt go anywhere_else and i dont have to check prices elsewhere as their price_match guarantees me the cheapest price and fast free delivery .
M	from my initial contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel_mednick ' s delivery and approach has been friendly , committed and diligent .
M	early on in the process daniel was very understanding and we discussed in depth budget , location and duration .
M	soon after , daniel matched me to a perfect and ideal holiday , he looked after me with great care and offered plenty of guidance on how i could save money .
M	we opted for the ncl epic cruise with two_nights at the 0 **** new hotel of marselle prior to cruising .
M	alas , i was very cheeky and took away all his details and found the deal for myself , but daniel come back again and not only beat my quote but still worked out an excellent deal which also included extras .
M	this to me really showed he was looking after the customer .
M	daniel ' s advice continued throughout with tips and recommendations , which i found very practicable , encouraging and ultimately very beneficial .
M	i have really_appreciated daniel and away0 ' s support ; the outcome of which is that we have now booked a great holiday , at a superb rate which we are very excited about !
M	thanks daniel , next year i am booking my honeymoon ....
M	i know who to call .
M	i left a 0 star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that ' s what i can call it ) with them .
M	it was taken down within hours by the company for no proof of purchase .
M	i have noticed that there are now several reviews that have been taken down for the same reason , funnily_enough , none of the fake 0 star reviews have been taken down .
M	i replied to you the next_day with a pdf of my order confirmation and a week and a bit later my review is still not live and i have heard_nothing from you .
M	i have also contacted your support email address about a rather concerning matter regarding fake_reviews being added to your site for this company because nigel_o ' hara were running competitions on their facebook_page whereby the only way to enter was to leave a positive review on your site .
M	i am not sure this practise is even legal !?
M	but once again , i have heard_nothing from you .
M	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
M	very disappointed in the customer_service i have received from yourselves !
M	i ordered a watch for my wife ' s birthday .
M	it stated on their website , delivery within 0 - 0 days which wasn ' t a problem .
M	however , i didn ' t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
M	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
M	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
M	that happened for just over two and a half months !!
M	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
M	i asked what was causing the delay and they told me that they couldn ' t tell me , i then asked if they had been in contact with the supplier and the gentleman ' s response was " no , we don ' t normally do that with slight delays ".
M	so not only had they given me the same copy and paste response each week , they hadn ' t even chased the item with the supplier and had the audacity to say that a month and a half was a slight_delay .
M	they offered me , actually , no they didn ' t ... i asked for a small discount as a way of an_apology and they asked me if i wanted to change my order to another item .
M	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer_service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
M	low and behold , they didn ' t have this one in stock either , i waited a couple of weeks and had no contact from nigel_o ' hara , not even an_email to let me know they had placed a new order for me .
M	by this point , i had had enough and cancelled my order .
M	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
M	how can a company take orders for an item they evidentially don ' t have and obviously have no way of obtaining .
M	even as i write this now , they are still taking orders on the watch and it ' s still out of stock !
M	how many other people must be going through the same_thing as me ?
M	so to round off , this is the worse shopping_experience i have ever had !
M	i can ' t express how bad the customer_service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
M	i asked them several_times if they didn ' t think they were going to get the item in stock to let me know so i could cancel the order and order elsewhere , but each week they promised me it would be with me the following week .
M	a terrible terrible company and i would stay as far away from them as possible !
M	just to add , it ' s been 0 weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after contacting them .
M	got a the muscle warfare stack and some other itwms for almost half of what other_sites were selling for .
M	oh and free supps !!!!
M	!
M	ordered the wrong_size but shoetique manage to switch size for a day with good service .
M	will order more in future
M	i ordered a lens and lens filter from pixmania . ie and received them both in very good packaging 0 days_later even_though they had come all the way from belgium to ireland .
M	couldn ' t be any happier with the speed , efficiency & professionalism of delivery !
M	placing my order was very simple & straight_forward .
M	payment was just as easy and it ' s an added_bonus that i could pay with paypal unlike amazon .
M	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could find so overall i couldn ' t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
M	i will_definitely be using pixmania again !
M	couldn ' t fault the company at all .
M	simple as that .
M	third time i have used mazuma and again it was great all_round .
M	very good pricing .
M	gave me an additional discount for a bulk buy
M	even_tho their prices and the cheapest on the net .
M	quick delivery to southern ireland which is hard to come by .
M	have bought from them before and will buy again .
M	as above , my item came from germany by ups .
M	arrived on time , job_done , great price - highly_recommended .
M	bought tickets , was contacted and confirmed via_email .
M	received ticket within plenty of time of show .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	kyle maguire
M	i found many cheap codes for all the games i like , i would recommend for anyone using digital downloads and the rate of delivery was super_fast i also found the site rather easy to navigate .
M	when i was first recommended cjs_cd_keys by a colleague , i was highly suspicious of the site being a possible scam .
M	fortunately after_reading quite a lot of reviews on trustpilot , i decided to take the plunge and purchased a bf0_premium cd_key .
M	their autokey distribution system is very easy to use once your purchase has been paid for .
M	the key i was sent activated straight_away on origin and i was getting stuck into to the cq expansion within minutes and enjoying every second of it !
M	real happy with my purchase !
M	would not hesitate to buy from again !
M	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived_promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo ' s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
M	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware update for the apn i ordered .
M	their support was very professional and were more then willing to help .
M	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted out so i didnt require an rma .
M	so it was a bit of a false alarm .
M	when these_guys say ' next_day ' delivery - they arent kidding !
M	!
M	i opted for the cheaper rm 0st_class delivery option ( 0 - 0days ) but i recieved an_email later in the day telling_me my order had been dispatched and would arrive the very next_day .
M	this is my first experience with quietpc and it has a been a very satisfactory one based on their delivery speed and the condition my order arrived in .
M	i will_definitely do more business with them in the future !
M	!
M	excellent prices , and super_fast service .
M	i will always recommend igful to my friends .
M	bravo !!!!
M	!
M	support , support
M	excellent company fast cheap delivery and when i needed to return an item this was dealt_with very efficiently .
M	would definitely use vie company again .
M	always save atleast 00 bucks by using their price_matching feature .
M	ordered a sony_ericsson xperia arc s last monday , delivered on tuesday 00am , brilliant phone , good service , im happy
M	must_say the customer_service i received was second to none ... love my new product and now will only use muscle force supplements each and every month .
M	just purchased chocolate optimum nutrition 000_% gold standard whey 00lb bag that will do my protein needs for a month :)
M	if your looking for protein my protein is the place to come .
M	you will get a top quality product with exceptional customer_service and most_importantly at a great price !!
M	def will be using my protein for my next order !
M	!
M	great products at great prices with super_quick delivery .
M	can ' t get better_than that !!
M	one happy customer .
M	my honest view about powerbeck is they are amazing !
M	they have great deals , the customer_service i receive everytime is second to none .
M	i love the whey_protein chocolate powder just goes down so nice everytime and also i have seen very good gains from it .
M	don ' t get me wrong i do train very hard and also eat good balanced meals !
M	!
M	use powerbeck they won ' t let you down !
M	!
M	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don ' t think they got the email "
M	when the order was eventually dispatched it was incomplete , no one informed me that i would not receive two items .
M	shoddy website , shoddy service , i will never use them again .
M	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
M	i posted my phone at 0pm and received an_email from mazuma at 00 :_00am the next_day saying payment would be made shortly ...
M	i had my money by 00pm , less_than 00_hours from time of postage !
M	brilliant !
M	ordered my item on the thursday before 0pm and it arrived on the friday , excellent speedy_delivery cant_complain_about that .
M	well informed_throughout the buying and delivery process with emails telling you exactly_what ' s happening and where your product is .
M	top quality service will not hesitate to buy from here again in the very near_future , thank_you guitarguitar
M	thy are just a fraud company .
M	be - careful .
M	don ' t trust them .
M	they will take your money and will not answer you .
M	fantastic experience with funktion .
M	we weren ' t sure what to do for my friends stag_do but the funktion team had loads of ideas and contacts for us to use .
M	jay gave us a great quote and fantastic service .
M	nothing was to much_trouble .
M	will use again for future events .
M	good prices and good products , there was a problem with dhl mixing up the order but sima took care of it and sent me the correct blades in 00hrs .
M	ordered a tv online , they rang up shortly and said very sorry but its out of stock , but would we like the next model up for a huge discount .
M	obviously we snapped up the deal .
M	it arrived within a few_days and we ' re loving the new tv .
M	guy called anwar at rgb deserves special credit .
M	nice bloke , very helpful and polite .
M	many_thanks .
M	having heard many bad_reviews on various sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn ' t want to do that .
M	i decided to give mazuma a chance .
M	i was quoted from the website Â£_00 .
M	i posted my phones off .
M	a day later i had an_email_saying the phones had been recevied and a cheque posted out .
M	the very next_day a cheque for Â£_00 arrives through the door .
M	i was absolutely amazed .
M	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
M	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
M	thanks mazuma
M	maravilha !
M	!
M	em menos de 00 horas estava com o telefone desbloqueado sem ter que instalar porra nenhuma !
M	grana bem gasta !
M	i ' m booking my ferries with aferry on a regular base .
M	they ' re easy to use and give me the option to compare prices before booking .
M	will use them again and again and again .
M	a +
M	da ich beruflich hÃ¤ufiger auf die fÃ¤hre von und nach england angewiesen bin und mir die Ã¶konomischste verbindung wichtig ist , habe_ich im vergangenen jahr viel zeit damit verbracht den besten anbieter zu finden - bis ich auf aferry gestoÃen bin und mein suchen endlich ein ende hatte .
M	seither buche ich nur noch mit ihnen .
M	warum ?
M	die buchung geht schnell , das system ist einfach zu durchschauen und bietet mir stets die gÃ¼nstigste verbindung an .
M	auch abÃ¤nderungen kÃ¶nnen leicht vorgenommen werden .
M	daher : fÃ¼nft sterne und ein gerne widerkehrender kunde .
M	great prices , genuine products , super - fast delivery ( uk -> greece ), discount coupons shipped along my purchase , highly_recommended .
M	the level of customer_service received from first point of contact all the way through to receipt , replacement and currently sorting_out technical_issues has been first rate with everyone i have dealt_with .
M	very happy to recommend hifi gear to anyone who will listen !
M	very easy to use and highly reliable website .
M	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
M	they issued me a refund a week_later with a cheque that took another week to clear and to make it up they said we will offer you free postage when you order again !
M	i ordered another watch , it was small in size ; obviously links were missing - they did not charge me for postage initially , but when returned for refund , they charged me for postage !
M	un fair , miss - informed and above all xxx !
M	you cannot charge for something when you have agreed initially that its for free !
M	they said they will send a cheque to make up for the postage cost - its been months now and i don ' t think i should expect anything !
M	the website has anything / everything you could ever want and need while providing great prices and fantastic shipping .
M	all of my orders i recieved in a few_days at most .
M	also all thefantastic freebies that im able to try before i buy helps me pick products i like .
M	a good network but very slow to connect when you lose and gain signal , also very expensive when you go abroad and make calls and use internet ( more_than any network i have been with before ).
M	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove off !
M	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible ... so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave me a full_refund .
M	so a few_months later ( last_week ) i decided to give them another try , the delivery came yesterday and once again 0 items were severely damaged , including cracked eggs and squashed pastries .
M	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
M	so i rang customer_service , the man was very helpful , and refunded me half my shop .
M	this shouldn ' t be happening , regardless of the refunds given , they are ruining their brilliant reputation they have instore .
M	i normally cannot_afford to shop here and usually shop at asda or sburys , but i like to try waitrose food now and again so i ' m willing to spend the money .
M	each of the times i have changed to ordering from waitrose , it ' s been a dreadful experience .
M	so stay clear , the previous reviews don ' t lie as well .
M	nice selection of latest clothes , good delivery time , and also they have a decent sale on almost constantly .
M	best online shop for contemperary clothing .
M	ordered a dozen_times and never any_problems .
M	ordered a few fragrances from this comany , and the prices are best you are going to find in the uk .
M	shipping takes around 0 - 0 days , but is free so i guess it isn ' t that bad !
M	packaging is also top_notch ..
M	great service , great prices , would highly_recommend !
M	i don ' t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
M	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
M	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
M	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .
M	i can ' t recommend highly_enough .
M	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
M	then phoned the pizza shop direct they said they had no record despite a confirmation e_- mail .
M	i would suggest that you try deliverance . co . uk much more reliable .
M	great weekend handled well by chillisauce , didn ' t have any worries ... and the hotel was much too fancy for a bunch of hairy ars * d men on a stag_do !
M	total scam !!!
M	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
M	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
M	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
M	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	!
M	... this be a great website !
M	love the layout , searching for products is easy and love the support they give .
M	even on the rare_occasion where we ' ve had to chase something up or we ' ve had a problem with an item they ' ve been quick to rectify and offer a fast and friendly service .
M	i have used thedrinkshop . com for quite a few_years and not only have i found their large_selection of alcohol at competitive_pricing , but their service delivery is top_notch too !
M	with fast dispatch in quality packaging , i really can ' t fault them .
M	the best dedicated online games shop on the web - great games , great prices , speedy dispatch , texts / emails / picture updates to let me know that my order has been processed , packed & sent .
M	if you want pre_- ordered games to arrive on time or even ahead of schedule then shopto is the place to go !
M	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought id take a gamble .
M	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
M	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
M	literally about 00_hours it took .
M	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums 00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
M	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !
M	!
M	we have ordered from printer land on a number of occasions and have always received truly excellent service from start to finish .
M	i cannot rate them highly_enough .
M	their advice on products is accurate and fair , and the efficiency of the ordering_process could not be better !
M	i can definatly recommend this site to anyone_looking to cash in on an old laptop .
M	i came accross many sites and this one offered me the best price , i was a little_wary at first but there was no need .
M	i got an_email_saying my laptop had been recieved the following_day after posting and a quote a few_days_later .
M	my quote after inspection was Â£_00 lower_than my orignal but for a valid reason and the price was still more_than i expected .
M	after accepting the re - vised quote i had the money in my payal account in no time !
M	:)
M	i took out a phone contract via carphone_warehouse , when i received the phone i was told i could cancel the phone insurance , which i did .
M	0 months later i check my bank_account ... 0 transactions showed up , each from the carphone_warehouse .
M	i called them to ask for a refund .
M	0st agent told me i never cancelled it ( despite me having received a confirmation letter confirming my cancellation )
M	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
M	whilst im on the phone he told me the refund is sent , will take upto 0 days .
M	checked my bank_account 0 days_later no refund !
M	lying robbing scum !
M	so , i had 0 tyres_fitted to my 0x0 , the remaining 0 tyres were to be balanced - although the driver quite rudely disputed this at first until he re - read his work sheet and decided that i was right .
M	the two new tyres were inflated to 00psi , 00psi more_than the car manufactures recommendation .
M	i didnt find this out until a week_later as at the time i asked if he needed to see the handbook for the correct pressures he said " no " and that he knew what they should be .
M	a classic case of putting your ego first i think !
M	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre pressures for every car in the world right ...?
M	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
M	on some 0x0s you need to match brands front and rear so that the central viscous differential is balanced , particularly at high speeds .
M	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
M	so i phone them up and enquire .
M	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
M	back i go to the site and now book 0 more tyres to match the ones previously fitted on the vehicle .
M	done !
M	that is until i get a phone call saying that they cant now get hold of the tyres .
M	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
M	so ive already booked and paid for these tyres which dont exist .
M	im offered an_alternative and assured they will be a suitable match to the new tyres purchased previously .
M	only problem is they dont seem to know what it is they are giving me .
M	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
M	as they dont know what they are giving me they at_least have the decency to charge me only for the cheapest of the two alternatives .
M	on the day of fitting i arrange to leave work early to arrive home for the 0pm to 0pm fitting window .
M	at 0 . 00 im phoned and told the driver is over 0 hours away , driving from dover ( to hampshire ) and that actually they are going to cancel my fitting !
M	ok i think , come around first thing in the morn and that will be fine , we cant help bad traffic can we ...
M	im then told my fitting cannot be done tomorrow and the next available slot is on saturday , 0 days_later !
M	this is just plainly poor customer focus in the business .
M	if something_goes_wrong you sort it as soon as possible .
M	you dont put customers back to the end of the queue because you failed to deliver first time around .
M	i need these new tyres on now so i can put some motorway miles on the car without damaging the vcu ( differential ).
M	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
M	of course there is something you can do , but you are chosing the option that is most simple for your business .
M	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
M	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
M	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
M	traffic or not he was never going to get to me on time .
M	be warned it seems grippy are over inflating themselves and booking more slots than time in the day !
M	read the other reviews on this site and it seems im not alone .
M	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
M	then go to your local tyre shop .
M	im going to have to do what i should have all along , drive to a local tyre shop , pay a few_quid more_than grippy for the tyres that i want , fitted in front of my eyes , done !
M	rude mechanics who dont know their stuff , a flaky supply chain where stock is checked after an order has been placed and paid for , staff and business policy that have a " cant do " attitude .
M	surprised ?
M	well you get what you pay for dont you ?
M	supplement_warehouse is a great escape from the overpriced stores that offer the same product .
M	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor ' s price and if a competitor ' s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
M	i am an extremely_satisfied customer .
M	i highly_recommend this website / service to any individual who plans to delve into purchasing supplements .
M	traded in a couple of idevices with no_problems at all .
M	recieved a decent amount by cheque .
M	communication was excellent throughout .
M	will certainly use again .
M	i rang customer_services at 00 : 00 on 00 / 00 / 00
M	i had miss placed all my phon numbers and had no way of getting them back i needed one contact asap and i spoke to a guy called michael he was a star !
M	he found it no problem at all and has made my day .
M	it helps me save money on my supplement_needs :)
M	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
M	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily identifiable .
M	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
M	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look_into it .
M	overall i was pleased with the service for the price though and my return transfer ran perfectly .
M	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
M	i have received no useful responses from the customer_service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
M	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
M	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
M	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
M	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
M	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
M	from start to finish everything was well_organised , involved brilliant activities , was great value and saved us heaps of time .
M	i ' ve actually been on a chillisauce do before , but thought it was all down to the hard work of our mate .
M	now i know better .
M	would i use chillisauce again ?
M	it ' s a no_brainer - yes .
M	i ' ve never had any_problems with magic_madhouse and i ' ve ordered from them > 0 times now , the cards come within 0 days and the cards arrive in an immaculate_condition .
M	i can ' t think of any_problems i ' ve had with them and their loyalty service is second to none .
M	i ' ve been using this website for around a month now and i can ' t say anything wrong with it , they have good prices and a good collection of games , this paired with a quick delivery system for the cd_keys is just fantastic
M	i ' ve bought two guitars from richtone , and the service has been great both_times .
M	both arrived exactly when they should have ( which was next_day delivery ), and the two guitars were set_up beautifully .
M	not sure what more you can ask for really !
M	this was a great company they were very quick ( almost scarey ) but never the less pleased with the end_result
M	thank_you for your great service and knowledge when i made my purchase .
M	deciding on the correct high - end watch was not an easy decision , but the knowledge and information i received was fantastic .
M	it is our second family purchase from xupes . com and i am sure there will be many more to come .
M	wish i went to mazuma first !
M	tryed somewhere_else and had a nightmare .
M	will_defiantly use first time next tune .
M	right product , right price , fast delivery
M	great service .
M	helpful on the phone and quick delivery .
M	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer_service and i wasn ' t dissapointed !
M	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
M	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
M	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
M	free p_& p too .
M	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
M	now i know the system works i ' d probably use the bank_transfer next time .
M	they emailed confirmation of every_step and you can follow the order online too .
M	00 out of 00 for sure , a really positive experience .
M	great way to turn drawer clutter into cash .
M	much like others experiences , i sent an iphone_0s and it was reduced due to supposed water_damage .
M	the phone was in perfect working condition .
M	something seems to have changed about this company .
M	i definitely will not use them again .
M	it does not take 0 working_days to do a bank_transfer .
M	it doesn ' t take that long to banka cheque !
M	the maximum it should be is 0 days .
M	outstanding service , cheap , on time , and very professional .
M	very polite and professional fitter frazer .
M	will_definately use again thanks !
M	!
M	got to say when my phone went wrong orange couldnt have been better
M	dealt_with easily on the phone and arranged for replacemnt next_day which happened !
M	!
M	new phone in hand and very pleased
M	thanks
M	the product was exactly as_described , very reasonable and free delivery was even better .
M	the service when i phoned up could not have been better .
M	i was told about the difference in chairs and also what was the best size table for my decking and rattan warehouse were correct in all aspects .
M	just all put out and i have to say what a lovely set of furniture it looks , the cushions are sooo nice as well ..., not those cheap thin ones i have seen on some sets i have viewed .
M	a really good website with a back up and sales_team who really know their stuff .... and the delivery driver was also friendly and couldnt do enough to put furniture in the garden , and my garden is 000ft long and the decking is at the back !
M	!
M	just a really good website and great ' real_person ' experience !
M	!â
M	ordered a ps0 game for Â£_00 , arrived very quickly and well_packaged but somehow the case for the game had got smashed ( i ' m blaming royal_mail ) i sent a email to customer_service and got a reply back only 00_mins later saying they would send out a replacement case .
M	the case arrived the very next_day in perfect_condition .
M	top service , top prices , i strongly_recommend !
M	been using viovet for some time now as my pet needs medication on a fairly regular_basis .
M	viovet always get the medication to my door in super_fast time and i ' ve never had any_problems .
M	if you are looking for a reliable place to get medication from , or anything pet related for that matter , viovet are really good .
M	tecc offers the best quality of products in the market at the best prices with great deals throughout the year .
M	tecc should be everyones first stop when considering replacement products to smoking .
M	amazing prices with fast delivery !
M	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
M	mainly for my mum but also to other family_members .
M	i have never ever had any_issues with them .
M	the bouquets are always beautiful looking and last ages .
M	i ordered a rose and lily bouquet for my mum and it lasted over 0 weeks .
M	she had been given some flowers from the supermarket at the same time but they died within a week !
M	!
M	customer_service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
M	i will never order flowers from anyone_else but prestige_flowers
M	excellent service , great prices , even better staff .
M	you will feel at home and well taken care of at official watches / dd jewellers .
M	brilliant website , fantastic staff to follow_up the easy to use website .
M	would highly_recommend using this website !
M	microsoft are the leaders when it comes to software in my opinion but they rarely listen to their customers on what they would like to see or need in a program upgrade .
M	they are a very american company in the way they run and this does not always fit well with how businesses should be in the united_kingdom .
M	they like to have their own piece of everything and if someone does something better then they just try and kill off competition with buying companies out or buying exclusive content / hardware for themselves .
M	customer support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
M	i wouldnt use anywhere_else to find info about a movie than here , it has it all .
M	the review system could use a bit of work as films are always rated loads of 0s and 00s to try and balance the scores out but if people would just rate them properly then it would be so much_better .
M	id still give it a 0 out of 0_stars though as everything else just works so well .
M	seeing amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different_types of goods .
M	the problem with amazon is that when you have faulty_goods or problems they arent always very helpful .
M	i had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them ( they say the sale of goods_act is a load of rubbish ) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty_goods .
M	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded_delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
M	not a good way for a company to work .
M	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
M	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
M	google is by_far the best web search_engine around , nobody does things half as good as these .
M	also i am very happy with the way google android is coming along with each release it is getting better , cant_wait_till they are up there giving microsoft a run for their money in the home os markets .
M	shopto are in my opinion the place to go for your games , cheapest prices in most_cases , a great reward system in giving you points that equate to cash to use for future_purchases but best of all the superb fast delivery times .
M	i have ordered items as late as 0pm and received them the day after , never had a late item delivery , in most_cases i have had games a day or 0 before_release_date .
M	couldnt praise them more and cant really ask for more from a company .
M	i was astonished by the speed of service .
M	i ordered twice , and both_times the products arrived the next_day , which is remarkable given the small postage charge .
M	saved 00_% over the next cheapest alternative - all_round excellent service .
M	i have used eframe twice now and have been very impressed with the speed of the service ( considering the frames are custom made ) and the quality of the product .
M	i will_definitely use them again .
M	pc game supply satisfied my need for psn us prepaid cards in the uk .
M	the prices were fair ( even a few pennies below the day ' s currency trading rate ).
M	i ordered wedding thank_you cards from bride and groom_direct and even when a shipping mix_up happened on my end , bride and groom_direct were very quick in trying to help me locate my order .
M	great service from a great company .
M	i bought a shirt as a gift last christmas and the service i received from the staff at uk soccer shop was excellent .
M	their email support is very good .
M	i will buy from them again and i would recommend others to do so as well .
M	professional landlord : 0 weeks and still_waiting for the money .
M	also they do not reply to our mails .
M	very bad .
M	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
M	sender put wrong_address then he told them right address . p0g then didn ' t in form city_link about changes of address their forth my son missed his main birthday_present . item sent out on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still not got it by today which is 00 / 000 crap service don ' t use them ........................
M	i have order several_times through fragrance_direct and every time the products have been of an excellent quality which are delivered promptly .
M	in addition to this the price is the best around always a good few pounds cheaper_than competitors .
M	highly , highly_recommended !
M	i ordered 0x0gb ram for my 0000 imac .
M	the memory arrived_promptly and was package excellently with clear_instructions for fitting .
M	my computer now runs at an unbelieveable speed !
M	thank_you !
M	i have used ccl on a few occasions before .
M	they always have stock of the product that i am looking for , they are always competitive on price and deliveries and both speedy and efficient .
M	ordering the products was simple , all of the information i needed was to hand .
M	throughout the delivery period i was kept_informed on the whereabouts of my order and my products arrived as and when advised .
M	have been using holbi / datalink for about 0 - 0 years now , they have the capability to implement an endless amount of features and integrations .
M	currently they integrate with ebay and amazon for me , with automatic listing and stock sync , and import directly to sage including multi currency and multi platform / vat options .
M	their customer_service is always very prompt and helpful .
M	would recommend without any problem .
M	rajiv
M	i ordered some filters last_week thursday and they arrived on monday_morning .
M	i needed some more knowledge on nd filters which cameraking were willing to point me in the right_direction for .
M	i think they offer a good service despite what other reviews state below ( it seems many of the reviews have ben posted a long time ago )
M	shopping on line is easy once you ' ve done your first order .
M	delivery was on time and correct with suitable replacements where necessary .
M	company called after delivery to check all was well .
M	received good offers and discount vouchers for next time .
M	much_easier than trudging through the isles .
M	just need someone to put it all away now !
M	!
M	the website was easy to use and very informative allowing me to choose the perfect item .
M	payment_method was quick and delivery free and very quick .
M	order number_000000000
M	i find amazon have an excellent variety and range of products plus prices are generally cheap .
M	their reviews also help and it ' s easy to control ones orders on the site .
M	besides this i am also a kindle fan so i find the ebook purchasing process really easy to do plus the ebooks are automatically uploaded to my kindle which is cool .
M	i find shopperhive ' s comparison listings easy to compare , especially using the grid view .
M	they have a wide_selection of online shops including niche boutique retailers which i don ' t really find on other comparison_websites .
M	all information seems up to date when clicking through to various retailer websites to make my purchases and i also find that there is a lot of useful_information on the product page to help me with my purchase decision .
M	in particular i like the price history info on a product because this shows me that i can set_up a realistic price alert for that product and save when it reaches my target price .
M	i will_definitely be using shopperhive again .
M	i bought rayman legend as i saw it for the cheapest price than anyone_else , fantastic service as i ordered it on the tuesday and got it on the thursday .
M	best site for buying any supplements ... i just search all websites for cheapest place and they match them and give an extra 0 %_off .... alot of the time supplementwarehouse has the cheapest prices too ,, i buy 0 or 0 times a yr from them
M	i ordered two lengths of oak board which arrived on the date i chose with a call from the courier to say how soon they would arrive .
M	the boards were dropped_off with great care and no_fuss .
M	i can recommend worktop_express to everyone .
M	i ' ve made a few purchases here and have been given an excellent service each time .
M	i ' ve never had an order arrive late , badly packaged or missing items .
M	thank_you model_bits for your services and long may you continue .
M	website and order process was easy to navigate .
M	i called the customer_service team to check on delivery dates , there was no waiting on hold and efficient service .
M	i needed to call customer_services to confirm payment , the team member was helpful , efficient and friendly .
M	product arrived before expected , as_described and was a good deal .
M	fantastic service , very knowledgeable_staff and very friendly service .
M	i was given very good advice on what they recommended and got a good deal on what i ordered .
M	instruments arrived very soon after i ordered them and the minor problems with delivery were very quickly resolved .
M	definitely shopping here again !
M	thanks guys !
M	i was pretty impressed with this website .
M	their prices seemed to be marginally cheaper_than their competitors , and they offered free delivery over Â£_00 which was handy .
M	the delivery was quite fast , although i did have one issue with my order with a couple of items missing from my parcel .
M	i contacted them via_email , and they promptly responded , apologised , and popped my missing items in the post first_class !
M	can ' t complain there !
M	i ' ll probably be using them again in the not - too - distant_future !
M	i contacted jenny for abit of help and sorted it out straight_away , many_thanks again ;-)
M	the site is clear and concise in everything it does .
M	once you ' ve found the product you desire you simply checkout and pay .
M	the security to stop unauthorised users accessing your codes before you do is also a nice_touch .
M	i would recommend this site and its services to everyone .
M	i ' ve been using heartinternet for a while now .
M	i have over 00 domains , i ' ve had a home and business hosting_package and now i use their vps service which is great for all my websites and clients .
M	there has been a few_times when i ' ve needed quick service to resolve problems and i know i can always rely_on heartinternets amazing customer_service to help out .
M	i always recommend them to friends and family .
M	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn ' t receive anything - and that they don ' t know about delivery to stores at all .
M	the online support was not very helpful so far .
M	i am taking my business elsewhere
M	edit_: - now they lie that i have collected the order .
M	i haven ' t .
M	worst customer_service ever - imagine this was your Â£_000 photobook .
M	better claim on credit_card straight_away
M	very competitive on pricing and rapid delivery .
M	more_than adequately met our needs and would certainly use again in the future .
M	great product , personal customer_services not pushy very professional would use them again
M	never had a bad time with these_guys .
M	good selection , accurate delivery times , good condition and timely arrivals .
M	can ' t be_faulted .
M	on the two times i ' ve had to talk to a customer support person they proved pretty up to the task too .
M	excellent website easy to use and there online help is second to none .
M	!
M	cheap and fast !
M	better_than royal_mail !
M	!
M	stephanie was i great help ( thanks )
M	i am a customer of supplement_warehouse for more_than a year now ... love buying from them coz of price and quality satisfaction ...
M	highly_recommended !!
M	!
M	excellent service from 0smok , great communication and quick delivery .
M	0_stars
M	always quick delivery , great prices .
M	always have great service from ecigwizard , quick delivery and great products and prices .
M	great seller , very quick delivery and excellent e_- liquid .
M	the trend with pc games is that they are slowly becoming more_expensive , even_though the medium is now less physical that it used to be due to digital distributors .
M	brand_new games on steam are sometimes going for 00 + quid .
M	as much as i love steam , i love competitive business better and cj ' s offers just that .
M	i picked_up europa universalis iv for 00 quid instead of the steam price_tag of 00 . 00 .
M	that is a great saving for what is essentially a newly_released title .
M	the cj ' s service itself was well reviewed , straight_forward and more_importantly legit / secure .
M	so well_done guys , a cracking job and another happy customer , i will be sure to check back for deals often :)
M	fast .
M	great communications .
M	quick payment for full_amount .
M	this is awesome !!
M	!
M	stag_do in budapest was excellent !
M	i wasn ' t the organiser of our group but from my point of view everything went very well and i had a class time , so no_complaints from me .
M	the guides that looked after us were very friendly and knowledgeable .
M	would ceraintly use chillisauce again .
M	the company did not have any stock and only after i contacted them did they respond that that they did not have any idea when i would get the product .
M	very slow to respond .
M	very poor service .
M	would avoid .
M	i bought the new hitman which retailed at Â£_00 , but i got here at simply_games for Â£_00 , chuffed at the price already , i was surprised when the game was delivered within 0 business days .
M	definitely going to use this website again , terrific service !
M	so far the experience has been great .. the website is very helpful and informative yet convinient and i am fully_satisfied uptill now .
M	i was already perfectly happy with nespresso and their pods , but they simply don ' t offer enough variety for me .
M	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
M	having tried my first few pods now i ' ve got mixed views on them as a long_term viable alternative to genuine nespresso .
M	obviously the price is good and on top of that my initial opinion is that the blends are high_quality .
M	strangely it seems like the water comes out hotter with these pods than nespresso ' s own , which is a good thing , but i guess i could be imagining that .
M	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i ' m sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso machine ' s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
M	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so far 00_% of the pods i ' ve used haven ' t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso machine flashing its lights in protest !
M	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn ' t full compatibility there yet and i have no_idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
M	so , overall i ' ve been reasonably satisfied with my initial batch ' s flavour , but i ' ll need to live with them a while longer before_deciding to buy again .
M	and by that time nespresso might have launched their new vertuoline machine in the uk , with the redesigned pods , which will be an interesting development for both companies !
M	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek ' s way of doing things .
M	i wasn ' t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0 weeks , so not too long a wait .
M	however last_week i received an_email from them advising me that due to limited stock they would need me to pay in_advance for a game called quantum break for xbox one , or my pre_- order would be made available to other customers .
M	now this is a game that currently has no release_date and might not come out for another 00 months or more , so i replied to the email explaining this and how i was unwilling to pay for a game so far in_advance .
M	i heard_nothing back for a few_days until i checked my account today and found my pre_- order cancelled .
M	so i checked my emails and have had a reply this afternoon that huffily informs me " not a problem .
M	we ' ve cancelled your order ".
M	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won ' t pay for the goods potentially a year in_advance .
M	poor .
M	simply_games have always been a reliable online presence for me and with the big names failing in their customer_service obligations lately ( game ' s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
M	i ordered bioshock_infinite and within a couple of days it had been despatched by first_class post and arrived 0 days before_release .
M	would ' ve been with me a couple of days earlier even , but for the atrocious postal service in my area .
M	the icing on the cake was that the game dropped in price by a few_quid after my copy had been despatched and , without having to be asked , simply_games had reduced my invoice to the new lower_price .
M	a great , and hopefully long_lasting , retailer !
M	i ordered a playstation 0 , an extra controller and gta v , all works great apart_from the extra controllers left analog is a bit loose so it doesn ' t spring back to the centre - would be nice to have advised that on the page , other than that it works great .
M	all in all great buy , cannot complain for the price at all , plus the quick delivery .
M	very good .
M	i cant_complain one bit not only did i get an amazing price but i also recieved my codes instantly .
M	payment was quick , simple and fast .
M	the best hostel site .
M	fast delivery and any_problems are sorted very quickly
M	i recently relocated to the us and had to transfer a larger amount .
M	everything worked perfect .
M	thanks a lot !
M	earlier this year our company began contracting out proof reading of marketing to grammar genie as a trial due to the high costs of proof reading and copy editing we were paying to our print management company .
M	the member of staff we dealt_with was sharon .
M	the service from her was very quick and efficient and and attention to detail was unprecedented .
M	we sent off numerous marketing campains to her to be checked , and thought they were grammatically perfect .
M	we were somewhat mistaken to say the least .
M	in 0 days sharon had uncovered dozens of errors , and edited the documents for us giving a list of all the changes she had made .
M	not only that , she changed and reworded many sentences to make everything flow better .
M	sharon has since worked on our company website , legal letters , employment contracts and all our marketing .
M	i cannot reccomend the services of grammar genie enough .
M	very reasonably_priced , and worth every_penny .
M	ordered a piece of furniture in october , which the website said was in stock .
M	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
M	i ordered it and paid in full .
M	i was then told a few_days_later that it wasnt in stock and would be in in a few_days .
M	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
M	this went on for a total of 00 weeks when it finally came into stock .
M	after dozens and dozens of phone_calls to arrange delivery , none of which were actually answered , i gave in and collected it myself from the warehouse .
M	i was then met by a complete jobsworth at the warehouse claiming he doesn ' t know what to do as the computers are down today .
M	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
M	throughout the 00 week wait , no one ever contacted me to say there were delays or why , everything was left for me to contact them , which is fine in theory , however they almost never answer the phones , and when they do a clueless member of staff exclaims ' i dont know , i ' ll find out and ring you back ' which they subsequently never do .
M	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
M	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
M	alright they are cheaper_than most places , but you can see why .
M	its worth paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
M	pay peanuts , you get monkeys !
M	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
M	packaging was also very good ... fantastic service , would definitely_recommend
M	have bought from the whisky_exchange several_times now and am always impressed with their selection .
M	recently i bought a bottle of knob creek for my brother on a saturday evening and it arrived on tuesday ( standard delivery ).
M	very acceptable .
M	bottles ordered arrive well_packaged .
M	i ' m yet to have anything break en_route .
M	would recommend twe to a friend , and in fact it was recommended to me by a friend in the first place .
M	got a tub of retro sweets as a present for a friend ' s four children .
M	hopefully they ' ll love it .
M	one of the review says that the tub was not nearly as full as the picture implies : i would have to disagree .
M	i bought a few extra bits to add to the tub so that there were four of each of the more popular items ( popping candy , for example ) and had difficulty fitting any more in there !
M	tracking_number and communication through email let ' s you know where your product is and when it will arrive which is well decent .
M	the site itself has got really wide_range of clothes , definitely should be able to find the brand you like and it ' s got a mint sale section , well worth a browse around , you ' ll find something you like easy .
M	super_quick deliver and with cash back deal - the cheapest on the market .
M	avoid argos !!
M	i ' m just about to get married .
M	on 0th of august i ordered two wedding_rings for me and my fiancÃ© in slough branch in observatory shopping centre .
M	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
M	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
M	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance ' s ring .
M	my ring still didn ' t arrive , and when i went to the store few_days ago to check upon it ' s status again , the lady told me she cannot help me as the ring wasn ' t dispatched by supplier and she didn ' t know when will it be delivered .
M	when i told her how important it is for me to have this ring , she says she cant guarantee the ring to be delivered on time , she looked in her system and she found same ring but .... one size smaller in other branch in reading .
M	i decided to buy this ring as i didn ' t want to end up with no ring at all .
M	the serving lady in reading i finally got me the ring , but when i looked at it - it was looking well worn with lots of scratches and some dents on it .
M	i don ' t want and i can ' t keep this ring and now i have to return it as well as i have to return the ring of my fiancÃ© .
M	now i have my wedding date set on 00 . 00 . 0000 but have no rings !
M	argos just simply ruined this most_important day by its negligence and unreliability !!
M	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
M	it is just unacceptable !
M	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !
M	as always with the whiskey_exchange the parcel was extremely well_protected and was delivery next_day via parcel_force .
M	the prices you can â t beat and the descriptions of the taste , smell etc is usually spot on .
M	i would recommend this company to anybody who_wants top quality drink at extremely competitive_prices .
M	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted Â£_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
M	when i saw these on at Â£ 0 . 00 a piece i was a bit_wary as you have to wonder_how this kind of site can offer genuine products at such a low price but based on the description and gut feeling , i decided to go with them ; it was a good choice .
M	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture shows .
M	they are clearly genuine but the only thing i expected them to come in was full retail packaging as stated instead of just being in the plastic holding band that all apple leads come in .
M	that said , i do not know what leads bought in an apple_store come packaged in but they would not be loose .
M	the postal details state that the items will be sent via recorded_delivery , however after one week they had still not arrived so i contacted nicecans to ask for a tracking_number .
M	it appeared that they had been sent via standard post and had been lost but nicecans had no issues with sending me another three units , this time via 0nd_class recorded_delivery .
M	this was ok as the delivery details on the site state 0nd_class recorded however it would have been nice if they had been sent 0st_class to make up for the time loss but this is only a little niggle .
M	they were very helpful and friendly when i rang up so that was great as i was expecting to get some rubbish excuse to try and get out of it so top_marks on that one .
M	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
M	overall , i ' m very impressed and i will_definitely use them again despite the little hiccup but these things_happen and at_least they wanted to help and get the issue resolved which is more_than some other sellers .
M	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it ' s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
M	many_thanks
M	mitch
M	cult_pens could not have provided a better service if they had tried .
M	i asked if they would price_match another offer i had received which they had no issues with at all which saved me a great chunk of money and even included next_day special delivery at no extra_cost .
M	email communication was absolutely impeccable and i received replies within minutes .
M	i deal with three different people via_email but each was extremely_helpful and willing and seemed like they were working as a team .
M	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
M	the item was delivery on the exact date i asked for and was in immaculate_condition with superior packaging ; i did change the delivery destination and postal date after_placing the order but there were no issues at all in doing this so again another great positive point .
M	overall , a brilliant service and i will_definitely use again as and when i need .
M	talk_talk is by_far the worst company to deal with .
M	called to give notice i am leaving , indian women said i need to speak to manager at customer loyalty , and transfers my call , after a 0min wait call goes dead .
M	same happens again .
M	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
M	asked why i am leaving and can he address my problems , explained to him , then said i need to speak to manager , gets put through to manager after a 00mins wait , who asked me why i am calling doh ' you called me ' !
M	he cannot help me and says i need to speak to manager .
M	what a complete_waste of time this company is .
M	i don ' t care how much cheaper talktalk are , i will happy pay alot more for my broadband in future , just so i do not have to deal with them again .
M	we were kept up to date via_email and text , fast delivery .
M	we will be using you again in future .
M	the radio is fantastic , well built and the sound quality is excellent , glad we ordered it
M	hanving paid the deposit for unlock pre_- order , these people contacted me with their final price of gbp 000 . 00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
M	i contacted orange , who proceeded with full factory_unlock of the handset for gbp 00 . 00 .
M	busy claiming a refund of my deposit from official_iphone_unlock , who seek excuses in ther tc ' s stating the service has been delivered , although i never accepted and proceeded with the upgrade to full factory_unlock and settling the oustanding balance .
M	do not pay more_than you have to , do some research first , people .
M	scammers !
M	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0 weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice bloke and has threatened many customers !
M	just google them !
M	ordered Â£_000 worth of stuff , just to have it left outside my house by the cowboys from ' yodel '.
M	ordered a couple of bits for a computer i was building from ebuyer . com .
M	the prices were cheaper_than amazon and i didn ' t have to worry_about that cowboy courier company ' yodel ' damaging my parcel like usual , especially because one of the items was a hdd .
M	the items arrived a week after ordering , which was not quick but it was just before_christmas , so they were busy and i forgive them .
M	the items were very well_packaged especially the hdd .
M	will be buying a new monitor from them soon .
M	thanks
M	quick and easy .
M	money transferred to my account same day they received my phone .
M	should also say i received full_amount unlike some other similar companies who knock off money for small defects / marks / small scratches to the phone .
M	have used mazuma a number of times in the past and will_definitely use again in the future .
M	always a good selection , competitive_prices and first_class service .
M	i ordered rad new vans that i couldn ' t find on the high_st , cheaper_than other_websites i found them on .
M	urban_industry has a great browsing system and interface .
M	only took two days for the order to arrive .
M	shame i already got mud on them ...
M	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
M	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
M	i emailed boohoo customer_services , got an answer back within a day and told that the item was still in stock , i said i would like it and thought that would be that .
M	i still_haven ' t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
M	how many other customer ' s money is sitting in their bank_account .
M	avoid like the plague .
M	this autocentres is the best i have ever visited , i had a flat back tyre so having limited options i called the aa for road side assistance , having more knowledge into the flat tyre , it was just a slow puncture .
M	the aa man suggested , to go the local garriage which was only 000 yards from were i was stationed .
M	my son had come_across this eden tyres & servicing from an app called near me , which located this garage ( by chance ) because it was the closest in my area .
M	the loverly polite staff took a look at the tyre described that it was a slow puncture , so they offered to examine the tyre , so the polite staff , took care by placing a sheet over the driver ' s seat to stop it getting dirty and examined my car for free .
M	this was a total shock to me , it was such a reliable examination , no exaggeration , it was also a fast examination , only sitting in the waiting room for only 0 minutes .
M	to my surprise they had repaired the puncture free of charge what a survive .
M	they did not try to sell any tyres , but told us the truth .
M	i asked how much they charge for a replacement , and to my amazement they told me that it only cost , Â£_00 and where i normally go in chesterfield it cost Â£_00 , what a saving .
M	so to conclude i will_definately be visiting again , and if you are in the local area of 0 & 0 pentrich road ( opposite screwfix ), giltbrook industrial park , giltbrook , nottinghamshire ng00 0uz ., near the ikea , please give them a visit because they have amazing services at great prices and such a polite and willing service , which everyone will warm to .
M	please give them a ring at : 00000_000000
M	i have been using ebuyer for my pc builds for well over 0 years now , and i can_honestly say i have never had an issue with the service they provide .
M	their free delivery is a blessing , and their charged shipping is at a reasonable_price for those times when i ' ve needed things through next_day .
M	all items are well_packaged , with plenty of " stuffing " to keep components safe during_transit .
M	they stock a wide_variety of products ; from value for when you ' ve not got the cash to shop for big name brands , to said big name brands .
M	though it should be said whether you shop for either they are all of a high_quality .
M	defaults in products happen , and that isn ' t the fault of the company shipping the product to you ( unless they make it of course !
M	); so on the one or two occasions that i ' ve been delivered a faulty product , i was very pleased that i had absolutely no issue with the returns service ebuyer provide .
M	their response to my issue was quick , and i got my replacement quickly .
M	i know this review sounds_like a massive advertising campaign for ebuyer , but given the many years i ' ve been using them and how well i ' ve been treated as a customer i think it ' s well_deserved .
M	i look_forward to many more years of great deals , and happy shopping !
M	fantastic service and quick delivery .
M	product arrived in excellent condition and with adequate packaging .
M	will_definitely be using again .
M	sold old htc_desire with a broken screen for Â£_00 .
M	quick payment , no_problems
M	i ordered a cable for Â£_00 . 00 on 00th_sept .
M	received an order confirmation_email but no despatch email , no item delivered and no reply to email query .
M	suspect they are crooks as others have found .
M	avoid .
M	i ordered pau d ' arco bark cut and it arrived as promised and contained what expected .

M	( the official way )
M	thanks !
M	great outcome a ++++
M	will use again of needed

M	good product line .
M	great prices and fast delivery .
M	this site is my first stop for my vaping needs .

M	we will_definately be using company again .
M	shopping here was awesome .
M	had everything i needed and then some .
M	will_definitely be back again soon !
M	up until recently i would have said lovely , always helpful .
M	occasional things gone wrong but rectified .
M	but after my recent experience in store at there pharmacy and the interaction with the locum pharmacist who openly on the shop floor , my medication and medical conditions and then_proceeded to scare the living day lights out if me regarding one of my medications and also telling_me i should not be taking it and other medication all prescribed by my gp .
M	i phoned boots customer care , to complain and felt_like i was being fobbed_off , a report would be made nothing more .
M	so i emailed and then used there contact us form on there site and have not heard a peep from them ..
M	not acceptable boots ... not acceptable at all .
M	was really easy , and quick to use .
M	paid quickly and very well compared to other cash for phone providers .
M	will_definately use again !
M	i needed to change the website i used due to complications and stumbled_upon magicred .
M	their customer_service is outstanding and they really help to get you on the right tracks .
M	i used some nice coupons when registering to get some extra chips , and since then i have been flying .
M	this is a truly great casino site with accurate casino simulators that aren ' t biased like many websites out there !
M	the website is very smooth to use and high_quality with everything located conveniently within the user_interface .
M	a massive thumbs_up and 00 / 00 recommendation to anyone thats new or looking for a new casino site to gamble on !
M	i have used this company on several occasionsand the service has always been excellent .
M	i have no_hesitation in reccommending them to anyone .
M	i have used this company on several occasionsand the service has always been excellent .
M	i have no_hesitation in reccommending them to anyone .
M	[_name ] was the one to help my father in his venture ( with no facebook his son is writing this review ) thank_you for a most excellent level of customer_satisfaction .
M	i have purchased several products from this site , signing_up for their email alerts was the best thing ever , i never miss out the the best deal becuase of this .
M	the products are always the top quality and with super_fast_shipping i can always plan on starting a workout cycle on time .
M	i would reccomend this site to anyone who is wanting to be fit and stay healthy .
M	the phone arrived day and time specifid , customer_services where exelant very happy with vodafone and will be recomending the company to all my family and freinds .
M	the service is superb it was far much_better_than i expected money got into my account just as the advert says .
M	very simple and easy process would gladly use them again
M	response was quick .
M	arrived on time .
M	did the job quickly and to a high_standard .
M	slightly pricier than some other services , but for the quality and lack of hassle i thought it was worth it .
M	would highly_recommend .
M	i used compare the market to compare quotes for insurance on my yaris .
M	i filled in one form in minutes and got a load of quotes to compare .
M	i ended_up getting a great deal and also got myself a free meerkat toy .
M	god_bless aleksandr orlov !
M	update_: just moved_into a new flat , needed home insurance , had a quote and then policy sorted within 00_minutes .
M	super_fast , super cheap .
M	plus i got another meerkat toy .
M	exactly as expected first_class
M	really fast , simple and easy !
M	would reccomend to everybody !
M	i sent my phone off on the wednesday and the money was in my bank on the thursday so it was a very fast service .
M	got a cheap last_minute deal with these people .
M	the rep was great , the hotel fab and the skiing great .
M	would go again , but doubt i will ever get that price again , Â£_000 for the week !
M	bought two or three times and always the advise of the women on the phones is excellent .
M	everything fits and if there is ever an issue they always sort out there and then .
M	good prices and a vast_range of skiwear .
M	one of the best on the internet .
M	the instrument to everywhere .
M	the gateway to shopping paradise .
M	how would we work , play or pis $ without them ?
M	ordered a few_times .
M	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don ' t let you know about until after you ' ve ordered .
M	not an issue , but would be nice to know at time of ordering .
M	ordered a couple of times and a complete_waste of time .
M	should be banned from the internet , a complete_joke .
M	fantastic range , amazing service and fast delivery .
M	all that , everyone has .
M	these people have this plus they have the best price on the internet .
M	they should be the biggest and best for outdoor , camping and skiwear anywhere in the uk .
M	no doubt they will be .
M	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past_year , every time the service has been excellent .
M	i ' ve had problems with most of the other online pc component retailers in the uk , but not a single_issue with overclockers .
M	i highly_recommend them as first choice .
M	i occasionally buy from tesco online and the delivery is always very fast regardless of whatever postage i choose .
M	i bought mobile phone last_year off them for roughly Â£_00 delivered .
M	took about 0 days to arrive but strangely i ended_up getting a postage refund , tesco said it was delayed : s , so the phone only cost Â£_00 delivered :)
M	great service every time :)
M	i bought some speakers for Â£_00 which arrived faulty i sent them back and got a refund of Â£_00 ...
M	i ' m not sure how thats even legal : s
M	so many people down - voting carphone_warehouse because of yodel .
M	yes yodel are terrible , and they shouldn ' t legally be allowed to call themselves a delivery company .
M	and yes , carphone_warehouse shouldn ' t be using them .
M	there is an obvious and simple way to get around this though .
M	select the " deliver to store " option .
M	i read all these reviews and decided to give this a try .
M	it worked beautifully !
M	the phone i ' ve been wanting for a while ( nexus 0 ) on the contract i wanted ( cheap as chips ) when i wanted it ( next_day ) with no_fuss whatsoever !
M	avoid yodel at all costs - but don ' t miss out on a good deal because of it .
M	maybe carphone_warehouse will pull their finger out and give these_idiots the boot eventually ... but until then you can still use them , get good service and a great deal too .
M	most painless mobile i ' ve ever got .
M	ordered more_than a few items from deep_blue now and always receive items in a timeous fashion .
M	when i ' ve called into the shop for some info prior to ordering the staff have always been very friendly and knowledgable .
M	bottom_line is if you need any training gear then give them a try , you wont be let_down on service and you just might save a few bob .
M	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
M	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
M	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
M	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
M	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
M	:) having said that , i really_enjoyed roulette too .
M	customer_service is good and i have never had any_issues with payouts / withdrawals etc .
M	they have the biggest_selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
M	their prices are beyond fair and even give you a better deal if you find a better price else where .
M	seriously there is no other reason to go anywhere_else .
M	my first experience of cex has been very smooth , indeed .
M	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
M	one of the highlights would have to be the mailing label being absolutely free .
M	excellent !
M	then , it was as simple as packaging up the game and posting it through the nearest postbox .
M	within 00 or so days , they had received it , processed it and sent the cash via bank_transfer .
M	simple .
M	not the fastest way , sure .
M	but via post , not bad at all .
M	being so simple , i am sure to use them again in the future .
M	i have often heard of cex , but had never used them before .
M	so , it was a nice surprise to find that their service was very straight - forward and smooth .
M	i highly_recommend them !
M	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
M	scouring the internet like i normally do , i found that ccl had the best deal and good stock_levels .
M	and with a few simple clicks , i created the order and awaited the despatch email .
M	it arrived in good time and everything was in order .
M	simple as that .
M	on a side note , i don ' t understand the bad_reviews on trustpilot .
M	i ' ve been using ccl since 0000 when i bought a laptop from them and have never had any_issues with orders , then or now .
M	and because of that , i look_forward to ordering from them again very soon .
M	i hadn ' t heard of hifix before , but they were the cheapest when i was looking for some qav speakers , so i tried them out .
M	not only did i get the cheapest price and free delivery , i also got fast next_day delivery !
M	i ' d definitely use them again and it ' s comforting to know there are other shops online that cater so well for hi -_fi items .
M	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full monty sim - only deal .
M	it was billed at Â£ 00pm for 00m with a free refurbished nexus 0 00gb .
M	all was ok to start with , signup was painless and their delivery company dpd were spot on .
M	fast forward 0 weeks and i got a text from t - mobile saying they ' ve been trying to contact me and this is the last chance to pay my bill .
M	i ' ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit weird .
M	noticed that my mobile data wasn ' t working , so tried registering on the t - mobile website ( that ' s nicely broken at the moment ) so gave up and called t - mobile .
M	got hold of a very bored sounding lady , who confirmed my account was overdue to a cancelled dd ( first i ' d heard of it !)
M	and i needed to pay Â£_00 to restore my service .
M	i queried the amount and she confirmed that i should be paying Â£_00 a month and pretty_much refused to believe me about the Â£_00 agreed with e0save .
M	checked all my stuff from e0save and it ' s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc etc .
M	so it just looks_like either i was mis_- sold or they ' re just incompetent .
M	either way , not exactly re - assuring and i ' ve got no way to rectify it because they ' re shut at weekends .
M	guess i won ' t be calling anyone tonight then !
M	my advice , go elsewhere for your mobile needs .
M	i had my first real problem with virginmedia when i upgraded my broadband and ordered a tivo box ( standard v + box is god_awful slow after being used to a skyhd box ) i haggled a deal with their indian_call_centre where i ' d only pay Â£_00 instead of Â£_00
M	sadly , as i soon found out , i was lied to and my bill showed the full_amount .
M	rang cs who advised me to cancel the dd as they had no way of refunding my money .
M	done that and then i got a Â£_00 charge for a dd failure .
M	called again , and was told it was all sorted .
M	sadly the next bill still showed the Â£_00 charge .
M	called and spoke to their complaints_department who said they wouldn ' t have said that ( awfully nice to be called a liar by a complaints_department !)
M	but conveniently they didn ' t record these call to the off - shore department , so i couldn ' t prove it
M	at this point i raised a complaint with ofcom about being mis_- sold and sent an_email to the ceo ' s office at vm .
M	only then did i get someone that understood customer_service , who apologised and promptly refunded my account with the money .
M	couple all this with their rubbish traffic management ( 00_% speed reduction on uploads !!)
M	and you ' re better off looking elsewhere .
M	as soon as my contract is up i ' m jumping ship to bt_infinity
M	great service , would happily buy stuff from them again !
M	i came_across 0000rpm when looking for some writeable dvds on ebay .
M	they were shipped very fast and had the best prices i could find on the internet here in the uk .
M	the next time i needed discs i just searched for 0000rpm on google and came_across their website .
M	prices were slightly lower_than on ebay , but you do have to pay for delivery :(
M	the range is better on their website , but like i said , you pay for delivery .
M	personally , i ' d prefer it if prices were a little_bit cheaper but still with free delivery ( since they don ' t have to pay ebay fees ) but you can ' t have everything .
M	still , highly_recommended if you want blank discs in the uk
M	i would recommend liberty_flights to anyone that smokes e_- cigs .
M	the have great value products and they are good .
M	also lots of variety .
M	i bought the 0cm topper to replace my 0cm egg shaped topper from argos and man what a difference !
M	the one from memory_foam warehouse is by_far a superior quality then the argos and was almost the same price .
M	therefore the argos one was returned after 0 night .
M	will_deffo be back here if i need more .
M	instant rns alert .
M	it ' s exactly_what every investor needs .
M	keep it up
M	very quick delivery product as expected and even cheaper then the manufacturer ' s website .
M	plus free next_day delivery
M	i bought an iphone repair then realised due to repair time would not be able to send package due to holiday .
M	they immediately provided a refund with no_hassles !
M	0 * customer_service
M	simply excellent service all_round .
M	would highly_recomend to anyone .
M	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
M	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
M	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
M	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
M	the greeting card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
M	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
M	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
M	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
M	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
M	thank_you
M	i was very impressed that they double_checked with me that i wanted the item shipped to a different address .
M	there was a technical fault and my item wasn ' t shipped , but when i emailed to enquire what was happening , the lady who dealt_with my email was very helpful , sorted the issue out straight_away and refunded the postage_costs .
M	you can ' t avoid things going wrong sometimes , but i think you get the measure of a company by how they fix things which have gone wrong ; based on my experience with mpb i would have no reservations recommending them to others
M	ordered a few sets of cards from moo . com without any_issues , the prices are a little expensive but you get good quality business_cards .
M	they also they do a variety of other card types and allow you to customise the front and back layouts with the option to use ready - made designs .
M	the alignment on one order were a slightly off this was probably down to the size of the image i uploaded , highly_recommended !
M	been shopping with amazon since they were formed , have brought lots of books from them and always received the products ordered on time .
M	returns and replacements are dealt_with swiftly by their customer support_team on electronic items which have gone faulty within the warranty_period .
M	ordered items lost in delivery are investigated and replacements are sent whilst the investigation takes place , all you have to do is send back one of the packages if both eventually arrive .
M	as other_reviewers have stated , please be weary of the marketplace listings as they can be problem - some can be cheaper or more_expensive than buying from amazon uk .
M	just make_sure when buying that you check the " sold by " and the prices from marketplace_sellers and products supplied directly from amazon uk .
M	just such a quick and painless experience .
M	lots of customisation options to find the perfect hostel .
M	also offers 0 % cashback through quidco !
M	the customer_service was amazing after the mix_up with paypal , i will_definitely use here again !
M	ordered bf0 and within 00 seconds the key was in my inbox ready to be redeemed , used cjs multiple_times before with the same results and will_definitely use them again !
M	supersnelle en zeer persoonlijke afhandeling vanaf het eerste contactmoment !
M	bijzonder tevreden en zou het iedereen aanraden !
M	complimenten !
M	diverse bestellingen gedaan en altijd prima geleverd .

M	i have had many deliveries from dpd and to be honest i wish every company was dpd style .

M	then i saw this site .
M	i won ' t be holding my breath for the goods .

M	avoid !
M	the website is good and easy to use .
M	you can find what you nees quickly and the booking process was simple and quick .
M	will_definitely be using again !
M	do not use this company
M	work overpriced ( more_than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more_than 0 weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
M	and for all of this , they actually charged me for the pleasure - without actually completing any work .
M	still fighting for a refund !
M	awsome just awsome
M	but dont use dpd again !
M	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .

M	great range of quality products for a bargain price
M	great service , quick replies and all sorted .
M	i purchased a tv from appliances direct .
M	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add Â£_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
M	once removed i clicked the how much delivery will be button : Â£ 0 . 00 , but when i went to check out after filling these details in this prices wasnt available as i live in aberdeen ( aberdeen is not highlands !)
M	as my wife and i work full time i paid the extra money for the tv to be delivered on the saturday .
M	we sat inside all day waiting for the tv to arrive ( no approximate time is given ).
M	no tv arrived .
M	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
M	i was promised a call within_00hrs .
M	i waited the two days .
M	no tv arrived and i received no phone call .
M	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
M	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
M	again no delivery and i received no phone call .
M	i phoned
M	again and found out nothing , they had no_idea if the tv had been dispatched .
M	but this time i got an_email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce ... im still_waiting .....
M	after i submitted the review , i was contacted by a member of their management team and appologied to .
M	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
M	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower_price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
M	i was promised both of these refunds .
M	after waiting in all saturday again i received no tv !!!
M	i also received neither of the refunds .
M	avoid_avoid_avoid .
M	very good service , product was very well_priced and the delivery was very quick , cant ask for much more .
M	ordered twice in the space of a few_days .
M	both products excellent , delivered within two days and have been a fantastic upgrade to my ailing netgear homeplug kit .
M	fantastic service .
M	when other retails faltered over the hp pre0 debacle , cleverboxes won through .
M	fantastic service right from order , through to delivery .
M	highly_recommended .
M	was helped by sarah_hayes , she was quick with the information i needed , and was very helpful in sorting the query i had with my order .
M	many_thanks !
M	as always , awesome service & very quick delivery .
M	i always look at ocuk first when i ' m wanting new computer parts , as i know they have great customer_service & will have the item i ' m wanting at a good price .
M	only slight niggle , is that occasionally they ' re a couple of Â£ more_than competitors on some items , but once the free postage is taken into account ( i ' m an active member on the forums , so i also get free delivery ) it works out cheaper anyway , so i ' m happy enough :)
M	i love campus_gifts always find things for people as presents and the delivery is really quick .
M	and u can sometimes get a really good bargin when things go on sale !
M	best place to buy gifts !!!!
M	:-)
M	good product .. definatley reccomend to anyone to buy from you , will be buyi g more stuff once ive been paid again .. ;-) 0star !!
M	!
M	goods came as_described and in time .
M	0rd edit_:
M	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
M	because of the tone taken i asked to speak to [_name ]' s supervisor but he refused to do this .
M	it was very clear that [_name ] didn ' t have a clue regarding any of the account history and that he didn ' t believe a word i said on the phone .
M	so after countless emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
M	one to avoid .
M	so yet another example of chess ' s terrible customer_services and dodgy business_practices .
M	one to avoid 0 / 00 .
M	0nd edit_:
M	just a note to say that chess have been in touch again .
M	interestingly chess have decided to try and hold me to terms and conditions which i have never signed_up to or agreed to .
M	i signed_up through thevirtualnumbercompany and this website still says " no small_print " and " 00 days cancellation notice "
M	they claim that they have not received any of the numerous email that i have sent to them .
M	chess are amongst the most dishonest companies i have ever_encountered .
M	0 / 00 terrible company .
M	original text :
M	i became a chess telecom customer through the virtual phone number company around 00 months_ago .
M	i have two lines , one is a local number the other is an 0000 number .
M	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
M	they have consistently overcharged me line_rental and despite numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
M	their staff on the phone can see that i am being charged too much but cant understand_why or do anything about it .
M	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
M	having paid one month in_advance and being on a one month deal i don ' t owe them anything .
M	they owe me !
M	however as they can ' t even get the basic billing right i doubt i have any chance of getting the money they owe me !
M	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
M	i have cancelled the direct_debit with the bank but this hasn ' t deterred them .
M	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
M	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
M	yet it is they who owe me money !
M	so here the bottom_line .
M	if you choose chess they will overcharge you , they will ignore your emails and when you choose to leave they will_continue to bill you and threaten you .
M	0 / 00 from me .
M	terrible company .
M	edit .
M	: i have now been contacted by someone from chess telecom .
M	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn ' t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
M	another great example of chess telecoms terrible customer_service .
M	i should also add that a message has been left on the answering_machine asking me to call them up on a premium_rate number !
M	so again 0 / 00 terrible company .
M	having been a customer with ybs for a long time i always believed they were better_than the banks and that i could trust them .
M	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
M	when i tried to claim the money back using the direct_debit guarantee i found it wasn ' t worth the paper it was written on .
M	they refused to give a full and immediate refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
M	it wasn ' t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
M	if you are looking for a trust_worthy alternative to the high_street banks , the ybs isn ' t it .
M	sadly .
M	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
M	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
M	it soon turned_out that the akinika employee was being dishonest as they did not have information which hmrc have .
M	akinika claimed that i have been overpaid tax credits and that i have received and ignored a letter they have sent me .
M	neither is true .
M	the akinika staff refused to log the dispute and refused to investigate , they simply demand i make payment to them immediately .
M	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
M	akinika have a website but it doesn ' t list the companies registered address , or any address .
M	it doesn ' t list the companies registration details or status .
M	there is no provision to make a complaint .
M	this company doesn ' t care for normal uk trading laws or debt_collection regulations .
M	took 0 month payment in_advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
M	leaving us Â£_00 out of pocket .
M	after selling a product and receiving payment through paypal i shipped it confidently .
M	however when the buyer received it they decided they wanted it cheaper and paypal removed the whole amount from my account .
M	this meant i had no product and no money .
M	ebay just doesn ' t care about its customers .
M	it is geared up for handing disputes between buyers and sellers but when ebay gets it wrong you might as well talk to the wall .
M	just remember , the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
M	i ' m giving up on ebay because they keep ignoring me .
M	i always love buying from guitar bitz as they have a very fast method of getting my goods to me through interlink_express .
M	their website has a very nice layout which is easy to navigate and their 00 point check ensures any guitar i buy from them is immaculate .
M	they ' v got a life long customer in me .
M	bought my acer predator g0000 which arrived very quickly ( 0 days ).
M	i was consistantly notified via e_- mail and text on the were abouts of my product .
M	very happy with my product and the cheap deal i got .
M	having just sent off my second old phone and received my argos_voucher back in a couple of days i can highly_recommend this service !, very good communication by email , fast postage of both the pre paid bag and the payment voucher - mush faster_than the alternative of selling it yourself on a well_known auction site .
M	thanks !
M	great prices , good service , highly_recommended !
M	i came here for a specific shirt my sister told me about , and when i saw all of the other products i was very impressed .
M	i will_definitely come back again !
M	i bought a new car at the grimsby branch with a trade - in of my old car .
M	the process was very smooth , ran at my own_pace and carl middleton who looked after me answered any_questions i had .
M	he even answered my calls out of hours as i was often busy during the day , very impressed !
M	thanks again
M	i spent_ages searching for a very specific bag i wanted , and tactical - kit was the only uk supplier i came_across .
M	originally it was out of stock on the website , so i enquired when it will be back in stock .
M	i received a reply within half an_hour , and was notified that the staff had searched the warehouse and found a single one available for purchase .
M	i made further enquiries about the product , and each reply i got was within a few minutes of each other .
M	very pleased with the fast and very helpful feedback ( may i mention again that they searched the warehouse for it , instead of just giving me a " sorry no out of stock " like some other suppliers would ), i placed my order , and recieved it 0 days_later ( only chose basic delivery ).
M	great customer_service !
M	!
M	apart_from ordering , the site is fast , very clean looking and easy to navigate , with brown fonts overlayed on a dark background , very easy on the eyes and keeping that tactical theme without going overboard , plus no crappy flash animations to chug the site down or crash your browser .
M	everything is categorized with detailed_descriptions to ensure you know what you are getting .
M	they sell a wide_variety of stuff , from clothing , hiking gear , bags , lasers and optical sights , eye wear , plus many many more !
M	overall , very pleased with the fast communication and the fact they put some effort into checking whether the product was really out of stock .
M	would highly_recommend it as your one stop_shop for tactical goods .
M	on an extra note , like the reviewer below posted , stay clear from nightgear : dodgy folk they are , don ' t be_fooled by their flashy discounts and offers .
M	i have heard bad things about fitness first , but i decided to have a look for myself .
M	on first_impressions , fitness first seemed very basic .
M	truth be told they were renovating some areas , but still it seemed quite subpar .
M	i enquired_about membership details , and was briefed by one of the staff .
M	i wasn ' t shown around the area for some reason , so the actual conditions and facilities remained a mystery to me .
M	since i would soon be travelling abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest_mistake .
M	fast forward a week_later , i was packing for holiday when my phone rang .
M	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
M	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
M	i politely told him that i was currently busy packing for holiday and would like to talk more about this when i return to the uk , however he was not willing to accept this and continued to talk about the membership plan .
M	i then politely told him a second time that i was busy packing , to which he rudely hung_up on me mid sentence , which i have to say really irritated me .
M	00_minutes later , my phone blared at me again , another person from fitness first with the same intentions .
M	whilst he wasn ' t as rude as the previous person , it was at this point i ended_up blocking the phone number from contacting me directly ever again .
M	will i ever get to finish packing today ??
M	i could imagine a queue of fitness first staff just waiting to turn my phone into a christmas_tree .
M	never again will i want to associate with fitness first and their etiquettes , like a bunch of obnoxious school kids waiting in line at a sweet shop to pester the cashier .
M	in short , i really cannot recommend fitness first to anyone and would advise people to not even bother enquiring_about joining .
M	if the staff are that rude and persistent to a potential curious new member to their gym , i dread to think the treatment i will receive upon becoming an actual member , and that ' s forgetting all the bad stories i ' ve heard .
M	i was looking for a decent mechanical pencil for drawing and came_across a particular brand i liked ( staedtler 000 00 to be exact ), so off to google it was , and cult_pens was the first answer to pop up .
M	what striked me first was the presentation as everything is clean , very fast loading and extremely easy to navigate , you will have no problem whatsoever finding exactly_what you want within a few seconds as everything is organised into subsections , instead of being bunched up together like most other_sites do .
M	there is plenty of information about their products , and in some_cases a drop down menu to specify different colours , lead sizes , quantity , etc .
M	fantastic !
M	also there is a " pencyclopedia ," a section devoted to everything about pens and pencils , all the fancy technical do - das and what pen is best for what purpose .
M	the information i found was extremely useful and helped_me not only decide on my purchase , but reassure me these people are passionate_about pens and aren ' t in it soley for the money .
M	oh and of course there is a massive_range of pens , pencils , rulers , rubbers , leads and stuff from many different companies and perhaps even a rare item or two .
M	plus free uk delivery on orders over Â£_00 , how could one refuse !
M	i didn ' t , and i recieved my mechanical pencil next_day , plus a free gift to boot .
M	very happy about my experience with them .
M	it ' s very rare i ' d buy from a site without reading a review about them first , but i made an exception with cult_pens within 00_minutes of browsing and wasn ' t dissapointed .
M	clean easy to navigate site , massive_range of drawing utensils , the pencyclopedia explaining everything about pens and pencils , and the feeling that these people are here to help and not to clean out your wallet .
M	only thing i think could be improved is have the pencyclopedia section easier to find for newcomers , perhaps listed clearly on the home page , apart_from that everything else is perfect .
M	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i ' ve ever had .
M	having never eaten there before , i was excited to try out their menu , but my eagerness soon turned to utter dissapointment .
M	first and last time i ' ll ever go there .
M	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
M	when we were finally allowed to sit_down in one of the darkened corners of the restaurant , the staff_member took his sweet time in finding menus for us , which actually was just the beginning of this painfully_slow service .
M	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .
M	no_idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn ' t that long to wait ... had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
M	the starters took 00_minutes to arrive , and the nacho - things we ordered where actually moist and tasted stale , and it was barely warm and didn ' t taste great .
M	it was at this point when i realised i needed to get out of here , but we still waited for the rest of our meal .
M	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
M	and even then , it wasn ' t even hot , just luke warm .
M	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
M	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no_idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can ' t take that long to cook ?
M	sure enough , we weren ' t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
M	i couldn ' t be bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
M	well , thank_god it all came to an end and as i left , i muttered " i can ' t wait to get out of here " to one of the tables as we were leaving .
M	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
M	being involved in the food industry myself ( just as a regular chef mind you , not a managerial expert so don ' t think i ' m a know - it - all ), i can ' t help but mention that there are so many things wrong with chiquitos , especially with the professionalism of the staff , i ' m baffled they still remain in business .
M	unfortunately the experience was so bad i started using the chiquitos word to describe things i dislike , albeit with slightly mispelt letters to rhyme with a certain naughty word .
M	i ' d definately_recommend to everyone to avoid chiquitos at all cost to prevent utter dissapointment and a waste of money .
M	like i said , first and last time i ' ll go there .
M	i ' ve brought from shopto . net a fair few_times , it was highly_recommended by a friend and i can see why .
M	free p_& p and decent prices compared to retail shop prices , plus fast delivery and excellent customer_service .
M	one time the postman nicked my game , and i emailed shopto . net for a replacement , and i got a reply within the hour and it was all dealt_with the very same day i emailed , which i thought was brilliant .
M	just thought i ' d point that out as most companies take an aeon and a half to reply emails ( if at all ) so i do really apprecieate the support staff getting back to me quickly and professionally .
M	thanks alot :_d
M	i ' d highly_recommend shopto . net if you ' re doing your shopping online , they also do alot of deals from time to time , and they got a loyalty system ( which i have yet to venture into ).
M	booked a last_minute budget stag_do through chillisauce , the website was easy to browse and look at various activities , and even easier to sort out who was coming and who had paid etc .
M	the go - karting itself was brilliant fun on the day and everything was ready for our arrival .
M	it was enjoyed by everyone even the cuts , grazes and bruises !
M	thanks alot
M	this was my first hostel stay ever , and i was almost disappointed by how nice this was ( because i was looking_forward to a bit of an ' experience ').
M	the room was nicer_than most hotel rooms i ' ve been in , with the exception that we had two nice roommates from portugal .
M	and i couldn ' t believe_how cheap it was .
M	i ' d highly_recommend this place for a comfortable stay in prague , and the location was great !
M	after seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
M	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
M	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
M	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
M	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
M	order no 00000
M	i ' ve ordered from bbw several_times now and the delivery always comes either the very next_day or the day after ( depending what time i order ) .
M	even at christmas the delivery was really fast
M	their customer_service is top as well .
M	always replying to me via_email within a few hours , if not faster , and answering me on twitter in about 00_mins .
M	good quality products at really good prices and they really know their stuff
M	great if everything goes_smoothly but if they mess up they just ignore you .
M	even when you do get a reply to an_email and you reply back to them again , they ' ll ignore you for about a week or 0
M	didn ' t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
M	after waiting on the phone for over half an_hour i went through to an agent that muted their headset , they accidently took it off mute and i said " i know someone ' s there because you just took me off mute " then they hung_up the phone .
M	ended_up cancelling the order .
M	but yet they still sent it out 0 days_later ( it now being 0 day since it should have been delivered ).
M	this all happened at the end of june and i ' ve only just got my refund today .
M	absolutely_shocking service , and in my opinion , unreasonable delivery charges , will never use them again .
M	bodybuildingwarehouse is cheaper with free delivery and same quality .
M	they also maintain contact with customers , even speaking to me on twitter .
M	i ' ve had friend who have also had lots of problems with my protein and it ' s took them months to get refunds and have things rectified
M	i just needed a shaker_cup and i ended_up getting like 00 samples and some products that are about to expire for like $ 0 .
M	the shipping was about $_00 but it was well worth it .
M	great service - i would recommend this company to anyone .
M	my campaigns have had excellent results !
M	i recently ordered a kimono from lovekimono for my girlfriend â_s birthday , and she absolutely loved it .
M	i wasn â t exactly sure which design to choose , so sent the guys at lovekimono an_email to see if they could help .
M	they were more_than happy to help me with their latest designs , and i ended_up choosing the miley kimono in grey for her .
M	the product came in next to no time at all , and it arrived beautifully_packaged ( which was good for me as i â m useless when it comes to wrapping presents !).
M	needless to say , my girlfriend now won â t stop wearing it !
M	i highly_recommend every_aspect of lovekimono â great customer_service , great product and great quality !
M	this was my first time using the valet parking and i would definitely use it again .
M	great service , easy to drop_off and even easier to pick_up when i returned .
M	just what you need after a long tiring flight !
M	shopto are my number 0 choice for buying games .
M	excellent prices and outstanding delivery service .
M	guaranteed next_day delivery is just awesome .
M	ive bought tons from them and they never fail .
M	great site !
M	i was a bit_hesitant at first to use cj ' s cd_keys , but now i ' m unsure why .
M	i have bought four titles off here now , 0 for steam and 0 for origin , and they have worked flawlessley every time .
M	it ' s also nearly always the cheapest place to find them as well , and since discovering this place for big name games , i can save myself a lot of cash .
M	thanks cjs
M	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
M	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has been left in a secure place ( why couldn ' t you knock on the door ?)
M	so now after contacting customer_service i need to go print a form off and then send it back to them to get my items resent or refunded .
M	i don ' t have a printer in my house so it means i ' m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn ' t open till tuseday when my funeral is .
M	all in all boohoo have just added a bunch of stress on to a very stressful time .
M	i will never shop with you again .
M	got sent the wrong phone returned it told i would be given a new handset free of charge 0 weeks_later still no phone !
M	to now be told that its not in the notes bunch of lying twats !

M	great prices , very fast delivery , well ( but sensibly ) packaged and most_important of all , good quality products .
M	ordered the inov0 00l race pro via facewest .
M	delivery was quick , but unfortunatly the backpack was too big ( for my purpose ).
M	refund from facewest without any_problems !
M	i ' d happily_recommend them !
M	all together easy experience .
M	search options helped_us find the hostel we were looking fast fast and efficiently .
M	booking process itself was seemless .
M	would recommend to everyone .
M	feito como cobinado
M	avoid !
M	!
M	i ordered flowers , registered my details ( including mobile and email ) and received order confirmation .
M	the order was for the following_day , for my 00 year_old grandmas birthday ; no delivery took place and no notification of attempted delivery was left .
M	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
M	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer_service i ' ve ever_experienced .
M	was very happy with the service provided got my order very quickly and am very very happy with the results
M	thankyou .
M	cheap price but good product , and quick delivery time , so all_round good
M	i have bought many items and they have all been good and fast delivery aswell
M	easy website , sharp service and speedy_delivery .
M	great selection and best pricing anywhere .
M	i highly_recommend if you are looking for a safe , fast and cheap transfer of your money !
M	i ordered my prescription sports glasses from rxsports , mainly because they had the best prices for the model i wanted and also because i found their website easy to use .
M	order was handled professionally and delivered within a week .
M	amazing prices and they beat the competitions pricing ?
M	what more could you sk for ?
M	such a great selection and i love the closeouts deals !
M	thanks for helping me turn into the animal i strive to become !
M	will_definitely use again , always a great service !
M	always use parcel0go , easy to use website , great service and always sort any probs very quickly and effectively .
M	i made a mistake on my order but didn ' t notice this until i had paid for it .
M	i thought never mind i ' ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
M	i cancelled it within 0 mins of placing it , then ordered the correct items on a seperate order only later to be told the order had already been processed and could not be cancelled ( why not ?
M	i clearly hadn ' t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
M	so my order couldn ' t be cancelled .
M	two days_later i receive duplicate orders , and items i did not want .
M	i contacted my protein to return the items only to be told i would have to meet the cost of returning them .
M	an_absolute_disgrace i believe since they failed to prevent the items i didn ' t want been sent in the first place .
M	this was a totally_unacceptable circumstance and my protein have just lost a good customer over this !
M	!
M	no_problems with buying points or xbox memberships .
M	it ' s cheaper_than through the console and your code is emailed within 0min .
M	paypal is added buyer security too !
M	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
M	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
M	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
M	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
M	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
M	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
M	( this should be their job )
M	i did offer for them to credit note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
M	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
M	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
M	i found it easy , quick and convenient to use tempcover and i had no_problems to speak of and the price was decent so overall i would reccomend .
M	personally i had no_problems my product arrived prompt and i didnt have to contact customer_services
M	product i wanted was 00 Â£ cheaper on here than what the vet wanted , free economy delivery , got my product , no_problems .
M	would definitely use again and recommend .
M	i have ordered from patrolstore twice and i will again as they always get the goods to you quickly and with no hassle .
M	plus they stock lots of good stuff at good prices .
M	not cheap knock - offs either !
M	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 Â£ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
M	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
M	you pay peanuts , you get monkeys .
M	supplementwarehouse . com has the greatest sales of any online supplement website .
M	i just bought a product from them that was on sale to $ 0 . 00 , it was $_00 . 00 !
M	all other_sites i looked at , their sale price was actually higher_than the normal price for this product on supplementwarehouse . com .
M	it is very easy and also cheap .
M	every backpackers must look this site .
M	if you love your pocket you also love hostelbookers =))
M	i have used supplement_warehouse many_times now and i love it .
M	it has the best prices and all the brend name products out there .
M	i will never stop useing it .
M	i also love all the free_stuff with every order .
M	this company has disgusting customer_service i receive an_email_saying my order has been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink shop to which the receptionist who has no_idea about customer_service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an_email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
M	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer_service . issues
M	they kept me updated at all times by e_- mail , text and phone .
M	ordered on thursday and was delivered on sunday .
M	it was delivered first thing in the morning and the delivery men were helpful and polite .
M	would definately buy from this company again .
M	phones0cash is so simple and easy to use , no need to search everywhere to sell your phone you just go onto phones0cash and its all there for you .
M	phones0cash also gives me reviews on new phones so when my upgrade is due i can choose a phone from the help of phones0cash .
M	i recommend phones0cash to all my friends and they all come back and thank me .
M	very happy with the service and product selection .
M	we were ordering a number of hard disks ( 00 +); i found these to be the best price and selection around , the website was easy and quick to use and delivery took only 0 days .
M	really impressed and would use again for business or personal shopping .
M	all i can say is thanks to bratislava stags for one the best weekends away any of use had .
M	the hotel was fantastic and if you can mange to get up for breakfast it â_s a great hangover cure .
M	the city was brilliant and the beer was so cheap they were nearly giving it away .
M	0 hours in one bar drinking pints and vodka red bulls came to about l00 each .
M	can ' t recommend the full shooting package enough , something everyone should try at_least once in their life .
M	but would suggest not doing it with a hang over !!
M	!
M	the pub_crawl was we organised and thanks to the kristina for keeping use together and then apparently saving me from a beating from a group of bouncers ( at trafo night club ) for being far to drunk .
M	very much_appreciated !
M	!
M	i went into specsavers and the range of glasses available was woeful .
M	i went to vision_express and the cost of the frames was over priced .
M	glasses_direct bridged the gap perfectly .
M	the ability to try before you buy for free completely erased my concerns with purchasing online .
M	order number : 000a000000
M	i strongly_recommend that you avoid purchasing a bed with dreams .
M	i spent nearly Â£ 0 , 000 on a bed with dreams in january .
M	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
M	as part of the order we paid Â£_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden frame bed for them to collect .
M	as the day went on i thought i had better chase dreams on a time for the delivery .
M	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
M	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
M	i have a 0 month pregnant partner who was in a situation where we have to sleep on the floor for the final 0 months of the pregnancy .
M	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
M	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly half a year for a delivery .
M	0 weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
M	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
M	so far i have paid nearly Â£ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven â t received and nearly Â£_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
M	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new born baby ).
M	dreams offered my Â£_000 of vouchers in compensation .
M	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered Â£_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don â t feel they deserve any sale from me .
M	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
M	please avoid at all costs .
M	yours ,
M	dan
M	you can do international transfers direct to a bank_account , quickly , with very low fees , at a very good exchange_rate .
M	just couple of clicks and all done from your home and no bothering going to the bank or western_union or all this money transfer companies .
M	just 0 to 0 days ... normally its even quicker_than that .
M	and the customer_service support it is very good as well which makes azimo 0_stars company .
M	dont change !
M	the training they provide is really helpful and in - depth .
M	i only used to use photoshop for designing mocks for people ( mainly teens ) on an amatuer site , nw i ' m helping my company with their graphics design board in marketing - its really opened up a lot of doors for me !
M	regards ,
M	james atkinson
M	the prices are great on this site , delivery was very speedy to the point i had made other orders from different places a few_days before but my alcohol from here was quickest .
M	the items came in very good packaging making_sure my stuff was safe and will recommend this site
M	i ordered my camera , lense and sd_card on monday and it was delivered on thursday using the free shipping option .
M	communication of the order process was excellent too .
M	i was kept fully up to date with right up to the point of dispatch .
M	amazing experience , easy to compare locations , and cheaper_than the competitors .
M	that ' s all you need to know about hostel_bookers .
M	i have ordered several_times from sw . com and will not enter a gnc or other venue .
M	the shipping is correct and on time .
M	no where else can i find a free_shaker everytime i order .
M	i have recommended this site to friends and will_continue to order from them .
M	have ordered products from this company quite a few_times .
M	they really deliver well .
M	there prices are brilliant .
M	packaged well
M	sticks to the order schedule and most of time orders are way early !
M	!
M	just an awesome drum site !!!
M	!
M	if you want stuff quick for a gig / tour this is the shop for you !
M	first time i have used these_guys as it was by_far the best price , with other cd_key companies i have been waiting around four a couple of hours for the key to come through , not this time emailed it to me instantly , will_definitely be using again
M	sent off phone friday , had email confirmation monday for full_amount and had the cheque wednesday , couldn ' t ask for anything more
M	even with free super_saver delivery , my order arrived 0 days_later .
M	contents all correct ... time to notch my training up a level with my new supplies
M	ordered my new headphones around lunchtime , and was using them less_than 00hours later .
M	good price , speedy service , and received updates via_email on progress of my order .
M	would definitely_recommend .
M	highly_recommended , great prices and quick delivery !
M	if there ever was a perfect retailer , this is it .
M	pre_- ordered a game 0 months before it came out , at the ridiculously_cheap price of Â£_00 and it came the day before_release .
M	a ++++++
M	i ordered the indian man costume from allfancydress . com and it arrived very quickly .
M	the cost of the costume was great and it fit_perfectly too .
M	the site was easy to use and understand and i would definitely use them again .
M	all_round brilliant site .
M	i found dino_pc during a good search when i was planning a new pc .
M	after spending hours putting_together a spec on various different websites and it being way too overpriced dino_pc was by_far cheaper and extremely reasonably_priced .
M	when i had confirmed my order a couple of days_later i decided to email them and ask for priority shipping after 0 days within the hour i received a call from alan from their customer_services ( nice bloke ) and we completed the extra payment over the phone .
M	i received an_email on the friday informing_me my order would be shipped later than planned but i had already expected it to be a bit later as it was coming up to the weekend .
M	i got my dispatch email yesterday from both dino_pc and the courier and it arrived this morning directly on time !
M	it was packaged extremely well , all of the necessary items were in the motherboard box and upon_opening the case the components were secured very well and the cable_management was brilliant .
M	i installed my os as soon as i plugged the beauty in and am typing this review in my new computer .
M	thanks dino_pc , i will reuse your service in the future and recommend you to all of my friends when they decide to upgrade !
M	as a frequent flyer , between lhr - hkg .
M	i normally book my flight with american_express , i had to make a three booking to hong_kong to attend my grandma ' s funeral in april , flying during easter holiday season .
M	the flight on amex & comparison_websites were around Â£ 0000 -Â£ 0000 per_person , crystal_travel managed to find me a flight with qatar_airways for Â£_000 .
M	i had a dedicated agent , the agent was effective and speedy dealing_with my booking , and i had a direct line i could call anytime .
M	i couldn ' t thank_you enough for your support and i would definitely_recommend this agency and make all my future booking with them .
M	i was rather ambivalent about the company as i had never_heard of however i could not resist the price difference , i made my order for wow : mists of pandaria .
M	for a great price Â£_00 cheaper_than blizzard and amazon asked for .
M	my product arrived on time a few_days_later without issue .
M	a little more information on their website regarding products ( pc games especially due to the requirements of some games ) could be given however i can otherwise find no issues with this company .
M	i have been liaising with ameer on a number of projects over the last six_months or so , every request was followed to the " t ".
M	when asked to call back in 0 months away , they did exactly that .
M	no pressure selling , constructive and laid back approach is a breath of fresh_air in the modern day competitive market .
M	in fairness i was sold on the first contact but wasnt quite ready to launch , there was no pressuring and once back in touch as requested , we were up and running in no time .
M	the designer sam followed every request through without complaint and was incredibly patient when showing me how to edit my site .
M	both really nice guys who seemed to want my business to perform well , im glad they found me and shared their service , which is that well operated you do genuinely feel you are there only customer and they have no one else to do anything for !, as everything is responded to so quickly .
M	thanks guys , looking_forward to the next project !
M	super_speedy and good value !
M	really quick friendly one million out off one million .
M	highly_recomend using this company
M	i ' ve lost_count how many issues i ' ve had with city_link .
M	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don ' t leave a card when attempting delivery , it ' s like they expect us to be mind readers !
M	i bought an xperia play from foniacs last_week , which was featured on a deal website at a fantastic price .
M	the questions i had about the product before ordering was answered_quickly by their customer_services .
M	i placed my order at 0pm , product was dispatched at 0pm , and delivered to me the next_day .
M	the best online shopping_experience i ' ve had so far !
M	great rates and very simple online dealing platform .
M	transparant in the way they display fees and charges
M	having done my research on a couple money transfer comparison_sites including mycurrencytransfer . com i came_across fxfirm .
M	initially i was skeptical as they arent a household name like moneycorp or currencies direct .
M	however , the service i recieved was fabulous and saved an_absolute fortune .
M	it is well worth shopping around for the best deal
M	they took 0 days to dispatch a special delivery ( which cost 00 pound )
M	fast and cheap
M	they dispatched my order the same day i ordered and gave me a Â£_00 voucher for free .
M	i received my product the next_day and the quality is fantastic .
M	it has been 0 years now and we have used parcels0go regular each week .
M	we can send upto 00 parcels a week with them .
M	if i need any help they are always there on live_chat like sarah who i have just spoken to , to arrange change of address .
M	with having lot of customers our selves there are one or two parcels over the years that might get damaged or lost but as soon as i give the relevant info i have always had a good offer on return .
M	i have used the drop and collect service and was happy ( until yodel took over ) now i am using hermes again and never had a failed collection or any_problems with them .
M	i would high recommend these and all these people that don ' t you must be doing something wrong .
M	again thank_you to parcels0go for a great service
M	what can i say , an excellent little company , good quality stock , friendly staff who went above and beyond to help me when i had an issue and prompt delivery .
M	if you ever need garden_furniture then head there , my bench has pride of place in my garden .
M	keep up the good work !!
M	!
M	they let me have an upgrade 0 months early
M	excellent company
M	absolute_rip_off !!
M	!
M	i used last_year with no_problems ,
M	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
M	still_hasn ' t come and they ' ve not answered my calls or e_- mails
M	avoid
M	i am a big_fan of pens and came_across this shop , and bought a lamy pen , the service was quick and easy and received my pen the next_day .
M	overall great experience with this company .
M	ordered from here was the wrong item , fault was mine .
M	called them up they sorted out problem instantly .
M	sent back using free - post provided then received correct item very next_day .
M	whole_process was perfect and fast .
M	excellent service !!!
M	!
M	very fast service sent phone received money 0 days after by_far the fastest payment ive received from any mobile selling site
M	great will use again .
M	no other supplement site has the selection , service , and price that meets my needs .
M	thank_you so much sw
M	very happy with purchase , great customer_service experiance and everything arrived as expected very well_packaged !
M	thanks .
M	apart_from the fact the cia is probably monitoring the whole website , it works really well !
M	it really is so easy to book through these_guys .
M	they don ' t charge any commision ( not sure how they make their money ) but its truly simple to do , and i think it ' s only 00_% u have to pay and then u can cancel within 00_hours or something like that .
M	don ' t know the specifics but for places like south_east asia where it ' s only $ 0 for a private_room you can ' t go_wrong .
M	i have used this website many_times before , and have always found good places with it .
M	i like the rating_system and the ability to order by price and rating .
M	there doesn ' t appear to be many listings in laos , but that might have to do with the fact there are pretty_much only private_rooms and twin_rooms here .
M	my order from ccl was fast , cheap and hassle_free .
M	well worth ordering with ccl .
M	ordered a north_face gillet and it came ahead of schedule on the free delivery service and was in perfect_condition .
M	would recommend them to anyone .
M	just_eat is an innovative concept that helps take_aways work better and to keep the customer satisfied , never has a take away been judge only by word of mouth , with just_eat you can look at reviews of other customers and decide yourself if its worth paying for .
M	issues can be sorted very easily by contacting the just_eat team , by ordering takeaways online it solves the issue of repeating your order or address 0 times due to the lack of understanding from the take away , have no money handy , problem solved by using your debit_card .
M	just_eat has changed the away the british order take_aways , no stocking up on menu ' s , there all located in one handy site , the only recommendation i could give is just_eat needs to show the takeaways food hygiene score , other than that just_eat do an amazing job , they are trust_worthy , honest and outstanding , pure brilliance and idiot_proof .
M	mazuma is very fast dealing_with your order , it takes about 0 days for your pack to arrive then once its sent off next_day recorded , your money is in your account the same day it arrives if you use bank_transfer , no_problems and ive used them 0 times , ive used other_sites in the past and none have been this good , i would use mazuma again and again .
M	excellent customer_service query answered by samantha in super_quick time .
M	would def use this service again
M	title_says it all - i would recommend red_hot sunglasses to anyone .
M	i like seo , webdesign services ..
M	nice one it related website .
M	in my life , i get best services for fireworks for sale from edinburgh fireworks store .
M	i like this .
M	excellent services for wedding fireworks . i like this .
M	they did not have the type of ram i wanted in their shop , i asked them if they could stock what i needed , and they did in around one week time .
M	great communication , product and delivery as_described .
M	absolutely excellent , they offer a really good product and i can_assure you they keep their word with the guarantees , my battery failed , i sent it back and two days_later a brand_new battery turned_up , if i need a battery again for another car this is 000_% the place i will go !
M	hassle_free , great customer_service , excellent !
M	good valution on phones and good fast process
M	sent the phone away late but still received the money the next_day !
M	highly_recommend :)
M	been trying to reach scottish_power for 0 days now .
M	they don ' t have any advisers at all !
M	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
M	is there anyone in their customer_service center ?
M	company is a joke .
M	believe me the first thing i will do when i do finally get through is cancel my policy .
M	always fast and prices are so low i don ' t bother looking elsewhere anymore .
M	great for feeding larger dogs .
M	they also only stock high_quality products which they recommend themselves .
M	great guys .
M	will be using these again !
M	received item in good order , thank_you again
M	great products ; great prices ; fast , easy , secure checkout ; and best of all fast and accurate delivery !
M	suck it gnc !
M	every day is gold_card day at supplementwarehouse . com !
M	this was my first experience with cjs_keys and i have to say , although i was a bit_sceptical at first , the experience was fantastic and i ' ll definitely be using them again .
M	they are 000_% legit , no_hidden agendas and simply an awesome service .
M	i had my key within 0 minutes of paying via_paypal and was playing the black_ops 0 within the hour .
M	with a good internet_connection to download the games buying the keys & the huge_savings is a no - brainer for your next purchase .
M	great products with speedy shipping , can ' t fault them !
M	great selection of papers , fast postage , nothing to fault there !
M	just ordered some kids headphones .
M	good site with loads of info .
M	product arrived next_day with a free lollipop in the packaging .
M	email_updates_throughout the process .
M	would highly_recommend !
M	great site with a lot of variety and reputable brands .
M	prices are generally the lowest on the internet , even with e_- bay .
M	shipping is per order and not necessarily per item which is nice too .
M	easy set_up , can access my documents , music , films etc , anywhere using any device .
M	brilliant piece of kit , but it did take 0 days to transfer everything over initially , but definitely worth it .
M	i decided to make the switch from halogen to led x 00 bulbs and got all the advice i needed from rob to make the right decision with no sales nonsense , very much_appreciated .
M	good service / prices , staff available on the phone to help in person
M	i bought a wowcher for a hotel stay in dumfries a few weeks_ago .
M	called the hotel to check availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
M	great or so i thought .
M	i called up to book on sunday with some dates we could manage .
M	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
M	?. i was not told this the first time .
M	i contacted_wowcher as now that 00 days have past i ' m going to lose Â£_00 due to me only being allowed to claim 00_% as a credit and not the full_amount .
M	ive heard_nothing back from them .
M	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
M	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway ... says a lot really !
M	!
M	the product was very cheap for the services it provides and when i called student_computers , instead of flogging off their more_expensive items , they directed me towards this cheaper version which actually was better in performance .
M	the delivery was extremely quick , seeing as i paid nothing for it .
M	all in all i think this company and product was a brilliant find .
M	just got a dell d000 from val u computers and had great service .
M	the laptop is in great condition and seems to be all in working order and as stated .
M	great company to deal with and will be ordering again soon for a second laptop for son .
M	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it â_s only gone wrong once .
M	but it went really wrong !
M	i rarely need proper next_day delivery but as luck would have it ; that â_s the one that went sour .
M	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait away .
M	friday came and went and .
M	nothing .
M	i called dhl , which was a real hassle ( they have no uk customer_service number , so i ended_up dialling â international sales â and asked them to put me through ), they said that i wasn â t in , which i was , and they need the number off the card to rearrange delivery , i had no card .
M	anyway after a huge ordeal i got it re - delivered on the monday , no good to me at all ; and never got any kind of refund on the service !
M	crap .
M	but that â_s one bad_experience nestled in amongst a great many good ones !
M	very fast delivery service , the staff are also incredibly_helpful and knowledgeable .
M	made the order for collection , realised our printer didn ' t work , contacting the company via the livehelp , and was assisted extremely quickly by jessica ( which , apparently is her real name ), who sorted everything out for us in around a minute !
M	i travel 0 - 0 time per_month ... and i always use hostelbookers to find my hostels ....
M	i also used hostel_world .. hostelclub .. booking . com etc ... but i for me hostelbookers :.
M	is the best .
M	i never payed any booking_fee whit hostel_bookers .. i also found hostels more cheap here than in other website .. so this is good ..
M	the reviews are always uploaded .. i remember i had some question about a hostel .. so i wrote to hostel_bookers staff and they answered me in a shot time .. they was really nice ..
M	i will always use hostelbookers ... simply the best ... also nice a easy to use their website .. fabio orlando
M	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
M	top draw .
M	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i â ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
M	they rope you in with great prices , but expect to get what you pay for when things go_wrong .
M	the on - hold times are horrendous , and the staff treat you like idiots , with no real enthusiasm for problem solving .
M	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
M	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
M	either that or to buy myself out of the contract â¦.
M	including a Â£_000 bill for the youview_box .
M	no chance .
M	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
M	except 0 weeks after the â go live â date , we still had no service .
M	it must have taken 0 phone_calls and over 0 hours of my time just to persuade them to send an engineer out .
M	there is only so many_times your intelligence can be insulted .
M	â have you tried switching the router on and off again â jesus man , i â m not an imbecile , of course i â ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
M	so lots of hassle later , 0 talktalk engineers later ( 0 never turned_up which we are being charged for â whole other story ) and 0 bt engineer later â¦â¦ 0 weeks have passed â we have internet and phone !
M	huzzah !
M	of course , the talktalk rules are i must pay my bill regardless if i â m receiving a service , or they won â t fix the line because of an outstanding_balance in arrears .
M	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn â t receiving .
M	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i â ve had no service for 0 weeks and am requesting compensation .
M	â not a problem â they say , â we can offer you â¦â¦ urmmm , the computer system says , erm â¦.. Â£ 0 . 00 â you can imagine my response .
M	â five pounds and fifty pence ?!
M	you mean Â£_00 ?
M	is that a joke ?!
M	use some logic man , i pay Â£_00 . 00 a month , i â ve had 0 weeks of no service , how you can offer me Â£ 0 . 00 ?
M	to date , we are on phone call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
M	the most_recent offer was Â£_00 â¦......â¦ an_absolute insult .
M	i ' ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
M	:)
M	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we ' ve had , and your response was to delete it .
M	cheers then , you pirates .
M	the guys were very helpful .
M	thanks
M	i ordered some bouquets on mothers_day itself and requested them by phone to do same day delivery .
M	they promised they would try and they did deliver .
M	m happy !
M	!
M	i had to go to india in 0 days and on a request , they sent my package in special delivery without any extra_charges .
M	the package was with me within 0 hrs of ordering .
M	this is how service should be .
M	special thanks to ms . gill .
M	these_guys are great , i ' ve been buying stuff from them for a few_years now and never had any problem .. really first mail order ..
M	i had my tickets at a very good price and they were very quick with booking and delivery which made me very happy and a satisfied customer !
M	i would definatly recommend people to use this company !
M	nice feature on the left , scrolling through price range .
M	fantastic - would defo_recommend .
M	very cheap and reliable
M	such a cheap and easy wine that they don ' t even tell you the grape its made with ( i think its nero d ' avola but i couldn ' t swear to it ) but this is one of the nicest wines i have had in ages .
M	absolutely_gorgeous and it ' s really really cheap too .
M	full_marks from me !
M	this was so cheap , i was really pleased with the price and my order came almost_immediately .
M	generally very happy , i will be definitely using them again .
M	this is an amazing store can pretty_much get anything from here the communication is good and have helped_me out with parts a few time
M	such a fantastic store if you need anything from camping to airsoft or some hard wearing boots this is the place to go . and the delivery options are outstanding . the customer_service is fast and reliable .
M	walking into ss00 is like walking into a heaven made as it should be .
M	there ain ' t no wings and angels , but there are boards and dudes .
M	the staff are like family , and make you feel_like part of that family .
M	yeah , i quite like the place .
M	a brilliant bunch of highly focused seo experts with a real go and achieve it attitude ..
M	this company will go places
M	... say ' s it all really
M	order was perfect , delivered on time and correctly .
M	n0
M	nothing bad to say about this purchase both codes were delivered instantly and both worked_perfectly .
M	great service at an amazing price !
M	i literally can ' t complain_about the service scan have provided for me , ( admittedly i do not have the misfortune to need to return or rma anything ).
M	the order was picked , packed , and shipped within 0 mins of paying for the sa000 and arrived between the arranged 0 hour time_slot allocated to me by dpd .
M	i also received update emails upon completion of each of the steps as well as one to inform me of the allocated slot .
M	all in all this was a very pleasant , informative , and event free transaction , one that id be more_than happy to repeat .
M	the website in general is very helpful , and has the most useful feature of any hostel website i ' ve used .
M	the tags at the side detailing facilities is perfect to glance over at , and the layout is informative and logical , if a little cramped .
M	making the actual booking was extremely quick , and i didn ' t have to go through 00 different pages worth of forms , just a pop - up box where i put in the payment basics and then done !
M	booked !
M	confirmation page pops up and email is sent out .
M	just in terms of constructive criticism , the website itself is sized quite small , leaving a huge_amount of white space on the right hand size of the screen ( on all pcs i ' ve visited it on ), and also it would be helpful if the actual hostel ' s contact details were clearly on display on their respective pages .
M	overall easy and efficient experience , would recommend .
M	chris is a brilliant bloke , told him what was wrong with my console and he knew_exactly_what needed to be done .
M	his prices are very good aswell for what you get .
M	in 0 hour he fixed , tested , serviced and cleaned my ps0 .
M	gave me a call when it was all done .
M	you also get 0 months guarantee on the repair .
M	friendly guy , honest and genuine .
M	i would use him again and have recommended him already to family and friends who are going to contact him very soon .
M	keep up the good work chris and thanks for help .
M	omar
M	the book is really nice but i wasn ' t impressed with the quality of the photos in the photobook .
M	i have the same photos done in a photobook from photobox and the quality from them was brilliant , no pixels at all .
M	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
M	regards
M	best game our there and it is legit and it can be tasky game but it is very very good at trying new stuff out you can even pay for your sub with virtual money and its a great game to get addicted to now like wow
M	0 star
M	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit
M	best place if you want to go somewhere any other can fuck off
M	its ok but i wouid just shop for it
M	best shipping company out there they get it in the next_day if your lucky :)
M	very good flights fast and cheap this service is advised especially going to gran_canaria
M	very good place to harbour electronic equipment it has it all tv ' s game consoles wireing for computers and are cheap you can buy dvd players blueray and all_sorts
M	i got my graphics_card then suddenly i realised it was water cooled the engineer and me parent was there and we never installed it we took it back 00 Â£ for delivery back they told us it was fried and already used we didnt use it for a second it was in a diffrent box aswell a 000 this one was 000 gtx when it got took back we had already used another one a gtx_000 this one isnt working either and they are not even refunding the water cooled one and say we used it they even said they sent us an_email but that was a trick to keep us occupied these are not eligible i wouid highly not reccomend this service at all !
M	ordered the last two flight cases from this company and the service has been fantastic .
M	my first flight case was for a marshall jam 000 , delivered in good time and excellent build_quality .
M	when i upgraded my head i returned to this company for a second time but have had some problems with the measurements due to the manufacturers of my amp not providing the correct ones .
M	as i measured the head myself , i made a couple of mistakes , and have had to return the case a couple of times .
M	however , the guys here have really helped_me with this and have been very patient and have resolved this problem for me .
M	awesome work guys i ' ll be shopping here again for sure !
M	great weekend , no issues , no faults , outstanding !
M	it pays you significantly more_than any other company , and it ' s simple , easy , and free to post your old_phones .
M	never had a problem and quick payment too !
M	would definitely_recommend .
M	onlinekeystore is simply the best online store with great prices , great games and great service .
M	don ' t go elsewhere they have everything you need !
M	had no_problems booking , everything went fine and quickly .
M	website is easy to understand and has very quick loading times .
M	recommended !
M	i made a bit of a mistake , i admit .
M	i was too trusting and sent money via bank_transfer to a seller who sent me some acoustic foam which smelt so bad i had to throw it away .
M	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
M	cost Â£_00 .
M	the seller pretended to refund the money , but after a month , i ' ve given up .
M	my advice : be_careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
M	if you cannot , do not use gumtree to purchase .
M	you may as well burn money .
M	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
M	they couldn ' t even be bothered to customise the email !
M	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
M	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
M	i asked them to remove the advert for the remaining foam , as i thought it was unfair for others to suffer loss .
M	they refused .
M	utterly_disgusted with this service .
M	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
M	worst experience online ever !
M	i purchased an se gemini iii from production_room , and i had an excellent experience .
M	i spoke to a great guy on the phone , whose name escapes me , unfortunately .
M	he sourced the mic , contacted me the next_day with an expected arrival and delivery date , and offered me a good deal .
M	in addition to this , they keep me informed of special_offers - and exclusive ones too .
M	i ordered an xlr cable which was out of stock , and they called me within an_hour or so to tell me they weren ' t getting any for a while , which gave me the opportunity to purchase elsewhere .
M	i cannot_fault them and i hope they continue to provide an excellent service .
M	invitations are gorgeous we are both more_than happy with them .
M	would recommend them to anyone .
M	thank_you very much
M	great service from currency uk
M	very impressed .
M	if in doubt dont be , to me it was a weird concept but it worked out great !
M	i bought Â£_000 worth of meats from here as my first purchase , got to say i was amazed how quick my order turned_up .
M	unfortunately due to rough handed couriers the box has exploded on one side and had a hole in one corner where it had been scraped across the floor .
M	luckily it was still ice cold though !
M	i noticed 0 packs of meatballs had went brown due to this so gave musclefood a call .
M	issue resolved straight_away , refund issued , i only rang to get mf to have a word with the courier .
M	best customer_service team ever !
M	the quality of the meat is unbelievable
M	mince is so dense it feels_like a steak , never felt anything like it !
M	cooks amazing with literally no fat drip too .
M	chicken_breasts are huge , most of them being 000 - 000g !
M	this is going to be my place to get my monthly shop from now on , highly impressed !!
M	if only they sold vegetables ??
M	haha .
M	cheap and fast
M	great selection , the price_match worked instantly , and a lot of free options and samples .
M	overall a great experience and i will be coming_back for sure with all of my supplement_needs .
M	ordered a new strap for my suunto watch .
M	wasn ' t sure what the measurements were so they took the time to go and measure one and call me back with their impressions etc .
M	item arrived the day after i ordered them .
M	cant ask for more_than that !!!
M	thank_you !
M	so easy to use for first time users that want to start there business and grow .
M	very helpful and any_problems are delt with straight_away i ' ll be using 000 for the next 0 yrs as my business is growing and ill be using them in the future as ive not had any issue with them and ive already_recommended them to my growing team as my businees is all about recommending ( saving money )
M	i was very glad with your product am for the delivery it was quicker and for the prices you need to do more promotion offer
M	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
M	they try to transfer the money to my card due to card expiry they are not able to do the same .
M	after i requested and fight with them , they accepted to transfer the money to my bank .
M	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
M	i ' ve ordered a fair few things from ebuyer and never had any_problems .
M	the site is easy to use and prices seem good .
M	after a mildly frightening conversation with a friendly carpenter regarding the potential cost of solid_oak worktops , i found worktop_express online .
M	i was very pleased with their prices , and it turns_out their worktops are very nice .
M	i was a bit_sceptical after_reading several reviews online about these cash for phones companys , and although mazuma didnt offer the best price (Â£ 00 - mazuma , the highest being Â£_000 ), they had the best reviews .
M	people were claiming to have been ripped_off by the companys offering more money saying they had recieved damaged phones , and giving out a fraction of the advertised price .
M	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
M	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
M	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
M	we ended_up using the best reviewed / cheapest surveyor from the list given to us from comparemymove and we are really happy with the result .
M	i ordered the new iwc pilots watch from iconic_watches two_weeks_ago and it arrived today as promised .
M	the correspondence i had with everyone at iconic_watches was 0st_class and the price i paid was definitely the cheapest i had seen both in shops and on the internet .
M	the next watch i buy will 000_% be from iconic_watches .
M	well its a very awsome thing you guys got going on here , pay two pounds and get a random key i like it alot , its a shame i already got a key that i own !
M	excelent job , i have got my iphone_unlock in less_than a day !!.
M	finally i have phone again after more_than 0 months as an ipod .
M	thank_you very much !
M	cjs_cd_keys is a great service that i cannot and i mean cannot recommend highly_enough i have been using the service for around a year now .
M	and it hasn ' t disappointed me once .
M	the few_times i ' ve contacted support my issues have been dealt_with in a professional_manner in a timely_fashion .
M	00 / 00 service , always cheaper_than the rest .
M	competetive pricing and regular special_offers , plus a good loyalty_scheme .
M	i normally select ' free delivery ' and usually have the goods in a couple of days .
M	when i ' ve used the next_day service the goods have always arrived on time .
M	goods are always well_packaged .
M	site is easy to navigate by category or brand or by using the search_function and there is plenty of revelant information for each product .
M	i would like to see more customer reviews of the products but that is down to the site users and not the company ( i haven ' t reviewed any of the products myself so shouldn ' t complain ).
M	highly_recommended .
M	i could easily browse through the website .
M	the site interface is clean and easily understood for first time user like me .
M	the booking page is also simple , the numbers are clearly shown and confirmation is received in the matter of minutes .
M	highly_recommended .
M	simply the best and better_than all the rest supplementwarehouse .
M	their low_prices are unmatched especially with there low price_match selection and quality first rate shipping .
M	sw is top of the line in customer_service , product selection , and discounts .
M	they are made to please the health and fitness supplement consumer .
M	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
M	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
M	the three that weren ' t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal hallway of my building by the front_door .
M	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal hallway is hardly a safe_place .
M	that ' s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
M	no cards were left through the door so there ' s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
M	i ' ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
M	hermes seem to use self_employed couriers and would apparently not require any experience , skill or professionalism from them .
M	hermes won ' t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual obligations ' are the reason , although i ' ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it ' s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
M	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
M	too quality firm .
M	love that questions are answered_quickly whether you call or email .
M	the staff know what they ' re talking_about as well , which is always helpful .
M	good prices , not the cheapest , most stuff can be found cheaper on ebay or amazon but comes without the customer_services .
M	i tried to buy a key from another site on - line but they wanted photo identity
M	so after about 0 hours of all this conformation stuff i gave up ,
M	and found cjs_keys i got my key within 00_minutes and could play in 00 ,
M	your site is amazing i will be back
M	this is one of the best digital software sites around .
M	the quick and easy nature of the purchase was unprecedented .
M	it seemed safe , and i urge_anyone who is after a bargain for items like microsoft points , playstation plus subscriptions and more , to look no further then here .
M	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
M	they are the middle_man !
M	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don ' t really have much control of whats_happening !
M	their customer_service is a complete nonsense !
M	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international deliveries !
M	i ' m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
M	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
M	this is my 0nd order with tile empire .
M	i was very happy with the service and notifications i got from tile empire and the metro black tiles i needed to fit with the deco .
M	their website was easy to follow and delivery was prompt and with no issues .
M	would use them again .
M	needed some advice ordering a pushchair .
M	gentlemen on the phone was unbelievably helpful , and extremely patient , even_though i took a lot of his time seeking advise :) :).
M	eventually ordered item on monday , it arrived tuesday_morning , sms in the morning of delivery .
M	cannot be_faulted .
M	keep up the good work .
M	wanted to sign_up to the exchange for some , found the starting point easy enough and took me through the steps needed to start betting with an intro video for new beginners
M	knocks socks off others
M	i cannot_praise their service enough .
M	they always deliver the best service for their customers , offer the best prices and are quick to help with any_issues .
M	always happy to use shopto . net , they offer their services with the gamer in mind .
M	hostelbookers is my first choice when it comes to picking hostels .
M	i ' m quite the novice at this , but after a few go ' s on the website , i have no issues booking hostels .
M	the website is just set out in a simple , yet beautiful fashion , and is incredibly efficient in getting you what you want .
M	booking your hostel of choice is very simple and can be done in a few_clicks .
M	comparing ratings between hostels , reading past reviews and in particular , the great variety of hostels offered is amazing and efficient .
M	top that experience off with very affordable rates and it ' s a winner .
M	i ' ve booked all my hostels via this site and i don ' t regret it for a second .
M	i highly_recommend using this for any traveller .
M	really impressed with healthy_supplies .
M	unfortunately one of the items i received in my 0nd order was damaged ( most_likely happened in transit ) but was replaced immediately as soon as i flagged it up , will_definitely be using hs again , thanks !
M	easy to use website , constant communication regarding dispatch ( even allowed me to change they day it was delivered via text ), extremely_satisfied with customer_service and product .
M	dont watch much tv but when i do i just end up turning it off after 0 mins of adverts is stuck in your face 0 seconds after you turn something on .
M	always left a card for attempted delivery !
M	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?...
M	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
M	bad_experience and service .
M	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
M	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
M	anyway ... 0 weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
M	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without any warning .
M	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
M	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
M	i usually use fedex but on this occasion had to opt for parcelforce .
M	after seeing the reviews on here ( trustpilot ) i got a little_worried but there was no need !
M	i use fedex because they are always on time and get my parcels delivered safely before 0pm .
M	parcelforce delivered at 0 : 00 with 0 % damage / creases to the packing , so i rate them very good on this experience :)
M	felt really strongly about recent issues with my internet and phone provider ( bt ).
M	so i decided to write a review , my first ever on trustpilot .
M	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
M	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
M	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
M	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online ... and still no review .
M	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
M	yes within 0 days was there reply .
M	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
M	or should i say never checked and / or published when it was perfectly_fine .
M	what ' s the point trustpilot ?
M	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
M	my mums migration to plusnet went wrong due to openreach but plusnet were next to useless getting it resolved and ended_up taking a week .
M	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
M	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn ' t know what else to do !
M	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
M	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
M	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
M	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
M	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn ' t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
M	their cheap package also doesn ' t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
M	will leave asap .
M	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
M	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
M	i think a dis - honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
M	i recently_purchased my daughter a vetech inotab from the funky_rabbit online store late on a sunday_evening and was able to reserve and pick_up in store first thing in the monday_morning !
M	ideal for anyone who ' s on the run and if not a very affordable delivery option was also available , a fantastic personal service instore as always !
M	happy customer !
M	happy daughter !!
M	!
M	i have been consistently impressed with urban_industry after using them for the last few_years .
M	great website , always have fresh stock , good sales , fast / reliable delivery , good customer_service & friendly on the phone .
M	i finally feel_compelled to review as they just processed a stress_free - refund on a faulty item very quickly .
M	big up urban_industry
M	as i had a fair few questions_regarding the products i sent out emails to snorestore which were promptly replied to .
M	no automated replies , just proper answers .
M	so i was very happy to order from them .
M	within 0 days ( first_class post ) the item was here and it could not have gone any smoother even during such a busy_period in london .
M	supplementwarehouse . com is always my first and last place for supplement shopping .
M	always has the lowest_prices and if i can find a cheaper price not only will they match it , they will beat plus they have a huge_selection to choose from .
M	there ' s no other place i ' d rather order from .
M	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
M	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
M	" guestlist_entry to chy bar " no guest_list as it was free entry to everyone anyway .
M	quad_biking and clay_pigeon shooting were excellent but we still feel after asking around we could of organised the whole_thing for cheaper but thanks anyway chillisauce .
M	ordered a berghaus cornice ii jacket and fleece in december_0000 , and another order january_0000 for second fleece , both delivered promptly .
M	a year later i noticed excessive_wear on the jacket around the waist draw - cord .
M	emailed support at outdoorkit at noon on a sunday who responded within fifteen minutes advising me to return the jacket .
M	they replaced it with a brand_new jacket , same model , size and colour free of charge !
M	it only cost me to post back the original jacket .
M	absolutely_brilliant , and wholeheartedly recommended .
M	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
M	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn ' t received it .
M	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
M	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
M	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn ' t even been collected yet , it ' s been a tracking error ".
M	what ?
M	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
M	but oh no - it ' ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
M	seriously ?
M	what a complete_joke .
M	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
M	" because we ' re a web based company ."
M	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn ' t bother to give customers their phone number .
M	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
M	then these are the place online to shop , have had 0 different batteries from them now over a few_years , no issues , no_complains , and always a good price , tip : join there facebook group for a small discount_code ;)
M	very surprised how fast my order was delivered .
M	this company came highly_recommended and did not disappoint .
M	i will_definitely be using their services again .
M	t - shirt what i wanted , great communication , fast delivery , will_defo use again !
M	!
M	best bookie ever !!!
M	!
M	great selection , service and price .
M	free next_day delivery and tracking service with lots of discounts via newsletter !
M	set the standard for online purchasing !
M	ive spent no less_than $_000 every couple months on supplements over the course of the past 00 years .
M	i ' m not gonna do the math on that because ill feel bad about it , but hey its a habit im not gonna break anytime_soon and im staying in shape .
M	bottom_line , i wish i knew about sw before now because 0 . they match prices ( with a simple reference site and price ) 0 . more of what im looking for so i dont have to go 0 - 0 places 0 . freebies that are coming out my , well you get the point !
M	shipping is very reasonable especially since the freebies and discounts surpass that amount .
M	its really a no_brainer , as long as my order shows up within a week then my loyalties are shifting to supplement_warehouse .
M	very nice and helpful on the phone , cheapest price i could find , and delivered the next_day having ordered at 0pm the previous .
M	ace !
M	very good service , the parcel was well_packaged and it was not damaged at all , and even_though the product was from_hong_kong it was a very quick delivery .
M	excellent !!!!
M	!
M	arrived in 0 days , sent first_class .
M	good quality , smells great and my vanilla ice_cream tastes great !
M	so much cheaper_than the supermarkets !
M	arranged service over the phone , quick response and perfect time and date .
M	on the day of visit , arrived at the time stated and also was completed in a speed time .
M	would highly_reccomend
M	great price from buysend and competitive with other online_retailer .
M	delivery was quick and delivered on time .
M	the product was exactly_what i was expecting and made my purchase very easy .
M	would use this company again and again .
M	had a few questions about using some of the international services and emma found local information on the carrier in greece quickly and efficiently .
M	because of her service i will use parcel0go .
M	booked online , was the cheapest to use and was right next to gatwick south terminal .
M	bus left almost as soon as i parked and there were others waiting behind it and on return i only had to wait for 0 minutes at the terminal for it .
M	at the gate my ticket was recognized nad was quickly on my way .
M	will_definitely use again in the future !
M	bought the game and within 0 minutes it had been delivered .
M	i will_definitely be using these_guys again
M	really the only place i go anymore .
M	good prices , match a competitors and free_stuff .
M	not much else to say but try it yourself .
M	as above ordered on the monday_morning and had the game by tuesday tea time ( i just used the royal_mail free service ) hitman for 00 pounds bargain as its 00 everywhere_else .
M	will use again
M	easy , no booking_fee , fast , and friendly - that ' s why i use hostelbookers for already more_than 0 years from now .
M	this is by_far the best experience i have had from a courier when rebooking collection .
M	thank_you parcel to go and especially sammie_taylor
M	i used to go to different online stores for all different things depending_on what i was doing and which had their own specified store brands .
M	i quickly learned that even for name brands , supplementwarehouse will outcompete other_websites ' off brands in price .
M	it makes it easier and more trusted this way and i wouldn ' t go with another company !
M	best price i could find anywhere and fast free delivery !!
M	couldn ' t ask for anymore .
M	top_notch place to buy always pleased with the speed of my orders would recommend you to try it today
M	fast delivery , easy website , good selection , great prices .
M	what more could you want ?
M	the site is well_laid_out and includes a variety options when choosing a place to stay .
M	their information was up - to - date and detailed .
M	good ill bay again
M	i have been ordering from these_guys for about 0 years now and i cant really say much else but they are very good .
M	they beat any other competitors price on the spot and the shipping is unbeatable .
M	thanks .
M	a really helpful company who deliver well_packaged , timely , quality products .
M	shocking .
M	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
M	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
M	my experience is obviously tiny and unimportant compared to those whose tickets are cancelled , replaced etc , but i think it ' s very symptomatic of how this company runs and treats its customers .
M	avoid .
M	nothing to say , really .
M	it is really great and cheap for visiing .
M	just one flaw , you must travel off_peak , which is really not convenient .
M	i have always bought my supplements from dolphin_fitness , before when i used to buy maximuscle products , now that i have switched to reflex products and even in recommended to a friend that was looking for bsn syntha - 0 ; on all cases they are the cheapest on the net .
M	would like to see them stock schiek training accessories , but that bears no reflection the speedy and satisfactory service .
M	great price and fast delivery
M	great free service and lots of paid help if needed .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
M	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
M	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn ' t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
M	they told us that it was a mistake and that we did have luggage included .
M	this was a lie which ended_up causing us a lot of hassle and costing Â£_00 .
M	they were rude and unresponsive when we complained to them .
M	there ' s a great service called flubit which gets better deals on products , which are already at competitive_prices .
M	what ' s more you are not committed to buying once they have quoted a price so it essentially works as an exclusive deal service for the exact products you want .
M	as well as the competitive_prices the quality of the produce is always better_than the supermarket .
M	the selection of products are fantastic and all for a great price .
M	the only thing i would change is to put montgomery cherry extract on the list of products .
M	the delivery is always quick and free which is always good .
M	i ordered my no explode on 0nd january and it got to my door at 00 ; 00 today .
M	i will be ordering from this company again and would recommend the to anyone .
M	hi after purchasing from savewatersavemoney i found it nice and smooth to use and the mobile site has been designed well too it was easy to show my girlfriend future_purchases whilst out and about and we now have a good selection for our new property in the summer
M	excellent fast service from_hong_kong , wow perfect time for christmas will shop with again
M	title explains it all , i ' m really happy with the fast service and good offers they have :)
M	great service and quick payment , emails to keep me updated and free delivery print off slip to send phone .
M	perfect
M	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
M	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
M	i told them i had no stores near by and there system gave me the impression the courier was coming .
M	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
M	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
M	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .
M	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
M	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we â ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can â t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i â d have it back next week .
M	i really wasn ' t happy with this as the distance_selling regulations said i was entitled to a refund and they could have just exchanged it .
M	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
M	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
M	so i called them and they said they haven â t even looked at it yet but they will soon and get it out the week after , i was totally unhappy with this as we at this point have been carrying our 0 month old baby around .
M	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
M	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn ' t put you off purchasing from us again .
M	so i said it hasn ' t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
M	but you â re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
M	â when we collect items for refunds we do need to minus Â£_00 from the refund for carriage cost , with this being a reworked item we generally would have charged Â£_00 for carriage as this comes with no guarantee for the repair .â
M	yes they wanted to charge me Â£_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
M	they then said they would refund me in full .
M	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that â_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
M	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
M	i hope this review has helped some people .
M	if they would have offered better service i would have gave these 0 / 0 .
M	one of the best for me to buy anything u want .
M	i giving 0_stars
M	i have been ordering red wine cases about 0 times now and every time the quality of the wines get worse and worse .
M	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn ' t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
M	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
M	today a guy rang me and wanted to sell me a new piggybank - type system , apparently unlike any of those typical ' wine plans ' with plenty of benefits and discounts .
M	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
M	moments later i receive two emails congratulating me on signing_up to this new fantastic service !
M	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i ' ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
M	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
M	this is a warning to anybody wanting cheap wine over the internet : stay_away from naked wines !
M	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i ' ve only had very positive experience with them .
M	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (Â£ 00 for Â£_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
M	going back to the website , finding those sunglasses was super easy and they had everything i saw in the shop .
M	the order process was very straightforward and delivery extremely speedy , with safe packaging .
M	i would highly_recommend this shop for anybody who prefers to ' look offline , buy online '.
M	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth Â£_00 . 00 .
M	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i wrote :
M	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
M	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
M	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
M	as of 00 / 00 /_0000 i have not received either dispatch notification or the item itself .
M	therefore i conclude that this company is involved in fraudulent_activity and a scam .
M	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
M	i ' m a regular customer at red_hot sunglasses and they have never once let me down .
M	in comparison to competitors their range is 0nd to none , the pricing is always the most competitive and most_importantly the service is spot on .
M	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
M	highly_recommend .
M	flies from heathrow , no charge for checked in luggage , free snack on the plane , but still budget price .
M	always seems to be trying to trick you on the website .
M	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don ' t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can ' t be taken in the cabin .
M	obviously it lacks shops , and a phone line , but these are two of the things that i have hated about previous network_providers .
M	i have only made one query and it was dealt_with very adequately .
M	fantastically cheap .
M	i continue to use ebay on and off , for selling and buying .
M	i can see that there is a problem with the balance of burden on the seller in conflicts , though have been lucky_enough to not deal with dishonest buyers .
M	products are cheap , but there are a lot of fake , replica , poor quality products .
M	supplement_warehouse has the lowest_prices any where on the internet .
M	the items i purchased can not be bought in stores and the original manufacturer tends to overcharge , and have little sense of expediency .
M	s . w .
M	allows you to track your shipment and even cancel or amend a current order ; assuming it hasn ' t been shipped already .
M	it ' s not simply a percentage off the full price but nearly half the cost .
M	even after shipping_costs , which are also lower .
M	this company has achieved the rare status of being an online store with the advantage of group purchase but with small business ideals like customer_service , and sense of fair transaction for both_parties .
M	i just wish the secret wasn ' t out so that i could continue to purchase these 0rd_party , first tier , products at basement prices .
M	i only assume deals this good don ' t stay under the proverbial carpet ... this makes it economically viable to try this companies legendary products on a routine basis .
M	i ' m confident that this will be one of the greatest deal giving websites on the net , in the times to come .
M	so buy up quick before everyone , and their brother , wants a piece of the savings pie .
M	overall an excelent company in all departments , fast processsing and delivery of all their goods , even to the channel_islands .
M	all products are competitively_priced and i ' ve never_experienced customer_services better from any other company !
M	top_notch , cannot_fault , asked to be informed when a product was back in stock got an_email in a timely_manner , was easy to checkout and was kept_updated of the status of my order at every_stage .
M	will_definitely buy from them again .
M	wonderful service , excellent price , all the music i need in as many places as i need it .
M	just need to get the rhcp and the beatles agreed and it ' ll be perfect .
M	couldn ' t believe it when somebody designed me some trainers , they ordered the wrong_size and they accepted the return .
M	just hope they are recycled properly :)
M	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
M	i have never had a successful delivery from this company .
M	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
M	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn ' t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .
M	i have had three total losses with them since the merger and the name change ( from hdnl to drop the bad reputation ) and the rest of the packages i have had to collect the products from the depot .
M	i have complained on every occasion and don ' t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
M	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
M	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .
M	i have had apple products for the last 00 years using every os since os 0 .
M	support is great , especially since the advent of the apple retail_stores where i can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time .
M	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build_quality is decreasing rapidly .
M	this year i have had 00 imac ' s scratching optical discs , three ipad ' s with faulty sound , two ipad 0 ' s with faults , 0 macbook chargers fail , 00 hdd failures and an ipod_touch with a flickery screen .
M	i manage three schools mac networks to a total of 000 apple desktops and three servers .
M	the removal of the xserve and the simplifying of os x server has seriously knocked my confidence in apple as a company .
M	i only hope tim cook can rescue the state of the company before it ' s too_late and it goes entirely os devices only .
M	buy all my wii and xbox games on it , cheap , quick and relable .
M	ordered my camera on the sunday and it arrived on the tuesday .
M	fantastic packaging , super secure .
M	honestly can ' t find any fault .
M	highly_recommended .
M	kirsty has been very helpful and understanding :)
M	been ordering from chemuk for many years now , always been steller service .
M	always worth checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
M	would order again without a second thought
M	excellent service , my items got delivered the morning after i ordered them .
M	the prices they had for name brand supplements was significantly_lower_than in - store prices for generic stuff .
M	simply the lowest i have found .
M	shipping is so fast , it is easier than going to a store and buying it there !
M	so i bought a cornilleau sport 000 indoor .
M	i live in n . ireland and spent a while shopping around for the best price .
M	without_doubt table - tennis - tables . co . uk offered the best possible price in the uk - they beat amazon by Â£_00 and all of their other uk competitors by ~ Â£_00 as they were the only company offering free delivery to ni ( others charged ~ Â£_00 for the 000kg delivery ).
M	i did experience minor issues with deliveries but neither were within the sphere of influence of table - tennis - tables . co . uk .
M	their customer_service was excellent , they chased up the couriers and provided me with information whenever i requested .
M	also as a nice_touch they sent me some champagne chocolates to make up for the delivery issues ( which were not their fault ).
M	overall a fantastic company with clued in , professional and courteous staff ( i dealt_with wendy , russell and tom ).
M	buy with confidence knowing that you are getting a great price on quality products backed_up by caring customer_service - if you live in ni or roi , literally nobody on the internet can beat their prices !!
M	!
M	they sell good posters .
M	i ' ve got 0 posters from the walking dead from them .
M	however i found the service better if ordered from amazon rather_than there actual site .
M	i tried entering a 00_%_off code on their site which didn ' t work i sent an_email to tell them that was 0 weeks_ago and i haven ' t heard a thing back .
M	customer_service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
M	great prices , good offers , excellent delivery service always bang on time mo issues_whatsoever
M	i have used moonpig for about 0 years now .
M	various birthdays , anniversaries etc .
M	always as i need , always arriving when i ask , never let me down .
M	love it !
M	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
M	would recommend again in the future for ( on - line support ) :)
M	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
M	0 arrived damaged , the other two went missing .
M	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for Â£_000 .
M	all because their system showed the parcels not having been picked_up .
M	customer_service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
M	wide birth , avoid .
M	use main companies like city_link , parcel_force , as they provide a tracking_number .
M	the drivers for this company don ' t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
M	i had to hand write one and ask the driver to sign it .
M	unbelievably shoddy work !!
M	!
M	i bought a laptop , which was the cheapest i could find by Â£_00 .
M	i ordered the item at 00 : am and it was delivered by 0 :_00pm , next_day .
M	i was sent regular_updates_throughout the process .
M	i read someone_else ' s complaint about returns , which hopefully will not happen to me .
M	a copy of this review will be sent to the company , and i ' m sure it will be in their interest to listen to these complaints and improve the overall service .
M	let ' s give them the benefit of the doubt .
M	so far , so good :)
M	i booked this company , by searching for the cheapest service online .
M	my parcel was collected on the day , and was received mid day just 00_hours_later .
M	after booking my parcel , i stumbled on these reviews .
M	what i did was open a paypal_dispute immediately after processing the order .
M	i posted a link to this website with reviews , and asked for a refund if the parcel was not picked_up as requested and delivered on time .
M	hopefully someone from the companies office picked_up the dispute and made sure the item was delivered on time
M	its only fair on this occasion , to give them 0_stars for their service , but , read the others reviews before considering their service .
M	there is no number to call the company on if things go_wrong .
M	it looks as though i got lucky !!
M	!
M	i did some digging to find the best price for my 0g ipod_touch and gadget_panda offered by_far the best deal .
M	so , i posted my item off to the freepost address - there was plenty of postage attached to that for me to send via recorded signed for delivery for just the 00p royal_mail charge and nothing extra .
M	i was kept_informed via_email as to the progress of my payment and i received the cheque promptly .
M	this is clearly a young company - my cheque was hand_written in a stamped , addressed envelope ( very cute touch ).
M	overall an excellent experience .
M	suggest this place to everyone looking to get there work out supplements and dietary supplements .
M	they really do have the best prices from everyone_else !
M	!
M	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
M	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
M	i ' ve been for more_than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer_service team .
M	few moths ago asked tmobile to change my tariff plan and was misinformed by costumer_service representative as result overrun my free minutes allowance and was billed en extra Â£_00 .
M	i had to make many phone_calls and sent official_complaint letter to sort it out .
M	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
M	i especially repeated few_times that i have new address , but representative ignored it and sent micro - sim to old adress however she charged me for it Â£_00 .
M	moreover tmobile representative blocked my current sim_card so i can not use my phone anymore and to contact them i had to buy pay and go sim .
M	over the next few_days i have contacted tmobile 0 times and every time was given different information_regarding my micro - sim !
M	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
M	sim still_hasn ' t been delivered .
M	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer_service located in india and philippines .
M	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another Â£_00 to get micro - sim .
M	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
M	thank_you tmobile costumer_service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid Â£_00 for nothing .
M	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer_service .
M	excellent quality image , fantastic service and postage speed .
M	can ' t recommend the company enough
M	thanks !!!!
M	0 *****
M	the key was given to me as soon as i purchased the item and it activated perfectly on origin .
M	thanks .
M	i placed an order for a canon_000d , but after 0 days and no email confirmation , i emailed them to ask them why not .
M	they told me the order had not gone_through , and in one of the most difficult to understand emails i have ever received , insisted i must phone them .
M	i asked them why , they didn ' t say .
M	i told them to phone me .
M	they didn ' t .
M	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
M	they had put through the original order despite me telling them not to .
M	i had to ring and cancel the order .
M	terrible service , deliberately aimed at getting you on the phone .
M	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
M	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
M	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
M	awesome tour company !
M	definitely highly_recommend morocco - excursions to anyone travelling to merzouga ... our_guide hassan mouhou went above and beyond for us !
M	my cousin and i have traveled quite a bit and i have to say , he was by_far , the best guide we have ever had .
M	he arranged so many things for us which were not a part of the original tour , our trip to morocco would not have been the same without his help .
M	awesome value for money , beautiful accommodation and a real taste of true berber culture , much_better_than the big commercial tour companies !
M	contact hassan and i promise you will not be disappointed ..
M	phenomenal , simply phenomenal .
M	breathtakingly beautiful , albeit cold , and unlike anything i ' d ever_experienced before .
M	well worth it !
M	hasan and ishmael looked after us well , cooking the best harira we had in morocco , telling stories and singing songs .
M	our camp was tiny , private and silent - a perfect tranquil stop ( though if we went to the dune top we could see a tent city nearby that apparently housed 000 people with electricity etc ... what ' s the point of that ?)
M	anyone going to morocco for the first time should visit the desert , and these are the folks to do it with .
M	they ' ll look after you
M	imei_unlock iphone 0 â 0s â 0 â 0gs official free
M	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
M	they took over a week to even dispatch my t - shirt .
M	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
M	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
M	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
M	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer_service .
M	got a Â£ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
M	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
M	large database of places around the world .
M	clean interface .
M	no full pre_- payment .
M	what to want more ?
M	awesome deals and super selection !
M	good shipping to boot .
M	no_complaints at all .
M	you can ' t seem to get my orders to me on release day !
M	again today a game which is released today i haven ' t recieved .
M	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn ' t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
M	so i ' m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
M	simply_games always get games out to you on time , sometimes early which is even better .
M	compared to some online game retailers it ' s up there with the best for it ' s fast , reliable dispatch and the games always come sealed to a high standand .
M	i would recommend simply_games to anyone tired of receiving not on time .
M	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
M	excellent !
M	thanks for the help sammie !
M	excellent service , very quick and easy , transaction was very fast and i am very happy to use this service again as they have very reasonable prices for my old_mobile .
M	fantastic price paid at a very fast rate
M	quick , no_fuss , nothing beats it for simplicity .
M	te website is clear , helpful and there is a vast_amount of choice .
M	many ' money off ' offers ( which all nutrition supplement websites have right ?
M	), however , echo genuinely seems to be one of , if not the , website offering the best deals .
M	delivery is very quick .
M	also , due to stock issues on my last purchase , the option to change or wait was put forward and the consideration towards me as a valued customer was evident .
M	will certainly be using echo_supplements again and recommend them to all who read this review .
M	the first place i look for a supplement is supplement_warehouse .
M	i check their price .
M	then , i spend some time looking at other_websites for their prices , to see if there are any lower .
M	about 00_% of the time , there aren ' t .
M	the other 0 %, supplement_warehouse wins the game with their 0 % price_match .
M	the best supp source online .
M	recieved the sigm 0 . 0 00 for nikon - sharp lens but does have issues in edges of image .
M	as per service - really quick service and delivery .
M	tried and certainly a trusted supplier - repeat customer .
M	perfect in every way !
M	fixed my phone back to perfect_condition !
M	amazing job !!
M	highly_recommended !
M	really quick delivery and excellent product - new shaker looks so good !
M	excellent , everything was perfect and the price was great .
M	customer_service was friendly , and our items were delivered in pristine_condition and packaged well .
M	i ' ve used them three times now and never had a problem .
M	a great range of options , helpful staff with plenty of ideas .
M	i ' m already recommending them to other groups !
M	great service , delivery was faster_than promised and the video reviews of avalanche transceivers were really useful for deciding which one to buy .
M	recommended .
M	was happily surprised how easy it was to purchase my game , and at these prices its insane not to use their site .
M	i got my computer exactly when they said and when i had a little trouble setting_up their costumer_service was very helpful
M	i bought cod black_ops 0 from cdkeyhouse and had no_problems at all , smooth and simple transaction through paypal and the key was delivered to my inbox in minutes .
M	its a great service and i would recommend it to anybody who_wants cheep discounted cd_keys rather then paying retail prices .
M	keep up the great service and support .
M	the product i ordered ticked every box . it was very good quality was very good value and came within 0 days . very satisfied customer !
M	i have been there customer for very long time .
M	the payment process is very fast .
M	amazing very happy with everything
M	never once have i been disappointed with this site .
M	top_marks !
M	i know digitalrev mainly from their youtube_channel , and was actually suprised to learn that they have an online shop .
M	i really like their videos on all_sorts of camera related subjects , and found that the particular camera i was looking to buy ( the canon_000d ) was cheapest on digitalrev out of all the retailers i was looking at .
M	so i ordered it .
M	it arrived within a few_days , was * very * securly packaged and i had no_problems whatsoever with any aspect of the transaction .
M	will_definitely order with them again !
M	if there is any_issues their team are helpful and try to get them resolved asap .
M	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn ' t be delivered when required .
M	no clear indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let me pay for something i would never receive .
M	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
M	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
M	i would advise to completely avoid until they amend their website to only sell you products and services they can actually deliver on and change their poor customer relationship attitude .
M	paid about Â£ 0 for product plus delivery , arrived next working day and product was exactly as specified and worked_perfectly .
M	not a single complaint , would advise to others and will happily use again in the future .
M	highly_recommend will 000_% buy from them again .
M	cheaper_than anywhere_else , plus the option to add a bunch of free_samples while checking out ?
M	who wouldn ' t want to shop here .
M	fast_shipping with one low flat_rate , i couldn ' t be more happy .
M	they ' re helping me get huge .
M	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just dumped them outside on a busy main street .
M	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
M	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i ' m requesting a full_refund .
M	we ' ll see how that goes .
M	judging from most_recent reviews it appears only london seems to get good service .
M	i have had no_problems with streaming or disc delivery .
M	although i have noticed google_chrome shows lovefilm . com to be an unsecure website .
M	also that after having a disc delivered and returned they just made the same film available for instant viewing , this happened at_least four times .
M	i have only used the service for three months .
M	i would like to see instant service include dvd and blu_ray extra features like making of and deleted scenes then we can do away with discs altogether , provided lovefilm can retain the license to stream the content as i have noticed many films become unavailable after a time .
M	hazard a guess many other_reviewers might have had streaming problems due to there internet_connection and service provider rather_than any technical fault with lovefilm . com .
M	i only say because when i came close to my own download limit streaming grinded to a halt , took very long to load or did not even start at all .
M	i have simultaneously been a member with lovefilms main competitor and have had no_problems either in fact its been a better service but lacking in new content .
M	i buy all my supplements at supplementwarehouse because they have all the products i want at a good price .
M	i ' m a customer for life !
M	wrong cable sent and speaker reflects light , completly the opposite of what i was told , just to get a sale .. still wating for the correct cable to use the speaker ..
M	i won ' t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
M	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
M	i found the diamondgeezer . com website through google , which had just the ring i wanted .
M	i was sceptical at first because of the website name but then found out the owner of the company has featured in an episode of dragon â_s den , which gave me all the reassurance i needed .
M	the website has a very useful_tool to check the progress of your order .
M	unfortunately , i received the wrong ring at first but the customer_service was quick to fix their mistake .
M	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
M	the customer_service is unbelievably good .
M	clive was the most helpful and polite person i have ever had the chance to speak .
M	mazuma blew me away !
M	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
M	would 000_% use again !
M	super_fast delivery excellent prices highly_recomended
M	its a fast and easy to use website the prices where very good it took about 0 mins to set_up my account with them and 0 mins after_placing an order for them to mail the code only thing that was a little miss leading is the $ 0 on top activation fee whats that when its at home all in all a good site
M	0 months_ago i preorderd aliens colonial marines from amazon due out on 00 feb_0000 the day before it was due to come out was emailed by amazon stating that due to unforseen problems i was not going to get my copy at the launch more_than a little annoyed i went_onto the amazon aliens : cm board to see if i was the only one having this shipping problem and as i gussed about 00 other loyal_customers where having the same problem .
M	this is the fourth time amazon has messed_up a preorder i have made and every time they have just brushed me off with a weak apogee so after years of loyal custom with them i decided to cancel the preorder and close my account so i did a short google_search and i came_across simply_games and not only was the game Â£ 0 cheaper i was going to have to wait only one days as apposed to 0 days with amazon needless to say all my future_purchases will be with simply_games they are fast reliable and cheap shop with confidance 00 / 00
M	its my fourth book from jessops , i was so pleased that they have been able to continue trading their photo_books are the best ones available on line or in stores , both for quality and value for money - although i would recommend holding out for the offers .
M	with the software downloaded to your laptop or pc it means you don ' t have to wait for pictures to upload or go through suffering at times of high usage , you can complete at your leisure .
M	this most_recent one was of my sons first year , it ' s a massive book and includes the text from an line blog which i have been writing fromm his perspective .
M	really took a lot of time to arrange the text and pictures and getting it uniform throughout the book it was enjoyable to see it coming together and adding more and more pages .
M	all i can say really is that i would and do recommend using cewe photo_books .
M	signed_up with them a few_days ago and after about ten_minutes i understood the entire software .
M	now i send my invoices within a few minutes every evening .
M	great software !
M	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
M	what is that about ?
M	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
M	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
M	these are then used to rate companies ?
M	dont sound right to me .
M	but my actual complaint about trust_pilot is that you cannot tell the truth !
M	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
M	i have a very genuine case against a very big website yet soon as i rate it 0 / 0 and give an honest opinion based on my many years experience with the company it is removed and i am sent an_email from trust_pilot asking why i have made this review .
M	what ?
M	it s in the review trust_pilot !
M	!
M	!
M	!
M	!
M	the review explains why i made the review surely ?
M	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an_email asking why you made it .
M	its a review site isn ' t it ?
M	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let me re - post or post another review about this company ?
M	corruption !

M	noun
M	the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person ' s reputation .
M	verb
M	make false and damaging statements about ( someone ).
M	my website has been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
M	we are verified safe by all the companies that actually test website , who are facebook to make the statement ?
M	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
M	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
M	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer_service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
M	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
M	the customer_service is extremely un - satisfactory !
M	if facebook take peoples money facebook should have a customer_service !
M	facebook have no customer_service !
M	my website is verified registered and verified safe !
M	alexa â verified | mcafee â verified safe | ssl security â certified | trust_pilot - rated trusted | paypal protection â verified | norton safeweb â verified safe | web stats domain â verified 000_% safe | facebook â ( why is it only facebook that says â maybe un - safe !?)
M	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
M	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
M	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
M	this has been in place for almost 0 weeks now , this is causing massive loss in traffic , engagement and sales !
M	we are suffering heavily !
M	thanks facebook !
M	your rubbish !
M	bring on [_external reference_]
M	arrived on time , even after adjustments made by myself late in the day , thoroughly_recommended .
M	hostelbookers is a great website for travelling .
M	i use it every time i travel abroad .
M	there is no beating the convenience of being_able to view so many places by price , location and rating .
M	one of my favourite things about this website is that all the places are reviewed by travellers just like me so i am more likely to stay some place that has a better review rather then just an attractive price .
M	the reviews help me a lot and i believe it is very important to leave a review for all places i stay in for this website .
M	i â m so glad i stumbled_upon party_krakow when organising my mates_stag .
M	if i hadn â t , i wouldn â t have been on one of the finest weekends away i â ve ever had or , in fact , returned to krakow just 0 weeks_later with my girlfriend ( with party_krakow â_s assistance !).
M	krakow â_s that good i went twice .
M	as with most stag organisers i immediately went straight to the british based tour companies with their flashy websites , easy payment options and â as i found out â cringingly flirtatious and patronising staff .
M	i found these sites useful for ideas but their prices are heavily inflated compared to what you can get if you book it direct .
M	this is what i was planning to do before i found party_krakow .
M	they , by virtue of their contacts in krakow , could pull together a package for even better value than going direct individually .
M	to add to that i met phil , their sales director , who couldn â t do enough to help us and advise us on various things for our weekend ( such as tips on where to eat / drink , exchanging currency etc ).
M	having exchanged a few e_- mails and telephone_calls â to the point where my other half was getting slightly_concerned_about the bromance i was striking up with â my main man in poland â as i kept referring to him â phil had managed to sort our weekend out for us at a snip of the price they were trying to charge on said british based websites .
M	the reason these companies get so much business is , i can only assume , is the fact that they have a british based secure payment website where individual stag goers can pay in instalments .
M	which brings me to the only slight negative with party_krakow .
M	when paying there â_s an element of trust as you â re simply transferring money into their bank_account .
M	firstly an immediate non_refundable Â£_00 followed_by half of the remaining_balance 0 weeks prior to departure .
M	the final amount is paid in cash on arrival .
M	all fine with me as i â d collected all the money from the stag goers well in_advance , had the opportunity to build up a rapport with phil and do a bit of research into the company .
M	however , more sceptical organisers may be uncomfortable doing this .
M	the sooner party_krakow invest in a secure payment website similar to their british competitors the better for them ( in my opinion ) as everything else they do is absolutely spot on .
M	anyway , to the weekend .
M	we were staying in the â royale apartment â_s which i was , initially , a little_dubious_about staying at as i was concerned_about disturbing other people in the block and being too far from the main square .
M	it wasn â t a problem â the large apartments are robust enough to cater for a bit of excess noise , they â re within easy walking_distance of the main square ( approx .
M	00 - 00 minute_walk away ) and on the door_step of the kazimeriz area which is where you really want to be anyway .
M	it â_s absolutely buzzing on a weekend .
M	there â_s a number of mini supermarkets to stock up on booze nearby as well .
M	another bonus was that there are no keys â it â_s all done on key codes .
M	secure , warm , comfortable , plenty of hot_water , well located and good value .
M	for our activities on arrival we immediately got picked_up from the airport to shoot some filthy large guns where we were met by our first guide sabine .
M	she spoke excellent english and was really chilled and friendly .
M	we peppered her with questions about where we should go out and what we should do .
M	she was only too pleased to help us out .
M	the gun shooting is over pretty quickly ( about an_hour for 00 of us ) but it â_s absolutely quality and if you want to fire more ( we went for the basic package ) you can pay as you go after the initial shoot out .
M	on the second day we got picked_up by the party_bus in the afternoon .
M	this is unbelievable â it â_s got an awesome sound system and is really stylishly decked out .
M	i â ve never been in a coach quite like it .
M	i was keen to book this as we could arrange a stripper for the stag in a controlled environment .
M	this turned_out to be perfect as it â_s essentially your own pub on wheels with a stripper .
M	our_guide gosia joined us for this trip and after our 0 hour trip on the bus she came out for a beer with us .
M	she was great company and , again , couldn â t do enough to help .
M	we didn â t pay for â all you can drink â on the bus which we were glad about as ( after a boozy lunch ) we only got through 00 beers between the 00 of us .
M	all you can drink is advertised at Â£ 00pp which â at 0 zloty a beer ( just over a quid ) â equates to about 00 beers in 0 hours just to break even .
M	when the first beer comes free as part of the package we only effectively spent Â£_00 on beer between the 00 of us .
M	unless you â re going to be drinking spirits / champagne or can drink at the speed of a beer every 00_minutes then i â d recommend paying as you go .
M	also , there â_s no toilet on the bus ( they do stops on requests though ).
M	as for krakow itself it â_s a beautiful city .
M	it â_s fun , relaxed , classy , tolerant and not in the slightest bit sleazy .
M	if you â ve been put off from going by various hyperbolic reviews in the past then don â t be , do your research for modern day krakow and give it a go .
M	it â_s also still incredibly cheap â most beers will cost you less_than Â£ 0 . 00 for a large beer and you can get a massive feed for about Â£ 0 .
M	as a stag venue you couldn â t really ask for more and if you put your faith in party_krakow you won â t be disappointed .

M	travelled 00 - 00 november_0000
M	chillisauce offer a great service , the choice is very wide ranging and website is very easy to use .
M	however , the product at the end of it is not worth - in my opinion - what you pay for .
M	we all paid Â£_000 for two_nights dorm accomodation in bristol , night club_entry and deep sea fishing .
M	a very brisk bit of research uncovers the fact that the beds that we were in cost Â£_00 per_night .
M	that leaves Â£_000 for deep sea fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
M	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
M	not great value for money .
M	and i very much doubt that the chaps on the boat took home Â£ 000pp .
M	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i ' m sure , you can get for free anyway .
M	chillisauce offer a good service in that they take all the organisation out of your hands .
M	however , if you ' re wiling to spend an evening arranging it yourself i believe you could get the same product for about half of the price .
M	great value .
M	delivered promptly .
M	nothing more really needs to be said !
M	great company , i always buy my supplements from supplement_warehouse .. its cheap fast and they have a larger selection than most everywhere_else ive looked .. plus they beat competitor pricing .. just no reason not to .
M	delvery was excellent very good that i recieved an_email to let me know the time and day my laptops would arrive .
M	value for money was brilliant .
M	definately be using again .
M	purchased three classic football shirts , all arrived in three days and in fantastic condition .
M	paypal to pay was very useful as well .
M	superb
M	was a little disappointing that some books i purchased were late to be delivered , but other than that , good service .
M	purchased a beautiful three piece suite from ebay a couple of days ago .
M	superb .
M	superb .......
M	i ' ve tried several time to switch from a cash - back website and eon website seems no to work ...
M	first time ive ever bought a cd_key , i play tera on a f0p account and im part of the tera club i wanted to make a third character but im restricted to 0 characters soooo i looked for a serial key to get the 0 slots instead of buying from the store which would have cost me a stupid amount of money ..
M	easy transaction , got the key , added to my current f0p account on tera website ( eu ) and woop 0 slots , more bank space , awsome !
M	very happy !
M	thanks
M	awesome company , great prices and a massive_range of products , love to use them .
M	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
M	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
M	my only small criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
M	overall a great service .
M	a few_days ago i needed to order 0 - tyres for my car and i decided to purchase these through the national website .
M	the quoted price was Â£_00 . 00 per tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total cost came to Â£_000 . 00 !.
M	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
M	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
M	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
M	" you ' ll have to wait , can ' t you see we ' re busy ?"
M	said the man .
M	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
M	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
M	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
M	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
M	he eventually came out with no apologises .
M	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i ' ve spent Â£_000 to support these_guys jobs .
M	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
M	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit "...
M	when is ' in a bit '??...
M	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .
M	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
M	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .
M	i went and sat back in the reception .
M	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
M	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
M	he walked out .
M	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
M	after 0 - mins he said " oh mr . mason you can go now its all done ".
M	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .
M	is this garage for real ?!
M	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
M	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
M	i will certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre ' s in the future ... my friends will be receiving the same advice .
M	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world ... at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
M	i bought some ed hardy trainers but ordered the wrong_size .
M	the process of changing the trainers was very easy and smooth .
M	great communication via_email and service .
M	we ordered 0000 a0 double sided colour fliers for only Â£_000 and recieved within 0 working_days !
M	was looking for best deal available for canon 00 - 000 0 . 0 is ii .
M	one of the top google suggestions was slrhut .
M	price is way beyond the current market value .
M	and trustpilot reviews made my choice even quicker .
M	since i was in a hurry i had chosen express delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ).
M	placed an order on wednesday last_week , no shipping notification before i chased the status of the order with customer_service on monday .
M	finally item was shipped on monday from usa .
M	arrived on wednesday , i . e .
M	0 working_days .
M	so be aware .
M	but for me it was still on time .
M	box looks good and tidy .
M	first look discovered no faults .
M	very impressed .
M	can ' s wait to put that on my canon_0d mkii .
M	highly_recommend everyone to try slrhut .
M	quick , affordable , reliable !
M	highly_recommended !
M	i saw too many bad comments about this company and want to share my experience with them .
M	i used them 0 times and ordered from them canon_00d , 00 - 00 f0 lens and 000exii flashgun ( all separately ) and everything was delivered next_day .
M	was really impressed with the service i received - i was immediately given a quote online , collection was easy and speedy ( given an_hour_slot for collection ) and payment was fast and the full_amount as given in my quote .
M	great service !
M	i needed a load of flyers printing for a last_minute exhibition in 0 days time .
M	i spoke to one of the designers at the manchester branch and went to meet them .
M	within 00_mins i had all the option presented to me and chose which i thought best , i even switched my business card printing to them there and then .
M	i have been promised a 0 day turn_around , so fingers_crossed it ' ll be ready .
M	the ordering_process was quick and the website well_designed .
M	i was updated frequently on how my order was progressing , including tracked delivery with the royal_mail ( track and trace ).
M	ordered friday_morning and received by midday on saturday .
M	products were well_packaged and exactly as_described .
M	thanks banana_fingers !
M	will_definitely be recommending to my friends and will be using again myself .
M	fantastic service , friendly / helpful communication and great prices ... what more could you ask for ?
M	i ' d wholeheartedly_recommend dragon_specs if you ' re looking to buy some new glasses ... much cheaper_than the high_street and a pleasure to deal with !
M	great company , great service - very clever !
M	don ' t get a bank loan again !
M	this way of getting a loan , is actually fun and exciting and you don ' t get ripped_off unlike banks !
M	a + would highly_recommend funding circle to anyone !
M	i was first introduced to kraft cufflinks through a colleague who only had good things to say about this company .
M	he couldn ' t have been more right .
M	from the first moment i got in touch with kraft i was provided with an outstanding service and this continued right the way through until the final product was with me !
M	wow my cufflinks looked amazing !
M	even the box they came in was exceptional !
M	thanks for your help and advice throughout my order !
M	i would recommend anyone_looking for a mens fashion accessory to use this company !
M	job well_done !
M	high_quality product , great price , professional service .
M	have been using , juno for many years ...
M	they havent ever failed me , delievery / turnaround times are very good , 0 / 00 orders ( before 0pm ) arrived the next_day .
M	price is normally very good , cd albums etc are normally equal to amazon prices .
M	they ' re always failry upto - date on music release , and give accurate estimations on forthcoming music .
M	any communications iv had with them in the past ( for later orders or damaged goods - which is extremely rare ), they responded quickly & professionaly .
M	i dont really use the juno download section , as in my opinion beatport is the best & the most up front .
M	however , i would say its well_designed and the sample player is really good , so if there was no beatport , i would happily use juno ... its cheaper too !
M	!
M	all - in - all juno is my prefered site for buying artist albums ( techno , house , progressive ) & dj equipment ( headphones , dj bags etc ).
M	i dont use vinyl any more , but they used to be my main source for buying 00 ".
M	hallo , the keys arrived the very next_day .
M	please use my reply and name if you like including area where we are as part of your totally and highly satisfied customers in every way 0 / price 0 / efficiency / 0 / service 0 / delivery 0 / customer_satisfaction .
M	a0 tops in everything .
M	please use this as a recommendation .
M	whilst the website does look a little dodgy it worked_perfectly and was much_quicker and a hell of a lot more secure than any other cd_key website
M	of all the cd_key selling websites iv ' e used this is by_far the most secure one , simply asking for a phone verification and allowing the use of paypal put my mind to rest , this , in addition to the nice layout and the great stock notifications i would happily buy again from them .
M	i placed my order on wednesday before 0 pm and i received an_email that states it would be delivered on friday or monday .
M	it ' s friday_evening now and there ' s no news , is this a joke ?
M	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
M	plus , there ' s so many online sports supplement s websites that provide same day delivery .
M	ordering on wednesday and waiting till_monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
M	i had been looking for a winter jacket online and had seen a few that i liked on a number of websites such as e_- outdoor . co . uk .
M	having never owned a north_face jacket , i went to my local cotswold store and ended_up trying a few different_styles prior to making an online purchasing decision .
M	i ended_up choosing the north_face redpoint jacket however , the store that i visited did not have one with a hood .
M	i began googling the redpoint jacket when i got home and found that it did come with a hood .
M	e_- outdoor . co . uk were the most competitively_priced and offered free delivery also so i ordered through them .
M	the service from there onwards has been faultless .
M	i received an order confirmation immediately , a text_message two days_later asking when i would like the item delivered ( with the option of changing the date or having the item delivered to a neighbour ) and received the item a day later .
M	the whole_process was very professional throughout and i would have absolutely no_hesitation in using this company again or recommending it to a friend .
M	on a final note , i am wearing my purchase as i type this review .
M	the item was received in perfect_condition and exactly as specified .
M	thank_you for a great buying experience .
M	i came_across webtogs whilst searching for the best price on a the northface base_camp bag for the gym .
M	they were the cheapest price i could find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
M	i ' ve used the company twice since , getting some argyll boots and a the northface jacket .
M	all items were shipped fast .
M	i bought my company ' s first colour laser_printer from them 0 years_ago and have been using them ever since .
M	they have been consistently good value in toner costs ( and i do compare prices !)
M	and always dispatch fast .
M	i recently_purchased another printer which is serving me well .
M	there was a delay when i ordered an extra - paper tray , but i got a call a few minutes after ordering to inform me of the delay .
M	the item arrived a few_days_later as promised .
M	i wish all companies were this reliable !
M	i found supplement_warehouse to be the place to go to find the best deals .
M	they will beat any prices you can find online !
M	thanks
M	i submitted an unlock for orange uk ( now ee ) and they said it would be done within 0 week .
M	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer_service and best of all they never answer the phone .
M	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three days !
M	if you want your phone unlocked , do not go here as you ' ll end up paying for nothing - they will not give you a refund either .
M	they also have a tendency to report real feedback to trustpilot as where all their other reviews are not genuine .
M	very good prices and very quick free delivery !
M	two_weeks_later , still no item , no communication / explanation , nor any response to email .
M	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
M	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
M	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
M	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
M	0 .
M	don ' t list items for sale that are not for sale .
M	0 .
M	if items run out of stock let customers know within one day , not 00 days .
M	0 .
M	don ' t lie to customers in an attempt to look like you are being a responsible company to the outside world .
M	0 .
M	it is also interesting that i got a response to a public post here rather_than my personal email .
M	rating has been downgraded to 0 star due to the proven lies and lack of trustworthiness .
M	user of quidco since 0000 , i have earned back over Â£_000 over hundreds of purchases .
M	that ' s all that needs to be said really .
M	i found the top i was looking for and placed the order .
M	half our later i got the comfirmation saying it was shipped .
M	excelent speed - price - service :)
M	i like to move it move it , i like to move it move it , i like to move it move it , you like to move it .
M	god_bless everyone those who made us to trust ' em to unlock our zombi iphones .

M	the best company i ever_dealt_with !!!!
M	!
M	i read previous reviews about this site a lot of people were very happy and therefore i took a chance and purchased an ipod_nano the condition description said scratched up back however when it arrived there were a few marks and i was really happy with the condition .
M	i also used the next_day delivery service as i needed it for a train journey to scotland i left my house at about 00 :_00am and it arrived just as i had left , however it still fulfilled its agreement to get here before twelve , again i am happy with this service .
M	( do not worry i borrowed an ipod from my dad and i had company anyway .)
M	all in all really happy with the product and the service .
M	it was a class day .
M	description was spot on and all went without a problem
M	the guys at sellmyhome are very thorough and fair and always available when you need them and indeed provide a very personal service .
M	i can ' t imagine getting a better service , certainly not from a high_street agent , and when you factor in how much you would pay to a high_street agent as a % of the property value that makes this a hugely high value service .
M	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else in the future .
M	i ' ll be honest , prior to this purchase i ' d never_heard of grooves inc and usually buy most of my electronics from more established websites like amazon .
M	i wanted to buy the ' mighty morphin power rangers season 0 ' dvd set and grooves was one of the very few sites in europe to sell the product .
M	i must_say that i ' ve been left impressed .
M	the order was shipped and delivered quickly , with a great price ( 0 disks with 00 eps on each for Â£_00 ) and secure packaging .
M	chuffed to bits that i found these_guys and will_defiantly use them again .
M	bravo .
M	honestly , this was the easiest shopping_experience that i ' ve ever had with suplements and the prices are just great .
M	couldn ' t be_happier with how everything went , and i will_definitely shop here again .
M	the delivery was really fast , however the boxing was badly_damaged , and after i had opened the box , it came apparent that the wood had a bit chipped off , nothing big .
M	furthermore , i had witness the delivery man dropped the boxing , i ' m not too sure whether this caused the damage or somewhere_else during dispatch .
M	it is a shame , but it isn ' t a big piece that is damaged .
M	would like the one piece to be replaced though .
M	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
M	as this is the only time i have ever had a problem .
M	great service even for a custom design i made myself and skins were very easy to install , looks_like a charm on my desire hd .
M	very cheap , really fast , no hasle , all legit
M	the service i have received is 0st_class .
M	i ordered some cricket boots and received them the next_day .
M	unfortunately they didn ' t fit .
M	i sent them back and had my new pair within 0 days !
M	i have no_hesitation in purchasing from barrington_sports again
M	i used this company due to it ' s convenience and had my car collected from work .
M	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
M	0000 came and went , no car .
M	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
M	i work in a completely remote location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
M	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
M	long_story short , an_apology was made but no reimbursement for expensive taxi , missed commitments with the family and cancelation of business meetings .
M	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
M	avoid at all costs !
M	i ' ve bought towbars and generic wiring kits from pf jones in the past , and was more_than happy
M	this is the first time of buying a dedicated wiring kit from them
M	i had a problem with it , but after chatting with there fitter and brian from the internet sales_team , we were able to resolve it in the end
M	with service like this , where someone try ' s there best to help you , and returns calls promptly , i would have no problem in buying again or recommending to others
M	pimlico_plumbers have been dealing_with a leak that was discovered under our living_room .
M	the plumber and carpenter who undertook the work , manolo leon - roman and david braidford , were highly skilled and worked very quickly to locate the leak and to fix it .
M	i was very impressed with the service provided by visualsoft , they kept communications with me at every_step of progress the site was making and any_problems i would come_across they would be right there to help solve any_problems .
M	the site is now up and running and we have already recieved orders within a week of the website going live .
M	this shows how well visualsoft are at making a well astablished looking website and how it links in well with search_engines to increase its customer base .
M	thanks .
M	over the last couple of years i have placed 00 or so orders with shopto . net .
M	every_single order has arrived the next_day without_fail .
M	all pre_- orders arrive on the date of release or a day earlier .
M	they are also very competitively_priced , usually beating the other major online_retailers .
M	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
M	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
M	you can find various things you might need and with a great price .
M	it offers used and new things .
M	great for using in uk and even abroad .
M	has been with me many years .
M	love it .
M	:)
M	great place to share your videos and music .
M	i use it alot to watch gute and funny videos and also listening music .
M	it ' s the main search_engine i use .
M	i don ' t trust others and this one is so easy and looks great .
M	this is a great site for shopping .
M	there is every thing in this one .
M	cheap things and it has many vouchers for the site .
M	i have flown with this airline alot .
M	this far i have had only one insident which easyjet solved quite positively .
M	i had to stay in a 0 star hotell fo a night , which easyjet provided for us and also gave us and even money to buy food .
M	it ' s great for 0 hour flights .
M	it ' s even better_than orkut .
M	so people who like orkut would like facebook even better .
M	there is more to do than just watch others pictures and write comments .
M	traveling has never been easier and cheaper whit this site .
M	i placed my order at 0000 one evening and it was with me before lunchtime the next_day .
M	the price was extremely competitive ( and i trawled the internet hard ) and they processed my refund quickly and simply - with good email follow_up .
M	i dont normally review anything but the service was so bloody good they deserve 0 minutes of my time .
M	order in confidence , this is a top internet vendor .
M	v quick delivery .
M	will order from them again .
M	everything from this company arrives very fast & their products are always of the highest_quality .
M	i had to return something once = even that was a pleasure as it was dealt_with fast & easy unlike a lot of web companies these days , webtogs take pride in their great service .
M	their prices are also very competitive & usually are the cheapest around also which always helps .
M	i have used them now a few_times & can highly_recommend them in all ways from ordering to delivery to returns if needs be .
M	top_marks all_round .
M	!!
M	!
M	a great site with a wide_range of different slots , machines running better_than most other_sites , withdrawal was quicker_than_expected , again allot faster_than different sites , after_reading reviews on forum sites there ' s allot of happy customers my self included , more deposit bonus will be great :)
M	spintee
M	i would highly_recommend ebuyer . com for its quick shipping of products and prices are better_than the high_street stores and you can also shop until 00pm and get the products the next_day
M	i also use ebuyer to compare prices with other online stores and this company is far the best .
M	speedy and excelent quality products :) very happy shopping with them
M	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
M	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
M	attempt 0 their automated callback disconnected me .
M	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
M	been a customer for a week as they supplied our new house , and its been a week too long ; already switching .
M	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
M	shocking .
M	haha sorry i had to say that because i honestly don ' t know how they got my late 00 : 00 order to me within 00_hours of payment !
M	i will shop at juno again , simples .
M	also if you don ' t own a pair of iso - acoustic monitor stands then don ' t rest until you do ... these things should be sold with every monitor , by law .
M	good job guys , hope next time goes just as well ;)

M	i ordered a product in a particular colour and size .
M	i got the size wrong , which is my fault , but the product that arrived was the wrong_colour .
M	sweatband gave me a partial_refund , and didn ' t cover the cost of my return_postage .
M	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return_postage cost .
M	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
M	i was searching for the best prices on various bits of kit for a triathlon and found mytriathlon with the best deals .
M	when i came to order another bit , the price was the same as elsewhere , but due to the ease of ordering and speed of delivery , i didn ' t hesitate to use mytriathlon again .
M	i would recommend them and will use them again .
M	i stumbled_across car del mar when looking for the cheapest price to hire a car for a trip to snowdon in wales from london .
M	car del mar provided a deal that was significantly_cheaper then anywhere_else i could find .
M	booking was simple , the website was easy to use and the information and instructions were nice and clear .
M	the company they had linked me with was very good , polite and there were no_problems whatsoever .
M	the car was in great condition , practically brand_new , drove well and was quite economical .
M	returning it was also nice and easy , and a great experience all_round .
M	overall , against the price of a train_ticket for two (Â£_000 ) total including petrol was Â£_000 .
M	superb .
M	feetus had a great selection of products , including the one i was looking for at the best price .
M	navigating the shop , finding information about the product and ordering was all very easy .
M	my item arrived quickly and when i had to swap it for the next size up , this was easily accompished and the staff were helpful and friendly .
M	now my review stands out .
M	tredz is great , i have no reservations buying form them if they have the best price for what i want .
M	never any_problems , always speedy_delivery and hassle_free shopping .
M	top_marks .
M	very pleased with the service , quick delivery and when i realised i ' d ordered the wrong part the turn_around to swap was also very quick .
M	great !
M	great , nice easy ordering , fast delivery , the best price .
M	shame they didn ' t have the black saddle available .
M	i ordered a part , the website was easy to use , the description was excellent , the part arrived quickly .
M	simple and fuss free , great !
M	fast and easy order , payment and delivery of the bottle cages , what more could you ask for ?
M	will use again if the price is right , top_class .
M	easy to use website , quick delivery , chocolate or chocolate mint flavours are better_than the coconut ...
M	i was looking for some super hot " lobster " gloves as i get insanely cold fingers ( maybe i ' ve got reynauds ?)
M	and came_across these !
M	they are brilliant and my cold fingers are a thing of the past .
M	i wanted these in a hurry so i could test them in the cold snap , and alwaysriding delivered them lickety - split ;-) very fast service , couldn ' t wish for more .
M	brilliant service .
M	quick transaction fast delivery .
M	that ' s all i really need .
M	ok it takes two_weeks but definitely worth it
M	i have got myself a new monster and saved 000 Â£ compared to a brand .
M	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
M	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
M	once i had recovered from the excitement of my delivery i eagerly opened the package looking_forward to admiring my shiny_new switch ... unfortunately my new found happiness was short lived .
M	the switch was the wrong_colour ... black instead of white , although after much deliberation while making a cup of tea i decided that actually i did prefer the colour of the new switch especially in certain light conditions .
M	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
M	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
M	in summary .... worse Â£ 0 . 00 plus p_& p ever !
M	i wanted a new ceramic hob for my kitchen and looking online hughes direct was the cheapest for the hob i had chosen .
M	the delivery of the item was very fast , and the hob arrived in immaculate_condition and works_perfectly .
M	recommended
M	i telephoned the company for some help as i wasn ' t sure of a few things and they were very knowledgable and helpful about my requirements .
M	once i ordered my parts they arrived well_packaged within 0 days .
M	i ordered a custom sized mirror from this company ' s website .
M	the mirror is exactly as ordered .
M	although the stated delivery was 0 - 0 working_days , due to materials not being in stock my order took 00 days to arrive .
M	due to the times delays with my order mirrorsandglass delivered the mirror to me free of charge as a goodwill_gesture .
M	placed my order and delivered within an amount of seconds !!
M	will_definitely use again and recommend to anyone !
M	!
M	ever since i found out about this website through a friend , its the only place i get my supplements from .
M	great prices and deals and fast_shipping !
M	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don ' t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .
M	as they say they are not trained to offer you other product in place of broken one .
M	as when you loose 0tb precious data isn ' t enough you will end up with empty wallet .
M	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
M	and as with every company making business in this way you can read up on their website dozen of comments from supposedly satisfied customers and off course only positive ones how wonderful the company is
M	i did order my item few_days before_xmas , and the item arrived very very quickly .
M	super service , and super price .
M	no word .... 0 minute for a key ... it wonderfull
M	brilliant service , very quick
M	had no_problems with ordering , very informative , quick delivery , no damage , very good service
M	used about 0 times so far and perfect every time .
M	no more sitting around at the garage .
M	only down_side is that they don ' t always have what they advertise on the website which means they call you with an_alternative .
M	i get them to come to my work address as this means i don ' t waste my time
M	never had a problem with them .
M	i always know what i am looking for and i love the free add_ons !
M	i did have an issue once with an_alternate shipping company , but normally ups or fedex is very fast .
M	the website should have a better search_function , like " pre_workout ", but otherwise it is easy to navigate .
M	very satisfied with my experience .
M	customer_service was of an excellent quality , the advice given was clear , the consultants i spoke to were honest , efficient and did what they said they would do .
M	very happy and would recommend to anyone .
M	really amazing service .. i use them all the time and really the best .
M	am a power seller on ebay and i ship a lot , and they are always helpful .
M	just easy transaction and delivered on time .
M	they have some good deals specially with ups .
M	will sure use again
M	i bought a case for my samsung_galaxy tab 0 . 0 , and i couldn ' t be_happier with it .
M	unfortunately the elastic band of the handstrap on the case came loose almost as soon as i received my snugg case in the mail , but the customer_services team immediately responded to my query and have already got a replacement on the way .
M	friendly , direct communication with a fast response time .
M	if you want to see how a top quality , no - fuss customer_service team works , look no further than the team from snugg !
M	the value for money ratio is quite good .
M	however , the food quality doesn ' t seem to be the best .
M	youtube was the best video sharing website when they started years_ago and they are still the best video platform on the internet !
M	google is still my number one search_engine .
M	i tried bing for some time as i liked their picture change every day etc .
M	but the search_results ( and that ' s obviously the most_important ) are just the best with google !
M	i signed_up with this invoicing service a few_months_ago and was positively_surprised as it is very easy and fast to send invoices .
M	last_week i had a problem with my revenue report which i wanted to export to an excel file and it didn ' t work .
M	i emailed them and within half an_hour the problem was fixed .
M	top customer_service !
M	this company is amazing !
M	i ' m a fitness model , and compete in shows !
M	i ' m always in a hurry and some companies don ' t have the products i need !
M	so , i truelly really on these_guys to get me preped and ready for my shows !
M	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
M	it was missing a button on the keypad so i was expecting to be contacted about receiving a reduced price .
M	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an_email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
M	happy days .
M	amazing love this site , instant and cheaper_than high_street , what more could you want !
M	!
M	i love online shopping with tesco .
M	it ' s fast , easy and i don ' t have to wrestle my way to the checkout !
M	really pleased with my purchase .
M	easy site to get around , found what i was after and the free batteries and no vat were great extras .
M	easy payment , speedy_delivery .
M	well recommended !
M	friendly search and easy booking .
M	fast and simple .
M	finds the best deals and displays all relevant_information .
M	have used them before and will_definitely return when booking our next holiday .
M	the website is easy to navigate , offers plenty of information to help you compare each hostels and best of all , charge no commission !
M	the website of choice for booking hostels :)
M	i only usually leave reviews when i have a negative experience with a site ( like most people ) but after_reading some of the nonsensical negative_reviews here , i will break that habit .
M	to cover some of the points made in some of the other reviews ;
M	- accounts are free and do what they say they do , you can chat with models as a free user , it just depends on the chat restrictions set by each_individual model .
M	premium features are naturally reserved for paying customers .
M	- i don ' t know the exact amount but the 00_% figure is probably about right for how much models make per token earnt through tips or private shows .
M	think that ' s bad ?
M	factor into the equation the cost that the website bares when serving thousands of cam streams to thousands of users , many of whom are guests or regular members , where does the bandwidth come from for that ?
M	how about when a model earns very little through lack of performance , do they pay back the cost of the bandwidth ?
M	i would estimate there is a profit in there for the administrators but not as much as you might think .
M	- as for tipping models for " off the site " perks , mfc makes it quite clear that all tips are just that ; tips .
M	any agreement you have with the model in exchange for a tip is between you and the model , no moderation or mediation is offered for this , also made clear on the site .
M	if you got taken for a few tokens , rate the model down and move on .. welcome to the real world .
M	i have never personally experienced this but then i just give tips as a token of my appreciation to the model .
M	- i have never personally encountered a poor juddery connection over the past 0 years of using this service but then i guess this is subjective to the models connection , server location and its upstream providers to your isp .
M	- track your ip_address , you bet .
M	find me a subscription website that doesn ' t do this .
M	what other way would you suggest to trace and block fraudsters and spammers ?
M	if you ' re a legitimate paying rule abiding customer , what do you have to worry_about ?
M	if you are worried_about this , you should delete your facebook , hotmail / gmail account and sign off from the internet .
M	- the website does indeed archive every conversation , not really a secret considering there ' s a link which allows you to view your past conversations with models ... without storing the information , how else would one make this possible ?
M	you could always click the " clear chat logs " link , though that could be some sort of underhand trick or trap so best be_careful / s
M	nonsensical codswallop quashed , now onto my experience with mfc ;
M	i ' ve been a member of mfc since 0000 and still a happy paying customer today .
M	i am also a member of other adult cam sites , but this website is frankly a hundred times better_than the others .
M	i prefer this website because it is much richer in features for paying customers than the others , with most other cam sites you are lucky to get a basic " java " chatroom and the option to take a model private .
M	mfc offers a non - laggy free chatroom , private , voyageur and group shows .
M	i could go on but i will sign off by leaving a pro / con list and let you decide for yourself .
M	pros_:
M	- free to use for all users .
M	- private archives ( great way to view your private sessions again , and again ..)
M	- thousands of very beautiful models , there really is someone for everyone .
M	- non laggy ( ajax ?)
M	chatroom .
M	- stable website and connection to cams .
M	- variety of different_ways to spend your tokens ( privates , voyageur , group and tipping ).
M	- a ton of other misc stuff i won ' t go onto list but it certainly is the most feature rich cam site .
M	cons_:
M	- ancient green layout .
M	it may have looked nice during web 0 . 0 era but this is 0000 and time for a change .
M	- plenty of ways to filter models but no way to filter by age ... somewhat of an oversight .
M	- no possible way to change the email address associated with your account ( other than by contacting support ).
M	- support is mediocre and very meh from my experience , and being a " platinum premium " member , i should in theory receive the highest priority level of support .
M	having contacted support on about 0 occasions , i only received replies on 0 of those .
M	it has nearly always been a technical or billing issue that i have contacted them about and not something covered by the wiki documentation .
M	for any other website , i would have stopped visiting it if this had happened , so it ' s a testament to how good this site is that i have chosen to overlook these occasions .
M	i neither work for or know the people who own mfc .
M	this review does not contain an affiliate link .
M	i ordered my ring in november and received it well within the predicted delivery time and wow what an amazing ring !!!
M	i proposed to my girlfriend on christmas day and she hasn ' t stopped staring_at her new addition to her finger since .
M	i cannot thank diamonds_factory enough for their great service .
M	i also walked past a major high_street jewellers today and saw the exact_same ring for Â£ 0000 , this wouldn ' t seem a bad price for it until you see that diamonds_factory do the same one for Â£_000 !!
M	seriously recommend them to anybody .
M	we normally use car_hire 0000 but our last two experience was not very good since they changed to rentalcars . com so we decided to look_elsewhere .
M	we chose elephantcarhire . net based on their reviews here and other_sites it was a great decision .
M	the rates they offer are very similar but they work with much_better suppliers .
M	it makes a lot of difference !
M	we will use elephant from now on .
M	you have wide_range to choose from , you can search on tyres compatible with your vehicle .
M	easy to purchase , good prices and quick delivery , couldn ' t ask for more .
M	will be using black_circles again .
M	it ' s my second international transfer with transferwise and i couldn ' t be more satisfied .
M	this could have the potential to seriously disrupt banks ' business in transfers .
M	i had serious doubts about using it , it really seemed much like a scam like you regularly get by email , but then i saw two people i know on twitter recommending the service .
M	after a quick chat with these_guys ( the simpletax team ), they said the service comes highly_recommended and they even knew the team behind it .
M	can ' t recommend this enough , really .
M	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
M	!
M	i frequently use vanilla pods to make ice_cream and i suspect that i have paid way too much for vanilla recently by buying from a supermarket .
M	schwartz put their pods in the same jars they use for all their spices ; totally inappropriate packaging as they have to bend the pods to put them in the jar .
M	i bought 00 pods from vanilla mart for less_than the price of two supermarket pods .
M	they were at_least 0cm longer and packaged better .
M	great product and great service , will_definitely use them again .
M	ordered a pair of raybans , came on time with great customer_service .
M	would recommend this website to anyone .
M	i hadn ' t used chillisauce before but i went on a stag organised via the company and was impressed with the organisation of the weekend .
M	when it came down to me to organise a stag , i didn ' t hesitate to book through them .
M	the prices are fair and the staff really help you tailor the experience .
M	we stayed in edinburgh during the fringe and the location couldn ' t have been better .
M	there are add on extras like activities such as highland games , paintballing , quad_biking which is great .
M	nearly everything is organised for you - all you need to do is turn_up !
M	i ' ve been ordering from supplement_warehouse for 0 years and have always had a great experience .
M	thier price_match has come in handy a few_times , and they always have the lowest_prices around .
M	plus you get free_stuff with every order !
M	very pleased thanks
M	shopto is the very best game shop i , ve ever used , the prices are so competitive , and always seen to be cheaper_than other online_retailers .
M	the service is second to none .
M	ive been with shopto for a couple of years now and have not once recieved a game late , ( after release_date ).
M	on ocasions i sometimes get it a day before_release_date which i find amazing and is really good to show my friends on psn that i , ve the game early or on time .
M	i saw a video of how the games get selected and dispatched and was shocked how the machines get the games out faster_than any other online games company .
M	its a thing shopto should be proud of !
M	i will remain to shop at shopto and tell my friends to do so too , as i think its the best personal service anyone can get from a internet gaming shop .
M	thanks shopto

M	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller_than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital photos .
M	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
M	they looked awful in the photo album i had purchased .
M	quick delivery though and customer support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
M	have studied a few course and have enjoyed them all
M	everything went_smoothly even the after service - very friendly .

M	the adverts never seem to have a problem .......... think about it !!!
M	!
M	i found this site via google , i won ' t lie , i had my doubts when i placed my first order , but i went with it .

M	thanks for the great prices and keep up the great work guys !!
M	!
M	fantastically quick delivery of a set of headphones - ordered an in - stock item from amazon . co . uk half an_hour earlier and it hasn ' t arrived today .
M	found the site through a recommendation - now here ' s mine !
M	came with discount_voucher and a lolly - can ' t complain !
M	the service provided by double 0 is excellent .
M	i was delighted with the tickets i recieved for the ellie goulding gig that i go too on sunday
M	highly_recommended !
M	i can only recommend this keystore .
M	i bought fifa_00 and got it after a heartbeat .
M	nowhere else you get keys such cheap .
M	the post back envelope arrived_promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .
M	will use again .
M	they are excellent and fast at delivering my products , always have the best prices , even shipping cost isnt too bad with all those free products and super_fast delivery
M	the company had the cheapest price for the product i wanted ; this did not come at the expense of service , quality or delivery .
M	with a small delivery charge , my package came with two days .
M	the product was secured and packaged efficiently with the product being brand_new with no damage .
M	00 / 00
M	i like this website
M	bought a game key due to be released in 0 days .
M	got the key the next_day as soon as they were available .

M	easy to buy
M	great service

M	great service
M	my relatively_small order was shipped on the next working day , the product was adequately packed and arrived_safely , i was kept_informed_throughout the process ( e_- mails for order and dispatch confirmations )
M	great prices , good quality item .
M	unfortunately my costume was a bit damaged upon_arrival but was the manufactures fault .
M	fanciedress were great and sent out new costume instantly before i had even sent mines .
M	and to top it off they paid the return_postage .
M	great company will_definitely_recommend to friends and shop in the future .
M	excellent , highly_reccomended .
M	ticket was even cheaper_than the face_value and it was sold out .
M	a ++
M	i have used hostel_bookers previously before and i simply cannot_fault them .
M	the ease at booking a night is so good .
M	they are number one in my opinion and the fact that they charge no booking_fees makes everything so much_better !
M	thanks again hostel_bookers
M	the site is very nicely_designed with a user_friendly layout .
M	it is very easy to find your account and see what you have ordered and when you will receive it .
M	it also has very responsive and helpful staff who have helped my recover my account recently and also has the prices i have seen on the internet .
M	i don ' t want that first sentence to sound crazy so i ' ll explain , i was buying 0 rtd muscle_milk drinks a day and they were 0 for $ 0 , well the protein i just bought had 00 servings and simple math showed me i saved 000_dollars compared to buying them the way i was .
M	very glad i found this site and it saved me a lot of money .
M	i would def_recommend the site / business .
M	they will beat anybody ' s price and add a reasonable shipping charge .
M	never had an issue with delivery either .
M	i give them all my business and tell others to as well .
M	the game was delivered to me in under fifteen minutes despite the weird time_frame on when i ordered it .
M	i was installed the game with little trouble .
M	no issues arose and there was no need to ever contact them .
M	great service , can ' t believe i have received such a pleased service , they are truely professional & at the same time very polite , helpful & humble people .
M	absolutely awesome , excellent & fabulous service i have received .
M	my very big sofa was collected on time , i was well informed about the dates & timings , seller was equally informed , hence a great communication .
M	my sofa couldn ' t go through the stair case because stair case is narrow .
M	boy put his brain & spent their time in sorting it out .
M	within few minutes my sofa was in my living_room .
M	they not only placed the sofa where we wanted , they also did the job arranging the stuff around .
M	i cannot get a service better_than them anywhere .
M	a true example of best customer_service .
M	hats_off to boy .
M	thanks a lot , would always take their service & would recommend 000_%.
M	you can take my words for sure .
M	u won ' t be disappointed at all
M	i am very pleased
M	thanks ,
M	amaresh
M	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
M	imagine a delivery company that turns up in your postcode , doesn ' t ring your buzzer , doesn ' t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
M	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
M	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
M	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
M	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
M	what are they thinking might happen ?
M	there are a few things i can ' t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
M	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
M	good experience ordering , and communications were good up until delivery .
M	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
M	product arrived and it ' s ok . quite average craftsmanship .
M	the tiles are perfect - fantastic value , and a great product .
M	the delivery not so good .
M	Â£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don ' t even deliver to your flat .
M	driver told us they can ' t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
M	not so classy , guys .
M	quick delivery , excellent product , great service .
M	very , very impressed with these_guys .
M	makes me want to buy another mattress !
M	provided the exact_same product to my previous_supplier , however their prices where more competitive and above all they delivered when they said they would no up to 0 weeks late ( like my previous_supplier )
M	easy to contact and fast to reply to emails .
M	i have already place another slightly bigger order and would have no_hesitation in recommending premier lockers .
M	first order fine although received a few_days late .
M	my second and larger order has been a complete_shambles .
M	i ordered the same product by in slightly larger quantities .
M	was given a delivery date via_email confirmation .
M	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
M	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don ' t know i don ' t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let me know and was again told i don ' t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
M	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
M	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .
M	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
M	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
M	* in response to workwear_express reply *
M	a copy and pasted reply is not good customer_service , and saying " i will look_into what occurred to ensure that these sorts of problems don ' t arise for future customers " is pointless just reading the first 00 or so reviews you ' ve said this at_least 0 times , so either you ' ve not looked into what occurred as you claim or you ' ve not sorted things out .
M	its amazing that you ' ve failed to reply to my emails yet within minutes you reply to my review and contact me regarding my paypal_dispute .
M	if you are in fact sorry as you claim to be give me a refund and learn and take on board what the reviews say instead of simply offering a generic reply and forgetting about it .
M	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
M	avoid this company as any order your place will result in your money being lost and nothing to show for it .
M	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
M	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
M	i am only on my second month with plus net and i ' m on my third fault .
M	trying to get someone to listen when reporting a fault is like pulling teeth .
M	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
M	on all 0 occasion after the 00_hours is up they send an_email_saying the support ticket has been closed as your internet is now connected .
M	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
M	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
M	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
M	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .
M	well plus . net i consider you to be in breach of our contract and will now be terminating my services , 00 month_contract or not .
M	complete_shambles and complete_waste of time run by people who cannot think for themselves only readying auto prompt of their computer screens .
M	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
M	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
M	i have a good anti virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
M	don ' t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
M	quick delivery at good prices with a good selection of products .
M	would recommend
M	very poor , been waiting on a delivery for 0 weeks now tracking keeps saying tried to deliver .
M	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .
M	we ' ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
M	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
M	hostelbookers is so much cheaper and didn ' t charge any booking_fee .
M	as i am a student , this really give me a great offer and it ' s not annoying like other website .
M	thank_you hostelbookers for helping me to save my money for the travel and i trusted you .
M	will_definitely make my booking from hostelbookers from now on !
M	! i
M	bought grid autosport black edition and it was the cheapest place to buy it , was a bit_worried as i haven ' t seen the website and heard of it , they were a great service thank_you .
M	a lot of my pc parts arrived this week and still_waiting for hen to ship my motherboard and my monitor suddenly had a mark in it and contacted them and they are sending a replacement straight_away
M	amazing shipping and they are very quick on shipping there items u have to pay for it , but it ' s worth it cause they are really good , i hope i don ' t encounter any_problems s with the item i bought from them as i haven ' t dealt_with their customer_service yet
M	i ordered 0 corsair 000d cases for me and my little bros build , after ordering it and reading the reviews i was really afraid if it would happen to me and after that i was trying to get a refund they said they were gonna dispatch it already they said i can refuse delivery and get a refund i said nvm ill keep the item .
M	they responded really quick thumbs_up to them for that .
M	also tracking was easy with ups .
M	it arrived today no damage what so ever fast free shipping i would recommend them to anyone , i will shop with them again amazing prices came with english manual even if it was form france .
M	always search here for the items im looking to buy .
M	also get a discount through my work incentive scheme - amazon - keep doing what your doing - no faults whatsoever
M	im on 0mb connection however the connection is sooo slow , im hard wired and i have problems with my iphone , laptop and xbox speed .
M	these_guys know what quality products are and they have invested time and money in making them right for us , the consumer .
M	whether your a professional athlete or an amateur gym go - er not only is there kit stylish but also fully_functional .
M	i use their gym gloves and the gel system works really well to reduce calluses and sore joints .
M	amazing kit at an amazing price
M	quick , easy , cheap ( pricewise , quality was far from cheap ) and my girlfriend loved them .
M	thank_you so much !
M	great price , delivered next_day using a decent courier ( ups ), well_packaged , rang to confirm company name ( delivered to work ), was very polite and friendly on phone .
M	great , reliable company , highly_recommended !
M	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded_delivery , then got email_saying screen cracked which is a joke as this had bubble rap and was in a case , said phone screen cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has been sold to somebody_else .
M	never ever using this again !.
M	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .
M	0 you could have damaged it .
M	0 . what the point off sending phone back if its been damaged .
M	thats why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
M	use again !
M	.............................. update ..................................................
M	will never use again !
M	thats the end .
M	got top money for them .
M	an old tag 0000 , omega_seamaster and my pride and joy rolex seadweller .. just had a baby and ' the boss ' said i had to get_rid
M	as soon as my missus says so i will be buying from them , real watch pro ' s
M	excellent service , would use again !
M	super_quick service - it was that fast that to get any faster you would need to print it before i even placed my order ...
M	i have been buying from ebuyer for years , either by paying by card or getting credit i have not had one problem and it is even better when they give me free next_day delivery .
M	what makes it even better is you can order some items really late and get it the next_day .
M	i mainly stick to computer_components or entertainment products like my 00 " samsung i bought from them the other day at around 0pm and it was delivered the next_day .
M	so all in all ebuyer is one of the best companies i have found .
M	just wish they could stop tempting me to buy more stuff ;)
M	came_across onlycdkeys with google so looked at the reviews from previous purchasers on here and everything looked fine .
M	so i thought i would give it a go , and with in 0mins after registration and telephone verification i had 00 months ps plus instantly .
M	so yeah in one word " brilliant "
M	easy website to use and the items ordered were here next_day and also extremely cheap prices .
M	my father and i went to nepal in october this year in to attempt the everest base_camp trek with private himalaya / expeditions ( pe ).
M	the experience was amazing and one we will never forget , right from the start we were so well looked after by pe .
M	pimba , one of the guides and an everest summiteer met us at the aiprort and drove us straight to our hotel for a welcome beer after 00 hs of travel !
M	the next_day we were due to fly out to lukla and as many trekkers will know the planes do not fly from kathmandu to lukla unless the weather is perfect ... we were not so lucky and it took 0 days for us to get out to lukla in clear weather .
M	throughout the whole time at the aiport in kathmandu , pimba from pe did his absolute best each day to get us on any flight he could and really looked after us , ferrying us each day from the hotel to the airport and back when we weren ' t successful .
M	each night he came up with a plan for the next_day until we eventually flew out on the 0th day and started our trek .
M	for our actual trek we had our personal guide dorje and our porter dhjiban - both were brilliant .
M	we felt very safe with dorje and he was a lot of fun , although serious when he had to be to make_sure we understood things ( like not having alcohol on the way up to ebc !)
M	the attention to detail was pretty impressive , making_sure we ate and drank well , checking our oxygen levels each night and making_sure we were being honest about how we felt physically .
M	as we had lost the 0 days at the start dorje had to change the trek on the fly and did so brilliantly without rushing us , always telling us " slowly ... slowly "
M	dhijban our porter ( 00 years old ) was pretty awesome carrying our bags every day and beating is on each section of the trek ... embarrassing actually !
M	when we tipped him at the end he came to say thank_you and you could tell he was very genuine ... he was very shy !
M	after a few tough sleepless nights near ebc dorje was always more concerned_about our health than getting to the top but when we made it he took me up to the top of a steep ridge and we took some amazing photos for 00_mins before starting down in the snow !
M	dorje became a friend , we had an amazing experience together and we celebrated in style on the final night in lukla ... i will be going back and i will be asking dorje to be our_guide .... the next challenge looks_like island peak !
M	the best recommedation i could give is to use pe again and i will be doing that with my wife in the next 0 years .. island peak is a definite and there is always kili in the future which is what makes pe so impressive , their global scale .
M	my father and i would both highly_recommend pe to anyone thinking of going trekking or climbing ... thank_you to the whole pe team and i am sorry i took so long to write this but work has taken revenge on me for taking 0 . 0 weeks off in a row !
M	thanks very much

M	when it comes in shopping online there is no better place than amazon , they have all the products that you need from supplements , foods , etc ....
M	i often order bodybuilding supplements in amazon and it will arrive in my apartment 0 - 0 days after i ordered it , and the products are all in tact .
M	no questions about your money what you see is what you get when you shop at amazon .
M	no questions ask !
M	i was really amazed with this site , at first i have some doubt that it will just be another company that has some delays , but no i was shocked when i ordered my nokia phone and it was delivered 0 days after i ordered it .
M	i chat with the customer_service representatives and they answered all of my questions , even some of my questions are hard and cannot be found on the terms and privacy listed on the site , they still answered my questions .
M	i would love to recommend this company to anyone who loves to shop online .
M	two_thumbs_up !
M	shopto is just amazing everything its next_day .
M	hardware next_day by courier for free .
M	support is amazing as well .
M	my controller for xbox one has issues but because it was limited_edition they have to replace whole console bundle but believe it or not replacement only took 0 day .
M	yes 0 day !!!
M	just amazing company
M	i used hifi - tower to purchase radio microphones for karaoke use .
M	i received clear information throughout my transaction and also received fantastic support when i needed help with my purchase .
M	i would recommend this company to anybody who wishes to receive quick , professional help from a company who care about its customers .
M	excellent service and advice from graham , gives you his honest_opinions about buying the right digital_piano .

M	faultless .
M	pre_- ordered ( ni no kuni wotww )- wizards edition , free delivery , saved my self Â£_00 and the game came a day early , what more could a customer ask for .
M	i will be purchasing my games from shopto from now on , as long as they continue to have great deals , 0_stars :_d
M	a very good service overall was a bit late on delivery but was kept_informed by e_- mail at evry stage .
M	computer arived undamaged , ( concidering the lift was broke and i live on the forth floor ).
M	only down_side was i spent alot of money they could have trown in somthing to sweten the deal .
M	i always haggle at the stores when i ' m spending big money and always get some free bees .
M	overall 0 / 0
M	outstanding company .
M	this was the 0st time i have used this company and will be 000_% be using them again .

M	this site has never let me down and always has lots of products :)
M	great site
M	superb service every time
M	tried lots of different mens skin care products but dryhide moisturiser is by_far the best i have ever tried .
M	some great advice and info on their blog as well .
M	taxi travel is the best company for all your travelling needs .
M	never has taxi travel let me down !
M	they are always on time and get me to my destination in a prompt manner .
M	the pricing is always competitive and their service always exceeds expectation .
M	i would recommend them to anyone !
M	certainly worthy of these 0_stars !
M	they had the best price i could find , including with free delivery , and the item arrived a few_days earlier_than it ' s actual release_date .
M	couldn ' t be more happy and will_definitely use again
M	lauren_w of parcel0go . com was amazingly helpful she helped sort out my problem so quickly and efficiently she is a credit to the company .
M	i had a really big problem with one of the delivery companies and she sorted it out no problem and talked me through processes and answered all my questions in a professional yet friendly_manner .
M	i was in such a bad mood about all this delivery trouble i was having but now i know its been sorted out im happy again and its all thanks to lauren_w , so thank_you lauren you were wonderful
M	friendly staff , quality work , cheapest prices :) well_done .
M	ps_: just waiting time could improve as for changing tyres i have been waiting for an_hour is quite a lot , but i know , you don ; t know when exactly i was comming in as when you book in , you have just option am or pm .
M	this awful company let me down in couple of occasions .
M	couple of time they didn ' t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
M	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
M	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
M	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
M	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
M	and depot is about 00miles away from my house :) and phone customer support won ' t even give you phone number for the driver .
M	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
M	nice web_site , most of the parts what customer need it is there , fast shipment , just would be beneficial for you to allow customers pay by paypal .
M	the website gave loads of hostels to choose from , depending_on what you want and how much you have to spend .
M	made the booking process very simple and quick .
M	will_definitely be using again .
M	i found the website very easy to use the pre_- paid envelope arrived the next_day , i posted it off and the money was in my account the same day they acknowledged receipt of my phone ... you cant_beat that for service very fast and efficient .
M	i was told about this site from a friend and i thought he was using something untrustworthy .
M	a few_days_later i used the site and was amazed at the low_prices and how fast i got my cd_key sent to my email ( roughly 0 minute )
M	i did have 0 key which didnt work , i emailed them about the problem and i was provided with a new key very fast ... so the support is also excelent from this site .
M	i will_definately keep using this site in the future , 0_stars and a big_thumbs_up for cjs_cd_keys
M	always fast despatch time + delivery times , easy to communicate with !
M	what more can you ask for a * service !
M	saved Â£_00 off football_manager 0000 and had the working cd_key within minutes .
M	couldn ' t ask for anything more .
M	top quality service .
M	bought a few items from liberty_flights and in very happy with the quality of products and the price is great .
M	i highly_recommend libertyflights for all your vaping needs .
M	i have recently tried 00 of totally_wicked gold standard concentrates and i am very happy !!
M	some of the best concentrates around imo , around 00 - 00_% i find a good average for fruit flavours and only 0 % with tobacco .
M	i loved 00 of them - they are top_notch , amazing flavours to vape - especially cherry ( 00 %)+ menthol - mixed 00 / 00 ( 0 %).
M	im new to mixing but its been a huge success !
M	i also received a Â£_00 gift_card , very nice surprise !
M	service is second to none , can email and even ring them thanks totally_wicked .
M	good prices , great tasting juice !
M	service is excellent , pleasure to buy from , highly_reccomended !
M	i ' ve purchased suits in store and the customer_service and quality has been fantastic .
M	when purchasing on - line however , the customer_service is non_existent .
M	phoning the customer_service team over a period of three days led to no response .
M	only when i put my issue on the public profile of their facebook_page did i get a response .
M	the clothing is of good quality , there is no issue there .
M	i just wish they would actually have a customer_service team you could instantly get hold of .
M	i cannot_believe that people have had bad_experiences with this company .
M	i have purchased many products from cotswold outdoor , both instore and online .
M	every time i receive 00 / 00 customer_service , the products are always excellent and if on the odd chance the item does not fit or function properly , then i have always received a quick refund .
M	i will be shopping from this store for many years to come .
M	i ordered a leather restorer spray to treat my holdall and it was exactly_what was needed .
M	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
M	having read previous comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
M	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 ' s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more_than [_external reference_] or [_external reference ]).
M	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn ' t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .
M	haggling occurred and then finally i settled on a price as it was clear i was not going to receive my phones back .
M	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort out my details so i could get paid .
M	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
M	i can always trust that webtogs will not only have the gear i want at a competitive price , but will also provide a first_class customer_service .
M	bought an engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com amazing ring fantastic price .
M	wired0fire did a great job of making a custom - built_pc .
M	they replied to all my emails within a day - once i realised this was the case keeping_track of the order was great , as they could tell me exactly_what was going on , and they even install linux on the pc for me for a very reasonable additional_cost .
M	great stuff , will shop with them again .
M	ordered two items on line and opted for the next_day delivery option ... low and behold the very next_day by 00 am they were with me two fantastic products that were in a sale making them exceptional value and with the reward_scheme have made my experience even better for value will certainly be using facewest again and again it certainly looks as though the loyalty is rewarded i have already told my climbing partner where to come for his next purchase
M	i have ordered liquid from them and order came through slightly wrong , but after one e_- mail to customer_services it got sorted really well as i received missing item next_day .
M	very good experience and would recommend them to anyone .
M	the holiday was better_than_expected , very helpful staff , perfect oranisation , lookin for next year `_s with them at the moment :)
M	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
M	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
M	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
M	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
M	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else ' s incompetence .
M	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over Â£_000 .
M	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
M	apparently the refund request hadn ' t gone_through , so we had to request it again , waiting another 0 days until we got our money back .
M	firstly , my home hub kept dropping connection , so i had to call to get a replacement .
M	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
M	i got a new one , but then my bt vision stopped_working .
M	again i had to jump_through hoops to get this resolved ... but it never did .
M	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
M	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
M	nope .
M	they charged me Â£_000_+ to cancel .
M	thanks bt .
M	but wait , there ' s more .
M	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
M	this was the final_straw .
M	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
M	they also charged us Â£_00 for a month without any service which we tried to get refunded .
M	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
M	it ' s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
M	goodbye bt .
M	hello sky .
M	great site for finding offers on lip balms and nail_polishes which is helpful for when buying gifts .
M	extensive_range on colours and fast delivery with easy to use website .
M	could be a site i use regularly ...
M	called up floridatix to get various theme park tickets for the family trip to orlando this summer .
M	very friendly service and all the tickets arrived within 00_hours .
M	we ' re very excited to go and chuffed with the service .
M	will_definately_recommend or use again if we decide to go back to orlando .
M	just as i expected , nothing too fancy but not too bad either .
M	did the job and for a a cheap flight and i had a great holiday .
M	i can see again !
M	awesome website with great choice .
M	catwalk feature really helps to bridge the gap between website and high_street shop .
M	always good stuff at great prices , big_fan !
M	i will come back and recommend .
M	thank_you !!
M	!
M	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
M	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
M	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
M	i have immediately submitted a returns request and have cancelled my order .
M	they may have the best prices , but it ' s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
M	treated myself to a business class seat from arlanda to heathrow .
M	the business lounge was very bland .
M	boarding the aircraft , i found two children sat in my seat , asked them to move , to which a very rude father replied that i should seat where the children should be sitting .
M	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
M	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
M	on time .
M	an entirely hassle_free process .
M	i entered what was required online , printed one document and because i was eager for my money , i sent it in a padded bag that i had lying_around .
M	although it ' s freepost , i ' d recommend queueing at the post_office for a proof of posting , just for the Â£_00 compensation cover should your phone go missing in transit .
M	within three days my phone had been received and the money was in my account !
M	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
M	so impressed that my partner has sent their phones to mazuma as well , and they got exactly the same great service !
M	highly_recommended !
M	have had some issues with paypal re payment , the seller has been so good and patient , keeping in touch and responding to all my messages .
M	as soon as payment was received - item was dispatched and received next_day .
M	also item was very good value for money .
M	highly_reccomended .
M	thank_you .
M	arunas .
M	great products at very good prices for what they are !
M	some of the best out there on the market .
M	fast delivery comes within 0 - 0 days of ordering , very efficient !
M	very pleased costumer and will_definitely be purchasing again in the future , 0_stars assured .
M	very quick delivery and great products on offer , would recommend to anyone !
M	fab service extremly helpful and understandable helped_me with my depression needed glasses asap , very very very good service staff and company thumbs_up !!
M	!
M	probably the best and smoooooooth transactions ever very quick and class service , defenatley recomend
M	long_story short , royal_mail lost my package and i spent 0 weeks on the phone with automated switchboards before they admitted they lost it .
M	then i was told i had to contact the seller and get them to send the item out again and that the seller could apply for reimbursement .
M	i was worried that this was going to be even more hassle as bannafingers hadn ' t done a thing wrong , why should they be out of pocket ?
M	but i rang them up ( phone was picked_up on the first ring !)
M	and 0 minutes later my replacement trousers where ordered , with free next_day delivery to apologise for royal_mails mistake !
M	and half the phone call was having a nice moaning session about the post service .
M	amazing company !
M	i had a problem and they fixed it immediately , no faff and no red tape .
M	i feel a sudden pang of loyalty to bananafingers now and will buy here a lot more often with the knowledge that any_problems will be sorted .
M	we ' ve used our local_branch of national for years and have nothing negative to say .
M	they are prompt , professional , courteous and have always shown themselves to be reliable .
M	what can i say about wired0fire ?
M	where to begin is the question .
M	i shall begin with some background first .
M	i set out to build a custom_pc , for simulations and extreme graphics performance .
M	this was 0 years_ago .
M	the fabled alienware pc was an inviting option , but after_placing my order with them , my parts failed to materialise for a fortnight .
M	i did some reviews and seeing the decline in customer_satisfaction , i bailed ship and requested a refund .
M	then i found a small company called wired0fire .
M	they had some good reviews , as did plenty of other_companies i found on the net .
M	but what made me trust them from the start , was the professional and knowledgable team of people that greeted me on the phone .
M	not once but several_times i rang them to ask questions and they knew their stuff inside out .
M	also , they answered the phone within five rings and were always polite and helpful .
M	so i to took the plunge and invested my hard_earned cash with them .
M	and , i can proudly say , here iam 0 years later smiling contently at the beast that purrs beside my desk .
M	one thing that was important for me when i was purchasing the pc was future proofing it for as long as possible .
M	i wanted to make_sure i could upgrade as time went by and the system i wanted was faithly built as per my instructions .
M	over the years i upgraded the graphics_cards , then i went sli ( twin graphics_cards for increased rendering performance ) and increased the amount of ram .
M	one thing to note .
M	they say actions speak louder than words .
M	unfortanetly , i cannot show you what this pc can do but i will tell you of an experience i had when i contacted wired0fire about 0 years_ago .
M	i was using 0000gtx sli at the time and i wanted to upgrade to 000gtx sli .
M	i rang up wired0fire to ask if i could upgrade , or if there was anything i should be aware of .
M	they could have just sold me the 000gtx cards , saying they wil work on my system , but they didnt .
M	they pulled up my computer data from their records and advised that i would require different power connections for the 000gtx to work .
M	there was also other concerns that might lead to potential issues and wired0fire advised that the 000gtx would be the next best thing to go for .
M	the 000gtx was more_expensive .
M	they could have sold that to me and left me to get on with it .
M	they had no obligation to assist me as my warranty had expired years before .
M	so , i think its clear that wired0fire are not money grabbers , out to make a quick buck .
M	i can_honestly say , that even after all this time , i can still ring them up and they will help me through thick and thin .
M	they still answer that phone within five rings and the person on the end of the phone is not a call_centre .
M	this review is more of a thankyou .
M	i sincerely thank_you toby , peter and the team for the standards you set out to reach and for maintaining excellant customer_services and satisfication .
M	your computers are the best .
M	you have won my respect and i cant tell you how difficult it is to find companies like yourselves in todays money driven market .
M	to anyone reading this review , considering whether to purchase through wired0fire or not .
M	i can tell you this , no one can beat them .
M	they have a morale standard of excellance that you dont find in many companies today .
M	most of them are out to get your money .
M	these_guys are out to show you what you missing out on .
M	if you want to go elite , then give them a call and you wont look back , you wont_regret it .
M	my second order with digitalrev 0x happy .... recommended !
M	if you are thinking about buying anything from this company .... forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times .... no one ever picks_up the phone .... i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it .... i has been 0 weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
M	still_waiting for a solution from them !
M	marcos
M	this site was recommended to me by a friend so i decided to check it out .
M	i was immediately blown_away by the low_prices and assortment of items .
M	supplement_warehouse hase everything imaginable and for a low price .
M	plus you can add tons of free items to your order , which is awesome !
M	very happy with the site .
M	a great website with all the info you need .
M	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
M	really happy and i will use again when i find something that i want .
M	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
M	as always with british_airways i had a great experience , friendly staff , on time and comfortable .
M	i flew from germany via heathrow to newcastle and had a stress - free flight .
M	i have flown with ba several_times and still have yet to be dissapointed
M	from the moment i applied for their pack the whole_process was quick .
M	my return envelope arrived within two days allowing me to send my old_phones off .
M	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn ' t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
M	the cheque was for the money i had been quoted .
M	overall i was very happy with the service .
M	i set_up a vps with heart and in the same day discovered that the server backup costs were way more_than i had imagined .
M	i had moved from rackspace to save money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
M	i spoke to heart and they were happy to cancel the account which was great , unfortunately they refused to refund any money .
M	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over Â£_000 for less_than a day ' s hosting .
M	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
M	companies with that kind of money grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
M	i made two orders - one a couple of days before_christmas and one a couple of days after .
M	both arrived in less_than 00_hours which was very impressive considering the time of year .
M	the items were also the best priced i could find on the internet and arrived in perfect_condition , couldn ' t ask for more .
M	ordered a pedal board case and it arrived next_day can ' t complain hassle_free will use gak again .
M	it ' s been 0 days since i ordered now and i ' ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
M	very quick delivery high_quality products for low_prices .
M	was using amazon back in the days of them only selling books and on a dial - up internet_connection .
M	never once had an issue .
M	pretty_much what all e_- commerce businesses should aspire to .
M	i ' ve been ordering from moby memory for over a year , they ' ve always provided a reliable service .
M	i ordered a micro_sd last_week and got it today , i ' ll definitely be ordering from them in future .
M	quick delivery , thanks .
M	i purchased a stuburt rain jacket that unfortunately developed a fault .
M	sent a picture of the fault to golf000 and within a few hours they got back to me stating that if i returned it then they would send out a brand_new one asap .
M	now that ' s customer_service .
M	thank_you !
M	to anyone in and around the derby area , buy your clubs from here !
M	went to purchase a 0 wood and was blown_away by the customer_service there .
M	was fully fitted for my new r00 0 wood and was given some invaluable swing tips to boot .
M	oh and they were exactly the same price as the golf websites so great value for money as well .
M	try them !
M	did the job but prices not the cheapest !
M	ordered 0 footjoy gloves ( sci_- flex and pure touch ), price was excellent and delivery was 0 days .
M	would say notification e_- mails of order status could be better but that ' s only a minor_issue !
M	these_guys are scam_artists !
M	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
M	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
M	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
M	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking down and having tried to contact us .
M	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding reception ).
M	now they refuse to refund us on the basis that only 0 coach turned_up and worse they keep changing their story as to why they feel they are not at fault .
M	i ' m now taking this up with my solicitor as well as the confederation of passenger transport uk .
M	you ( the public ) have been warned !!
M	!
M	i use interlink on a daily_basis and have to say that they have been impeccable since i ' ve been with them ( especially compared to the nightmare that was dhl who i used before ).
M	only thing is i wish they were able to offer more competitive_prices for shipping to northern_ireland ( still have to use dhl for that ).
M	staff at my local_depot are beyond excellent and importantly they are reachable on a direct line and always answer within a couple of rings .
M	with dhl you get put in a queue to speak to some teenager who hasn ' t got a clue and couldn ' t care less .
M	keep it up interlink and don ' t rest on your laurels !
M	couldnt be eny happyer with the prices thx ...
M	easey way to sell best place
M	i order a single baseball cap with a home made logo on it as a test of the quality of the products made by this company .
M	the image i gave them was not high_quality and they tried to tell me this .
M	unfortunately their emails got lost in my junk_mail folder , and when i finally checked this folder they had gone ahead and made the cap with the image i sent .
M	the cap that arrived was well made , and the printed image was much higher quality than i ever imagined .
M	the customer_service people that tried to contact my were polite , helpful and were trying their best to give my the best quality item they could .
M	after about 0 attempts to contact me they made the cap as best as they could and i am very satisfied with the quality , speed of delivery , and the company as a whole .
M	i will be ordering more from this company very soon
M	i am extremely impressed by westin_gourmet .
M	being somebody who has been raised to be paranoid about food safety , especially when it comes to chicken , i was very wary about ordering meat online .
M	but due to being about to begin a fitness diet where i would be eating excessive amounts of chicken_breast , i decided to look_into buying it in bulk .
M	after a bit of research , i came_across westin_gourmet ' s wonderful website , and regardless of my apprehension about having meat posted to me , i found myself intruiged .
M	the sheer amount of choice on offer immediately captivated me and made me salivate , and the brilliant prices just made it all the more appealing .
M	deciding to take a risk ( slight exaggeration , i did a lot of research online first to make_sure they were a reliable company ) i made an order of 00kg of chicken_breast .
M	not only that , but after hunting through their numerous good deals i managed to acquire a free corn - fed whole chicken to go with it ( this deal has now expired but they appear to have frequent new deals so have a look ).
M	when my box arrived i excitedly opened it up , not knowing what to expect .
M	i immediately could see that my worries had been for nothing - the chicken_breasts were sealed in sturdy professional plastic packaging ( seemed more solid than what i get at tesco ), the whole chicken nicely contained in a bag , surrounded_by ice packs that were still frozen solid , and then encased in padding , all inside the box .
M	and i got a box of freezer bags for free too !
M	all this i promptly put in the freezer , very pleased with my decision .
M	but of course , the final test was to come - the meat itself .
M	for the price i paid , i half expected some steroid - filled water - injected live chicken to be sat staring_at me , its pupils enormous from the cocktail of chemicals it had been fed on .
M	but of course ( thank_god !)
M	this was also just foolishness on my part .
M	because not only is the price per chicken_breast much much_better_than any pitiful attempt at a deal i have received from the local supermarkets , it is also very decent meat !
M	i had unwittingly grown used to eating chicken_breast which had been bloated on water by money - hungry supermarkets , and so was very pleased when i cut into one of the enormous chicken_breasts from westin_gourmet and found it to be just pure meat !
M	no water - injection , no added salt , just the genuine taste of good quality chicken .
M	now of course , my review isn ' t all encompassing - i am yet to try one of their many appealing steaks , any of their wide_range of sausages and burgers , or their luscious looking lamb , but i most definitely will be doing so in the near_future , and i have every confidence that this company will impress me again and again .
M	i can ' t recommend this company enough .
M	for years i had been buying expensive supplements from online websites , slowly watching my money disappearing on products which would not last more_than a few weeks .
M	it was disheartening .
M	then i found out about myprotein . com , and initially , i assumed for their prices they had to be either an incredibly well - made scam , or incredibly low quality .
M	however , after hunting for reviews and opinions on them , i began to realise the truth - they were genuine !
M	now , i have been using them for years , and would not use anybody_else - the quality of their products speak for themselves , and not only are the prices significant lower_than the brand - name supplements , but they come in much larger quantities too !
M	i adore this company , and feel that the only reason people can possibly be buying the more_expensive brand - name products has to be either a magpie - like attraction to colourful labels , or that they simply have not yet been directed to myprotein . com .
M	i know i am gushing on , and so may sound false , but if you have a bit of money spare , buy some creatine from myprotein . com and from a more_expensive online_retailer , test them both out , and you will understand fully .
M	long live myprotein . com !
M	!
M	had a good look around on the internet to find a supplier who not only had the right products .
M	but also at a very competitive price .
M	will be going back again for more stock
M	i went with affordablemobiles after three offered a poor deal , affordablemobiles had the same deal but no upfront cost and Â£_00 cashback .
M	i ordred at 0pm friday and it arrived saturday_morning at 0am at my work !
M	i was amazed !
M	brilliant service .
M	would recommend to all .
M	i ' ve used fonebanker for years every since my se k000 .
M	you can get more money from other_companies but fonebanker is easy to use and fast payment times .
M	always amazing and on time .
M	excellent choice of products !
M	i recently_bought an electronic drum_kit for myself , excellent price on the website and such fast , free delivery .
M	the only_drawback i can think of was the delivery man was really grumpy but that ' s fedex not gak !
M	this is the easiest transaction i ' ve ever done online .
M	check value
M	receive bag
M	send
M	??
M	?
M	profit !
M	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for quite a while now and have never been unhappy with anything i have purchased from them .
M	i generally pick_up a few things that are past date but guaranteed fresh and have never been dissapointed with these items either .
M	thank_you supplement_warehouse !
M	can ' t wait to rock the new t -_shirts i ordered .
M	fantastic quick service thanks to chris day of i independent merchant services for getting us all set_up to take card payments .
M	will be recommending to my other business friends :)
M	very misleading and terms of contract are shocking .
M	do not take out a product or service with this company .
M	i have since cancelled my policy
M	just want to say how helpful your on line chat service is .
M	i had a problem with collection today and isabella helped out by re arranging my collection for tomorrow .
M	thanks again parcel0go !
M	!
M	0nd review : thank_you once again sammie_taylor .
M	you were most helpful and patient in helping me out again .
M	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
M	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
M	the item has sold out also so i ' m increasingly worried that they couldn ' t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they ' ve not responded to my e_- mails .
M	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
M	very easy and very fast .
M	i played on 000 a few_times now and they have always been fair and allowed me to withdraw my money promptly .
M	on top of doing everything they need to do as a casino 000 goes the extra_mile and always offers great promotions .
M	got a phone call to discuss my eligibility for a free boiler and the woman i spoke to talked me through everything and was very helpful .
M	would definitely_recommend .
M	i have ordered in the past and after two orders having fraud charges following them i decided not to order from this site anymore .
M	one thing however , their prices are the best around and that comes in handy when needing to support ones fitness habits .
M	plus they beat_competitors prices which is always a benefit .
M	one detractor is the shipping cost but when you use the thanks0 coupon_code it basically discounts the shipping to what you might pay with other_sites .
M	im giving a neutral review as for right now due to anticipating another possible fraud charge which i hope doesnt happen a third time ..
M	i enjoy shopping the large selections and the insane discounts i just cant seem to get my head around the fraud purchases me and my friends have received so this is only to be aware of the possibility of it happening to all the customers out there .
M	please call the customer_service line to report any fraud so they can immediately jump on it .
M	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
M	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
M	great service , and quick delivery !
M	will buy again !
M	nothing to complain_about .
M	kept you up to date with where your parcel was .
M	arrived on time .
M	no_complains .
M	will use again !
M	they sent emails keeping you up to date and dealt_with the request very fast .
M	i should add that the quote was for a broken phone and they gave me the price offered .
M	literally the best , fast and easiest money making way to get_rid of your ipad .
M	thanks so much :)
M	chosen purely_because they had by_far the best prices for the items i was looking for , the very quick delivery was an added_bonus .
M	i don ' t wanna sound like a cliche automated script , but ok , i ordered a bag from them , it was totally to my liking , dispatched and arrived quickly by dpd , and came with a free gift , and that was despite the fact it was a good Â£_00 less_than elsewhere !
M	i dunno about repeat_business because it ' s not something i regularly need to keep repurchasing , but if i do , i know where to go !
M	they have a good range of stock , all arrived within a few_days .
M	only a couple of gripes , seems they only have one set of prices regardless of weight or class , just different speeds .
M	also , there are a few more items they could have that their competitors stock , especially sushi related .
M	marj lopes at round the world experts was recommended to me by a good friend , and what a recommendation it was .
M	marj was great , she took my requirements and created an amazing itinerary for me .
M	she understood what i wanted from my trip and got me the best possible deal .
M	i would recommend marj to anyone .
M	top service - personal , efficient , great value
M	first time customer , placed a order for a canvas at 0 . 00am , had a email to say it was ready for collection at 00 . 00am
M	excellent service , great quality , would thoroughly_recommend and will be using in the future !
M	thank_you
M	got the tyres i wanted and made a massive saving on what i was quoted , def use again ..
M	sold 0 ipods , sent on a monday and paid what they quoted , money was in my account on the friday , very quick service , would use again .
M	disgusting service , 00 days_later item is not delivered and wont give a refund because " i still used the service "
M	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
M	either my hermes is really bad - or quite simply their customer advisors need some good training .
M	mazuma may pay less_than others but mazuma are honest and very quick with payment .
M	take a tenner less but you know you will get excellent service
M	tickets arrived on time and even called me when dispatched .
M	great service !
M	w . neil
M	on top of this they have a great refferal scheme .
M	i ' ve often shopped with zavvi , as they ' ll post some very competitive offers .
M	going online has served them well !
M	usually very competitive and their own products are great , delivery is free and very fast for free delivery !
M	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
M	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
M	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
M	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn ' t described properly and that they should change it .
M	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
M	after 0 or 0 e_- mails they eventually accepted that the description was wrong and gave me a poor_excuse for an_apology .
M	to this day , the headphone are still listed incorrectly .
M	do not buy from pixmania .
M	ever >
M	the title_says it all .
M	i bought a steam cd_key of bioshock_infinite .
M	the delivery was almost instantaneous and it worked .
M	the checkout is easy enough to navigate , as is the website itself .
M	it was also the cheapest price available anywhere for that game .
M	i don ' t normally_write_reviews in fact this is my first .
M	i would recommend this company to anyone .
M	they did exactly_what they said , they would do .
M	i ordered a phone & headset bundle on the 0 / 00 / 00 and it arrived the morning of 00 / 00 / 00 i even got an_email with and hour delivery slot and the guy was here bang on time .
M	the product was well_packaged when i opened everything was there and was up and running in a minute .
M	will_definitely be using again .
M	i was interested in a pair of cdj ' s so had been on the website a few_times to check prices etc and i wanted to know info about the bstock .
M	i rang the sales_team who instantly informed me of a better deal only available through the sales_team so i took them up on the deal .
M	great lads in the sales_team , arrived next_day without a hitch , i am now smashing out mixes of nightlife 0 - happy days .
M	no_complaints from me would not hesitate to use them again .
M	i made an order and i received it the very next_day .
M	great prices too !
M	ordered yesterday and received the very next_day .
M	0 hour eta .
M	what else can you ask .... great service !!
M	!
M	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
M	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
M	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn ' t hear from them .
M	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
M	currently , nobody answers the phone !
M	!
M	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
M	they called me next_day to inform me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
M	the customer_service agent assured me that i will receive it on tuesday .
M	i called them on tuesday and they told me that they did not receive new stock yet so i have to wait_until the end of the week or until monday , so apparently they don ' t know when .
M	this company is out of credibility .
M	this is not how a respectful companies do business .
M	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
M	they only post 0_stars reviews and this supports the incredibility claim .
M	i first found the website as they were selling some ski goggles that i wanted .
M	however , the price was cheaper elsewhere .
M	although they couldn ' t match the price , they did offer to reduce it and send the product out to me quicker_than the other website .
M	the man who i spoke to on the phone was very helpful , and even recognised me when i called back later regarding my order .
M	the item was received next_day , and shipping was included for free .
M	i ordered the bose qc0 from rgbdirect as they showed up on google_shopping as being the cheapest .
M	the website was not outstanding , however , they more_than made up for this with the price and the level of customer_service .
M	i spoke to somebody on the phone who followed up on stock_levels and called back .
M	he then called again to confirm the delivery date .
M	overall , i was very impressed with the level of customer_service .
M	i ' m basing this on a few purchases made over the last few_years .
M	generally , the prices are pretty good on expansys , offering cheaper alternatives to expensive branded products .
M	the delivery is actually pretty good and i have had no issues there .
M	i have two main things to complain_about .
M	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an_email every 0 - 0 days ).
M	i would prefer if they had a more intelligent system , whereby they sent me specific offers i would be interested in .
M	my second complaint is about the lightning to 00 - pin adapter i bought - i know trustpilot isn ' t generally for product reviews , but this was an expansys branded product so i feel it is justified .
M	the product description showed the same features as the standard apple adapter - support for charging , sync , analog audio , usb audio , and yet the product did not work as designed with a docking station or fm transmitter .
M	i am still_awaiting a response from expansys on this , after which i may update this review .
M	i know a lot of people have got bad things to say about carphone_warehouse - i don ' t know if they have issues in terms of contract phones , but for ordering an offline phone they were pretty good .
M	i ordered the iphone 0 on the first pre_- order day from the apple_store online with a delivery time of 0 - 0 weeks after the release_date of friday 00 september_0000 .
M	however , due to some changing travel_plans , i cancelled the order .
M	i then checked the carphone_warehouse website , which showed a delivery date of monday 00 september and the same price as the apple_store .
M	i phoned to confirm this as it seemed too good to believe , and it turned_out to be true - i was however told that it may possibly be delivered on tuesday if there are any unexpected delays .
M	to my surprise , the phone actually arrived on friday 00 september ( the release_date of the phone ).
M	this was great - i managed to get the new iphone , on the day of release , without having to queue for hours at the apple_store !
M	ordering online was much_easier , especially with available sizes .
M	however , there are a few improvements i would suggest :
M	0 .
M	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
M	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
M	for example , with the occasion suits , you are offered things like shirts on the same page , with no detailed images of the shirts being worn without the suit jacket .
M	0 .
M	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
M	it ' s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
M	great for mindless browsing , not so good for finding what you want .
M	0 .
M	charging shipping on a Â£_000 order is a bit cheeky .
M	from all the online shopping i have done , i have found even where shipping isn ' t free ( it normally is ), it is at_least free for higher value orders ( e . g .
M	over Â£_00 or over Â£_000 ).
M	0 .
M	while i like the idea of not being charged for your product until you are happy with it , it makes the ordering_process confusing .
M	it also tries to lure you into subscribing to the magazine without making recurring charges clear .
M	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
M	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
M	quality of the products were good .
M	shipping was on time so no_complaints on that side .
M	i ordered a shirt for a wedding from mytuxedo , and it was better value than anywhere_else i had seen .
M	the site looked professional and was easy to use .
M	everything was well integrated with their couriers so that i received updates from both_sides at the correct times .
M	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
M	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
M	however , on my most_recent delivery , i was very clear about the location .
M	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
M	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
M	i used the website to just arrange collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
M	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
M	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three times with no answer .
M	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let me in .
M	all in all , i think it ' s a terrible service .
M	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
M	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
M	i don ' t want to have to sift through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
M	surely you can ask for more information in the user profile and then choose offers accordingly ?
M	on a more positive note , the offers are usually pretty good .
M	i ' ve taken_advantage of a couple of them .
M	have used crucial before to order ram for my machine as theirs is one of the best rated .
M	the selector on the site makes it much_easier to choose the correct product .
M	i ordered yesterday_afternoon with the ( free ) standard delivery and got the item this morning .
M	i love receiving firebox emails and going on the website .
M	they have an interesting range of products , and they don ' t annoy me with a barrage of emails .
M	no issues when i have ordered with them in the past .
M	i love using the ba website and executive club .
M	all of my flights are easy to manage , and with the app , mobile boarding and the ba credit_card , everything just seem to work seamlessly .
M	i ' ve ordered many_times over the years from amazon .
M	never had any_issues with payment , delivery or any other part of the service .
M	i had an issue with a product just once , and despite the manufacturer being completely_useless , amazon solved my problem quickly and easily .
M	i will_definitely be using this site again

M	there no central then that .. just in the main placa catalunya , where barca celebrate theirf football winning parties ,
M	the place smell and look like new , everything so clean and been taking care ... its amazing !!
M	we been intreduced to the other guests and they made sure to put us in the guest_list of some of the clubs for tonight ( free entry )
M	dont think_twice - book it !
M	thank_you sean -- you make us feel at homa :)

M	good service with all the information i needed
M	i ordered an ipod fm transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
M	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
M	i emailed again , same response .
M	i read the reviews and decided i was going to lose out one way or another so i bombarded them with an_email every three hours or so in large text and started then on the complaints @ datakits . co . uk .
M	they have not replied but my item has now been dispatched ... despite telling them i want a refund .
M	lets_see what turns up first ... my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
M	seriously ... sending my luggage from the uk to france was crazy fast and painless !!
M	i ' ll definitely keep on using this service and i recommend it to anyone !
M	!
M	went to google_shopping to look for some spray paint and found ffx to be a really good price .
M	reasonable postage cost too .
M	they accepted paypal so i went_ahead and ordered .
M	it arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
M	very pleased with the service and will certainly use them again .
M	added them to my favourites straight_away .
M	very cheap deals and arrived very quickly with superb packaging , would definately buy from here again
M	having bought the engagement_ring for my fiancee in march_0000 from quality diamonds , we returned to purchcase both of our_wedding_rings from quality diamonds too .
M	the service , choice and quality of the items is absolutely first rate and the company are a real pleasure to deal with .
M	there is no pressure to purchase ( unlike many other_places in hatton gardens ) and the prices are very good indeed .
M	all in all , thoroughly_recommended and the whole team are great to work with .
M	the interface of the site is quite intuitive - all needed fields are right at the place they have to be .
M	data array is awesome - hundreds of hostels and good prices , really .
M	more_than that , each hostel provide plenty of details about it - dozens of photos , all_kinds of rooms and exact prices , precise location and so on .
M	integration with maps and guest reviews rise the level of usage experience .
M	the only little thing that was a little uncomfortable - i couldn ' t find a way to look for specific hostel at the site , but sure that there are an option for it .
M	very nice !!!
M	!
M	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
M	no response to complaint email even after there stated 00 day responce time .
M	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
M	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won ' t be back not to be trusted !
M	been plagued by text_messages confirming delivery slot and date on 0 seperate deliverys .
M	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
M	ii ' d give them a miss !
M	would highly_recommend very efficient fast services , products arrive in good condition and with excellent use by dates .
M	also one of the cheapest sites around !
M	i saved over Â£_00 on a year â_s flea and worm treatment for my two cats ( by vets prescription ) which you think would slow things down , the items still arrived next_day after emailing my prescription straight after the order for my products .
M	all you have to do is attach your order no and email your vet â_s prescription to the address provided , and my products still arrived the next working day .
M	also you have the opportunity to leave a comment or note with your order as in the past my items from other suppliers have been sent in a jiffy_bag and have arrived crushed , i asked for my items to be sent in a box to avoid this using the comments / notes box on the order form and that â_s exactly_what they did .
M	would not hesitate to recommend to anyone or to use again !
M	i also had to put my cat with allergies back onto a prescription diet this order was also received the following working day by city_link less_than 00_hours after the order was placed !
M	fantastic .
M	a *****
M	love this site .
M	easy was to earn money without even thinking about ti .
M	you can do your online shopping as normal .
M	then visit the site before you buy and earn a little mint .
M	a must if you are signing_up to a subscription service .
M	i really like using ebuyer , not only is it one of the few stores listed on topcashback that sells computer_components and peripherals , but it also and has a very user_friendly design and very comprehensive search_function .
M	i haven ' t had a problem with deliveries in the past and it gets fairly steady flow of customer reviews on each product .
M	very pleased with the service .
M	very easy to use website - makes the act of sinning with a dirty takeaway even more effortless .
M	no more fighting over who calls up and sends the order , you can simply pass round your laptop and add what you want .
M	huge_variety of food and widely utilised by many of the takeaways so you can pretty_much get anything you want - from your standard pizzas to caribbean , sweets , and booze .
M	i ' d also like to add in the early days i had several orders that went missing that i never received .
M	you can go onto the justeat website and talk to a rep via a chat window - i did this and got a full_refund every time .
M	very impressed with the expedient repair on my phone .
M	iphone 0 smashed front and back with various chips all around .
M	i received the phone back in outstanding condition .
M	i would certainly recommend repairs0everyone to anyone !
M	!
M	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty_goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
M	i will not touch them with barge poll after my experience .
M	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn ' t charge you a fortune .
M	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
M	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
M	i was a member there before all my troubles started i am now leaving this place well alone .
M	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
M	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn ' t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
M	impressive speed but not much good if your not in .
M	luckily a family_member was at home at the time of delivery .
M	the item i had ordered arrived in a robust box but was far to big and had no packaging to stop it rolling around .
M	again i was lucky the manufacture had done a better job with its own packaging so the item arrived in good condition .
M	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
M	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
M	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
M	unfortunately it did not work .
M	i phoned and emailed many_times .
M	the unit was eventually collected 00 days after delivery and the refund was done 00 days after delivery .
M	i think that ' s appauling customer_service .
M	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer_service .
M	i ' ve always had a good experience using hungryhouse .
M	i can say anymore , other than , i will_continue to use them !
M	i really can ' t fault the guys at why buy new .
M	i ' ve used them several_times both instore and online .
M	i just wouldn ' t recommend the courier company they use , as the driver delivered my parcel to a flat 0 blocks away !
M	great service thanks
M	great prices , everything was booked online , with a follow_up phone - call almost_immediately to confirm prices and booking details .
M	fitter was prompt and helpful , and managed to fit both tyres in a crowded car_park with very little room !
M	website is fantastically easy to use , i was looking at hiring a tuxedo but found the parts i was missing at mytuxedo for a brilliant price .
M	sets are cheap , mix and match items are well - priced - have not worn my shirt and tie yet but have tried it on for size and am pleased with the results .
M	great site !
M	000 quid cheaper_than going directly to the shop i had them fitted !!
M	recommend them highly
M	i bought a watch of watchfinder came the next_day i didnt like the watch the watch was fine just to big on my wrist i sent it back and got a refund without eny hassle so for me enyone looking to buy of these over the internet cant go far wrong thay even emailed to say thay had received it in the morning then emailed to say i had the money back in the afternoon no doubt some companys would mess u about n try and not refund u i will use these_guys again keep up the good service u wont go far wrong with watchfinder thats my experience with them enyway
M	i recently ordered a new av amp from this store .
M	they responded quickly to all correspondence , delivered the item when they said they would and had the best prices i could find online .
M	can ' t think of a reason to shop anywhere_else !
M	couldn ' t be_happier with the service provided .
M	website is easy to use , received email_updates plus i was kept_informed of the delivery date by phone .
M	brilliant range of tyres too !
M	ordered a phase 00 on the thursday and by friday it was sitting comfortably next to my big muff .
M	absolutely fantastic , especially when you are able to track every_stage of your delivery through dpd ' s website .
M	not forgetting they also send you a sms and email in the morning telling you the estimated time ( usually within an_hour_window ) they will be at your doorstep , allowing you to pop out of the house for a quick pint down the pub to dream of your new product before it arrives .
M	of course every product i buy for my guitar will be done through guitarguitar .
M	thanks folks
M	these_guys are great , the webpage may not be really well_organised especially with those long lists of items but it ' s not too annoying .
M	the prices are great for some products , e . g .
M	things here may be cheaper somewhere_else but somewhere_else may be more_expensive .
M	you just need to research your prices !
M	but their delivery and dispatch times are terrific .
M	this company is horrific .
M	the staff are horrible and don ' t give a damn about you .
M	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
M	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .
M	you ring them up to ask about an order they sigh down the phone and act like they don ' t care .
M	the pricing / website is also a joke .
M	i went into the store two days ago and spoke to a staff_member , we ordered myself a motherboard which is stated on the website as well as the manufacturing code - asus m0a00l - m lx v0 .
M	when he printed out the collection receipt it said asus m0a00l - m lx which is obviously incorrect .
M	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
M	i then asked him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
M	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
M	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
M	asus m0a00l - m lx .
M	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
M	' no this is the right one , it is the v0 version .
M	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
M	my god .
M	i got so angry .
M	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
M	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
M	so i just couldn ' t be bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
M	the funny thing is the original price i bought it for was Â£_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it ' s price to the one off amazon .
M	guess how much it is now ?
M	Â£_00 .
M	they upped the price just as i left the store .
M	maybe this isn ' t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
M	they are conniving , horrible people .
M	i would happily pay Â£_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
M	cclonline will be informed about this review haha .
M	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
M	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
M	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
M	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
M	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
M	have a nice day .
M	information i wanted was very clear and easy to find - location , pictures , travel advice / directions from airport .
M	simple process to find the best hostel
M	just do the shopping on your own .
M	they are , on average , 00 - 00_% cheaper_than anyone_else .
M	shipping is fairly expensive , but it ' s outweighed by the free_samples and gifts .
M	bought some supplements at 00_%_off , then got 0 shaker_bottles and 0 samples for just . 00 cents extra .
M	i think it ' s definitely worth the cost of a bit more shipping .
M	got my pre order key 0 days early along with saving Â£_00
M	the pc arrived much faster_than i anticipated at an excellent price , everything was good until my graphics_card was showing major artifacts , i contacted cyberpower and they responded almost_instantly ( email ) and sent dpd the next_day to pick_up the card then the day after i had a new card , very quick service .
M	the new card i received was not working or even being detected it was brand_new though still in box , so i contacted cyberpower again , they responded almost_instantly again and suggested to send the pc back to see if something else was the problem .
M	dpd came the next_day and then took the pc , the day after to my horror i get an_email_saying that the motherboard was damaged with pictures to prove it , i got angry because i was adamant that i had not damaged the motherboard and blamed them .
M	cyberpower were brilliant no matter how annoyed or angry i got they dealt_with me professionally and calmly , they said that i could either wait to see if msi repair the motherboard or buy a new one from cyberpower and if the msi one gets repaired i ' ll be refunded .
M	i demanded a full_refund but i was denied ( wouldn ' t blame them ) i gave in and bought a new motherboard then got a call saying that they would send my pc the next_day ( saturday ) it arrived working perfectly with the same graphics_card that wasn ' t even being detected before , so i was blaming cyberpower for something that they hadn ' t even done but i ' m pretty sure i cant of broken it or maybe i did , nonetheless few_days_later i got an_email_saying that msi repaired the motherboard and i will be refunded for the motherboard , ended_up with a better motherboard for free .
M	unfortunately that graphics_card also artifacted not cyberpowers fault it was still in the box brand_new , again got a replacement within 0 or 0 days but then that card even artifacted but no where near as bad , i wanted perfection though so they suggested a nvidia card and now i ' m going for a gtx_000 for a bit more money .
M	cant recommend cyberpower enough they sent me 0 free games for the inconvenience , with great service even after buying the product .
M	i didn ' t even pay for professional wiring and they done it for free .
M	thank_you chris and gulam for putting up with me .
M	this electronics store seems to have everything and whats more is that nearly everything is always in stock too .
M	i found that three had a decent price for the iphone .
M	however the reception isn ' t great in all areas .
M	the online billing services is fairly good .
M	overall a good service let_down by the network_coverage .
M	amazing range of awesome products .
M	urban_industry is my first stop for some new threads and kicks .
M	having been nearly ripped_off by a local car sales office , i found these at this great price .
M	have used kwik_fit before and will have no_hesitation using again & if you ' re any where in the anglia region jay who fitted my tires is a decent chap .
M	high_quality products at reasonable prices a delivery service that is second to none
M	in the last_year i ' ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
M	only one issue with pricing but that was a fault i had caused to the phone .
M	other than that happily_recommend their service .
M	ordered my lens on the thursday and it was delivered on the monday .
M	it was even quite exciting to see where my lens was in the world at various times using their tracking_system .
M	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything went well and will be ordering again soon .
M	eav made my shopping_experience extremely easy and provided me with lots of advice .
M	order turned_up fast .
M	thanks
M	i recently was on a mission to find tickets florence + machine concert at the o0 in december . tickets are sold out for the gig and i spent a while looking at tickets on websites of secondary ticket agents ... who were charging an ' arm and leg ' for the tickets and sometimes over Â£_00 of the face_value .
M	i booked tickets through 00tickets . com even_though i had not purchased any tickets before .
M	the price was very reasonable and at centre stage .
M	which was what i was looking for .
M	i received the tickets in 00 days ( a month before the concert ) without any trouble .
M	i ' d recommend 00tickets to anyone that is looking for a reliable service and a fair price .
M	cheers !
M	speedy payment , easy to use site .
M	would be nice if they had an i - phone app .
M	i have been with bt for many years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
M	you really need to be patient , and i am not that patient , as i hate to go through telephone systems , hence my 0_stars !
M	it feels good to be able to express ourselves sometimes !
M	nevertheless , their products are generally quality !
M	i am shopping to aldi regularily and i think it is an excellent company .
M	finished the mind_blowing range you can find at tesco where you end up buying more_than you need .
M	with aldi , you go straight to the point , and the selection of product you find is tasty enough for me !
M	well_done !
M	good company , good honests and hard working people , and extremely_helpful .
M	i ordered many_times for my jewellery for my lip piercing , and my nipples , and the quality has always been there .
M	on top of that , i got it wrong a couple of times ( i am nopt very good with sizes ..) and they never created troubles or anything .
M	i could simply return my package , have a full_refund , or an exchange on one_occasion .
M	i believe they actually make the body jewellery ( handy for special sizes !)
M	including the bioflex jewellery that they created , and from their advice for my lip piercing , i gathered that they are also piercers more into the passion for what they do and not here to make quick money .
M	often , i receive free extra jewellery with my order !
M	nice to know there are still some good people out there !

M	using the cv_store was a serious wake_up call that my cv was poor and i was making glaring errors .
M	cv_store is very quick on giving feedback and creating a new look .
M	my cv is now 000x better_than before - and the best feedback ?
M	many recruiters have told me that my cv was what got me the interview or that it was extremely well_presented and crafted .
M	well worth the money .
M	i ordered a nikon_d0000 for Â£_000 .
M	it is a much_better price than anywhere_else i found in the uk or on - line .
M	delivery was quoted at around six days , but it only took three via dhl where the order tracking was very good .
M	my bank initially refused payment by debit_card - so i had to call them to pr - authorise the transaction .
M	was surprised when i found out the goods were being shipped from spain , but they came through on time and as expected - and still cheaper_than i could find elsewhere .
M	i bought simcity and some dlc from them which was much cheaper_than amazon and anywhere_else at the time .
M	i received my key within 00 of ordering .
M	great site .
M	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
M	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
M	as i said in my last e mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
M	where is yours ?
M	i ' ve been looking for a good , but cheap dvd writer for my desktop since my last one packed up , and i didn ' t need a blu - ray_player as i don ' t use my desktop for that .
M	i found this lg after googling for a while and ebuyer had the best price and free delivery too as a special , which made it even better .
M	i was genuinely surprised that something under Â£_00 would be free delivery , never mind Â£_00 . 00 !
M	great experience , cheers !
M	i ' ve used bc for ordering car and bike tyres .
M	the pricees for car tyres are fantastic , and thats even without considering the fitting cost is included .
M	nice to see more premier garages appearing too .
M	the motorbike tyre was the best price i could find , and even with delivery cost was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	easy to use .
M	even when booking for the same day .
M	it just works
M	scope and mounts arrived bang on time , well_packaged and exactly as discribed .
M	perfect service as always will be back and would recomend to anyone .
M	ordering was simple , as was payment , my item was dispatched quickly and arrived well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
M	i was emailed at every_step of the purchase as to what was happening and where my package was and what time it would arrive .
M	very good for me where i work nights .
M	over all extremely happy and will certsinly use again in the future .
M	in depth descriptions of all the products is very helpful , dispatch is fast and dpd are great at getting you your stuff on time .
M	will certainly use them again .
M	needed a few large items shipped over from out the eu
M	but i needed them asap
M	so amazon contacted me to get my items delivered to my home
M	got my items delivered the day before i needed them
M	excellent customer_services
M	great service .
M	it the 0st time iv used parcel0go and what a great service .
M	i made an error when i book my collection which was sorted fast and with know problems by there online_chat helpline .
M	the young_lady ( leanne ) was great got me sorted out in 0 minutes flat .
M	i will be using this service again in the future .
M	00 out of 00 .
M	probably the only company where you can find smith fuel v0 goggle range .
M	really pleased with dispatch options .
M	i recently_bought valkyrie profile 0 for the ps0 and it came very quickly !
M	the estimate on amazon was quite long but one of the staff_members send me an e_- mail saying to ignore it and they ' ll send it via_royal_mail 00 , and it arrived two days_later .
M	very good condition , and it works_perfectly , even_though i was worried there would be some problems as my ps0 is quite old now !
M	will_definitely buy from them again !
M	i really like how fast they deliver .
M	you can track the progress of your delivery via the e_- mail you receive with parcel number and the tracking website is very clear .
M	it ' s also very useful when you ' ve missed the delivery that either they leave a calling_card to say where they have put the parcel safely or that you can go on the website and arrange a new delivery date .
M	i would certainly use the service for myself , as the company i ordered the parcels from have been using this .
M	i also really liked that the delivery drivers were friendly and to the point .
M	again .. brought a code from these_guys / gals and was instant and legit .
M	bf0_premium for Â£_00 instead of Â£_00 . 00 bargain !
M	00 / 00
M	i want to mention the excellent and prompt service , as well as james , alina and christina for their attention , care and professionalism !
M	i highly_recommend !
M	good luck to all of you , my friends !
M	good morning . i write to you from baku , azerbaijan .
M	i want to thank_you for the excellent service .
M	your customer_service ( sheila , mary ) is very prompt and very helpful .
M	shipping is very fast .
M	thank_you .
M	sincerely ,

M	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
M	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
M	either way im happy with shopping at lidl its shopping @ a budget with some nice products for the price .
M	no_complaints here , i have used nitrotek in the past with no_problems . the site is easy to use & it seems to have a better range of products that most other_sites ive been on , they even stock the parts for my xrc - 0 so i will be coming_back for more at some point !
M	order no .
M	000000000
M	cheers_guys !
M	i have purchased a number of items from alpkit and i have always been very happy with the price , speed of postage and after sales service .
M	i would recommend their down jackets to anyone , i have had years of service out of mine and it has lasted really well .
M	i also own a head torch which in my opinion cannot be_beaten at the price point .
M	to top it all off they offer free postage , not really sure how they do it for the price .
M	i purchased a pair of native boots from urban_industry .
M	the price was the cheapest i could find on the web and they were offering free tracked delivery .
M	the boots turned_up 0 days after ordering and were very well_packed .
M	i can ' t fault the service and price , i would definitely order from them again and i would recommend them to others based on this experience .
M	hostelbookers is always the go - to site for hostel bookings .
M	easy - to - use website , great range of quality hostels , and cheaper_than the rest .
M	i ' ll always choose hostelbookers first !
M	used for a few_months now , never had any_problems and great prices !
M	i would fully recommend this professional outfit .
M	repairs turned around quickly and hassle_free .
M	worth a go !
M	this website kills the competition !
M	by_far the lowest_prices and biggest_selection arround !
M	i will always order from here
M	never bother using them .
M	the slightest mistake cannot be rectified without costing you more_than half what you paid .
M	do anything_else but use this pathetic_excuse for a company .
M	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can ' t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
M	well what can be said about alpharooms â¦..
M	fairly cheap ?
M	well yes .
M	but at the same time uncommunicable could also be said and '; you get what you pay for '.
M	mainly just one thing should be said in particular do not under any circumstance book with them !
M	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company â¦ don ' t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few pounds off .
M	it ' s honestly not worth it .
M	i made that mistake â¦ twice .
M	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single beds ( after requesting a double ).
M	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
M	so seeing an opportunity for a cheaper trip i decided to use it on a trip to new_york with a transfer at reykjavic from london .
M	big_mistake .
M	not only did it take more_than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again ..) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer_service placements ).
M	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
M	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
M	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .
M	it was simply awful .
M	on our arrival in america i emailed and complained to alpharooms .
M	i received a curt reply saying they had ensured we were now seating with each other again on the journey back ( so admitting they had booked us apart ) but even more amazingly then then blamed me saying it was something they couldn ' t guarantee and that it wasn ' t their fault !
M	simply unbelievable
M	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
M	its taken a further 0 emails to finally get to a senior customer sales representative .
M	they ' ve all rudely passed responsibility away from themselves .
M	so i ' m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
M	what kind of travel company decides to book a party of two several rows apart on a flight , after you ' ve stated you ' re travelling together .â¦.
M	clearly not a proper one .
M	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
M	please_please_please i implore you â¦ give these_guys a wide berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago â¦ anyone would be an improvement !
M	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don ' t make the same mistake we did !
M	_______________________________________________________________
M	my reply > to alpharooms reply below
M	as you ' ll see alpharooms has since responded to this email in much the templated way that they contacted me when i raised these issues with them .
M	they ' ve done this on several review sites .
M	so for fear of any mistruths i ' ll simply state my reply here
M	___________________________________________________________
M	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
M	so the fact you have the audacity to blame me for not specifying this ( when i did and your staff_member said ' oh that sounds nice ' before seeing fit to sit us several rows apart ) is sheer madness .
M	as i ' ve already stated i ' ve started legal support for this matter and i will be getting my money back .
M	along the way also ensuring that any other potential_customers don ' t have to suffer in the way that i did with such a company as yours .
M	con no : zdbysw000000
M	i ordered a large_amount of furniture from home discount website .
M	i received an_email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they ' ve dispatched my goods , but it didn ' t mention which courier .
M	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave me a consignment_number which i looked up .
M	on the tracking_information , it said : 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 00 :_00am to 0 :_00pm .
M	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me Â£ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
M	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there ' s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
M	this was bad service because the company had not bothered to contact me to let me know they were even delivering on this day .
M	so i sit .
M	and i wait .
M	00 : 00 goes by .
M	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
M	engaged .
M	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
M	i am literally just ringing a landline .
M	ridiculous .
M	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another Â£ 0 ).
M	i continue calling and finally get someone at around 00 : 00 .
M	he tells_me that ' there has been ' an incident ' in portsmouth ', so the van driver has decided to do his round backwards and to disregard the eta information .
M	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
M	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
M	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
M	at 0 : 00 , up comes the status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00pm all barcodes 000 exception carded .
M	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
M	there is no card .
M	there is no delivery van .
M	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
M	the delivery van has not visited my road because it is a no - through road which takes about 0 minutes of cautious reversing to get a taxi out , nevermind a delivery van .
M	so i ring the depot , there ' s no answer .
M	i leave a message explaining the issue .
M	it ' s strongly worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
M	it ' s now 0 :_00am on the 00rd oct and no - one has bothered to call me .
M	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
M	i am Â£_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
M	terrible , terrible service .
M	by contrast , dpd have been keeping me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
M	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct 0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
M	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
M	used collectmyparcel . com a couple of times and had no_problems .
M	booked the day before and the collection has always been made on time .
M	excellent service all_round .
M	my go to company for parcel delivery .
M	great selection of brands and excellent customer_service .
M	my new favorite supplement website .
M	i normally used booking . com to find hostels but on the recommendation of a friend i used hostelbookers . com and cannot_believe_how awesome it is !
M	their service is top - notch and the booking process through them is very easy to get the hang of .
M	their listing functions provide practical and cheap options which is great for me because i hardly need a 0 - star treatment for a 0 - 0 night stay .
M	it really is the go - to booking service when out and about !
M	great radiator delivered at a great price - really impressed with the website , range and prices .
M	thanks very much , oli
M	easy to use website , great price and quick delivery .
M	many_thanks .
M	the shower came out very quickly , communication was great and the finished_product is excellent .
M	the website was clear and easy to use , choice and prices were very good .
M	recommended .
M	i chose worktop_express based on their reviews and i wasn ' t disappointed .
M	the product was delivered exactly when they said they would by 0 very helpful guys .
M	on the phone the customer_service was great , they answered my numerous questions .
M	the worktop itself is beautiful - the staves are thick and the quality of the finish is excellent .
M	the fitters had no problem in putting it in .
M	price smashed everything else i saw - specifically homebase and b_& q , but also ikea .
M	the quality is also far better_than the samples i saw of these 0 .
M	worktops do require complete oiling , but worth doing to pick your own finish .
M	000_% recommended - thank_you !
M	thoroughly
M	putting time and effort into picking the right product and supplier will always pay off in the end .
M	we purchased our new dishwasher from appliance planet after_reading great reviews on both the appliance and the supplier â_s website .
M	the dishwasher was rated the best integrated dishwasher on which ?
M	and was fantastic value for money at the Â£_000 mark .
M	i initially went to the website for price , but it was the customer_service and ease of use purchase that sealed it for me .
M	once i was on the website , the range of products nearly got me to change my mind but i stuck with my original choice .
M	the website was clear and very simple to use .
M	the search_functionality on the website was intuitive and most_importantly the prices were incredibly competitive .
M	the customer_service over the phone was fantastic , my call was quickly answered and they were very helpful and knowledgeable about the product â able to answer questions on spec and discuss delivery logistics with authority â and in fact i finally placed the order over the phone .
M	there was no upselling or extended_warranty annoyingness of calling currys - or another online_retailer who called me back after a purchase to ask me if i wanted a longer guarantee - just clear impartial_advice .
M	the delivery process was efficient and reliable â they would even do a free saturday delivery if we needed ; they called me to confirm delivery dates and were very flexible .
M	i chose delivery for a date quite a long time in_advance and they were able to assist .
M	i received a text_message reminding me of the order arrival and the delivery guys were really helpful and very accommodating on quite a tough delivery .
M	the dishwasher , siemens sn00m000gb , itself is brilliant .
M	the kitchen fitters were able to install it quickly and easily .
M	the machine takes a large load for it size .
M	the clean is fantastic every time , even dried on cereal comes off .
M	we adjusted the top racks for our big plates which was thankfully easy to do â our last machine didn â t have that functionality .
M	oddly it doesn â t dry our tupperware very well â but this is my only complaint to date !
M	to sum up i would thoroughly_recommend the website and will be buying any appliances through them in future .
M	thanks guys !
M	great product and more inmportantly price - delivered safely and quickly
M	great website , great prices , really good service and quick delivery .
M	thoroughly_recommended
M	a great experience , great product and great price .
M	many_thanks for the help , advice and service
M	do not ever use this company .
M	it is terrible .
M	customer_service is as bad as none existant , i paid an extra Â£ 0 to get it delivered in 0 - 0 business days , it has been 00 days and still not come !
M	brilliant !
M	monster_supplements , offer a great range of products all at far lower prices than available in the high_street or indeed almost anywhere_else online .
M	any_issues are resolved quickly by friendly and helpful staff .
M	they ship fast and often add free_gifts to regular customers , all in all an a0 company !
M	works like a charme , saves 00_% of cost and experience is super smooth , especially for a repeat usage .
M	great range of high_quality products at good prices and everything i need for my sign making business all in one place .
M	nevada sorted a little mistake that the couriers had made super_quick , ill definitely use nevada again .
M	i desperately_needed some new work trousers ( i ' m heating engineer ) so i had a quick look online and having had dickies stuff before i felt_confident about the quality .
M	i ordered them late yesterday and they turned_up a lunch time today ( which is a saturday !)
M	i really wasn ' t expecting them to turn_up until monday due to late friday order so amazing delivery / ordering_process .
M	also i have short ass little legs and was so happy that i managed to get trouser the right length so that the knee pads were actually knee pads not shin pads !
M	haha .
M	all_round great service .
M	extremely happy .
M	i got an amazing price for my new laptop , it arrived when they said .. i even got a text telling_me which hour it would come and the name of the driver which i wasn ' t expecting .
M	after so many nightmares and disasters with other online_retailers this was such a relief , i would happily use studentcomputers again and have already_recommended them to others .
M	=)
M	i contacted ttb to arrange a static_ip_address , which was done with no_fuss and was working before i ' d finished the chat .
M	i then asked for a ptr record to be setup , and was although i was passed over to someone_else for that to happen , he read over the chat , confirmed the ip_address and the hostname , and arranged the ptr setup there and then .
M	very helpful , and i thank the two individuals concerned for their time and efforts .
M	this is the best place i have came to find to buy supplements .
M	they have the best prices you will find any where with a wide_variety to chose from .
M	will match any price .
M	helps save tons of money
M	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
M	i gave up .
M	my nan was unfortunate enough to get through and sign_up and she ' s had problem after problem and also reports the customer_service is lousy .
M	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to ...
M	avoid at all costs !
M	i love google , although i think android is a bit of a grey area as i had an android that was faulty after 0 months .
M	i use google apps for business and it ' s brilliant , i also google for my personal mail , maps , documents and so on .
M	i really recommend google apps for business to any sme .
M	sound went on my htc_desire , called htc and they didn ' t want to know .
M	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
M	not impressed !
M	truly amazing .
M	for everything you want and great customer_service , there ' s only one place i go .
M	i ' ve used parcel0go so many_times i ' ve lost_count and each and every time the customer_service i ' ve experienced has been amazing .
M	i ' ve imported items from the us , shipped ebay items around the world and sent domestic packages across the uk without any hassle whatsoever .
M	this company really know how to look after me and with updates on twitter and facebook , it ' s great to know i can get hold of someone if i have any_questions about tracking or general questions .
M	a special mention has to go to kate and george who go the extra_mile .
M	thanks guys !
M	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
M	i also think they ' re great value for money ( a 0 day courier which usually arrives in a day anyway for about Â£ 0 - brilliant !)
M	and the ease of use of their website plus google_checkout / paypal for payment is so easy even a child could do it .
M	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
M	they ' re my courier agents of choice and i won ' t be using anybody_else .
M	thank_you very much ,
M	after paying and sending a foto of my credit_card ( with numbers covered ) it took them about 00_hours to deliver the unlock .
M	happy with everything .
M	thanks again
M	roman
M	czech_republic
M	great service , no hassle , always prompt in replying to queries and dispatching orders .
M	one feels valued by the company .
M	a pleasure to deal with .
M	excellent , first_class , delivery spot on choice of good fantastic , defiantly a class company that will be used again , many_thanks karl and team
M	not only does supplementwarehouse . com offer their 0 %_off any competitor ' s price , the free_samples make ordering from the site well worth it .
M	other company ' s limit the amount of samples , but sw has no limit , a huge_selection , and unique offers like magazine_subscriptions .
M	a great buy and awesome service !
M	selling my old_mobile through mazuma was quick and easy .
M	best of all it was the best price available !
M	i got my cheque through the post within a day of them receiving my phone .
M	well impressed !
M	a very competitive company to deal with .
M	great deals and great service from chillisauce .
M	from the onset our site was set_up ready to use , no hassle and no issues .
M	activities were great , location and directions given .
M	hotel was more_than adequate too .
M	many_thanks for taking the pressure off of the stag and the groomsmen most of all !
M	thanks again .
M	dedicated service to get you the best deal .
M	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
M	thanks .
M	as i guess most people are , i was a little_dubious at first when a friend_recommended this site to me .
M	i through i ' d pay through paypal in case i had any_problems and managed to get 0 . 0 %_off for getting the code and liking them on facebook .
M	once i ' d received the e_- mail a valid code was delivered in next to no time and that ' s it , done .
M	i recommend for value and simplicity and i will_definately use again , yet another happy customer !
M	they regularly don ' t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
M	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
M	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football team .
M	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
M	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
M	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
M	cost .
M	pay peanuts ...
M	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
M	i had an issue with an item arriving broken , without delay a replacement was sent and arrived a few_days_later .
M	the product is fantastic as well both in terms of value for money and taste .
M	whilst i know the supplements are expensive it has lasted longer_than i expected and i am seeing good results .
M	i would highly_recommend maximuscle . com to others wanting good products coupled_with great service .
M	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
M	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn ' t answer any_questions !
M	they couldn ' t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
M	they should at_least state that all orders are drop shipped !
M	so i promise you this smartbuy sunglasses ( not very smart at all ) you haven ' t heard the last of me !
M	i will be taking this further !
M	i have only recently received the refund which seemed doubtful at the time !
M	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
M	who don ' t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
M	poor_excuse for a business !
M	bad practice and even worse customer_service !
M	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
M	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of Â£_00 it isn ' t worth the risk !
M	we wanted a ford mustang for are florida trip in 0000 we asked if we could put it that we have requested a ford mustang using usrentacar with dollar when we got to florida dollar said they got are request from usrentacar and they have the mustang waiting for us so we could not recommend usrentacar enough
M	we are also going to use them again for are dec_0000 trip back to florida
M	i think 00 . co . uk is a great site , always offering bonuses and 00 . co . uk doesnt just take your deposit , like most sites i gamble on they take my deposit and im gone within 0 minutes .
M	full of bally games and all the popular igt games .
M	they offer a 000_% first deposit match and most weeks you get an_email with a code for free money that you can use to play a newly_released game .
M	i don ' t usually like refering or recommending sites to other people but id recommend 00 . co . uk to anyone !
M	!
M	ok casino but like all gamesys sites it can be very unfair !
M	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
M	they offer a daily free game which used to be good .
M	no matter what i used to have atleast 00 free_spins a week but after a while it stopped giving me them .. i had a couple of months cool off and started depositing again but it ' s now been 00 weeks since i won on the daily free game .
M	makes you not want go go on when your losing your deposits most times and not getting anything back like free_spins .
M	casino ' s need to think more about their players and not just the money thats coming in .
M	a little something back is always nice .
M	i rate this casino 0 / 00
M	used to be my # 0 casino to make deposit ' s but my experience suddenly changed !
M	after a while virgin games just stopped paying out on the slot machines , every deposit made was just gone within 00_minutes if that !
M	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
M	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it ' s mostly no wins and i ' ve not had free_spins for a while now .
M	i deceided to take a cool off from the site at the start of the year as the chat_host i was speaking too was very rude and unprofessional .
M	i complained on the last day of the month ( monthly game that offers guaranteed spins or cash ) that i wasn ' t winning on the free games and it had been a while since i won off virgin even after all the deposits made .. other members and the chat_host ' s posts were nasty and it was like they was all telling_me to just go !
M	my last reply was " virgin games has just lost themselfs a regular depositing player " and the chat_host ' s reply was " ok , see you tomorrow " like i just come on for the free games ?
M	i ' ve recently started doing my free games again and it ' s been 0 - 0 weeks .
M	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so .. since my cool off , nothing has changed .
M	i will_continue to make deposit ' s on virgin games but not like i used too !
M	i have disabled chat so i don ' t have to deal with any chat_host ' s anymore !
M	virgin games needs to get_rid of chat_host ' s .
M	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has gone now .
M	i think virgin games needs to update there casino more often and offer better bonuses like deposit matches and free_spins for new game releases , just a pound bonus puts a smile on everybody ' s face !
M	there is casino ' s online now that make you want to deposit on that site ... virgin games just dont offer that .
M	great website , fast payment , as promised and totally secure .
M	well worth a try if you have a laptop lying_around collecting dust !
M	give it a go now .
M	cheers
M	never had an issue .
M	fast_shipping and love the 0 %_off the lowest competitor price you can find !
M	!
M	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
M	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn ' t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
M	if you are a retailer please have more respect for your customers than to use this service .
M	i can ' t fault twe , always delivered on time and well_packaged .
M	the only time i have had reason to return an item the customer_service was fine .
M	they arranged to collect the item and i had a replacement within a week .
M	the price quoted for 0 phones was the best i could find anywhere .
M	i received the prepaid bag within a couple of days and the money in my bank a few_days after posting the phones back .
M	not much else i can say other than it was very simple .
M	next_day delivery was very cheap and the product i was after was still the cheapest including delivery .
M	had no issues with the site and the product was packaged extremely well .
M	where would we be without you !
M	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
M	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
M	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come back to collect the rubbish .
M	nice design , simple to use .
M	i ' ve got 00 staff and this will save us a whole heap of time .
M	very quick and easy service , just put in your details , put in your phone details and a few_days_later you ' ll get an_email_confirming the unlock is complete with easy to follow_instructions on how to complete the process :) thank_you :)
M	if i was referring anyone to buy from a record store it would easily be juno records !
M	its not just records that they sell , they cover equipment , cd ' s , downloads , clothing , record players amongst others but it is one thing for a shop to have the goods and its another to treat there customers well and juno records certainly does just that , with great prices , quick shipping and great quality items juno records is the only record store in my opinion !
M	i stumbled_across site by mistake on google .
M	ended_up buying more_than i was looking for .
M	items delivered extremely quickly .
M	very , very impressed .
M	will be using regularly from now on .
M	great price and fast delivery from_hong_kong
M	really easy to use website , great prices , service and quick delivery - perfect online sales - definitely my first choice for sports gear from now on .
M	i just got an upgrade from my phone provider & had a scratched & dusty old 0 .
M	i got my new phone & stuck the old 0 in my drawer .
M	a friend at work said i should sell it to mazuma .
M	i looked up the price & the phone was fully functioning so seemed a waste not to at_least try .
M	honestly it was so easy !
M	i signed_up online & gave all my details & requested a pre_- paid envelope for my phone ( this was the longest part of the process ) a day later i got the ennvelope !
M	i deleted all my stuff from my old phone , cleaned it down & sent it off .
M	i got an_email a day later from mazuma ( communication is fantastic !)
M	to let me know they had recieved it and the next_day i had Â£_00 in my account !
M	i have used mazuma twice since , once for another working handset & once for an ancient phone which was broken .
M	this totalled another Â£_00 direct into my bank_account !
M	exact_same experience .
M	i would reccommend to anyone .
M	quicker_than cashing a cheque !
M	brillient product ... officially a lord :) bank , credit_cards everything even nectar card :) very pleased :_d
M	company is very helpful and professional , i was selling my imac and the at first i thought ebay .. prices for a mint_condition imac were very bad .
M	but i found cash my gadget on a google_search and wow good price and super friendly service :)
M	00 / 00
M	good product selection at a good price with some good deals , worth looking out for not many internet shops i trust but this is one of them
M	very impressed , in stock , cheaper and very fast and free delivery !
M	dropped into stoneacre on wheatley hall road with the intention of just having a look around when after about 00 / 00_minutes was greeted buy a salesman ( tony illudge ).
M	usually i try to avoid the salesman until i need to actually speak to one , however i found tony ' s customer_service brilliant , very direct talked no nonsense and told me all i needed to know , talking to him was like talking to a guy in the street and not an overbearing salesman like at perry ' s were i had been previous and felt the need to run away after 0 minutes which was refreshing .
M	all in all from the original viewing of the car , test_drive and finance meeting to picking it up it only took three days , would of been less if i had been able to get to the dealers earlier on in the days instead of 0 hour before closure .
M	tony kept me updated_throughout the whole_process .
M	i would seriously advise_anyone of my friends and family to purchase a car from them in the future as i know i will be .
M	i have bought several items fro hennie ' s all were sent immediately .
M	i ordered the wrong item this was no trouble for them .
M	thoroughly_recommended .
M	bought suunto watch .... great price .
M	standard delivery chosen , item arrived next_day !
M	opened the box , had a question ...... phoned the company
M	question was answered there and then , with a follow_up e_- mail to confirm
M	i was happy ... where else on the net does that happen then >?
M	?
M	this is my second time ordering my supplements from sw !
M	great prices and fast_shipping .
M	i don ' t se emyself ordering my protein_shakes anywayere else .
M	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
M	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
M	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn ' t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
M	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
M	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
M	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
M	my advice - don ' t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only Â£ 0 dearer than iflorist !
M	i ordered with this company for the first time and was told that my items would be received by 00 december at the latest .
M	they never arrived and i contacted asos who intially did nothing .
M	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn ' t completed the returns slip !
M	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
M	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
M	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
M	having never rented a property out before and becoming a landlord for the first time , i came_across openrent . co . uk and found their service both efficient and simple to use .
M	my property was listed on all the major websites within 0 working hours and my property was rented within 00_hours of signing_up to openrent . co . uk
M	i would definitely_recommend this service and will use it again in the future .
M	i ' ve never used simply_games before , but i am glad i did .
M	not only did my game arrived fast the price is also outstanding .
M	highly_recommended for those who spend quite a bit on games regularly .
M	will_definitely buy from you again .
M	the product was delivered on time , packaging was good .
M	gift_wrapping was perfect , will use service again
M	adzuna ist ein " google " fÃ¼r arbeit suchen .
M	ich fand meine arbeit mit der suchmaschine .
M	danke !
M	got a fender stratocaster and a ibanez hollow body ( which i bought there ) set_up .
M	had it done within the week , incredibly affordable price and an excellent job_done .
M	after waiting years for an iphone ( only because i could not justify the high price that o0 had forced upon the british public for so long ) along comes three with an incredible deal .
M	contrary to public perception , the signal_coverage is excellent , with me rarely going without a speedy 0g connection .
M	my friend_recommended me to the site after i had tried other protein drinks from high_street stores .
M	not only is myprotein . co . uk considerably_cheaper then the high_street , it tastes a lot better and feels_like a lot better quality than the high_street brands .
M	on top of that , the delivery time was astonishing .
M	i ' m telling all my friends about myprotein . co . uk , 0 star service and products !
M	i purchased a set of 00 " bbs chr black alloys for my mk0 vw golf and could not be_happier .
M	i got them at the cheapest price i could find on the internet with free delivery .
M	my sales_rep cormac answered any_questions i had and does his job in an efficient and professional_manner .
M	the result is a very happy customer who would happily use performance_alloys again and recommend them to anyone .
M	i recently_purchased a dell multifunction laser_printer from printerland . co . uk .
M	not only were they the best price by quite some margin , but they included free delivery and an after sales service to put larger companies very much to shame !
M	superb service from start to finish , would highly_recommend this company and i will_definitely be using them again .
M	very fast delivery , great price , would definately use them again .
M	great weekend in chester , started with quad_biking at catton hall , which was a good laugh !
M	in the afternoon we did a pub treasure_hunt , this was great fun and set the rest of the days drinking up well !
M	the chillisauce organised activities were fun to take part in , would recommend them to all stag_do organisers !
M	if your fone brakes id send it to bozowi i sent mine and got my money straight_away was very pleased with the service i received
M	very happy with wiggle .
M	have used you guys a couple of times now and can ' t speak highly_enough of your customer_service .
M	great prices , easy to navigate website , kept me up to date with my speedy_delivery and some haribo in the box as well !
M	couldn ' t ask for a better company .
M	thank_you .
M	bad communication
M	slow delivery
M	average value
M	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can ' t .
M	overall a very bad customer experience .
M	great company , with a superb service !
M	a rare find these days .
M	a pleasure .
M	requested a boiler estimate first thing friday_morning and by 0pm the same day my old boiler had disappeared and a brand_new one installed .
M	nick quilter provided a brilliant service and is clearly an expert in his trade .
M	i will happily use pimlico and nick again for big jobs like this .
M	they may not be the cheapest but some things are worth spending a bit more money on for that extra quality .
M	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
M	after hours spent speaking with yodel customer support who stated that the address was wrong , when it couldn ' t have been more correct ( we had included every piece of info possible ).
M	they made an attempt last_night at 0pm to a very clear business address !?
M	!
M	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
M	what a waste of time .
M	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
M	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .
M	would recommend !
M	i had been looking for a pair of prada sunglasses for my girlfriend for weeks only to find blaze had them instock .
M	i called the number on the site and was pleasently suprised to speak to someone so knowledgable and helpful .
M	the sunglasses were sent to me with free next_day delivery in time for my girlfriends_birthday .
M	blaze made purchasing online easy as i am not familiar with purchasing through the internet .
M	will_definitely_recommend to all my friends and family .
M	been buying from myprotein for a few_years now .
M	love the products and they never dissapoint .
M	sainsbury ' s prices are very reasonable , and their ' basics ' range has the same standards of quality as their normal products , but they have more relaxed rules on size and shape .
M	if they do not have something that you ordered in stock , they are very sensible about what they give you as a replacement .
M	should you still not be satisfied , they refund you the item and sometimes even let you keep it .
M	the website is very helpful , as you can not only sort through all the categories , but you can sort through all the different categories based upon what is on offer , so you can save a lot of money !
M	for the entire duration of my time with t - mobile they have sought to resolve each and every issue i have ever had .
M	now don ' t let this fool you into thinking that there are lots of problems with them , every company has a few kinks .
M	the first problem i had was a lack of signal - a month later the merger with orange was announced , and soon after i was able to use orange signal too .
M	when i found a cheaper deal with o0 , t - mobile not only offered me a deal that was far better_than the one i had found , but also reduced their price for new customers so as not to be_beaten .
M	they have incredibly friendly staff , very reasonably prices , and the booster_packs are brilliant .
M	overall , this is the best phone network i have been with , and i ' ve been with all the major ones in my time .
M	mazuma offered a great price for my phone , got the pre_- paid envelope out to me in no time , processed the phone almost_immediately after receiving it and paid me the next_day .
M	excellent =)
M	very good conditions , fast 0 day shipment to germany , nice contact
M	when i moved_into my property in december_0000 i looked around for the cheapest tarrifs .
M	first_utility came up on price comparison_websites so i chose to stay with this company .
M	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn ' t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
M	when i recieved statements showing how much my balance was it turns_out they were still billing me for these months .
M	i have had to send in copys of my tenancy agreement and also covering letters and was told somebody would get in touch but still nothing has been resolved .
M	this has been gogoing on for months now and it is a complete_joke .
M	when i phoned them to see if they habe received my cheque i was told this they didn ' t accept cheques by 0 advisor bit was advised by somebody_else that i could pay by this method .
M	i have also had problems submitting meter_readings to fu and when i have managed to do this they " havent " recieced them .
M	can ' t wait to pay off my bill and move to a respectable company .
M	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can ' t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort out their diabolical mistakes .
M	after been passed from pillar to post and been told that they don ' t have an account for me i have to ask
M	0 , if there is no account and i don ' t exist on their system , why the hell am i receiving bills ?
M	0 , why can 0 person find me then other people can ' t .
M	i mean for god sake the only thing u didn ' t ask me for was blood .
M	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
M	when all i wanted to do is sort out this ridiculous account .
M	don ' t take it out on me if your having a bad day !!
M	!
M	0 , why do i need to be transferred to a change of tenancy department when i moved in to my property nearly 00 months_ago when all this was done in december_0000 ?
M	?
M	this service is the worst i have received by any means .
M	this company needs shutting down if all they do is rip people off .
M	sick of fu completely now .
M	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer_service and incorrect bills .
M	wouldn ' t it be good if this company was on don ' t get done get dom !!!
M	wander how they would try and cover that up .
M	service was excellent , customer_service was excellent , delivery time again excellent , quality you guessed it excellent
M	satisfied with the all services provided .
M	raised an issue via trustpilot , had contact from magic_madhouse who offered a resolution .
M	will be using again .
M	will use again , good product and price .
M	fantastic customer_service !
M	what more can be said than great service , great delivery times and free p_& p .
M	highly_recommended .
M	order no :_000000000
M	plane arrived well_packaged and delivered next working week day as specified on ordering , customer support via_email was quick and helpful , thanks thomas .
M	recommended
M	very undecided if home learning would be for me .
M	it is harder ( obviously ) and does require a lot more time and dedication then classroom teacher but on the plus side you are your own boss and you can work on your own time .
M	really like ncc home learning , would use again .
M	just some of the quickest and most reliable service i have ever_experienced online .
M	i ' ve had a few issues over the last few_days with changing addresses and cancellations and i must_say , emma and elizabeth have been absolutely amazing with their help on the live_chat .
M	i am a strong believer in good customer care and yours in second to none .
M	thank_you for all your help parcel0go . com :) without you box frame canvas_prints would not run so well
M	nespresso ( coffee machines ) have unfortunately chosen these_clowns for their warranty repair pick_up service !
M	first , i had to listen to their pick_up man effing and jeffing for at_least a minute as he could perform the simple operation of opening a plastic box .
M	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
M	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
M	0 weeks_later , with no forewarning ( this i blame nespresso for ), they attempted to redeliver on the 00rd of february .
M	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
M	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
M	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
M	i tried to call , but their " award winning call_centre â phone line , said there " was a fault ".
M	as it was out of their office hours , unlike the phone line was saying , i was unable to speak to a member of their team .
M	i went online ; their website also said there was a fault .
M	the next_day , i called .
M	i followed the automated_system for collection .
M	it gave me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
M	none of these days were possible due to work / commitments .
M	as the card said the item would be returned after 0 working_days , i felt under pressure to commit to a collection date .
M	i went online to see if i could find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
M	i found a number for their customer_services - after 00_minutes queuing , i realised none of the call_centre awards were for efficiency and gave up to continue with my day .
M	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
M	i called them the next morning .
M	the man i spoke to said he could only look_into this if i had my consignment_number ( i find this hard to believe that a delivery company can ' t find you from an address ) but fair_enough , i thought i ' d take number with me to work the next_day .
M	i called next_day with the number " no , we ' re just a depot , we don ' t deal with collections , i ' ll put you through â i was put through to a lady , who said " i ' ll put you through to customer_services ".
M	another 00_minutes on hold , during my break , i gave up .
M	it was now friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned .
M	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team ... sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ..." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
M	this threw up the result ' your package has gone for re - delivery '.
M	i suspect it has been returned to nespresso - dpd will no doubt charge for this and charge for nespresso to re - deliver .
M	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
M	this is basic stuff .
M	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
M	i intend to call nespresso on monday and complain_about this appalling company .
M	the person who gave them a 0 star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
M	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service â beware !!
M	!
M	not only did i purchase cod ghosts at a great price , it was delivered in 0 days with no issues .
M	i have ordered from sw several_times now as well as some other_sites .
M	i find myself coming_back here every time now .
M	the customer_service is friendly and i know i ' m getting the best deal out there .
M	even more so with the price_match .
M	i have been shopping for supplements on musclefinesse for about a year and i can_honestly say that its been a dream_come true for my body_building needs ...
M	shipment comes the next_day and i never have any hassle as they are always fully stocked with everything i need !
M	i give it 0 star , aaa plus !
M	!
M	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
M	i was staying at home all day waiting for them , no calls no bells .. after they " fails to deliver " three days , i visited them personally and got my parcel ,... this time they sent me a message said it will be delivered between 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 ..
M	i waited another morning , obviously i ' m being stupid again .
M	nothing delivered .
M	i decided to go out and do my own business at 00 : 00 , when i ' m away from my home , the mailman called me at around 00 , asking me to go out to the gate for the parcel , i was in a rush running back home he showed a massive impatient and unfriendly face to me .
M	got the money transferred immediately when they receive my laptop with the same price i quoted which is really important
M	bought a shirt for my prom on the site came within 0 day with free delivery !, very pleased and satisfied .
M	i will_definitely use asos again !
M	hands_down the best supp site ..... they will match any price that you find on the internet .
M	they do not have free shipping but their prices are so low you still end up saving money ....
M	highly_recomended !
M	amazed to begin with at the speed of which my order came !
M	tastes great , good quality and great price !
M	too soon to tell if i ' m getting results , but i ' d expect to see some in another 0 - 0 weeks !
M	the websites information is perfect for making_sure your getting the correct product for your goal .
M	and it ' s always good to see other_peoples reviews of the products to get a ' real persons ' idea of what the product is like !
M	i would definately_recommend these_guys !
M	they make beautiful quality rings , they were helpful and friendly from the begining and fast with their service and feedback !
M	i bought my girlfriends engagement_ring from these_guys and will be buying our_wedding_rings here too !
M	purely_because of such an excellent service !
M	nikki of ec0000 was great , she was able to resolve my account problem within a minute or two ..
M	she was able to explain clearly why i am having a problem with my account all while being polite & courteous ...
M	best prices on the market no wonder i get recomended it so much by freinds this website is one of a kind
M	wonderful search_engine
M	i have good price for air ticket
M	right choice
M	very helpful and polite .
M	give her the prize !
M	easy to use and reliable .
M	order the titanfall origin key and had validation within minutes paying through paypal .
M	will use again and would definitely_recommend .
M	i have been waiting for 00_minutes now to speak to someone in customer_services .
M	this company is absolutely abysmal .
M	the item arrived the morning after i ordered it !
M	didn ' t have to use customer_service centre so can ' t rate it .
M	the item was 00 pounds cheaper_than it was in the north_face website .
M	very pleased with the product and service .
M	i will_definitely_recommend it to others .
M	ordered a sealey jump start pack .
M	arrived two days after purchase via dpd courier .
M	courier service used was great .
M	i was able to track my package in real time .
M	the item was well taped up and inculded an ffx catalogue .
M	opened the package to inspect contents .
M	everything else was there except the all important mains charger .
M	a quick message to ffx ensured one was sent out very quickly .
M	messages were also replied to promptly .
M	mains charger turned_up .
M	so all in all very happy with purchase from this supplier whom i have never used before .
M	i first heard of mattressman on a popular search_engine .
M	as i was in desperate need of a new mattress i had a look on their website and was astonished at their huge_range .
M	all_sorts of mattresses were on offer here .
M	i bought my old mattress from benson ' s for beds and i was going to buy my new mattress from them till i compared the prices of both mattressman and benson for beds .
M	mattressman was cheaper and they offered free delivery !
M	as with all new companies i use , i always do a bit of reasearch into the company , after all i was parting with quite a bit of money and i wanted to be sure i was dealing_with a professional company .
M	ordering was easy , using the filtering system i was quickly able to find my new mattress .
M	i was taken through the usual steps of entering my personal details address and payment info and by the time i knew it i had ordered my new mattress .
M	delivery was painless too .
M	i received a phonecall from the driver that he had arrived , delivered by one man to my doorstep .
M	my experience of using mattressman was a pleasant one and i will certainly be recommending mattressman to friends and family .
M	well_done matressman , keep up the good work !
M	despite some of the reviews here , i am one of the customers who received excellent service .
M	i purchased a cannon professional cooker from them which not only was cheaper on their website but they would also personally deliver it themselves rather_than using a courier company or similar all the way to central_london !
M	!
M	my cooker arrived early on the day expected and i can ' t say that i am dissapointed .
M	in the future i think i will order from them
M	i have used lastminute for a number of things ranging_from flights and accomodation abroad to booking a hotel room in the uk .
M	on all occassions i must_admit i have never had a problem with them .
M	the prices are clear and concise , it is clear what you are paying for .
M	e_- tickets are delivered promptly to my inbox .
M	there was only one issue once and that was to do with paying using my debit_card , although i think it was just a one off bug in the system which was soon resolved .
M	all in all i think a very good website that can be used to compare with similar services other providers may offer .
M	i ordered a shoulder bag from here .
M	they had a wide_range of choice and designs i couldn ' t find with any other retailer .
M	i ordered my item and it arrived in a couple of days .
M	i was happy with my purchase and would definately shop again .
M	i first stumbled_across this website from another of their affilliates .
M	i was looking for designer clothes that were offerred at competitive_prices .
M	my first order totalled nearly Â£_000_pounds , but i must_admit , when i do shopping online i always research the website and read their reviews where possible .
M	this website had some negative_feedback , but to counter that had plenty of good feedback .
M	i placed my order , using my credit_card in case i needed to make a claim on it .
M	to my surprise , my order arrived the very next_day .
M	since then i have been using woodhouse clothing for all my clothing needs and i couldn ' t be_happier with their service .
M	will be shopping there again soon .
M	i had never_heard of photobox until a friend of mine mentioned them .
M	i thought i would visit the website to find out more .
M	i found the website easy to navigate , however the wizard that is used to create you book was very fiddly and confusing even for me , a tech_savvy chap .
M	i soon got the hang of it though , and before i knew it i had created my book , ready to be printed and delivered .
M	on top of this i received 00 free prints ( 0 " x0 "... i think ).
M	for a start i thought this was great !
M	my prints arrived first , within two days of ordering on a sunday_evening .
M	my book arrived 0 - 0 days_later as anticipated and i could not be_happier .
M	i am going to use their canvas product next !
M	i have been with o0 for years and have never_experienced any_problems with the provider .
M	i would rate their customer_services as good .
M	on one occassion i had a problem with a smartphone i had purchased from somewhere_else , o0 were still happy to help and did their best to resolve the issue .
M	although i never swear allegiance to them ( i always look for the best deal even if it means switching providers , i ' m with orange at the moment !
M	), they are better_than some of the providers out there .
M	i made an offer on a pc and was extremely happy when my offer was accepted .
M	i was even more delighted when delivery was free .
M	when the item arrived , before even opening it , i was confident it had arrived damage free .
M	the packaging was very well_done .
M	would definately shop again , and would get my recommendation .
M	when it ' s time to stock up , i know by now what type of supplement i ' m looking for ( fat burn , protein , creatine , etc_.)
M	and supplementwarehouse . com makes it easy to search for what i ' m after .
M	then , once i ' ve found it , they get me the best price - period .
M	to top it all off , they have great <$ 0 deals for me to sample products i might be interested in .
M	you really can ' t beat this site .
M	thanks for everything .

M	ordered a new xbox one console .
M	i was contacted regularly and kept up to date ..
M	i will use again ..
M	fantastic company
M	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
M	after sending them email and promising them opening of paypal case and returning goods by royal maill and copy of their return_policy - they organised collection on monday .
M	unprofesional will newer use again .
M	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
M	not much to say besides of great !
M	good to shop from digital_rev !
M	buy a costume from here !
M	ordered lush wetsuit .
M	came two days_later . brilliant !
M	i ordered a jacked in the afternoon and it was delivered by midday the following_day .
M	fantastic service and one of the most competitive_prices on the web .
M	highly_recommended !
M	website good and easy to use , created an account , and ordered some stuff at 00 . 00 monday_afternoon .
M	the delivery came just after 00 . 00 on tuesday .
M	that was good service , on standard delivery too .
M	the content was securely_packaged and everything was fine .
M	i would use them again .
M	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
M	and you can ' t verify yourself to make a review using your email .
M	first and last time i ' ll use them .
M	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn ' t turn_up .
M	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it ' s too_late to make alternative_arrangements .
M	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
M	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .
M	quick , easy , and very reasonably_priced great hardware !
M	!
M	whenever someone is asking what i use or where i get it , i always refer them to the supplement_warehouse .
M	this is my first time order online because i ' m fortunately to live close to both locations but i ' m sure this service will be great too !
M	i have complete respect for a company like this which essentially gives money to customers for items they may be buying anyway .
M	i ' ve gotten a lot of cashback over the years which has allowed me to buy something nice at the end of it all .
M	i used to use quidco . com a lot but i ' ve since moved over completely to topcashback . co . uk because they do not charge an annual_fee .
M	i still use quidco for the occasional deals that are not available on tcb such as instore cashback .
M	it would be great to see quidco remove their annual_fee .
M	keep up the excellent work .

M	i used to use quidco . com but i ' ve now moved over completely to tcb because they do not charge an annual_fee and most of the time the cashback they offer is more .
M	keep up the excellent work .
M	i ' ve been using this website for over 0 years now and i think it ' s the most amazing site on the internet .
M	their weekly newsletter has a wealth of information and really does help to save money .
M	if i need to sign_up to a new contract for gas , electricity , broadband , mobile phone or whatever , i always check mse to see the latest advice .
M	they have so much information their site and even if it is not covered , there is so much help available on the forums .
M	i must have saved thousands of Â£ in the last few_years just by the information available on this site .
M	keep up the great work .
M	i ' ve ordered many things from play . com and i ' ve always been completely happy with their service .
M	i love the fact that all their delivery costs are included in the price as i feel the price displayed is without any hidden_charges .
M	i ' ve had to return a few items and received a full_refund for them without any hassle .
M	great company .
M	i used to be a customer for freedom0surf and never really ran_into issues that required me to use their customer_services .
M	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
M	i contacted customer_services who were really unfriendly about the whole situation .
M	they were rude and did not respect my choice to be removed from all their marketing / newsletter information .
M	there is no need for rudeness of this nature and i will not be using this company again .
M	in fact , i have since persuaded 0 friends from not using freedom0surf when they were considering using them for this very reason .
M	i ' m sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
M	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
M	unfortunately some companies i order from do not specify which courier they use and i often have the unfortunate luck to have hdnl for some of my orders .
M	about 00_% of the time , i am left infuriated with how the parcels are left at my house .
M	i ' ve parcels containing electric items thrown over my 0 foot garden fence , parcels wedged into my gas meter box , parcels left in my recycling bin which was 0 / 0 full with garden cuttings and rotting vegetables , one time my wife had forgotten to lock her car and the parcel had been left in the drivers footwell ( this is something i ' m completely baffled about , do delivery drivers go around checking whether car doors are open for the houses they are attempting delivery at ??
M	), i ' ve had parcels left with complete strangers ( it ' s amazing that delivery drivers think that just because they live a few houses away , that they can ' t be strangers ), i ' ve even had a parcel left behind my car and without having a note left ( car had been unused for a number of days and only after moving it did i find the parcel there .
M	the parcel were chocolates which could have been ruined as they were out in the rain ).
M	i really hate hdnl and make it a point to complain to the company i order from ( e . g .
M	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .
M	hdnl ' s customer_service is ridiculous as they have no quality_control and the delivery drivers do not seem accountable to anyone .
M	very impressed with price and quality of products .
M	very fast delivey will recommend and use again .
M	0 star service !
M	work in the trade and started using opt about 0 months_ago - wish i ' d found them 0 years_ago !!
M	!
M	brilliant products and info , prices are best i could find and when i did have a query , phoned and spoke to rich - top bloke , sorted me out and went the extra_mile !
M	0 / 0 from me lads !
M	i ordered a fridge_freezer that was delivered in time , but it was damaged and getting them to pick it up has been a nightmare , over two_weeks_later they managed to collect and after a further 0 days i got a refund , i reordered from appliancesdirect and withing 0days a perfect appliances arrived from two friendly drivers ,
M	order on monday_afternoon , and its delivered tuesday lunch , what more could you ask for ?
M	it was all really simple , no_hassles at all , and fast communication .
M	very easy to find all the information which you could need to know , definitely_recommend .
M	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
M	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
M	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
M	i can safely_say that i have never had a bad reading of inbaal in all the years she has been doing readings for me , she has predicted things that i though " yeah_right that will never happen and then it did "
M	her way of giving readings is very honest in what she see ' s but at the same time in a friendly way , she has never gave me any dud info and even when she has had to give any bad news which i have to admit there has been once or twice she has done it in a respectful and caring way that i can say that most other psychics i have been to do not ,.
M	i will be booking inbaal again soon as i ' m sure its been awhile , and will highly_recommend her to anyone :-)
M	i was hesitant to order a camera for my girlfriend from digitalrev so close to christmas .
M	i was worried that , due to the company ' s base being in hong_kong , shipping would be expensive and take weeks .
M	my sister had recommended them so i bit the bullet .
M	i was pleasantly_surprised when my order was dispatched on friday the 00th and i received the camera , well_packaged and exactly as_described , on monday the 00th .
M	it is my experience that service like that is hard to find in the uk .
M	the camera is a genuine canon g00 with a 0 year_warranty and is just not available for cheaper anywhere on the internet .
M	i will use digitalrev again without_hesitation .
M	i ' ve ordered from see tickets a few_times and although the tickets push it a little in arriving , i haven ' t been let_down yet .
M	the kindle wasn ' t for me ( yet ) but returning it couldn ' t have been easier .
M	i ' ll be checking out the amazon tablet .
M	ordered my taps on 0th_august , received them on the 0th .
M	great service and perfect products .
M	recent booking with ebooker was smooth .
M	eticket came in like 00_minutes , that too at the middle of the night .
M	i would give 00 / 00 to the site .
M	all perfect
M	a little late and i have the iphone_0s unlocked
M	thanks ....
M	fik en ny rutter efter fÃ¸rste opkald .
M	billigt og god service , bedre kan det_ikke blive .
M	fast and easy trans .... will recommend ....
M	this was my first time ordering with digitalrev and i ' m very impressed !
M	fast delivery and everything turned_up on time with no_problems .
M	cannot find a cheaper place out there .
M	always my go to place to shop !
M	this site is probably the worst site i have dealt_with .
M	their communication is absolutely atrocious .. the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up ..
M	i purchased my ticket on thursday and within 0 hours i was notified that my cc may have been misused by an_automated email .. i followed their directions of the things they wanted for proof ( still find it very strange since no other site has done this ) and have yet to hear back from someone .. that information was sent friday around noon i have yet to hear from them and its saturday evening ..
M	my only solution now is to book my return_flight with someone_else
M	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction .. the same day i made the purchase .. thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
M	i ' ll also make_sure to pass on to everyone i know to never use your services
M	this website and the people that own it are amazing because my order came to me within 0 minutes of ordering .
M	thank_you guys
M	easy to set_up , easy to configure and even when you ' re not quite sure what to do you can simply ask them
M	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
M	paid the amount , instantly received an_email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .
M	after appr .
M	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn ' t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
M	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
M	if my payment didnt go through , why do they need my confirmation for cancellation ?
M	not booking with them ever ..
M	i just want to complain_about the service i have been receiving with regards to their repair and protect washing_machine package i bought 0 months_ago .
M	their engineers come with one part and then leaves my house in 00 - 00_minutes apologizing they couldn ' t fix and then i have to wait 0 weeks for next to come .
M	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
M	they come with new part , try it , that don ' t work and go back .
M	00th_sept , 00 was icing on cake as your engineer didn ' t turn_up .
M	i was sitting at home whole day waiting for engineer but no communication , nothing and when i checked my status of repair , it was saying repair complete .
M	no doubt , knowhow ' s facebook_page doesn ' t allow user to add their comments as people don ' t have much nice to say about the service they get i suppose .
M	worst company i have come_across .
M	stay_away
M	the lady was very helpful at the store and gave me good advice with the installation of the bathroom .
M	very happy and positive woman which made the purchase very easy to make .
M	i have already_recommended to other family_members and friends who are thinking of a new bathroom_suite !
M	contacts arrived 0 days after they were ordered .
M	saved us travelling into_town and having to wait around in busy opticians .
M	very satisfied with the service and would recommend to friends and family .
M	aspect were very quick in responding to my call out , the engineer left the house as he found it and i found him very polite throughout the process !
M	very reasonable_price and highly_recommended !
M	jeg_fik mine varer hurtigt og nemt , ingen_problemer overhovedet .
M	det gik smadder nemt , og prisen passede som markedsfÃ¸rt .
M	meget tilfreds .
M	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
M	cookie was undercooked and coke tasted like carbonated water coloured brown .
M	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
M	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .
M	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
M	come on screwfix get your act_together and you could be a good company again !
M	have used them when flying to jersey from southampton for the past 0 years .
M	never had a delay or a problem .
M	cabin_crew were helpful but i think the plane could have been cleaner .
M	otherwise had a great service .
M	brought an item of ebay , was meant to be 00 hour courier .
M	package was despatched next_day but delivery is now 0 days late !
M	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .
M	second time i was in the house the whole day , i was down stairs next to my drive window and no vans arrived yet tracker said consignee could not be reached !
M	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
M	doubt i will ever get my parcel and reckon the yodel employee who was meant to deliver it went and saw his mates instead of delivering anything .
M	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
M	join this campaign on [_link ]
M	[_name ] and [_name ] gave great advice , worked to our budget and helped_us choose a diamond we were happy with .
M	look_forward to receiving the completed rings in a week or so .
M	subject to rings arriving with no_problems as we expect , i can ' t fault the service received .
M	i ordered my camera on monday_morning - it arrived tuesday_afternoon ( hong_kong to central_london ).
M	now that ' s what i call service !
M	chillblast delivered my purchase on time and it worked immediately .
M	everything was packaged_securely , competitivley priced , and i was eligible for a free monitor upgrade as well .
M	they responded to my queries quickly and carefully , and were always helpful in answering my questions .
M	i would definitely_recommend them to others .
M	a * for sure !
M	i really like the fast_shipping and great customer_service the company provides .
M	i ' ve used these now 0 many games after my friend started using them .
M	was a little_weary at first time as i ' d .
M	never_heard of them but trust me i ' ve used them for orders via post which always come sooner_than they say it will be hear ( 0 - 0 days most ) and used cd_key email several time too now it ' s always in my inbox within 00_mins .
M	what makes it even better there always excellent prices , cheap as chips .
M	i used to use amazon all the time but since i ' ve found simply_games there ' s been no need as 0 - 00 times there always cheaper n new_releases .
M	use with confidence .
M	liam
M	" i received a phone call as the printer i had originally ordered was out of stock â i found them very helpful , i was able to change my order there and then with minimal_fuss .
M	i am very pleased with both my purchase and the customer_service i received ."
M	can ' t wait_until my contract_ends and i can switch .
M	been complaining direct and via_twitter , just get the same rubbish reply to run silly tests .
M	when in the office or at home i get 0 - 0 bars signal , but i get no calls or texts and most of the time i can ' t dial out .
M	then suddenly i get several texts all at once with varying timestamps up to hours before the current time .
M	tried my sim in other phones .
M	same_thing happens .
M	rubbish .
M	i have used this company to order hundreds of dvd ' s over the past_year .
M	they are super_fast at dispatching items , delivery normally takes 0 - 0 days , which isn ' t bad considering how cheap it is .
M	i ' ve had a few problems with broken cases but they have refunded me within 00_hours of emailing them .
M	i recommend this company as they ' re always efficient :)
M	i ' ve ordered several things from this company , the delivery is always excellent .
M	i even receive pre orders before the day of release .
M	the prices are great , their extremely quick !
M	recommend to several friends .
M	fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	!
M	great price , slight hiccup with delivery , but resolved very quickly and professionally , i would defiantly reccomend , and will be purchasing from lambda - tek again !
M	i bought a dpa headset mic from sound exposure as the one we currently had , had just died , it arrived very promptly .
M	we then realised the mic seemed a lot quieter than the previous one .
M	soundexposure were very helpful and organised a quick replacement to this one .
M	all worked_perfectly .
M	would definately use again .
M	as an architectural company gradually re - branding , we love the attitude of the promofix team and their approach to clients needs .
M	they are positive & friendly ( yet proffesional ) and are quick to respond to our requests .
M	what more could you want as a client , would highly_recommend .
M	i would recommend digital_rev to anyone .
M	i have been registered with their social network for quite some time , and the speed and packaging through the store is superb !!
M	!
M	i ordered 0 products , the next_day they had been dispatched .
M	all but one , i sent them an_email asking about it , 00_mins later i had one back saying they didnt have them in stock and i had been refuned .
M	if i had check my order on there website i would ' ve already of know the above .
M	so i choose a new mask which then arrived the same day as the rest of my stuff .
M	i would highly_recommend .
M	it was time for a new pc , i had a couple of friends who bought from pc_specialist , i check out reviews for pc_specialist and other pc builder options and am glad i bought from pc_specialist , it came in 0 weeks , and was delivered the next_day after dispatch .
M	i worked out the price of buying all the part and building it myself and worked out cheaper to buy from pcs .
M	i have purchased from mpb before and found them to have some of the best used prices on the web for camera_equipment .
M	i decided to upgrade to a decent standard zoom by selling three of my old lenses via their ' trade in ' option .
M	i was a bit_dubious at first but the whole_process took a few_days from dpd picking_up my lenses ( for free ) to getting my new lens in the post .
M	i was offered good trade prices for my lenses ( more_than i expected ), better_than certain high_street outlets , but you need to be honest about the condition of your stuff .
M	i was able to add more stuff to my order before it was dispatched and i received lots of communication via_email during the whole_process ; they also answered a few queries that i had quickly .
M	i am very happy with the lens i received which was advertised as exc ++ and it looks mint to me .
M	the only changes i would suggest to them is to link the trade process to your mpb account .
M	i already had an account ( from prior purchases ) but nothing about the trade and consequential sale was mentioned in it .
M	it would be nice to track the progress from your mpb account page .
M	also , once they received my items i had to ring them on the phone to pay the remaining_balance , it wasn ' t a problem and the process was quick and painless but it would have seemed a bit more streamlined if they just sent me a link to an online payment page or if it was linked to my mpb account and was auto added to my basket ( with the credit from the trade in showing ) with just the balance on the new lens to pay online .
M	overall i was very happy with my experience and i will_definitely be using them in future_purchases and / or equipment trade ins .
M	i recently made a purchase from gear0music .
M	the item was delivered with in 0 days and for a reasonable_price .
M	during the order process everything is clear and easy to understand and prices are explained well .
M	item was well_packaged upon_arrival .
M	all in all i was impressed and have added them to the list of my preferred music provider .
M	really fast delivery , products fit description .
M	customer_service gave fast response when i had enquires about delivery timings .
M	great low_prices and tons of products .
M	shipping was a little high but hey so is fuel !
M	my new one stop_shop .
M	we dispatch our goods world wide and have collections from every courier company available in the uk , all the other drivers park outside and walk up to the first floor to collect our goods without any_problems .
M	hermes do not , they park down the road , or behind the office and wont walk up the stairs to collect from us ...
M	upon ringing the main office the response was " our drivers are not allowed to leave their vans ".
M	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
M	come on hermes , step it up please .
M	i brought a pair of ray_bans at 00 : 00 and they arrived by 00 : 00 the next_day , fast brilliant service , very helpful , will be shopping here again .
M	ordered on friday_night came tuesday via nxt day deliv and a great product
M	i ordered a laptop from pcspecialist around the end of october .
M	i was looking to purchase a laptop as a desktop replacement for work with audio and this required certain specifications .
M	even_though the company is focused on providing gaming pcs i found that the options to choose from when building my system were very broad .
M	the pricing of components is excellent and i found that i could build a high - end machine for literally half the price of some of the obvious top end brands such as dell , apple and sony .
M	my product is solidly built , ergonomic , and looks pleasing to the eye .
M	one of the concerns that comes with ordering a product like this online is ...
M	ordering a product like this online ; spending alot of money and worrying that something could go_wrong or not be built to standard .
M	this is just not the case , i was constantly_updated on where my order was in the production line , given time estimates and clear details on my order and invoice .
M	my product arrived just 0 working_days_later in perfect_condition and to my exact requirements .
M	in addition the customer_service is second to none .
M	i had a little problem with a bluetooth driver and this was solved within minutes via friendly knowledgable staff .
M	all in all a great experience with them and i ' ll be purchasing from them again soon .
M	i purchased a masuri titanium cricket helmet for my friend â_s birthday , he loved the helmet , but the masuri titanium cricket helmet was dirty .
M	event thought the masuri titanium cricket helmet was in new unopened packing , the helmet was stained , there was dirt marks on the helmet , it looked like it could have been a display model instead of being new , i paid Â£_00 for the masuri titanium cricket helmet and i wasn ' t impressed by the condition .
M	i also purchased a gray nicholls fiber glass sheet which i love that was really good value .
M	the shipping was free and really fast .
M	overall i was really happy with the fast_shipping on my goods , but unhappy with the masuri titanium cricket helmet which was a present for my friend has dirt marks on .
M	i would recommend this company to my friends ,
M	we stayed at villa nino in lanzarote and had a wonderfull time took our 0th month old baby and having the villa was great best holiday we have been on and i will_defo be booking with jamesvillas again !!
M	!
M	when everywhere_else was sold out , simplygames pulled through .
M	i even received the product earlier_than friends who had preordered with thehut / zavvi / amazon so i was a very happy laddie !
M	thanks guys , i will_definitely use simplygames in future !!
M	:)
M	ordered bioshock_infinite on the xbox_000 .
M	at the time it was the best price available in the uk .
M	the delivery was also very prompt .
M	very happy .
M	i would def_recommend this service to all my friends !
M	!
M	i would recommend anyone to use mazuma_mobile ltd .
M	the website is user - friendly and simple to use .
M	we went to vital_concept for a new website .
M	ravi was brilliant in his approach , we sat down together and before hand he had already done his industry research and was able to show me market leaders and how they went about with their website designs !
M	already very impressed with vitals pro - active approach i was more so impressed when they were able to come up with designs and functionalities within just a few_days !
M	with the website complete , they provided an in - depth yet very easy to understand manual on how to use and upload to our new site .
M	overall , i would 000_% recommend any business to use vital_concept , not only for the quality websites they make but for the efficiency , knowledge and great client aftercare they provide across all of their services .
M	we at kenford builders will most certainly keep on coming_back !!
M	!
M	when organising the stag_do for 00 people i thought of the pain of having to ring up activity places , hotels , getting peoples money and deposits ....... but when i discovered chillisauce could do all that for me it was a no_brainer .
M	simon the rep from chillisauce put_together the ideal package to suit our needs and i could sit back and wait for the action packed weekend to arrive .
M	all the activities were top_class and the hotel location was ideal for walking_distance to the main nightlife in liverpool city_centre .
M	i would certainly recommend using chillisauce , and if i was organising a large event again i will be using them for sure !
M	many_thanks chillisauce for making this stag_weekend a huge success .
M	fantastic bespoke product delivered to exact specification & requirements i asked for .
M	delivered within a couple of days .
M	could not fault tshirtstudio , would highly_recommend and will_definately use again .
M	trekkinn order 000000 . did you ship this item ?
M	i have ordered many things from here , not a single complaint .
M	everything is legit and does not take long to receive .
M	i have yet to find another website that can compete with their prices .
M	i will_continue to use this site .
M	love it !!!!!
M	!
M	excelent service miles better_than envirophone !
M	great supplements company , have a great range of products , a great knowledge and passion and are totally customer focussed .
M	their facebook_page and forum are really useful and informative and thier prize giveaways are numerous and are great fun !
M	catherine was extremely_helpful not just with what i wanted to know but she also offered more help once she had finished , a lovely_lady
M	ordered a phone on thursday that was of a fair condition .
M	saw that there was actually a very good condition phone of the same make and model so i emailed the contact address that same day to ask to swap if i paid the difference .
M	someone got back to me within minutes ( after 0pm no less !)
M	and had agreed to ' upgrade ' to the better quality phone .
M	the phone was dispatched on friday and arrived on the monday .
M	the communication was brilliant from these_guys and i would suggest asking if you have any_questions , they seemed more_than happy to help !
M	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
M	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
M	it ' s not , it ' s a lie .
M	you will have to wait 0 - 0 working_days during which time you cannot cancel the order and no explaination will be given .
M	do not order online with them .
M	superb service , no hassle at all .
M	ordered online , ugg_boots received in quick time , think i have found my new store to order from , more orders coming they ' re way shortly for my hols
M	very very impressed with the service , well secured packaging , recieved my product in 0 days !!
M	wow
M	i will recommend to my friends and family .
M	thanks mr_memory :)
M	it ' s been a while since i ' ve been on ebuyer ' s website , so i was a little_worried that things might have changed .
M	but it ' s good to know that they still provide the amazing service and great prices that first attracted me to them years_ago .
M	so , i was told about a nautical themed party at my company and decided what a great idea it would be to go in fancy_dress as a sailor .
M	so , off i go to escapade in camden to see what they have to offer .
M	the store is huge with loads of costumes to pick from .
M	i almost lost my mind walking around that shop .
M	the costume selection was amazing !
M	in the end , i found what i wanted and gave it a try in the changing rooms .
M	it was a snug fit , but i wanted something bigger .
M	so i asked and they told me they have a warehouse with lots more sizes .
M	a dream_come true !
M	so , at that moment , i jumped on my phone , found the outfit and bought a bigger size for myself .
M	quick and easy .
M	the costume arrived at my home , i tried it on and it fit great .
M	i looked awesome in it and couldn ' t wait to show it off at the party .
M	excellent customer_service and a great price_match feature !
M	they have some of the best deals on the web , i have now gotten all of my friends to start using this website instead of bodybuilding . com .
M	they have a few products that i haven ' t found elsewhere .
M	they also have some great shakercups .
M	buy all of your supplements from supplementwarehouse !
M	i booked two flights one for myself and one for my partner from beijing to kuala lumpur however the site crashed and timed out .
M	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more_than happy to take your money !
M	budget_air then charged my credit_card for each flight ( 0x Â£_000 . 00 ) informing_me i would have a refund within 00_hours for both charges .
M	one charge was refunded and the other has not .
M	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
M	.
M	.
M	no answer !
M	i have emailed their customer_services .
M	.
M	.
M	no answer !
M	the impression i get from this is budget_air conduct themselves in an unscrupulous and dishonest manner with no regard to customer_services .
M	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
M	budget_air â please can you refund my Â£_000 . 00
M	a very user - friendly , well - priced ( often prices are cheaper_than booking through the hostels themselves ) website .
M	i ' ve used the site several_times now and have never_experienced any_problems whatsoever and have no hesitations in recommending it !
M	purchased a teeshirt monday , got it tuesday .
M	what more can you ask !
M	i ' ve been using this website for a while now and i love it .
M	very helpful advice , top_notch customer_service .
M	just what i neededt !
M	0_stars !
M	*****
M	you can trust amazon with everything you buy .
M	excellent service in terms of delivery , returns and customer support .
M	highly competitive_prices and quality products .
M	north_face products are always the best .
M	wanted to purchase this since long and finally did it this winter .

M	inner fleece is very warm .

M	e_- outdoor delivered it next_day , so excellent service from them .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i am astonished that john_lewis don ' t get an average of at_least 0 . 0_stars .
M	i have bought maybe 00 different things from john_lewis over the last couple of years and have received nothing but excellent service .
M	any replacements or refunds were dealt_with quickly .
M	the guarantee is excellent , often better_than other stores and more_importantly fuss free .
M	the quality of their own products is also exceptional and great value .
M	i only wish they had a bigger range of items , so i don ' t sometimes have to buy what i want elsewhere .
M	i returned faulty etymotic earphones in april for replacement under_warranty and 0 months later have not received a replacement .
M	worse though , stone audio have not responded to my emails chasing it up and when i call to enquire and they say they will call me back , they never have .
M	they have provided no information when i ' ve asked for updates , so i now have to turn to my credit_card company to chargeback for a refund .
M	i will never deal with this company again .
M	absolutely_brilliant .
M	immediate payment , excellent free online_chat customer_service and the only guys that jailbroken phones .
M	not quite the best price you ' ll get but definitely the best option out there .
M	amazing quick and almost always tracks !
M	day started well in nottingham on my stag_do with paintball which was awesome , we then went to book into our hotel rooms to find there had been not rooms booked and we were left waiting for approximately an hours ( vital time on your stag_do ) eventually we where put in a taxi to the other side of town moving us away from hooters where we had to be in 00_mins .
M	this as you can imagine put a dampener on the evening .
M	hooters was brilliant as expected !!!
M	after that we had a good lads night out on the town .
M	not sure i would use chillisauce again unless they sort out there confirmation of rooms and follow_up issues with some type of apology as hopefully i only have one stag_do ...

M	flashbays products are well_priced and excellent quality .
M	the service it also outstanding .
M	elorna of flashbay . org is our account_manager and is a pleasure to deal with .
M	any query ' s and she is happy to help .
M	i ordered the wrong item and knew i would be in for a time_consuming and costly fix .
M	one call later and they arranged for an exchange parcel to arrive the next_day with no extra_cost to me !
M	it is the things that go_wrong with an online company that define their level of customer_service .
M	power_tools direct have given me the confidence to know that there is a person at the end of the phone to sort out my problem should i have one and that that person will do their utmost to ensure i receive a hassle_free service - i will shop there again
M	sold a broken phone for Â£_00 which would otherwise be thrown away / recycled .
M	pre_- paid envelope arrived next_day for the phone to be sent out and payment was received two days after i send the mobile phone off .
M	next_day delivery on the dollars i ordered and the best rate amongst the results on moneysupermarket . com .
M	very professional service , highly_recommended
M	i have search in stores and online for good products at reasonable prices , but most the time that ' s just impossible .
M	after using supplement_warehouse for a few_times i have decided to forget other stores and online outlets and make supplement_warehouse my one stop_shop .
M	with great prices and free_shaker with every purchase why shop other_places !!!!!
M	!
M	excellent deal on our reading_festival tickets !
M	arrived on time and had a great day !
M	thanks 00 we will_definately be checking you out again !

M	got a harness in the sale .
M	sales staff were helpful on the phone .
M	good job banana guys !
M	the site was easy to use , tons of choice and my stuff arrived in no time ... would recommend it to anyone !
M	never had a problem with this company in over 0 years of use !

M	great service and great products .

M	i bought saints_row 0 and from my payment it was an instant auto - key retrieval .
M	i added it to my steam library and started downloading it straight_away .
M	iv used this site many_times and only once there was a problem with an order but the support i received was quick and helpful .
M	it was sorted out in 00_minutes .
M	highly_recommend to anyone not wanting to pay full retail prices !
M	some amazing bargains .
M	it was great shopping , but i am considering to high for shipping for the item i had purchase and also do not see united states postal service for cheap and fast services .
M	was very good experience however , the sell order before phone apprantly did not get recived and i lost my dal
M	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
M	i feel this is a major issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
M	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !
M	i will never use this company ever again !
M	i booked a theatre and meal deal through lastminute . com for my girlfriends_birthday .
M	i didn ' t pay a lot for the deal so i wasn ' t expecting much in terms of meal and seats but i was planning to make the most of it all the same .
M	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
M	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
M	so good so far , however , 00_minutes after ordering our meals and drinks , nothing had arrived .
M	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
M	i told the waitress who didn ' t even offer an_apology and took the food away .
M	meanwhile , my girlfriends macaroni and cheese arrived complete with raw pieces of bacon in it !!!
M	so again we told the waitress and again no apology and again took the food away .
M	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it ' s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
M	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn ' t had our drinks .
M	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
M	before we left i did notice that the meal offered would ' ve cost us Â£ 0 . 00 each , along with the Â£_00 theatre tickets , our so called " deal " should ' ve cost Â£_00 . 00 ...... i paid Â£_00 . 00 !!
M	!
M	anyway , the seats in the theatre were great and the show was awesome , apart_from the over enthusiastic woman next to me who hit me on the head and in the face several_times , to my girlfriends delight !
M	!
M	so to sum up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren ' t deals at all and cost more_than face_value .
M	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
M	!
M	i am been trying to set_up drirect debt for for 0 years every time i try to set_up with them they say that you direct debt is not set_up and they charge you 0 pound for not having direct debt talktalk is so bad would book about how bad they are seriously
M	it is definitely the best and fastest way to find a good place where to stay .
M	in a few seconds and without any extra fees you can choose and book your place .
M	i never travel without using it !
M	organised service and friendly , but unhappy with the price after doing further research .
M	for headlight re alignment and bulb replacement cost Â£_00 quid including mot .
M	in reply to this they offered me a Â£_00 refund which i accepted
M	checking the internet with many other travel_insurance websites i found that essential travel_insurance gave me the best cover for price that i needed for my trip .
M	the item took too long to arrive considering delivery cost Â£ 0 . 00 , i didn ' t receive the item for a few_days , the courier failed to collect the item twice .
M	i was looking for a atomiser that was not on safercigs site i had been looking everywere for this .
M	i had heard of safer cigs from a mate , so i emailed daz asking for this atomiser that i had been looking for he emailed me back within the hour and he had what i was looking for as discontinued stock so i sent a way for them and they came the next_day iam really happy with the service and would say that safercigs is a good service to e cigs if you are looking for anything for e cigs then just ask they would go out there way to help 0_stars from me

M	have no_complains what so ever , my xbox was repaired quickly and for a good price and i haven ' t had any trouble with it since .
M	ive shopped with many different e_- tailers , but never one like aria , their customer_service focused approach was so helpful , the forum they run is a dream for all enthusiasts alike , and their website and order proceedure is second to none
M	i recently ordered a saitek cyborg v0 keyboard , order went through instantly , dispatched within the hour , and delivered the very next morning , in perfect_condition ..
M	the website is easy to navigate and if there is any problem , they are simply 0 phone call away or a visit to the forums
M	cant_beat this service !
M	i rang them to ask a question about laptop and next_day delivery .
M	they were polite and helpful on the phone but explained i had to order before 0pm to make_sure i got next_day delivery .
M	i ordered at 0pm .
M	got a txt and email_confirming the delivery and the time it was to be delivered .
M	dpd delivered the laptop at 00am the next_day .

M	good company .
M	great prices and a customer_service second to none .
M	need i say anymore .
M	easy to use , very user_friendly , got my money the day they got my phone and at the said .
M	prices are ok but range of wholesale products is pretty bad to be honest .
M	there are better online japanese food stores out there .
M	i knew roughly what i needed for my new shower .
M	i found wd on google and looked through there site .
M	it was a helpful layout with lots of info that helped_me work out what i needed exactly .
M	i ohoned up to place the order and found the staff very pleasent , professional and helpfull .
M	the goods arrived very quickly and were higher quality than i expected .
M	can ' t understand how they can do it for that price but who_cares !
M	0_stars !
M	great range of products , good prices and fast delivery .
M	can ' t wait to make make sushi !
M	excellent service will use next time and every time .
M	thanks parcel0go
M	had paint_balling arranged for the saturday as part of a stag_weekend away in newcastle , which was a painful blast !.
M	guestlist_entry into tiger_tiger on the friday_night with a bar_crawl added in to .
M	which i found better on the sat night as it was full of girls girls girls !!
M	!.
M	my one beef i had with newcastle ' s club seen was club luna , i suggest if your not a chav !
M	you stay clear as sh_* t seems to happen in that club if your not a chav as our group found out .
M	but other than that top painful weekend for us all would defo come back for seconds !!
M	!
M	this is the second time i ' ve used mazuma and for the second time the transaction went off entirely without a hitch .
M	bag arrived_promptly ( taking into account the recent postal disruption with the bad_weather ) and money was credited to my nominated account the same day the phone arrived back .
M	paid for one month license expecting a good outcome to help me thrive in fifa coins , however the complete_opposite occurred , the told me programming errors had occurred upon several_occasions causing me to lose all of my fifa coins with no compensation because i didn ' t look at their facebook_page due to being in school .
M	you will never get a reliable service from this company
M	don ' t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
M	quick rapid responses and around the clock support
M	they were on time within the time they say .
M	great service with amazing customer_service to get back to you in a timely_manner .
M	they do exactly_what they say .
M	i would recommend to friends .
M	im so glad i stumbled_across muchbetteradventures . com while trying to plan a ski / snowboard holiday for this year !
M	booking a holiday for a group of 00 can be quite a stressful experience , making_sure all the details are correct and everyone is happy , especially with all the information google chucks at you from hundreds of holiday sites .
M	as soon as i found much_better adventures i was blown_away with how easy and simple they made the whole_process .
M	after entering just a few details of what we were looking for , i had a speedy response ( from real people not just an_automated_response !)
M	who i could tell had an interest in our specific_requirements and made a real effort to gain us deals and quotes for suitable holidays .
M	i ' ve used surfdome multiple_times before and i always go back to that website .
M	i can ' t find anything wrong with my purchase here .
M	i had all the info i needed and emails covering every_stage of the process .
M	i ' d definitely_recommend them !
M	i write to thank_you for the recent advice you gave me regarding backing up my clients artwork files in the cloud .
M	a task which i have been dreading for some time .
M	at sun jones , we pride ourselves on offering quality products and excellent customer_service .
M	it â_s therefore incredibly important that the suppliers we choose share the same ethos .
M	not only did you take the time to fully explain the options available to me , but you went out of your way to stop me purchasing office 000 from you and instead directed me to a solution that was best for my business , even if it meant you losing out on a sale .
M	it â_s your commitment to customer_satisfaction and expert knowledge of your industry that will see techmonkeys grow from strength to strength and i will do my utmost to refer clients , colleagues , friends and family to you for all their it requirements .
M	update_:
M	success !
M	i can confirm that the issues i have had with regus have now been resolved , thanks to their dedicated customer_service team at surrey .
M	for the way that their customer_service team handled the situation , i have altered the rating from being a one star to a three star_review .
M	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won ' t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
M	original review :
M	- hidden_charges .
M	at no point did the salesman , edward discuss the additional services mentioned in the terms and conditions .
M	he discussed rent rates , telephone and internet rates so why not point out the other charges as well .
M	i get the impression that they play a game of " who can we catch out " with prospective customers .
M	their abuse of trust is morally and ethically disgusting and i hope they are investigated for their deception .
M	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
M	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
M	on numerous_occasions , i had calls to my mobile from clients and prospective clients saying that i hadn ' t returned their call .
M	why ?
M	because i never got the message , that ' s why !
M	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told him you weren ' t here so he left ".
M	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
M	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn ' t follow_up on his visit .
M	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act 0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
M	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
M	- poor office conditions .
M	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
M	even in the winter months , i had to leave my door open to ensure a steady supply of fresh_air .
M	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
M	why do some have it and not others ?
M	- damaged reputation .
M	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
M	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
M	he only had the office for 0 months but since leaving , he has had numerous issues with regus ( major accounting errors , false charges etc_.)
M	and is now on poor terms with me as a result of the recommendation .
M	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
M	do not recommend anyone to regus .
M	- security .
M	the lights in the office are automatic - they only turn on when someone is in the room and stay on for about 00 - 00_minutes after leaving .
M	a few_times on arriving at the office , i noticed that the lights were already on before entering ( and sometimes late at night when i decided to pop in to do a bit of work out of hours ) so i questioned the center manager , sharon , about this .
M	she told me that the cleaning staff had key access to all the offices to ensure they could carry out their duties even when the offices are locked .
M	this was very concerning to me as i use a lot of expensive equipment , software and also stored confidential documents in the office .
M	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren ' t even able to take messages for me !
M	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy outfit .
M	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false sense of security .
M	purchased for a christmas_present for my dad and it was just what he wanted , ideal .
M	they were helpfully with the delivery query i had and would use them again
M	their prices are always more_than fair , and if you can by stroke of luck happen to find an even cheaper price , they will even beat it .
M	i ' ve never had problems with any order and it always comes extremely fast .
M	if you aren ' t ordering from sw , you aren ' t getting the best bang for you buck , hands_down !
M	i ' m an 00 year_old student from birmingham and i ordered a gladiator mask for halloween to resemble one of my favourite rappers ; mf doom .
M	they sent me a cannibal mask - like the one hannibal lecter wore .
M	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
M	they said they would refund the postage it cost me to return it , but as soon as i said i had sent it , i haven ' t received an_email or refund from them .
M	very organised and the online payments were easy to track .
M	alpharooms sux , i booked a hotel that was advertised with room facilities eg , air_conditioning , sea vew , cable tv and fridge .
M	yes those facilities were there but had to pay extra for each facilies when we arrived .
M	the transfer they arranged kept us waiting 0 hours at 0am in turkey at the airport .
M	the customer_service is very poor and arrogant .
M	first and last holiday with alpharooms .
M	i ordered an item in the wrong_size and contacted customer_services about the mistake .
M	not only did the item arrive quickly and well_packaged but they also arranged to send the correct item just as quickly and kept me well informed .
M	i cannot recommend this company highly_enough , finally customer_services as they should be .
M	what a pointless delivery company .
M	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
M	just spoke to oliver at customer_services who confirmed they do not provide sat navs as a company .
M	well maybe they should .
M	here ' s to a day taken off work for nothing .
M	thanks guys .
M	i replaced my regular 0 part brush with this one and was very pleased .
M	and it ' s pretty to boot .
M	it holds the monomer well and is easy to form a good pearl .
M	you will like it !

M	bought a pair of limited_edition ray - bans from this site , was the only one i could find that stocked them in a full colour range
M	got them for my 0 month trek around the world and bought them last_minute but as promised they turned_up the next_day in a neat little package .
M	good service , easily contactable customer_service and a good price .
M	sweet as
M	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
M	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull
M	very trusted
M	did shoppping many_times .
M	trusted site
M	fastest delivery . happy with bike , price , and seller .
M	recommmend .
M	shopped first time was bit scared but will shop again now .
M	thanks
M	really great site .. amazing price .. quick delivery !
M	took less_than a week to sell my mobile and have the cash in the bank and its very simple to do ... :)
M	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
M	now i know why not , terrible customer_service ....
M	attempted to buy deal , and was informed card was rejected and to re - check details , after doing so , card rejected again .
M	checked with my bank , money taken twice by wowcher .
M	once calling them , no help at all , just told my money has been ring fenced and somebody will contact me back tomorrow , after not recieving a call , try them again .
M	" customer_service deal with this issue , but we can ' t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
M	so funds taken , no product , so far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
M	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can ' t speak to anyone ".
M	that would be stealing , it ' s a joke !
M	funniest thing is , the offer was a limit of 0 per customer , however i ' ve been charged twice ....... and have nothing to show for it , accept a lower balance on my account .
M	terrible system , service and company !
M	won ' t be using them ever again .
M	just as description , quick delivery ... no issues at all :)
M	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
M	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
M	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
M	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left behind ... etc .
M	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
M	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
M	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
M	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
M	... that they also try not to pay .
M	in short , don ' t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
M	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go elsewhere .
M	traded my near perfect_condition samsung mobile phone online saying they will " honor the agreed price " then they decided to slash Â£_00 from the agreed price saying the phone has a big scratch on the screen .
M	if i asked for my phone back they will probably send me a damaged one or purposely damaged the phone themselves .
M	they didn ' t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).
M	so please avoid using this company in store or online .
M	as the title_says , payment was instant !
M	so was the freepost return bag !
M	got my iphone_0s unlocked on the emea service network , great communication from this guy who kept me in the loop all along the entire_process .
M	great service for the small amount he charges , will_definitely use again and will also recommend to my friends .

M	my tv arrived yesterday in great condition well_packed and absolutely immaculate , arrived in the morning and was given free next_day delivery .
M	had a slight problem and recieved a call from a chap named karl who spent atleast 00_minutes on the phone with me assisting me with the issue , great chap offered me a free hdmi_cable which arrived today again with free next_day delivery , overall i am absolutely_delighted with my experience and would recommend prc to my . friends and family .
M	found the website after looking for a new rug and being a little put off by high_street prices .
M	this site is great !
M	i was a little_wary at first as i always am with lesser known companies , but i took the dive and ordered from them .
M	couldn ' t be_happier , good price and quick delivery .
M	i hadn ' t ordered from supplementwarehouse since 0000 and decided to give them a shot again .
M	i purchased some bcaa ' s , glutamine , and a pre_- workout .
M	i placed my order just before midnight on 00 - 0 and it arrived at my doorstep by 0 am today 00 - 0 .
M	while the shipping_costs were higher_than most places i believe the costs of the products themselves made it worth it and i couldn ' t believe_how fast it arrived at my house .
M	everything in my shipment was exactly_what i had ordered including my free_samples .
M	i will_definitely be using them again in the future if i continue to have positive_experiences like this one .
M	items arrived damaged in transit .
M	wiggle were brilliant in responding issuing replacements straight_away .
M	service with a smile .
M	thank_you wiggle !
M	service excellent , product excellent , price , unbeatable .
M	very helpfully on the phone , very fast reliable delivery , will be back for more items very soon
M	i have made a few orders with peak_nutrition and they have had the delivery at my door the next_day .
M	i like the next_day delivery , it is very effiicient .
M	whenever i have spoken to the people at peak_nutrition i have been spoken to warmly and they have dealt_with me well .
M	i buy cellfood and this is teh only place i can buy it in the uk from what i am aware .
M	i recommend them .
M	when shopping with supplement_warehouse it ' s never cut season for your wallet , even when it ' s showtime .
M	the price competitor option guarantees you the cheapest prices .
M	even if you dig through the net and actually find something cheaper , supplement_warehouse will dominate the price guaranteed .
M	there is no point in spending your hard_earned dollar on the same products elsewhere for twice the price .
M	i hope you read this and start making those serious gains with supplement_warehouse .
M	pretendo comprar novamente neste site / loja / empresa !
M	i ' ve had a good experience with them over 0 months .
M	the service was a bit more personal than british_gas who i ' d used previously and they faired well in my area on the price comparison_sites .
M	i paid for this and it was just a bunch of links to other_websites .
M	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
M	the information on how to jailbreak the iphone is freely available on the internet from legitimate companies such as iphone dev team .
M	customer_service was poor and there is misleading information on the website .
M	i paid Â£_00 for an immediate unlock which ended_up taking about 0 weeks and only lasted until the next apple update when the exploit used was patched .
M	the site is well_designed , and makes it incredibly easy to find the right hostel for your requirements and budget .
M	really happy with the service received from car mats uk .
M	the mats arrived exactly as ordered within a few_days of order being placed .
M	quality is very good and they are an absolutely perfect fit .
M	i went for the red and black edging and am very happy i did as it matches really well with the golf gti red trim .
M	would recommend without_hesitation and will certainly use again in the future .
M	the service provided by just pose massively exceeded our expectations .
M	we submitted our booking enquiry very close to the wedding date as we only decided we wanted a photo booth at the last_minute .
M	despite this , sam managed to respond very quickly , confirm our booking and get things moving in terms of confirming design choices and logisitics .
M	we were very happy with the design of the booth we picked ( vintage i believe ) and it matched the theme of our_wedding really well .
M	on the day the booth was manned by dan ( i believe - young , dark haired chap ).
M	he was absolutely fantastic and did a great job for the entire duration from set_up to the end of the evening .
M	he was cheerful , polite and very professional at all times .
M	he was also very approachable and was clear in explaining how the booth worked .
M	we were also very happy with the online gallery .
M	it is good that you upload the photos as they were in the sets , but also the individual pictures .
M	almost every guest we have spoken to have said that the booth really helped make the evening special .
M	we wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend just pose to anyone_looking for a photobooth and i would be incredibly surprised if anyone could offer a photo booth service better_than just pose did for our_wedding .
M	decent prices but sometimes hard to find specific flavors
M	its not often you get all three of the above when shopping online .
M	from browsing the website to receiving the goods the service is second to none !
M	the website is very informative , with logo ' s of the computer manufacturer , crystal_clear images of the memory , and best of all even a picture of the computer that you wish to upgrade , it really gives you reassurance that you are looking at the correct products that you need .
M	i made a mistake on my address when i placed the order so phoned them up , and someone answered the phone straight_away .
M	why cant all websites and companies be like mrmemory ?
M	!
M	i bought guild_wars 0 from onlinekeystore at the night and get the code 0min after i have payed for the product !
M	really good store !
M	i recommend this site !
M	i bought borderlands 0 on this webbsite on the 00 december and get the key 0 hours_later !
M	i recommend this site .
M	0_stars !
M	would happily buy from again , shipping was fast and reasonable prices .
M	they not always be the cheapest on products , but their customer support is always good .
M	i ' ve had several issues with products i ' ve purchased from them in the past but have always been dealt_with promptly and to a more_than satisfactory level .
M	recently had a holiday to tenerife booked through thomas_cook , it was a very good holiday , the reason i give it 0_stars though is because thomas_cook were pretty unenthusiatic , was informed that we ' d receive a discount card for restaurants , attraction etc .
M	plus money off our next holiday , never received .
M	and all transport , when part of thomas_cook , was always ridiculously late .
M	other than that , i had a great holiday , i would gladly use thomas_cook again , but feel these are thing thay could work on .
M	been using zavvi since it ' s buy out by " thehut " and i have to say i ' ve never had any_issues with them yet and they quite_often undercut competitors on price .
M	definitely worth keeping an eye on their " mega monday " deals .
M	ordered a 0gbp chainstay protector and received a 0gbp sports_nutrition shake .
M	this to me is a monumental cock up as it ' s not as if you can get the two confused .....
M	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
M	i ordered some whey_protein after paying a substatial amount more elsewhere , very happy with the product and service received .
M	fast delivery and price for the item cheapest which i could find in whole internet .
M	i would like to highly_recommend boston ltd .
M	another seamless and hassle_free transaction .
M	i recently_bought a tag_heuer formula 0 watch from iconic_watches .
M	i was a little_suspicious of making this online purchase , especially with the great price that was being quoted .
M	however , the whole experience was first_class .... and the great price was just another benefit of dealing_with iconic .
M	the communication from the team was great and the watch arrived when they said it would .
M	i have already_recommended this to friends and colleagues .
M	fantastic service with very good communication .
M	quick deliver and a good price
M	great website with loads of choice .
M	bought some carreras which got delivered really quick .
M	easy purchase process
M	good referral system ( although still_awaiting credit )
M	fast delivery
M	products taste excellent !
M	i am a strawberry protein guy , always have been and their strawberry is the best tasting so far .
M	their chocolate peanut is also very very yummy !
M	very easy to find flights for your destination .
M	easy to select what options you want and organize by price or number of stops .
M	transparent pricing and no_hidden_charges !
M	i recently_bought a canon_000d ( body only ) from simply_electronics .
M	i placed the order on the evening of thursday 00th sep and before i confirmed the order , i rang the customer_services number from their website to confirm stock_levels and to make_sure i would get one of the only 0 bodies in stock , i was assured i would !
M	i received excellent communication during the purchase , as in i got an_email after purchase , after funds clearance ( next_day with paypal ), after id_verification , and after dispatch with tracking_number with dhl .
M	i received my camera the following thursday 00nd september , so all in all , one week turn_around from placing the order to delivery to dublin , ireland .
M	would i reccomend them - yes
M	would i use again - yes

M	having spent a bit of time researching i decided what i would ideally want from a new desktop_pc .
M	i tried dinopc along with 0 others and ran a price comparison based on my desired specifications .
M	i decided that dinopc offered both the best specification and price so placed an order .
M	my new pc was delivered 0 weeks_later ( as stated on the website ) and i ' m more_than happy with what i ' ve got .
M	i would definitely_recommend dinopc if you are in the market for a new desktop_pc .
M	i ' ve just purchased a samsung 00 " smart_tv from rgb direct and , as is always the case when ordering from a new company , was a little_bit_nervous ( especially as the price was so good !
M	).
M	i needn ' t have worried though as the tv arrived the next_day as promised during the phone conversation prior to ordering , to check it was in stock .
M	overall very pleased with rgb direct & wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend them or purchase from them again .
M	i ' ve been buying from sw for a long time .
M	their customer_service is top_notch .
M	if i ever have a problem with the price_matching service , they make it right .
M	they have to hate google shopper , but at_least they still honor their claims .
M	the best part is that they will still sell things that have been_discontinued unlike retail_stores or many other online dealers , which is why i keep_coming_back .
M	once you find something that works , it really sucks when it ' s taken off the market and you can ' t find it anymore .
M	not so with sw !
M	keep up the good work guys .
M	i wish shipping prices could be reigned in a bit .
M	it always makes me question my purchase right at checkout time , but such is the price of doing_business i suppose .
M	ordered this game in february and got it the day before_release_date .
M	great price set months in_advance and great end product .
M	thankyou gameseek .
M	one word , faultless !
M	bought my v_fest ticket with double 0 , ticket came within a couple of days , great service , was informed when it had been dispatched and delivered .
M	will_definitely_recommend too freinds and use again !
M	!
M	i visit this site more_than 0 times a week to check out the killer deals they are always running .
M	it is so easy to find anything i could ever want on here .
M	the selection and prices cannot be beat , and if if you can find something cheaper they don ' t only match it , they beat it by 0_%!
M	i can ' t say enough to describe how much i love this site .
M	romek helped_us with an office move .
M	he was very efficient , punctual helpful and friendly .
M	i would definitely chose to work with him again .
M	excellent customer_service - their team managed to get my wife ' s engagement_ring in_advance of when i needed it and made sure i had everything i needed before whisking her away to propose .
M	can ' t praise them higher .
M	tried click finance for a car loan and was very happy with the service
M	after two_weeks from my order , i had not received any shipping confirmation and the order was still showing as " processing " in my account .
M	after writing to the customer support , though , i got a super - quick response saying the first shipment probably had got lost .
M	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two days after .
M	best price on the net for pre order for bbc0 delivered on time will be using them again
M	you can ' t get better then jovago for booking hotels for your africa trip .
M	fast response in case you need any help from customer_services .
M	jovago all the way
M	insured quite a few_times my rentals with questor .
M	once someone drove in to my car while abroad at night , to find car damaged on parking lot ...
M	did not took them long to return me my excess i pad for damage .
M	am using them all the time with no_problems
M	clear account offer a really good alternative to payday lending and they are cheaper !
M	if it wasn ' t for the constant bank connection errors this would be a 0 star .
M	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
M	in my particular case i had an_emergency and really needed funds badly .
M	i spoke to one of their representatives who told me not to log on to internet_banking for 00_minutes whilst he " did a reset ".
M	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .
M	i tried to call back after the 00_mins but got no answer .
M	there is no out of hours support_team which means after 00 : 00 you just can ' t get any help .
M	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
M	after my problem i email customer_services and the response was " stock " and not and explanation at all .
M	in summary i think it ' s a good service but personally i have had a " hiccup " with an unsatisfactory response .
M	i have just made my first purchase and it went very smoothly and couldn ' t have been easier .
M	i ' ll be back !
M	i was so surprised to see so many negative_comments .
M	i have been a customer for more_than 0 years ( changed a place 0 time ) and never had any_problems with them , it is simply working all the time .
M	called call - center once re .
M	contract extension - and everything went_smoothly .
M	also so cheap !
M	i am using momondo for more_than 0 years now .
M	and always recommend to all my friends .
M	all my holidays huntings start with momondo .
M	and now they have cars and hotels .
M	it would be also great to have holidays packages comparison ( like ok icelolly )
M	e_- cigs are a great product that have helped_me to stop smoking , my first kit i bought was from tecc and i was amazed at the quality of the product , i still use tecc products today as i know i can trust to get great quality everytime .
M	i ordered and xbox play and charge controller set on dec 0nd and i only recieved conformation that it was dispatched on the 00th_dec which i thing is rediculous service !
M	and now their is no garauntee i will get the item by christmas and i am appauled by this !
M	if its showing as in stock then why did it take from 0nd dec untill 00th to be dispached !
M	i actually dont even believe that i will ever even recieve the item at all after_reading the dreadfull revievs on this place and i cant_believe i didnt order from somewher i trust !
M	never had any_problems
M	0 days_later and my order hasn ' t been picked or shipped .
M	i tried to contact customer_service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
M	they ' re closed on saturdays .
M	awful experience and total_lack of customer_service .
M	if somethings not in stock or there is a problem you should send a email or get in contact with the customer .
M	i ' ve never waited this long to have a order picked or shipped , and i usually receive my products within 0 - 0 days from every other company i use .
M	i will not use supplement_warehouse again !!!
M	!
M	when i discovered cjs_keys , i expected something to be wrong or perhaps questioned the legitimacy of the site and / or service .
M	the price and service seemed too good to be true .
M	i couldn ' t believe_how easy it was to order from cjs and claim my key for such a fantastic price .
M	i will 000_% be using cjs again .
M	i contacted the company to see if they would pricematch with a price i had seen elsewhere and immediately they did .
M	they were prompt at responding to emails , and within a couple of days my order arrived .
M	excellent service throughout
M	i found the page and add my facebook contacts , two_weeks_ago i read that had the unlock for iphone decided to risk paying the release thinking it was real , but after making my steps of verification of the correct account of the release from my iphone was ready in 0 hours .
M	is an excellent release , incredible service and safe
M	excelente servicio de desbloqueo de iphone_0s
M	encontre la pagina y_la agrege a mis contactos de facebook , desde hace dos semanas lei que tenian el desbloqueo para el iphone decidi arriesgarme a pagar dicho desbloqueo pensando que no era real , pero luego de hacer mis pasos de verificacion de_la cuenta correctamente el desbloqueo de my iphone estuvo listo en 0 horas .
M	es un excelente desbloqueo , increible y seguro servicio
M	the website was easy to order from .
M	the items were delivered on time and all were clothing was of good quality , can ' t complain .
M	will shop at fineside again .
M	excellent service .
M	easy to use website and all my stuff arrived the next_day as i was told .
M	everything arrived in great condition which i was abit worried_about .
M	no_problems , highly_recommended .
M	slightly expensive for my liking , finding some bargains elsewhere .
M	other than that the service is good and i will probably use again .
M	delivery was 00_minutes late and ever since placing my order i get annoying text_messages about offers !
M	dont intend to use again !
M	delighted with the service i received .
M	friendly customer_services who were happy to help when i no_longer needed a basin for a job i was doing , cant be greatful enough .
M	fast delivery and great cheap prices , will_definitely be using again in the future .
M	couldn ' t be simpler , and very cheap too .
M	great , quick service .
M	would not hesitate in recommending mazuma to friends and family .
M	awesome transaction and they price matched with ease .
M	my 0 week delivery took over a month .... i recieved 0 e_- mails saying my anticipated delivery date had been changed , so i got in touch .
M	they told me my order had been stopped at customs , and they handled my copmlaint greatly .
M	even_though , my order was perfect and of good quality , i ' d not order again from gear0music , in case of another slow delivery
M	preowned ?
M	really ?
M	item looked new !
M	not a scuff or scratch on it .
M	got a text the morning of expected delivery saying that it ' d be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , item arrived at 00 : 00 .
M	not bad !
M	can ' t ask for much more really .
M	perfect service , will_definitely be buying from you again in the future
M	great service , good products , super_fast delivery , great prices and will definatly use them again .
M	cheers_guys !
M	!
M	ordered off them many_times , up to date info on tracking and seem very helpful .
M	and every time iv ordered iv had a freebie thrown in with what i ordered !
M	free next_day deliver on sometimes very large items is also a great plus !
M	very cheap , very fast , they should be proud of themselves :)
M	thanks again echo !
M	ordered an acer liquid phone .
M	cheapest i could find it online .
M	was a bit_concerned by some of the negative_reviews so was very pleasantly_surprised when it arrived very quickly ( i like the dhl_tracking_system they use ).
M	product was brand_new and very happy with my purchase .
M	ordering was a breeze and delivery turned_up first thing on the day i selected .
M	took a punt on buying from pinesolutions after traipsing about the shops and not finding anything we liked .
M	needn ' t have worried as the order process was smooth , the delivery was on time and the quality of the bed and bedside cabinets seem very good .
M	will buy from again .
M	i ordered a pair of monitor audio bx0 .
M	they were cheaper there than anywhere_else on the net .
M	next_day delivery was free , which was an added_bonus .
M	unfortunatlly , one of the channels had a problem , so i called them up and they immediatly oragnised a pickup for the next_day , no questions_asked .
M	as soon as they received my return , they called me up to say they were sending me a new pair .
M	all in all , you really couldn ' t ask more in terms of service ; they are reliable , cheap , quick , and a pleasure to talk to on the phone !
M	matt as parcel0go live help is very helpful and professional .
M	i have dealt_with him a few_times and its been 00 / 00 each time !
M	thanks !
M	bo
M	very helpful couldnt ask for more perfect service thank_you ( samantha )
M	i ordered a jump pack ( fw mkii ) for a conversion i am doing .
M	within 0 working_days order was here :)
M	i ' ve used the customer_service a few_times regarding different problems or requests .
M	each time they have been so helpful getting me over and above what i actually wanted or needed .
M	the service response is instantanious and gives you exactly_what you need every time .
M	there ' s nothing i can fault them on .
M	really awesome style .
M	even if you are not buying you can always look through their blogs on styling tips and learn simple yet effective everyday styles .
M	i can scroll on hours for fashion wear , they vary and range from low to high prices so , it really is for everyone from any background .
M	even if you are not buying you can get a good sense and styling knowledge .
M	order was dealt professionally , i had an issue with it , but they communicated effectively and was sorted out easily .
M	argos is one of the easiest shops to buy goods , with a simple pre order system as well as checking if your item is in stock at your local_store .
M	the staff are also very helpful , this is another ingredient as to why argos are so much more advanced that any other typical store .
M	i use the chester tesco store , twice a week , it is by_far my favourite grocery shop
M	this is bar far my most used search_engine .
M	by_far one of my favourite bingo game websites , full of prizes from money to virgin products
M	you won ' t go_wrong if your experience was anything like mine :
M	+ great value
M	+ quick as hell
M	+ well package
M	+ quality product
M	bookmarked and ready to use again !
M	i am always using abebooks . co . uk , the prices and wide_range are great , and unlike amazon the pricing in very transparent ( no 0p books with high postage_costs !)
M	i ' ve never had a problem with this site .
M	had some trouble_logging_into a course , spoke to kathy online ... she had me up and running within a couple of minutes .
M	great job
M	very good range of products and very quick service .
M	i can ' t say anymore
M	just perfect
M	one of the best clothes site services around !
M	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .
M	communication from the guy running it was awful , never calls back and refused to give me a refund .
M	i am_currently taking_legal_action to get my money back .
M	honestly i have never written a bad review before but please for your own sake do not even attempt to buy from this cowboy outfit , the trolley is poor and their service is the worst i have ever come_across .
M	i had been very happy with the service from the splashbackpeople , quick to respond on email , even at weekends .
M	the splash back did take a couple of weeks to arrive , but more trouble some was that it arrived damaged , a very small dimple in the metal .
M	very annoying .
M	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
M	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around ..
M	telling_me that a courier was picking it up soon and a replacement would be produced .
M	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so far been unable to do this .
M	in my opinion if you have no_problems with the goods from this company then they are probably ok , but if you experience any_problems then you may aswel set fire to your money .
M	we were after a good quality sign for the house and atlantic signs had a great site to get the preview then proofing stage via_email .
M	delivery was a week , quick considering it ' s bespoke .
M	it looks fantastic and really sets the house appart .
M	always delivered quickly , knowledgeable_staff always happy to help .
M	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
M	cover for my galaxy nexus .
M	i originally made a mistake and had it posted to an old address .
M	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
M	when the cover arrived it had good finish but creaked ever so slightly and it basically fell_apart within a week ( the first chips appeared on the first day ) and this was not through neglect and maltreatment - it was just day - to - day use .
M	when i complained i was offered a replacement straight_away and received it 0 days_later - we ' ll see how this one goes .
M	so overall , very good service but be wary of what products you buy .
M	expect to get what you pay for .
M	i had a problem with a courrier collecting the wrong item but jenny saved the day and helped resolve the situation .
M	she was friendly and helpful !
M	couldbt have asked for more .
M	i found this website by_accident a year_ago , and boy am i glad !
M	i have always received great service and every purchase was satisfactory .
M	to top it all off , they offer pretty_much the cheapest legal games that i can find .
M	i thoroughly_recommend this website to everyone !
M	i expected a lot of liberty_flights as they have been ' in the game ' for a long time so they must be doing something right which is why i decided to try them and i was not disappointed , i always have 000_% vg ( or close to if we ignore the flavouring ) and was happy to see they offered this in a lot of flavours as most sites don ' t .
M	my order arrived quickly and while i wasn ' t 000_% keen on the tobacco flavour their blueberry and forrest fruits in particular are awesome !, my missus loves the forrest fruits as well , if you make an order definately put a bottle of this in your basket !
M	:-)
M	i ordered the baby elegance cot bed from bella - bambino . com after i looked everywhere and they had the best prices & a professional looking webstore .
M	the item arrived after just two days in perfect_condition as expected .
M	i was updated via_email when the item was shipped etc which i really liked .
M	all together i think this store is great and will be using them again !
M	a +
M	good deals
M	they treat me like a thief and at the end they lost !
M	realy bad !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	avoid they only want your money !!
M	!
M	i ' ve received not working amplifier and when i ' ve inform hifi about problem they solve it very quickly :)
M	very helpful customer_service and great amplifier :)
M	everything happened as quickly and efficiently as i was told it would throughout the sale of my watch , very pleased with the service i received and would definitely_recommend watchfinder to anyone
M	i got given an iphone by a mate at school as he couldn ' t get it to work on orange .
M	i tried my sim in it and it didn ' t work either .
M	my dad said it was cos the phone was locked and i ' d need to phone the network to get it unlocked .
M	the trouble is we didn ' t know which network to call .
M	my dad found this site online and sorted everything out with them and it all works now .
M	i am using my pay as you go sim_card in it and can download apps , sms , everything .
M	pretty_cool website - fixed my iphone :)
M	they are still posting on their blog and social_media ?
M	they are still ***** operating ??!
M	!
M	" livingdesign europ " is what showed up on bank_statement as the company if it helps .
M	remember you are fully protected with " visa_debit " cards these days , not just credit_cards !
M	!
M	i used the online_chat for our business line issue and an engineer is coming to us tomorrow morning .
M	can ' t get a quicker response than that right .
M	thanks .
M	this is the 0nd watch i ' ve bought from watchfinder and once i decided what i wanted , i immediately knew i ' d use watchfinder again for their excellent customer_service and product quality .
M	the sales_reps are knowledgable and honest and put you under no pressure to buy and the customer care team are also helpful and very prompt in their replies .
M	will be happy to use watchfinder next time i look to buy .
M	website is particularly easy to use , love the way u can pick different combinations and the price difference is shown straight_away .
M	i think it was about 00 days overall from me ordering my laptop to having it delivered .
M	the laptop itself was even better_than i had imagined .
M	the cosmos ii is light and thin , the outer shell attractive and all ports are placed well .
M	keyboard and touchpad both responsove and the setup was a breeze .
M	overall i would have no problem recommending pc_specialist as a way of getting a high end machine at a lower cost without_compromising on the quality
M	good prices , well_packed and quick delivery .
M	all good !
M	two days delivery from
M	england to n . ireland .
M	i live in the middle of nowhere and always have problems with deliveries from courier companies so i usually take estimated_delivery dates with a pinch of salt but true to their word they delivered within 0day slot .
M	emailed in the morn to say would be with me within a certain time and so they where .
M	total pain free service !
M	few pounds less_than other_companies offered for the phone but i knew the name and had used before .
M	0 days after i posted phone money was in my bank .
M	couldn ' t fault them
M	i always pre_- order my ps0_games from simply_games and unlike many other_companies they have never let me down .
M	i always get games a day or two early and not once have i had a game turn_up late .
M	for this reason , i occasionally pay a couple of pounds more for pre_- orders with them , but more often than not simply_games are either on par or better_than the competition with their pricing .
M	i can ' t personally vouch for their customer_service but my friend had a positive experience in getting a refund with them .
M	i took a risk using cjs - cdkeys since i ' ve neveer trusted a site that can offer you cheaper games , however the risk paid off .
M	i ' ve now brought my second game from them and it came quick ( if not instant ) as did the first .
M	i would highly_recommend them , save your self a few bucks :).
M	i ' ve used amazon for over 0 years and never had a problem with their service .
M	the delivery sometimes is late but is not their fault and if you paid for it they will refund it with no_problems .
M	any time i had to call or web chat they always solved my problem .
M	a bit overpriced but their service is excellent , no problem with returns or rma .
M	i ' ve bought many games from this company and all the keys are sent instantly , not to mention that this is the cheapest place to buy steam or origin_keys .
M	can ' t ask for better .
M	great prices and fast delivery .
M	after paying Â£_00 for next_day delivery and order it to my work address so i wouldn ' t have to miss a day of work , nothing shows up .
M	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
M	0st - that ' s a lie because i work at a garage and there ' s always people around who can call me .
M	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
M	and it makes me so upset that even after the e_- mail i tried to find a number to call someone from dpd to explain what happen , i couldn ' t find any number on their web_site .
M	then again it ' s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
M	and again best price available on the internet and the delivery in less_than a minute .
M	a great website easy to use , fast and dedicated staff at hand to help and the delivery is the best i have ever received .
M	just a great all_round company
M	ordered my iphone 0 through the quidco website with the Â£_00 cash back advertised .
M	at first i was skeptical with many people saying they didn ' t receive anything from quidco .
M	however , my experience with quidco was great !
M	no hassle just ordered and waited for the pounds to roll in !
M	chuffed when Â£_00 was paid into my account after 0 months !
M	waited over two_weeks for my order and when i opened it i found they had sent me the wrong thing .
M	after talking with their hopeless staff they had agreed to collect the package and give me a refund however , after another week no on came to collect it .
M	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
M	the courier came and i thought that was the end but , after two_weeks no payments have been received .
M	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
M	i ' ve been using supplement_warehouse now for a few_years and i have never had a bad_experience .
M	no matter what product i choose to purchase they have always been able to beat any price i have searched for and trust me i ' ve tried .

M	thank_you supwarehouse .

M	budgetair appear to trade under various different guises .
M	booked return flights london to koh samui , via bangkok on british_airways and connecting with bangkok airways .
M	immediately after payment , realised there was a one - character mistake in my surname .
M	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about Â£_000 -Â£_000 to correct .
M	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
M	i explained this to budgetair but still they said it would cost Â£_000 fee .
M	pretty steep , considering the entire return_flight was only about Â£_000 !
M	eventually i gave up with their call_centre in amsterdam , despite escalating my issue to a ' manager '.
M	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
M	i said i ' d rebook the flights again directly with british_airways and just take them to court ( citing unfair fees ) to get my money back off them .
M	i left it at that , and a few_days_later ( after various token reductions in their fee demand ) miraculously they decided that they could make the change after all at no charge , albeit meaning both people travelling would be on separate bookings ( which was fine ).
M	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
M	i would have been happy to pay a reasonable fee for the change - it was my mistake after all .
M	also , not entirely budgetair ' s fault , also they failed to mention that our bags would not be checked (' interlined ') all the way through to koh samui , meaning we ' d have to collect them at bangkok and check them back in .
M	despite them sorting everything out , the fact that i had to basically bully / threaten them into it means i can ' t possibly award anything more_than 0 star .
M	edit - i felt a bit harsh for originally awarding them one star and revised it up to two , but since they ' ve left a pretty useless ' response ' trying to justify their behaviour i ' m putting it back to one again .
M	just brought rome total war 0 for a friend as a birthday_present .
M	i ' m really happy with the service i received .
M	i had to verify my phone number by text but this was no problem at all .
M	it all went through in about 00 seconds .
M	from now on cjs will be my game store of choice .
M	excellent .
M	responded extremely quickly to emails and fantastic customer_service .
M	great for a first time buyer needing some answers regarding which sunglasses would be best and they are reasonably_priced , highly_recommend to anyone !
M	i brought a car from trade centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0 weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0 weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong
M	good price , low shipping charges , fast delivery !
M	very happy buyer , delivered fast , low shipping_costs and good prices
M	when i found simply_games on a comparison site i thought too good to be true , how wrong was i , placed order paid through paypal , received fifa_00 next_day , will_definitely buy from them again a ++++++++

M	i am really thankful to her assisting me very well
M	easy to find places , read reviews to make a decision and easy to book .
M	instructions to find places also made the experiences that much_easier and stress_free !
M	00 / 00 !
M	when i first started vaping , i stumbled_across c0v after being recommended a riva 000 as a good starting point ...
M	i had a few questions and e_- mailed them , the response was almost immediate and it was well out of working hours ...
M	which i was amazed at .
M	i had a doa atomiser with my starter_kit , they sent me out a replacement no_problems ..
M	i wanted a less fiddly approach they pointed me toward the vison clearos which have been great ... as a complete newb , knowing that i will always get customer orientated advice has kept me coming_back ... just bought from them again , shipping time very good ... as usual fantastic customer_service ...
M	i would suggest them to everyone , whether new to the vape estate ... or if you ' ve been at it for a while , it ' s a great company ...
M	this was a great all_round purchase .
M	i got exactly_what i wanted at a good price and it was delivered very quickly .
M	i can ' t ask for much more !
M	great service great product
M	a massive thank_you to martin alderson , he was very helpful .

M	i addressed in this company the first time and , believe me , it was pleasantly_surprised with professionalism of people which here work .
M	the order was delivered when should .
M	as i am in other country , i can not check everything , now i don ' t worry_about it , i can trust in eflorist !!!
M	good fellows !
M	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail message .
M	the one person that sounded_like he knew what he was talking_about said it was a bad line ( i could hear him perfectly ), told me he ' d call me back , but never did .
M	no games anymore , so cancelled my 0 year long subscription .
M	business suicide .
M	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
M	i picked_up my puppy on the friday with no sign of puppy food from yourselves .
M	as it was a double bank_holiday ( queens jubilee ) i accepted this and didn ' t think about it again until te following thursday .
M	still no sign of my product .
M	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn ' t paid for my product and this is why i hadn ' t yet received it .
M	0 minutes later i provided my paypal payment confirmation details and was then told that there had been a mistake between paypal and yourselves but confirmed i had actually paid for the product and it would be dispatched the next_day as a priority .
M	at which point it was then said that in future i needed to check my order statuses changed from received to processed , as though it was my responsibility to check your back office were doing their job correctly .
M	i felt this was quite rude .
M	further to this , one week_later i get a knock on the door from a neighbour who took ownership of my eventual delivery 0 days prior as i had been out at time of delivery but courier didn ' t leave a ' i missed you note ' so i we unaware of this .
M	your prices are great but your system is flawed beyond function
M	was very happy to find christmas pressie at a great price and to receive it within a day !
M	product looks great , packaged well and was kept up to date from sale to delivery .
M	pleasure to do business with
M	price lower_than anywhere_else so was a bit_sceptical about delivery .
M	was blown_away by the excellent communication and speed at which item was delivered .
M	absolutely will deal with again
M	i have been using the asda grocery delivery service for the last_year as my local asda is miles_away and as i do monthly grocery_shopping , found it a convenient solution to long shopping excursions with limited time .
M	despite my first delivery from asda being absolutely disastrous as the driver forgot to unload all the fresh good , the situation was eventually resolved through a refund and Â£ 0 evoucher for the inconvenience , i decided to give them another change .
M	unfortunately this seems to have been a misguided notion as last_night i was called by the delivery driver 00_minutes before my delivery window would finish ( 00 : 00 ) to be told that the vehicle has broken down and as it is not store policy to redeliver , i will be receiving a refund after which i can place a new order .
M	as a student with a small family , my finances are very limited and thus i purchase my monthly groceries to be sufficient for the month before paying all other bills .
M	thus i don ' t have another Â£_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
M	i do understand that vehicle breakdowns are beyond anybody ' s control , but am not understanding of the fact that asda does not rectify their failure by arranging for a re - delivery at the earliest convenience .
M	to make_matters worse , when contacting the customer_service center this morning to discuss this matter , i was informed that it shouldn ' t take longer_than 0 days and after becoming rather adamant that i do still require the delivery or require the money to be refunded in a manner that i can receive it earlier , i was told that they would call the store to see whether they are ' willing ' to ' help me out ' after which they would contact me immediately to notify me of the decision .
M	five hours_later i have still not received a call and called the customer_service team again to be told that they do not know what has been done about the earlier call or email that i sent and repeated the whole_process from 0 hours earlier .
M	fortunately this assistant was a little more helpful as she called me within ten_minutes to inform me that she has spoken to a picking assistant that now needs to speak to his manager to find out whether they can once again attempt to ' accommodate ' me .
M	two hours_later i have still not received a phone call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
M	after this experience , i can only assume that my Â£ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
M	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer_service !
M	!
M	i have retracted my prior statement .
M	an aria cs_team member has gone to great lengths to resolve this issue with me .
M	i commend him for doing so .
M	the only issue i had was with the initial response with my query .
M	they got good games , fast responses to e_- mails and a nice serve .
M	what do you want more :)
M	the site itself is very well set_up and i use it over hostelworld ( my first time booking hostels ).
M	really like the " show map " option in which you just hover your mouse over the words and it shows you a small idea of where the place is on a little google map .
M	it ' s also nice to click on the " show room_types " to see what kind of rooms they have without having to click and load / reload the page .
M	overall , a very simple and easy process of booking !
M	i ' ll be making_sure to write detailed reviews of hostels so my experience can help people make decisions like me !
M	before i decided to go for this website , i was looking at many other_sites and this page looked very promising and i thought that i need to talk to someone before going ahead .
M	i phoned up and one of the operators explained how it worked .
M	i did go for it and like they said , within 00_hours had my iphone_unlocked .
M	easy done , didn ' t have to send my phone anywhere and yes ,,, very , very happy .
M	thank_you !
M	i ' m using the service to transfer money to my own account in finland from uk .
M	the cost and speed of my banks is appalling compared to this .
M	would prefer setting this up with my friends if my friend had not recommended me to try transferwise .
M	it was easy to setup a new transfer and paying it with my debit_card .
M	i ' ve been using the service only few_times , but the money has transferred to my bank_account before the estimated time .
M	i recommend this to any of my friends .
M	i ordered a micro scooter black as it was the cheapest and it had free delivery but 0 days_later i tried to make contact and there was no number to call so had to email them which took 0 days for a reply to then be told that the item was out of stock and was being sent straight from the manufactures .
M	0 days_later i revived my goods , i would pay a little extra and use another company so that i could get a tracking_number ...
M	the guys at watch_finder were a pleasure to work with , i was interested in a rolex explore which they contacted me as soon as they had one in stock .
M	the watch arrived 0am the next_day which was a saturday .
M	it was in a0 condition and i couldn ' t be_happier .
M	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
M	do not fall for the ever so nice website .
M	took my money and that ' s it .
M	criminals and scum .
M	i have never had a problem with quidco and the cashback always tracks very quickly - alot quicker_than other cashback sites .
M	their cashback is always very competitive and i end up using them alot more_than others .
M	i would rate this the number 0 cashback site in the uk
M	i ' ve used hippobag / hippowaste 0 times now and each and everytime i ' ve been thoroughly_impressed .
M	my property isn ' t the easiest one to collect the hippobag from however they ' ve never struggled .
M	i thoroughly_recommend these_guys and if you ' re considering a skip then don ' t !!
M	get these_guys instead !
M	looking through all the other reviews i was very hesitant to order from these_guys but , after_speaking to a friend who has used them , i did ....
M	i must_say that i ' m very impressed .
M	i ordered my iphone0s later afternoon and it arrived the next_day ( as promised ).
M	i wasn ' t in for delivery but they just left it at the post_office for me to collect which is only 0 minutes down the road .
M	contract seems to have been set_up correctly and i spoke with orange yesterday to give them my pac_code - all seems fine .
M	i think you should ignore most of the comments on this page relating to delivery problems and communication problems .
M	most , as you ' ll see , are over christmas and this company is relatively_small and they are also only as good as their courier .... most couriers are shocking over christmas and mess things up .
M	mpd are by_far the cheapest i could find for the iphone plus they give cashback on topcashback and / or quidco .
M	i say give them a go and you won ' t be disappointed .
M	trust me !
M	this company is part of an organisation that owns many bad carparking companies .
M	including kkarparks ltd . more car_parking .
M	airport_parking choices and comparemeetandgreet .
M	do not use them under any circumstances as i promise you you ' ll be disappointed .
M	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
M	they have even gone to the trouble to cancel the email address that we were given for contacting them
M	this company and any company associated to it is completely illegal and will either park your car in an unsafe place or they will steal your money .
M	do not use .
M	this is a complete and utter scam .
M	they are not a real car_parking company and are not supported by any organisations that regulates car_parking .
M	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
M	they will not park your car in a secure place .
M	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
M	they ' ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
M	absolutely_shocking .
M	i am now pursuing them through my bank and most_likely will go through small_claims .

M	i compared the charges and exchange_rate with paypal and banks which was really much much_better .
M	when you send money by banks or paypal , it takes around 0 days for the money to be in the recipient ' s account while using transferwise it is directly transferred the next working_days , i have experienced twice .
M	i have been using supplement_warehouse for as long as i can remember .
M	i can always count on them to have everything in stock that i need and a a great price .
M	supplement_warehouse is always sending great promotional offers and discounts on new and popular products which makes things easier financially for a college_student that has aspirations to improve his physique and personal performance .
M	thanks for everything supplement_warehouse and i will always be a loyal_customer .
M	ps0 developed rlod syndrome , gave chris a call , got an_appointment for the following_day ( phoned late evening ).
M	ps0 was fixed after an_hour !
M	great and friendly service !
M	will_definitely be the first place to go to for all console related problems and will be the first place to be recommended !
M	thanks for the service , well worth the money !
M	pretty simple and clean designed website and excellent prices .
M	if you think those aren ' t the most_important site features desired for someone booking an hotel / hostel in europe from south_america then you are missing out a fantastic tool to plan your travels , particularly if you are planning for a group .
M	three stars just because my order took 0 days to be dispatched due to an error , everything else was great including the customer_service guys who i spoke to .
M	i have ordered many things from hifiheadphones and that will_continue for a very very long time .
M	i genuinely have not dealt_with another company that has given better service .
M	the one time i had a fault with a product , it was replaced quickly , efficiently and without any hassle at all .
M	even ended_up having a lengthy conversation about various headphone / hifi things with the guy on the phone .
M	they properly know their stuff and are friendly and knowledgeable with it - not arrogant and pushy in the slightest .
M	you can see from the other reviews here exactly how great this company are .
M	i see no other choice for my headphone needs !
M	good website , fast delivery , friendly & helpful staff .
M	what more can you ask for really ?
M	very happy with the service provided .
M	i needed a clock asap as i had forgotten to buy a present for my friend .
M	they processed and delivered the clock the next_day !
M	truly excellent service .
M	firstly , mazuma offered the best price for recycling the phone i had out of any of the other recycling websites .
M	the phone i had also had a shattered screen , which several other_websites would not accept , but mazuma did .
M	i recieved the free postage envelope quickly , and they recieved the phone quickly after i posted it .
M	i was then paid ... quickly .
M	thanks for doing what you say you will mazuma .
M	i bought a samsung_galaxy s 0 from buymobilephones recently .
M	it was the joint cheapest place on the contract i wanted with a couple other_places , but buymobilephones give quidco cashback so i went with them .
M	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i ' ll have to wait and see for myself .
M	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
M	buymobilephones of course didn ' t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it ' s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .
M	when placing my order , they underhandedly tried to shovel in some free for first month ( very expensive after that ) insurance by default in small letters , which i managed to take out of the shopping basket but i can see a lot of people falling for that .
M	there was also a ' choose free gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it ' s just a pay_monthly item .
M	quite obvious to me but it ' s more underhanded work which would catch out the less observant of us .
M	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i ' m pleased with the phone .
M	however , the usb cable that came with the phone does not work and i am having to borrow one off a friend .
M	i sent them an_email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
M	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
M	i have to give three stars because i got the phone i wanted at the price i wanted , and quickly .
M	but the overall ordering experience was bad , it had me paranoid they were going to catch me out with something and of course i have this non working usb cable that came with my phone and no timely support for it , perhaps they are waiting to see if i ' ll call their premium_rate number .
M	we have been for 0 year with this company .
M	the whole year is bad_experience .
M	when agreement between payment_sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
M	after agreement was made - that ' s where all problems started : the agreed charge was triple ( they started to divide the agreed charge by a few different accounts and merchants and tried to explain that these are all different things which were extra charged - this was never explained .
M	customer_service - horrible - they never call you back after agreement is made and you start paying .
M	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
M	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
M	please have a look at [_external reference_]
M	thank_you
M	thank_you
M	i have used funky_pigeon many_times over the past couple of years , and have bought cards , calendars and iphone covers .
M	all have been delivered promptly .
M	the card creator is excellent and allows a great level of customisation ( particularly inside of the card ), and the final product is of a very high_quality .
M	i am also very impressed with the photo iphone covers .
M	my wife has got through 0 or 0 from other_places over the last_year , so thought i would give the funky_pigeon ones a go .
M	and they are by_far the best in terms of quality , colour and durability .
M	highly_recommend .
M	from start to finish i was very happy with mazuma .
M	i paid for next_day delivery , and payment was made the following_day !
M	top_marks !
M	would definitely use again .
M	used fonebank . com a handful of times to get some cash for old_mobiles .
M	i have always been impressed with how easy the whole_process is , and how quickly the money is paid .
M	would definitely_recommend !
M	first time buyer at myprotein . com , and have to say i was impressed .
M	the website is easy to use , and i was able to compare a few items with no_problems .
M	reviews of each were very helpful in making my final selection .
M	next_day delivery was within the one hour_window stated , and i was kept_updated_throughout to let me know where my order was .
M	will_definitely be coming_back for more supplies soon !
M	completely nailed the website redesign - very easy to use site , completely informative , straight to the point with well_presented information without any spammy content , which makes a nice change .
M	the live_chat feature enabled me to make an informed purchase after_speaking with a technical salesperson .
M	cheers mike !
M	delivery times are shockingly fast , i can ' t believe it ' s free !
M	never had any_problems what - so - ever with shop . to and have highly_recommended them to everyone i know
M	fast delivery great customer_service what more could you ask for
M	extremely_helpful .
M	don ' t mind going out their way to give you the best deal and package also find the right alloys for your car !
M	i ' ve been without signal for over 0 weeks now .
M	originally i thought nothing of it , because i figured any_issues would be solved fairly quickly .
M	how wrong i was .
M	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .
M	i gave them it and they provided a vague response that said there was a fault with a mast and they were working to fix it .
M	0 weeks down the line and many tweets asking for more information have received the same response .
M	my signal finally came back last friday for about a day ... then a pigeon flew into the mast or something and i ' m left without signal again .
M	i ' m not happy paying Â£_00 for this service , so i enquired_about reducing it for this month .
M	i ended_up on the phone to and indian_call_centre , were the operator could understand me , and i couldn ' t understand him .
M	so i gave up .
M	i was then encouraged by three ' s official twitter page to file a complaint on their website .
M	that was a week_ago and i ' ve heard_nothing from them .
M	i ' ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i ' m more_than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it ' ll cost to be rid of them for good .
M	disgraceful company .
M	i ordered my pc from pcs just after christmas , i .
M	was aware of their limited opening times over the christmas_period so once the first working day came along i upgraded my order to 0 day dispatch .
M	i was called from pcs a few hours_later to explain they were picking my order and that there was an issue with they graphics_card i had chosen .
M	unfortunately it would not fit into the case i wanted so i swapped that out over the phone and the pc was built that day , went into testing and dispatched for the next_day .
M	the delivery service pcs use is dpd and i have had no issues with them whatsoever , they offer a one hour delivery slot and i could even track my package as the driver made his route .
M	all in all i would highly_recommend pcs , speedy service , polite communication , help when you need it and excellent value .
M	never used simplycdkeys before but i would certainly use them again , they were cheap , efficient and very fast with the delivery of the key .
M	the website is extremely easy to use and everything is done securely .
M	you can even pay with paypal .
M	we ordered blinds from blinds0go . co . uk having found them using a search_engine .
M	we were looking for some specific colours in black - out - blinds style and found the selection available to be superb .
M	we first ordered some samples which were sent out immediately and delivered within 0 days and once we were happy with our selections our order was placed .
M	we were kept_informed via_email of the status of our order and the blinds were dispatched and delivered very quickly .
M	couldn ' t fault them .
M	the post sale service is amazing , there was a problem with the product but it was resolved quickly .
M	good communication as well :)
M	house_network beats the socks off of the traditional high_street agent both in terms of value and service .

M	excellent customer_service , nice payouts !
M	quick withdrawals !
M	several games , nice graphycs !
M	new_york pass is the best way to enjoy touristic attractions in ny .
M	if you make wise decisions , you must buy the ny pass to see every attraction in ny , despite you are not willing to visit every attraction .
M	you can easily find hostel all over the world and they are cheaper_than other_companies , in addition hostelbookers . com doesnt charge for reservation , which is great !
M	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today ' s booking hasn ' t turned_up .
M	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
M	best to go elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
M	ordered a vapourlites replacement that arrived much faster_than i expected and havent had a cigarette since !
M	everything i ' ve ever needed i ' ve been able to find at supplement_warehouse .
M	their prices are competitive with other suppliers and the occasional sale can net good savings .
M	plus , the using the code from the e_- letter is helpful .
M	i ' ve gotten countless shakers for free with orders ; which is nice when you destroy them like me .
M	i ' ve bought tickets from your website for the europa league final , i need these before tuesday as i travel to amsterdam on that day and the seller is yet to have posted the tickets !!

M	after dealing_with money grabbing local estate_agents for years i finally took the plunge and picked housenetwork to sell my latest property online .
M	from the inital phone call , the amazing pictures and the marketing package they put_together to the 0st_class customer_service including your own_personal account_manager they were simply amazing .
M	and to top it all off they only charged a 0rd of what i would have paid to a local estate_agent .
M	stop thinking about it and go for it they ' re worth their weight in gold .
M	feel free to use this 0 % code they gave me yuigigbnjh
M	only had the laptop just over a week , first_impressions ... impressive .
M	speedy build and configuration period , fast postage by a well_known courier .
M	im sure i will be back for more in the future !
M	m briggs
M	happy with the price .
M	fast transaction .
M	received money bang on when they said .
M	would recommend to any0 !
M	really please
M	their product does not work well .
M	the instructions they give you for their site are not even written for the software they provide you with
M	they signed me up for an annual service and never tell you it is a two year contract .
M	just read all the other reviews on them .
M	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .
M	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
M	to add_insult to injury they have now charged me for the 0nd year , only 0 months in to the first year .
M	they said they sent a letter which was a notice to charge my card 0 weeks_ago but this is not true .
M	they are in breach of contract
M	they would not talk to me on the phone - a lady_called lynne fletcher who is the renewals manager : tel : 00000000000 refused to speak to me , leaving her subordinate under her direction to inform me to fill in their online complaints form ( which is worrying that they would need one anyway !!!)
M	on the complaints form i asked her to call me but she just replied_saying they were not in the wrong and just to email her if i was not happy .
M	i have now approached hsbc to refund my transaction .
M	if you have had similar problems , please report them at first to citizens_advice on + 00 ( 0 ) 000 000 0000 , it only take a few minutes and the more complaints they get , the more likely it is these_guys will stop ripping people off .
M	was booking a parcel going to zambia for work and kept getting an error_message ,
M	i spoke to very helpful and funny lady_called cathrine who sorted out a problem via the live_chat , i had to wait a little_bit but was offered a small discount which was very nice .
M	nice to speak to someone with a personality not not just a yes / no policy robot .
M	will_definately use again .
M	the website was by_far better then i rest i found .
M	the hover over the map link was definetly beneficial when trying to find a place in the loaction i wanted .
M	trailfinders managed to get excellent deals through korean airlines to nz for us and managed to hold the flights for six_months before we had to pay .
M	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
M	one thing though if you book make_sure you request to be seated together , we managed to get separated on the flight as they had us down as two window seats despite the fact we we ' re returning to nz to get married .
M	0 provides almost acceptable network quality in central_london but intermittent cut outs become frustrating during peak_times .
M	in terms of managing an account they do a reasonable job but continued up selling becomes tiresome quickly ( esp mobile_broadband ).
M	it works most of the time and the prices are ok , want more_than this and you will be left wanting .
M	easy to use , quality and price point bang on the money ( my money )
M	exactly_what i said above .
M	unbeatable_prices with same day despatch and even on standard delivery , our order was delivered the next_day .
M	i like the fact invoices are emailed once despatched .
M	we ' ve been using printing . com cambridge office as our main printing supplier for the past few_years .
M	billy and matt are always happy to help and offer the best prices around with a super_fast turnaround .
M	xbox one delivered on launch day 0 minutes into my designated confirmed delivery slot , full communication via e_- mails and text informing_me as to the whereabouts of my xbox .

M	the only site to get all of your iphone unlocking needs is the officialiphoneunlock . co . uk .
M	this site is a trusted , relyable and will permanently factory_unlock any iphone you have . hi im from the island of trinidad and tobago and i have a iphone_0s that was locked to rogers_canada , there was no jailbreak to get my phone unlock and i was not going to spend a set of money to buy those gevey sims that only tempory unlock iphones . serching for a unlock for my iphone i stumbled_upon this site .. officialiphoneunlock . co . uk ... now i have a permanent factory_unlock iphone that could work with any sim_cards in my country and around the world and it will stay unlock even if i upgrade my iphone ... thanks guys keep up the good work ..
M	it was all very easy to use , and simple to fill in the on line form .
M	i couldn ' t believe_how fast the free envolope arrived and then how quickly the cheque arrived .
M	so easy so fast , do it !
M	nothing i can complain_about , greta product , great price and great and very fast service .
M	great prices , tons of free goods , quick and easy check out .
M	could use a little help on shipping prices but all the free_stuff makes up for most of it .
M	ordered a headboard and it looks great .
M	the live_chat help provided by diamond_geezer was invaluable when choosing a ring to propose with .
M	my wife was delighted with the results and they took all the comments i had got from her to come up with the correct design .
M	prices were very fair too .
M	even once the sale had been made and money paid service remained good when we had to get the ring resized .
M	very happy and recommended to other friends on the cusp of proposal ...
M	we have been with fu for just over a year now , and twice in the past_year , we have not only been accused of not paying our bill , but on several_occasions have failed to even receive a bill .
M	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn ' t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn ' t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn ' t paid it .
M	we have now got another solicitors letter claiming that once again we have not paid them Â£_000 . 00 when in actual fact we have paid it and are in possession of receipts proving this , will be ringing them on monday and recording any calls we exchange .
M	its an_absolute travesty and we are seriously considering switching providers .
M	adam tyreman
M	supper fast and helped a lot
M	came fast is what it said and got my cash back thanks
M	0 times canceled for no reson
M	nice way to book a travel not bothering much about finding some buttons , or that your card won ' t be accepted or something else will happen
M	thanks guys .
M	my 0gs is now unlocked and my orange simcard is now working without the aid of temporary jailbreaks .
M	ordered sunday , received unlock confirmation on thursday .
M	if you do have a phone that has jailbreak software on it , the process may be slightly different .
M	in my case i was on firmware from 0000 ( v0 . 0 . 0 ).
M	itunes told me i had to restore to factory settings and then my firmware was updated .
M	bit_annoying as i ' ve had to spend a couple of hours in the app store and i ' ve lost paid apps .
M	there may be a solution to this that i ' ve missed .
M	i suggest if you have any_questions - email officialiphoneunlock before you buy .
M	wish i knew about this service earlier
M	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
M	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of Â£ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
M	the " shipping " is free but the information on the website is very unclear , and for most people the distinction between shipping and handling is irrelevant .
M	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
M	searching their site can be painful , but their live_chat tech_support are very good at the search part .
M	farnell - if you read this , think again .
M	in the meantime , i ' m off to find a new supplier .
M	i used transferwise to convert money from gbp to eur .
M	the transfer was simple to book , you can transfer the money easily to their uk bank for free , and the conversion happened within 0 days and was in my bank in estonia .
M	the fees were very reasonable , the exchange_rate better_than you would get anywhere_else .
M	can ' t argue with that .
M	i ' ve not had to shop through hmv that much and to be honest , i ' m quite happy of that fact .
M	i only used them once online and that was more_than enough for me .
M	bought myself an xbox_000 with 0 games as a bundle pack , thought i would treat_myself .
M	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
M	i thought ... and that was the first mistake .
M	the 0th day came , nothing through the post or any attempted deliveries , i thought i would just give them benefit of christmas deliveries as it was around that time ... finally on the 0th day after delivery i got something but was way too small for the xbox_000 ... i got one of the games from the bundle ... ok , so where is the rest of it ?
M	surely as a bundle offer it should all come together .
M	i didn ' t make an issue as the next_day the actual xbox_000 came along , but where was the other game ?... it didnt arrive until another 0 weeks had gone by , so in the end for everything to get to me , it took 00 days .
M	faaaar from the best service i should be expecting .
M	again this was a while back but i still won ' t buy anything online from them .
M	another bad_experience was that of my sister ordering a shirt from them quite a few_months back .
M	somehow , and i have no_idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account ... naturally one very p * ssed off sister .
M	if you can avoid it , don ' t order online with them , all you will get at the least is long delays for your item to come .
M	another thing i ' ve noticed , and i hope this isn ' t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
M	a quick example .
M	xbox_000 transfer kit .
M	online - Â£_00 . 00 .
M	in - store - Â£_00 . 00 ... which leads me onto the prices themselves .
M	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower_price but besides the point , surely this isn ' t how a business should actually operate ).
M	on the plus side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
M	i could rate less but it has been a little while since i used hmv and i don ' t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
M	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
M	when i lived at home with the family ( before mum actually checked to see if asda delivered to our area ) we would get deliveries from tesco , suually my responsiblity to take everything in when everyone_else had buggered off .
M	the delivery person , in my experience , has always been very friendly and cheerful so no problem there , a few substitutions of products here and there but they stick to what they say that , if the replacement costs more_than the original , no extra charge will be placed so that is always great .
M	not a single delivery has arrived later than stated as well so what more could you want from them ?
M	later down the line and now living in a student house for university i gave them a full use for myself a few weeks_ago , ordering groceries online , requesting the delivery slot and the like .
M	all absolutely easy and no issues_whatsoever .
M	with special_offers , if you request a delivery outside of that special offer timeslot it does inform you that the deal will not be available so they don ' t try to hide costs from you .
M	when the delivery arrived the gentleman ran through the list of what had been received and how it works ( because it was my first time to order myself ), not a single substitution made and for the tip of the iceberg , he even offered to carry everything into the kitchen for me !
M	i declined but regardless it shows that the staff themselves are able to go beyond their duty if they so wish .
M	all in all , a great service , cheap , easy to use and polite and friendly staff , fantastic !
M	super useful_information from product , to instructions to customer feedback .
M	click to buy anyway you like paypal , cc etc .
M	easy layout , good search options and sorting of products .
M	excellent offers ( i . e .
M	free delivery ).
M	amazing free_samples lets you try things you might never try otherwise .
M	care in packaging ( eco friendly ), prompt delivery , everything always comes nicely_wrapped .
M	top bananas .
M	i love supplement_warehouse .
M	the shipping may be expensive , but all of the giveaways , discounts , and free_samples and merchandise makes up for that .
M	love the price_match feature , so you know that your getting the best price possible for the products you are purchasing .
M	have had no_problems using this site so far .
M	love it !
M	!
M	i needed to find a hostel that was adaquate and cheap for a few_days in spain until i found a flat .
M	hostelbookers allowed me to find the perfect hostel , see it on a map , compare prices and read many reviews .
M	they also have a handy insurance feature .
M	great all_round .
M	flying out to a wedding on may 0rd and guess_what ... our flight was cancelled and opodo booked as another flight that was 0 hours_later !!
M	we have to wait in paris for 0 hrs whereas we booked it specifically for only a 0 hour wait ... obviously we will miss the wedding !
M	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer_service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
M	!
M	all i hear is their terrible hold music ... which i can describe as being even more painful than waiting and knowing my money is going down the drain .
M	you suck opodo ... never using you ever again .
M	vincent
M	i ' ve made a number of expensive purchases since 0000 and to date i haven ' t been disappointed in the service i ' ve received .
M	specifically with a particularly large order ; matt was very understanding and took great lengths to ensure i received the best possible service .
M	it may be somewhat of a lottery to get the rare bits you want at times , but that ' s only because model_bits can be counted on to stock the very best at excellent prices which means his wares are always in demand .
M	rightly so too , i highly_recommend this business .
M	the service has been ok , until i lost my phone .
M	i called their support to block the sim_card , and i was told it was impossible to block the sim_card right away , i would have to rely_on an automatic auto - blocking after 0 months of non usage ... so somebody might be using my phone right now , preventing the auto - blocking !
M	i paid a premier service for a shipment from us to uk and here are some interesting discoveries i have made with the tracking no .
M	0 .
M	it takes 0 days for the parcel to be delivered to uk by usps for a 0000 mile long journey .
M	0 .
M	it takes 0 days for the uk custom to clear it .
M	0 .
M	it takes 0 days and ticking for parcelforce to deliver custom notice with the depot 0 miles from my doorstep .
M	they are also shameless enough to charge an 0 pound process fee for that .
M	it is safely_say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
M	the miracle of their survival is totally based on the unfair competition of using the royal_mail â_s existing network and infrastructures which are not available to other very hardworking , organized and responsive services .
M	they won â t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
M	in short , they are shite !
M	the reason_why people find this company useful is when they try to sort out the lowest_price this company usually pops up .
M	however , they are cheap for a reason .
M	they don ' t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don ' t get a hold of the goods they sell .
M	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
M	as you would imagine , buying process could become more complicated with extra parties involved .
M	if crescentelectronic can â t acquire your order they will just send you a preformatted email telling you they don â t have that in stock leaving you wondering what about those stock numbers ?
M	don ' t you never ever trust their stock numbers , they are all wrong and they want it that way so that you can prepay confidently .
M	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
M	if you are not a few quids short , do not buy from this company , especially you are buying for a production environment .
M	they can get you fired .
M	their rma process is problematic as well .
M	i bought 0 wd re0 0tb enterprise class hard disks for a raid0 array built .
M	with a very rare luck , 0 of them are dead on arrival .
M	the rma went on well until the replacement disks arrived a few weeks_later .
M	first of all , the disks are not sent by crescent electronic and are sent by another company - the actual supplier of the disks .
M	second of all , the supplier company sent some overall 00 pounds cheaper caviar wd blue 0tb consumer class disks for replacements ( we will call this company the 0nd company for short ).
M	correct me if i am wrong , people generally would expect to get a bmw 0 series back if they send in a bmw 0 series for replacements , wouldn ' t they ?
M	well , i got lucky and i got a vauxhall astra back !
M	i phoned the 0nd company trying to tell them how ridicilous is that and a young_girl in her 00s picked_up the phone telling_me â those enterprise disks are out of stock so they decided to send me these â.
M	from the fair natural way she talks about it i decided not to argue with the people with the wrong logic to start with .
M	it is not my responsibility to stop them from destroying themselves .
M	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
M	with countless emails , waiting and worrying for a month and a half i finally got my refund .
M	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
M	i felt that with this sort of experience a 0 star would be an overstatement , 0 star would be proper .
M	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
M	0000 00 00 update ,
M	i revised the 0 star_rating to 0 star as crescentelectronic is trying to cover up my very honest review .
M	the staffs of boston limited are very resourceful and helpful .
M	items ordered arrived in a blazing fast speed and currently awaiting for second despatch .
M	they stock some of the smallest supermicro chassis accessories e . g .
M	a dvd bezel to whole server arrays .
M	if you are building supermicro systems , this dealer is the only and good choice in the uk .
M	ii felt this is a company with service in mind .
M	i put my enquiry of sas cable on the web and they phoned back within 0 hours .
M	very helpful and informative responses as well .
M	generally speaking , i will shop with them again .
M	yet to stress test an online dealer the best way is going through their return process , that is something i am yet to do ( i hope i don â t have to ).
M	hence this review can not give an account for that .
M	unlike various other key sites , oks has always provided a quick and efficient service .
M	every key i have bought from them has been delivered within ~ 00_minutes , usually closer to 0 minutes .
M	all keys have worked without any hiccups or issues .
M	preordered my xbox one with these_guys and they were great .
M	they kept me updated on my order all the way through launch , offered me options to modify my order and gave me a very accurate 0hr time_slot for delivery .
M	i was really impressed at the level of communication and speed of service .
M	good stuff .
M	had a problem at the start '' my fault giving wrong phone number '' but it was sorted out really fast and i got a great deal :_d
M	00 / 00 would bang
M	highly_recommended
M	purchased a pc for one of my small business clients .
M	great value , especially as it ' s backed by a warranty .
M	ordered wednesday_night , delivered friday_morning with excellent to - the - hour tracking_information .
M	can ' t fault the service or value , definitely recommended .
M	the company provide an great service for a good price .
M	if you ever have a problem , they are fast and efficient in helping you , especially if you use the " live help " option .
M	however , a third_party soils their good name , that third_party is yodel .
M	yodel damaged my parcel when it was being delivered , i was forced to return the contents to the seller , he arranged collection , again , through yodel , and they failed to arrive at all !
M	the following_day , he rearranged collection with tnt and i ' ll be ...
M	they didn ' t seem to have a problem with collecting a parcel .
M	a far_superior company .
M	my live_chat with emily was fast and solved the problem in a matter of moments .
M	conclusion ; highly recomment p0g but avoid using yodel where possible .
M	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it ' s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around Â£_00 per_month including vat .... sounds great right ?
M	errrrm no !
M	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
M	connection would stop , signal would fail and here ' s the catch , anytime i called customer_service i would spend maybe 00_minutes a time talking to people who honestly didn ' t care , couldn ' t help , asked me to reset my device then passed me on to someone_else .
M	i ' ve been left flabbergasted at some of the lame excuses & responses i got from people who shouldn ' t work in customer support roles - they didn ' t have a clue !
M	i ' m not sure what database or system they use but like other customers have said , nothing seems to be recorded so everyone i get passed to , i have to explain the whole situation again from start to finish ... how frustrating !!
M	but on top of that , by the end of my phone call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
M	pretty_much no one really cared !
M	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other countries ... this is about a call_centre with staff who don ' t care , maybe don ' t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don ' t get feedback about their poor performance .
M	however i can ' t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
M	for this reason the senior members , directors , ceo ' s , owners should be ashamed of how you run your business and what you see as acceptable ... you may think you have a great product but just read all your poor reviews week after week .... surely you have some integrity , some part of you that says " hold up , something really is wrong here " ???
M	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
M	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
M	just look at how many people have said that they will never use you again , or who want to cancel their contracts .... still you do nothing .
M	i ' m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
M	i ' m sure it won ' t be too long before you all come unstuck .... good luck with that !
M	oh & to any other customer who is thinking about joining three for broadband or a dongle or even myfi ..... please don ' t !
M	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
M	oh & guess_what my new months data_allowance was meant to start today !
M	0th of every month .... but you guessed it !
M	yep , it doesn ' t work .... no surprises there .
M	no one at three will care because i ' ve paid already !
M	great business_model they have !
M	absolute bunch of clowns !
M	i have only bought one thing from myprotein , i don ' t wish to be bombarded with reviews .
M	i took a three year_old tag with a misaligned hour hand into the shop , expecting to be sneered at slightly given that my watch is probably worth about a tenth of their average sale .
M	instead i was met by a polite and friendly assistant who referred the watch to the horologist .
M	in short , the watch was fixed on the spot in 00_minutes for a price far cheaper_than quoted elsewhere with some advice on the general condition and how to ensure it doesn ' t happen again .
M	cannot recommend highly_enough .
M	great feedback games keys are so easy to buy over all love this site !
M	excellent service / price / delivery - minor problem with one pair immediately resolved by supplying full replacement pair
M	ordered a cd_key on 00th_november .
M	got email instructions with how to download game .
M	clicked link in email but no download , just a thank_you text file with note saying game file will be emailed up to 00_hours .
M	thursday arrives and still nothing so emailed kumbaso support to ask them if i don ' t receive cd_key by end of the day then i will ask for refund .
M	0 days_later so i ask for refund within 0 working_days .
M	if i don ' t hear_anything i will get my refund via visa .
M	update_: after a week of nothing i have received the code .
M	good website design .

M	0 . ordered door seal : opted for bosch part (Â£ 00 ) rather_than 0rd_party (Â£ 00 ) due to few mixed_reviews of cheapo ones .
M	0 .
M	delivered next_day .
M	watched tutorial online a few_times while fitting , to get step by step guide .
M	fitted and back together in an_hour .
M	brilliant .
M	great prices , great customer_service , speedy_delivery !
M	the price_match option is another great feature s . w .
M	implements to excel above its competition .
M	a sales_rep from first_utility came to my house he was really polite not pushy and told me about their company and smart meters and decided to go_ahead with it .
M	this was the best thing iv done in a long time !
M	i can moniter how much im using which is great , all i have to do is give a meter_reading each month for 000_% accurate bills .
M	the billing system aswell is great , so easy to understand .
M	all the people putting bad_reviews , clearly dont understand how to read a meter when asked to and in general just stupid .
M	i honestly dont see why everyone isnt with first_utility , best company on the market at the moment !!
M	!
M	there is nothing i could fault about my recent_purchase of two mapominoes games from taunton_leisure .
M	i chose them as they offered the cheapest price on the internet for the products .
M	the delivery came earlier_than_expected and the items were completely undamaged and in great condition .
M	taunton_leisure also re - used a box from a previous delivery ( it said in big letters on the side beans and sausages ), which showed a prudent approach to business and the environment .
M	first_class !
M	i had a package arranged for this morning between 0 and 00 .
M	i had the day off of work so waited in my front room for the hour , knowing that i would see the van turn_up .
M	it never arrived .
M	instead , i received an insulting text_message hours_later informing_me that the delivery had been rejected by the recipient .
M	i phoned asos immediately to confirm the delivery address was correct , to which they confirmed correctly , and then passed me on to this abhorrent company .
M	i spent 00_minutes speaking to automated_messages before trying my luck with a different team that i found on the website .
M	the woman , mandy , seemed not to care and passed me through to the ' customer care ' team .
M	care - ha !
M	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
M	i then found this website with many a 0 star_review on it .
M	i saw that an_email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
M	hours_later and the apparently ' always manned ' email address has sent no reply , despite me sending my consignment_number and contact telephone_number .
M	i needed this parcel as i ' m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
M	useless bunch of cowboys , avoid at all costs .
M	and don ' t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an_email ' - i know for a fact you won ' t reply .
M	the most unprofessional company it ' s ever been my displeasure to deal with .
M	i needed a collection rebooked .
M	the agent i spoke to , sammie_taylor , was very friendly and helpful and sorted my issue out within_seconds .
M	wonderful service .
M	will_definitely be using again .
M	thanks sammie !
M	i ordered a three stone engagement_ring from diamonds_factory with some reservation as you are not able to actually see the product until it reaches your door .
M	all those reservations were completely unnecessary though .
M	rianne dealt_with my order from start until finish and was so helpful and friendly to talk to ( even recommended to order a couple of sizes up to ensure it fitted when i popped ' the question ').
M	the ring arrived and fitted when i presented it , however i was very slightly disappointed with the brilliance and shine of the diamonds .
M	i spoke to rianne about this , and she was very understanding and made it easy for me to adjust my order and to adjust the cut grade , also she recommended which certificate i should get .
M	this was all at a very small price increase , but the finished ring now on my fiancÃ©es finger is incredible and dazzling and worth so much more_than any small increase in price .
M	can not recommend enough .
M	amazing job rianne and team .
M	thank_you for making my purchase so easy and special
M	scott .
M	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
M	when checking my tickets after i had paid for them , the booking summary stated it was same day return .
M	the initial booking summary before i paid for them did not say this .
M	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost Â£_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
M	yet another company contributing to rip_off britain !
M	the manager , sean , should be ashamed of him self .
M	in the end i was able to use virgin_trains website , who also do not charge booking_fees and display booking summary information accurately before you pay .
M	i have emailed redspottedhanky a complaint so i will update in due course .
M	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn ' t need to give notice to leave .
M	they then charged me a early termination_fee .
M	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
M	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
M	i ' m now with tesco who have much cheaper packages and only english call_centres .
M	t - mobile is now known as ee so avoid them and get a better deal with tesco , talk_talk or 0 .
M	very competitive_prices , fast dispatch and product as expected .
M	very happy so far .
M	i would certainly order from again with very good prices and free delivery
M	i ' d recommend riverside garden_centre without a doubt ; they are very competitively_priced , delivery was punctual and well communicated and the bbq is great .
M	excellent service on sending out samples .
M	fast and well communicated .
M	will see next what they are like for larger orders of tiles .
M	amazing site !
M	ordered my usual protein , free next_day delivery , and a free gift all for the same price as going to the supplier !
M	!
M	do not pass this site up !!
M	will be using all the time from now on !
M	!
M	absolute quality , start to finish , everything went as it should !
M	mike and irina were brilliant , looked after us and made sure everyone had a top time , even the - 00 temperatures weren ' t a problem !
M	epic weekend made much_better by knowing the tour company had sorted everything for us !
M	!
M	can ' t speak highly_enough about them !
M	i always use these_guys , and very rarely have any_issues .
M	had to rebook a delivery for tomorrow , got " live_chat help " from gemma , very courteous , helpful , and efficient .
M	thank_you
M	i love this website .
M	this is the only place i purchase i workout_needs from .
M	i love all the discounts .
M	i am leaving o0 today .
M	the service was , at one point , quite good , but has degraded to the point of being useless .
M	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren ' t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i ' m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can ' t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
M	i am now in the process of changing my network to a company who is serious and is not larking about , playing games and pretending to be a business .
M	i have had no help and no explanations .
M	my emails have gone_unanswered .
M	i could have had a doctor ' s appointment this morning .
M	i have a host of illnesses i need to sort but because o0 decided to be lazy and useless i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
M	great .
M	i rang and rang and i missed the window because my phone outright refused to connect the call .
M	i am extremely angry .
M	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i ' m saying , go_ahead .
M	please , i would love to hear you try to defend yourselves .
M	i could do with a laugh today .
M	and if you decide that , after_reading this , you no_longer want me as a customer well ...
M	i don ' t honestly care .
M	i blew ten_pounds on a service that i can ' t even use .
M	oh , and i warn you now that any reply , any kind of response from you will be made public .
M	i will post it to every_single review site i can find .
M	trustpilot , yelp , i ' ll post to facebook , i will make everybody i know aware of it .
M	i promise .
M	it was the first time i used this website but it was very easy to use and i received really good quote and great service . i would certainly recommend this website to everyone as it saves loads of time and money .
M	thank_you and keep the good job !!!
M	!
M	best regards
M	v . georgiev
M	i have used dfds so many_times and every time they have been perfect . on number of occasions i have had to contact the customer_service and have always received the help i needed as quickly as i needed it .
M	i am travelling at_least 00 times a year abroad and would never book my ferry with anyone_else .
M	thank_you dfds for always been so great and kind to us !!
M	!
M	regards

M	what a simple website .
M	i â ve done my research and after checking out 00 different recycling websites i have to say this is definitely the simplest .
M	search your phone , place the order and wait for your money .
M	couldn â t be easier .
M	the communication is really good .
M	i received an_email all the way through the order .
M	when they received the phone , when it was tested and when i would be paid .
M	i would definitely_recommend it .
M	try it out for yourselves .
M	you won â t be disappointed .
M	i wasn ' t .
M	i decided to buy parallels for mac , Â£_00 on their website but i was lucky that an unusual earlier payment stopped this going through which led to me finding it on amazon for Â£_00 .
M	me ... happy !
M	:) it also arrived before an order placed with another uk company a few_days before the order with amazon !
M	iceland is also great for single people and for those who can ' t cook !
M	i ' ve found lots of great offers on meals for one , especially the pizzas and ice creams .
M	on my latest visit , there was none of the lettuce i wanted but a member of staff went and got some which had just arrived at the warehouse out the back .
M	very helpful .
M	i regularly use the trainline for buying tickets to get to london and it always finds the cheapest ticket from across all the train companies .
M	it is all very convenient and works well .
M	the only_downside is the booking_fee , but that is the price of convenience and if i ' m buying a lot of tickets at once then it is well worth it .
M	it ' s been about three_weeks since i received my earphones and all has worked fantastic .
M	i have other headphones bookmarked as i wish to purchase them when i have the money - good one not the cheap kind this time and i am going to buy them from iheadphones when i can .
M	we were so badly let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
M	we gave them deadlines and explained that if they could not meet them to just tell us as we had another supplier who could meet them , but we were assured there wouldn ' t be a problem .
M	the samples we asked for by a set deadline were missed but we were again reassured the order in full would be ready for a press conference to be screened on live tv .
M	only days sbefore the press conference they started the kit but still assured us it would be ready , they told us to come at closing time on the friday to collect it .
M	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn ' t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
M	when we discovered the following_morning that half the kit was missing an we rang them we were pretty_much just told that it wasn ' t their problem and that we set unrealistic deadlines .
M	they are now accusing me of lying and collecting all the kit as their receipt says so yet i have emails going beyond collection date and answer phone messages explaining the rest of the kit is ready 0 days after the deadline .
M	i have decided to take this to bbc_watchdog now something i had no_intention of doing until i was accused of lying .
M	i see that this is not a one off either .
M	very very dissapointed
M	cheep , top up 00 , get Â£_00 credit
M	arrived very fast , very impressed with the product a ** company
M	from 000000000
M	so i love the deals they are the cheapest on the net .
M	the problem is the shipping can be outrageous .
M	i just bought a couple of items less_than a pound ; then i tried to add several free items an a tshirt .
M	this took my shipping from 0 . 00 usps to 00 dollars ups or fedex .
M	i took all the items off .
M	then it went back down to 0 . 00 i tied to add just the tshirt an it went back to 00 dollars .
M	my issue is it should have been just flat_rate !
M	they supply everything i need for my craft robo , the website is easy to navigate , and the price is good .
M	no_complaints .
M	and because they are reliable i have become a repeat customer .
M	got a price and got a check for the amount agreed on the site .
M	used them before a few_years_ago , trustworthy and reliable site .
M	they weren ' t the highest offer compared to others , but having read some bad_reviews of other_sites , and seen a whole range of companies i ' d never even heard of i stuck with mazuma .
M	my phone was in perfect working order but looked very tired for 0 years use .
M	i don ' t think others would have given me the price they originally_quoted .
M	will be using again in the future .
M	easy to navigate website , straight_forward and hassle_free service .
M	would use again .
M	thanks
M	was directed to the wiskey exchange by my brother , have ended_up spending ages browsing .
M	was a really easy site to navigate , the feedback and info was hugely helpful and purching was a breeze .
M	they shipped it out quickly and arrived in plenty of time .
M	i shall be back on there soon to find some more gems .
M	brilliant company to deal with , easy transaction , straight_forward website easy to understand .
M	price was fantastic unbeatable for the tyres i ordered in that size .
M	and very quick service .
M	would deal with again quite happily .
M	the customer_service team is awesome , and have helped out in whatever possible way they can ( like extending my hosting renew date when my wallet was stolen so i didn ' t have to worry_about it expiring until i got my new cards ).
M	also the actual services are very easy to use , really good price and i recommend to everyone for domains and hosting .
M	efficient , reliable and excellent value for money .
M	will_definitely use again and have already_recommended to others
M	i ordered the ceiling tiles and grid over the phone , came on the day promised .
M	all the parts where in perfect_condition , i installed it myself and was very pleased with the results .
M	ordered the game 0pm on the day before it was officially released .
M	it dropped on my doorstep the next_day !
M	i was a little_hesitant at using a foreign site but the service was second to none .
M	i received email_notifications every_step of the way and recieved my canon_0d in very little time .
M	as soon as my camera was dispatched i recieved a link and was able to track my package from_hong_kong through to germany and then into the uk .
M	i wouldnt_hesitate to use this service again especialy when uk prices are so high
M	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary school , they did not fit as the arms were at different angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
M	well i suppose it ' s workmanship for the money .
M	there is no ability to talk with customer_service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
M	i have been using overclockers for the better part of 0 years now .
M	i am still a loyal_customer to them and i can vouch for their high_quality service .
M	their shipping speed is very quick also .
M	i know those who have had rma have received extremely good support service although i can happily say i ' ve never had an rma with overclockers !
M	:)
M	i purchased t0de last_night after using their trial .
M	at first i was very skeptical due to them not accepting paypal .
M	although after_speaking with support he explained why which made a lot of sense as people had been doing a lot of charge backs against the account to scam him .
M	not only did the paypal make it seem skeptical but the site didn ' t seem to have been updated in a fairly long time , although this was also explained and support seems to be online quite_often !
M	alas i decided to go through the bitcoin process , at first it was confusing but they happily talked me through it .
M	in the end i have received a high_quality product that i am very happy with .
M	i have also had an issue which was down to my own fault although they helped_me out with that also extremely quickly .
M	i am happy to help anybody with this and i can vouch for these a thousand times over .
M	all in all i couldn ' t have been happier with my purchase .
M	absolutely perfect service !
M	i cannot_fault it .
M	autokey_system gives you your key_instantly with a photo image of the retail key ( excellent when you need to recover a stolen account ).
M	it also links them to your own account so you can have a database of all the games you have purchased with them .
M	to get your key you must verify your phone number ( which cannot be voip ).
M	this is to verify ownership and also prevents any of those who try to scam .
M	the code worked_perfectly on origin ( ea ) and i had no_problems what so ever .
M	the key was very cheap in comparison to the origin store ( over 00_% cheaper !).
M	i will be using this site as much as possible , i just cannot_fault them anywhere and they will be recommended to many if not all of my friends !
M	another amazing purchase from cjskeys .
M	farcry 0 is cheaper_than anywhere ( deluxe edition costing Â£ 0 less_than a normal version , so grabbed that up .)
M	bought 0 - 0 games / dlc codes from cjs now , and i ' ve only had one of them with a problem .
M	which was sorted by their fast replying , friendly staff in no time .
M	will_continue to use for most , if not all , of my pc purchases .
M	really couldn ' t be_happier .
M	thanks guys / gals .

M	i ' ve pre_- ordered a lot of games from shopto , at_least 00 , and they ' ve always been here before_release_date .
M	also ordering games that are already out , get to you in no time .
M	i ' ve had problems with other online companies taking up to a week for stuff to get to me and it ' s rediculous , considering the servive i ' ve had from shopto .
M	as you might have guessed , i only stick with them now .
M	:]
M	this is my on stop_shop for all my supplements .
M	fast_shipping and good prices .. i think that says it all ..
M	hostelbookers is the website for people who want cheap and good places to be in the whole world .
M	it provides means to assure if you doing the right choice , and connects you with hostels and hotels that otherwise you would never know .
M	so , hostelbookers is the perfect website for real travelers .
M	i ' ve been ordering from supplementwarehouse for over 0 + years now and i just keep_coming_back .
M	everyone tells_me to go to bodybuilding . com and whatever , but i just keep_coming_back .
M	i always counter with " you should go to supplementwarehouse . com !"
M	the price beating option is awesome .
M	shipping is usually pretty good too ... and you get free_shaker_bottles all the time !
M	can ' t beat that !
M	shipping is fast as hell and usually comes within just a couple days at most .
M	i ' ll stick with them as long as they are around !
M	- mike blanton
M	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
M	on occasion i can find deals there that beat the prices of both play . com and amazon . co . uk , but those deals are quite few and far between and usually only appear when they have their sales .
M	they often inundate me with emails informing_me about new sales they have running , and if i didn ' t know better i ' d say that they were always running a sale of some kind .
M	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
M	i have dealt_with amazon for a number of years and i have never had a problem with them ( touch - wood ).
M	especially now that they have free delivery with all of their items , i really cannot_fault them .
M	the only niggling detail is that it ' s not always easy to tell which items are being sold by amazon themselves and which are being sold ' through ' amazon by other_companies - to which the super - saver - delivery offer doesn ' t apply .
M	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .
M	go_karting was great fun and the hotel was in an excellent location .
M	strip_club was cheap and grotty .
M	i ' m a paranoid person and this page gave me enough confidence to do my booking !
M	it ' s really easy to use and i have confirmed several_times that provides the best prices !
M	great alternative for everyone that is searching for cheap and good alternatives .
M	they will always match a price and the customer_service is amazing .
M	thumbs_up for the military discount !
M	order process was simple , price was good and delivery was fast & without any_issues .
M	i ' d have no_hesitation recommending chemicaluk . com to anybody and i ' ll be using them again .
M	i bought a kettle from go - electrical nearly 0 years_ago and unfortunately it developed a minor fault with the lid .
M	after_speaking with the manufacturer i was told i needed my proof of purchase which i couldn ' t find as the serial_number alone wasn ' t enough .
M	normally this wouldn ' t have been a problem but , firstly , i couldn ' t remember where i bought the kettle from and secondly , my hard_drive failed before_christmas and i lost over 00 years of e_- mails .
M	after_speaking to my bank they were able to track down a purchase around the time i thought i bought it .
M	i phoned go - electrical and the lady on the phone was extremely_helpful and tried numerous ways to find my details .
M	after a few minutes she was able to and promptly e_- mailed me a copy of the invoice within 0 minutes .
M	because of this i was able to return the kettle and get a replacement .
M	go - electrical ' s excellent service not only got me the best price in the first place , but also saved me spending another Â£_00 on a new kettle .
M	very impressed .
M	i ' ve just placed another order .
M	couldn ' t find the salomon s - lab advances - skin 00 in hong_kong , found it on trekkinn and it ' s cheaper_than hk retail price even shipping cost included !
M	!
M	the website had a good layout , was easy to use and the items arrived quickly and exactly as_described .
M	as mentioned above , these_guys are not playing around and sitting on orders , you pay they provide whatever you payed for , however they advise you that orders can take up to 00_hours ...... never gonna happen !
M	maximum time i was waiting was 0 hours and it was 0 years_ago .
M	best site to buy games .
M	after a few minor hicups when i started my contract everything was sorted quickly and never had any_problems since .
M	realy glad i changed to them from o0 .
M	ordered th eitem on friday_evening and recived it tuesday .
M	great service and good costomer service .
M	order no :_000000000
M	i have been using maximuscle for a while now , it ' s a good product but will be looking elsewhere for a similar product at a better price .
M	maximuscle please lower prices in order to keep my custom .
M	placed order on the tuesday and had received payment by the friday .
M	great service !
M	i ordered from uk on tuesday_morning , the item arrived by friday_lunchtime .
M	all items present and working well .
M	no_problems with customs etc .
M	great value for the item - sony nex0r .
M	i ' ve only used it a couple of times but so far it ' s been outstanding .
M	the sensor picks_up everything , as good as a human eye .
M	used in difficult light ( cloudy day , occasional sunshine ) but all colours and depth captured well .
M	the 00 - 00 zoom lens makes it very portable ( not quite pocket size but light and easy ), the simple manual controls for iso , aperture and shutter speed make composition easy .
M	i look_forward to much more use with it .
M	our business has expanded massively since we started using visualsoft in 0000 , with a new and improved re developed site .
M	they provide outstanding support and excellent customer_service .
M	visualsoft have helped_us to grow our business and they continue to do so with new ideas and concepts .
M	we would highly_recommend visualsoft to anyone_looking to develop online retail .
M	fantastic service and everything is packed perfectly .
M	we re - use the packing boxes for our rats :) highly_recommend .
M	had problems with orders missing items , had extremely rude and abusive emails ( just because i asked for orders to be changed and i returned one item ), poor packing that leads to damaged items .
M	given them enough chances to make_amends and they have proven that they are not a reliable or professional business .
M	buy your cards from [_external reference ], they have a fantastic customer_service , and deal with questions etc , in a friendly_manner and they send items out in boxes with fantastic packing .
M	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
M	in response to the reply below :
M	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
M	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
M	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn ' t pay royal_mail .
M	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
M	why should i be banned for something out of my control ?!
M	( rhetorical question ).
M	you have proved yourself a liar and a complete fool .
M	i have not lied once and have facts and proof to back up what i say .
M	i must have spent over Â£ 0000 on your website and i ' m treated in a disgraceful manner .
M	you should be ashamed .
M	also what you said to the other person who gave you 0 star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
M	that just shows that you ' re arrogant and self righteous .
M	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .
M	i hope people can see you for who you really are , but i hope more so that you see the error of your ways and change and have a good life .
M	i also apologise for some of the things i said in the email , i was angered by the unfriendly and condescending email you sent me ( with the same tone as others you have sent before ) and i felt it was the last_straw .
M	enough said , i wish you well and kind_regards .
M	i am testing it and not get the result until now
M	from this site i Â´ ve gotten 0 games within 0000 .
M	darksouls , avp , skyrim and dragonborn dlc .
M	all cheap and instant delivery .
M	except for dragon born who had to be activated through a russian vpn .
M	this was a fast affair and they had some very easy to use guides on how to do it .
M	and this requirement was advertised well before you bought anything .
M	+ good prices
M	+ fast delivery
M	+ good service
M	+ up to date
M	- library could be bigger ?
M	rating 0 / 00 "
M	i am a search_engine freak , and i must have searched the entire internet for the best prices , service and security .
M	in the end , i chose hostelbookers because it actually had hotels cheaper_than some lousy hostels .
M	it made my day !!
M	just type in your check - in and check - out days and you are on your way .
M	two minutes later i had my accommodation booked , and all the info in my email acoount .
M	very recommendable !!!
M	good luck folks !
M	!
M	cool site .
M	nice concept .
M	wonderful prices for products .
M	shipping_costs are terrible .
M	i booked the flight ticket through opodo and the flight company charged me already , however opodo charged me 00 pounds in the next_day with any explanation .
M	it seems like a service charge for booking the ticket !!!
M	00 pounds service fee ???
M	just for booking ticket online ?
M	isn ' t it ridiculous ???!!!
M	moreover , they did not noticed me about the service charge when i was about to checkout for the ticket on their website !!!!!!!
M	!
M	such a wonderful choice of food , wines and beers .
M	really impressed with the quality , price and speed of delivery .
M	i have recommended this website to all my friends .
M	i had laser_eye_surgery two years_ago and really have no_regrets whatsoever .
M	my tips would be :
M	- not to expect absolute perfection - i get some starbursts at night , but i was warned of this and in a way it ' s no worse a problem than looking at a light through dirty glasses ;
M	- have someone to take you to / from surgery and look after you for the first 00_hours so you can wallow a bit - i wouldn ' t say it hurt a lot but it did feel_like i ' d been in a scrum or had banged my head , and just felt tired ;
M	- haggle - different companies had different prices , optimax themselves had several different offers and i chose the one which made it cheapest by quite some way .
M	compared to the cost of glasses , lenses and optician appointments , it will soon pay for itself .
M	bit all in all - if you ' re on the fence about it , then i would say go for it .
M	my plumber recommended your site .
M	we were impressed with the speed of delivery and the price .
M	worktop_express were the cheapest bamboo worktop providers i could find after an online search .
M	it was simple to place an order by telephone and then use paypal to pay , and they were happy to arrange delivery to fit in with the work being undertaken in my kitchen .
M	thus_far , the wood appears to be of high_quality and has settled well after oiling .
M	i am happy to recommend them .
M	the cheapest shop for the item i was buying by some distance , with very prompt delivery .
M	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
M	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
M	it has great deals and good customer_service .
M	not a great website but great instore with all the best deals .
M	quick free delivery and0 the cheapest prices .
M	alt i orden - hurtigt levering
M	have been using amazon for years and to be honest it ' s almost taken over my life .
M	the most amazing range of products anywhere , great customer_service , excellent prices and fast , secure delivery .
M	can ' t recommend it enough
M	website was simple to understand and easy to use .
M	we got to pick delivery day of choice , which is a very nice feature .
M	kept up to date on our order via_email and telephone , so we knew when to expect delivery .
M	delivery drivers were efficient and friendly , placed the furniture exactly where we wanted it and took away all the packaging .
M	the furniture is fantastic and service was flawless , would highly_recommend this company .
M	best prices and deal of all the websites i have found !
M	great service too !
M	i needed some new sunglasses for my holiday to malta and was looking on the internet .
M	i came_across smartbuyglasses via google and their prices were amazing .
M	obviously with such cheap prices you want to be sure they are genuine so i did my research and it all added up and to be fair the pair i got were only Â£_00 more on amazon .
M	when i ordered i must_say i didnt expect them to be shipped from_hong_kong and as i ordered on a monday_afternoon and i was going on holiday on thursday i feared the worst .
M	on tuesday_morning they left hong_kong and buy 00am on wednesday i had them at my house !
M	amazing service that simply cannot be_faulted .
M	cannot wait to use you guys again .
M	i cannot recommend them enough !
M	the product is genuine and i compared my glasses to the same ones my brother has in a different_colour ( that he paid alot more for ) and they are identical .
M	compared to a lot of payday lenders out there , wageme . com is quick and easy .
M	i â ll be honest here , the interest rates they offer aren â t the best in the world , and other_sites beat them by miles on that .
M	however , if you â re looking for a lender who â ll give you the money as quickly as possible , then they â re the best .
M	i had a quick approval , with no forms to fax , staff where very helpfull and friendly and i was able to do the whole_thing from start to finish on my mobile phone .
M	i highly_recommend wageme . com
M	shannon
M	i ordered
M	they sent
M	i received next_day
M	what more can you ask for :-)
M	i moved_into my new build property on the 00th_october_0000 .
M	it is now the 00nd march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
M	i have rung them up & provided them with meter_readings on a reasonably regular_basis ( in spite of having smart meters ).
M	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over Â£_000 from my account without any notice or production of a bill .
M	this was subsequently refunded to my account in january_0000 with no acknowledgement of the financial difficulties this had caused me .
M	i have requested details of my tariff and have calculated what i believe i owe them so if i can do this then why cant they ??
M	?
M	it also seems impossible for them to acknowledge any written communication & the ' contact us ' on the web_site is very hit & miss , on one occassion it took over 0 months to even get an_automated acknowledgement .
M	overall a very poor experience for a first time home owner & i definitely wouldnt recommend using first_utility .
M	i am now looking at transferring my services elsewhere .
M	ordered a big muff pi bass edition along with a new cable on tuesday_morning .
M	paid for cheapest delivery option as i was in no hurry for the items .
M	received email on tuesday night saying that they had been dispatched that day .
M	now i was expecting my stuff to arrive thursday / friday so imagine my surprise when early this afternoon my package arrived .
M	better that i ' d thought it ' d be and hats_off to the courier company you used too .
M	would not hesitate to recommend to friends to use you guys and will no doubt use you again .
M	you guys_rock at under 00 $ and excellent service , this is the first time i have ever given a feedback to any online service , you guys have given me an excellent experience .... thanks a ton and keep up the good work :) \ m /
M	super_fast delivery means our printer is never out of ink !
M	also best prices around !
M	the staff are very helpful and friendly !
M	highly recommeneded .
M	fantastic long_lasting shine given in a very short time would highly_recommend to anyone with any car
M	i was interested in learning more about excel and found this course .
M	it was on offer and cost me only Â£_00 so i figured i had nothing to loose .
M	although the course had lots of moduels which seemed daunting at frst i realised that the method of teaching used was really simple to understand and enjoyable .
M	after completeing this course i feel i have a much_better understanding of how and why using excel is extreamly helpful to business and individuals alike .
M	very guick east touse web_site and good communication through delivery time

M	this is not a dig at sunglassesshop , as i ' m sure the product i bought was likely pre_- packaged and redistributed , however i had to carefully remove both lenses and remove multiple pieces of white packaging that was stuck between the frame and glass .
M	there is no way this got in there after the lenses had been fitted , as one piece was poking out on both_sides of the lense !
M	product : dirty dog dozer sunglasses ( gunmetal / green , polarised ).
M	i have added a 0 star_rating for sgs , as the faux pas was not with them , but with the product manufacturer .
M	first time ordering from this site , great prices , easy to use and a lot of products have been reviewed by customers which makes it easier to choose what your looking for .
M	put my order in and got to choose a free gift which is a nice_touch , package came in no time at all and there was a few free_samples thrown in too .
M	free delivery over 00 and loyalty_points system is great .
M	all in all i couldn ' t recommend this site enough and it will be my one stop_shop for all my sup .
M	needs
M	used relocation - quotation . com to find a removal company for my move from london to sydney .
M	had a quote back within an_hour and booked my move the same day !
M	clever service but reward is poor
M	i am lucky_enough to be able to train in cyprus every easter for the ironman season .
M	sigma sport have supplied all of my kit for years but this year they excelled themselves .
M	my specialised seat post broke and no shop on island could supply the part .
M	wanting to stick rigidly to my training programme i phoned sigma and asked them to get the part to cyprus asap .
M	it was ordered at 0pm and arrived the following_day at 00am .
M	i take my triathlon very seriously - so do sigma - you know they understand your needs and will advise you , with knowledge and experience .
M	i will qualify for 00 . 00 worlds this year - it ' s taken great equipment , which has all been supplied by this shop , online , in shop or on the phone from cyprus .
M	maj john richards rifles
M	on hostelbookers , it is easy to book and pay your hostels .
M	the price are the best !
M	i use parcel0go as they help me deliver cycle parts to my customers on time and profitably , while still offering very good prices .
M	i have decided to top up the full_amount and keep the account ...
M	thanks to [_name ], one of the best advisors there , and fellew cyclist in exceeding expectations in customer_service at p0g and helping cyclesorted grow !
M	[_external reference_] <<<< cycle sorted ... cheers [_name ] p
M	i would recommend chemist_direct to anyone .
M	the product reviews are 000_% accurate and the prices are very reasonable .
M	i will place orders again for sure from this company !
M	my technician was matt heath , he was apologetic upon_arrival for being within the allotted time and was good company throughout the service .
M	i received excellent advice above what the service was offering and was able to have all my questions answered .
M	for me , this is the best new service around .
M	cheap as any garage around , convenient , professional and above all else it was as easy as a few_clicks online .
M	five_star service .
M	will_definitely be using this company for a long time to come .
M	highly_recommended !
M	many_thanks , andrew .
M	two bad_experiences , latest one , order was accepted on site , got a call 00mins later and was told that the order hadn ' t got through and it was going to take 0 - 0 days to refund it .
M	i won ' t be using them again now .
M	i had a bunch of old_mobiles in a drawer - i mean , who doesn ' t ?
M	- so i decided to make a few pennies from them .
M	mazuma was almost certainly the simplest way to go .
M	you add a list of imei numbers ( that ' s the unique identifier for your mobile ) and then they give you a price .
M	they ' ll even have broken phones off you .
M	i asked for a free postage pack that arrived a few_days_later .
M	( you might want to order a couple if you ' ve got a number of phones as the cardboard container was quite tight once packed with four .)
M	if you take it to a post_office you ' ll be able to ask for " proof of postage " which covers you for Â£_00 free insurance .
M	( you ' d be mad not to .)
M	a few_days_later , a cheque arrives in the post .
M	done .
M	item ( black dress shirt ) i ordered got lost in the post , which is obviously not my tuxedo ' s fault , but did mean i didn ' t have the item for when i needed it .
M	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
M	good prices and one of the few places i ' ve found that sells black dress shirts .
M	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair amount of hassle all things considered .
M	have ordered from gameseek 0 times now and they have been great each time .
M	my latest order was the ps0 and they helped with every_step from the pre_- order to even having it delivered a day early !
M	( although thats probably the royal_mail not knowing the release day was on friday , not thursday ).
M	i will order from them again and would recommend them .
M	awesome service , friendly customer care and a great variety of products and unique flavors ( try the banana mixed with jaffa cake !
M	).
M	i would definitely_recommend this company .
M	i am afraid i have nothing but praise for the staff at peter tyson , in particular matthew , nigel and scott who i ' ve dealt_with via e_- mail and phone .
M	all my e_- mails were replied to within an_hour and my telephone_calls were dealt_with quickly and they were nothing but helpful .
M	this is the second time i ' ve made a purchase from the shop and needless to say it will not be the last .
M	very highly_recommended .
M	service great , have quality products , understand price of shipping due to free_stuff and incredible deals .
M	always shop here
M	posted my ipad 0 yesterday and funds recived today , cannot express how happy i am with the service not many recycle sites which use paypal so thanks again will recommend you .
M	black_circles provided a premium service at a price that was extremely competitive , the best i had found !
M	they delivered them , fit them and balanced them all for the price on the site !
M	very happy customer and have already referred them to colleagues at work .
M	overall great experience !
M	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
M	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
M	the second order contained a corsair ax000 professional series gold 000 and another cooler master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
M	when these items were ordered i was told there were plenty in stock , however once the order was placed 0 days_later i was informed that the cpu coolers were not in stock .
M	so as i needed these parts in a timely_fashion i was forced to cancel the coolers as they would not send the rest of the order .
M	to this effect i created two tickets each quoting the order numbers and requesting the aforementioned items be cancelled .
M	the first cooler was cancelled quickly and the windows 0 copy dispatched for which i am pleased .
M	however the second cooler was not cancelled and i received a rudely written reply to my ticket implying that i do not read my e_- mails .
M	when i proved that i had asked for both to be cancelled i was just told the system had not updated which i found to be odd as i requested cancellation at the same time .
M	i will be placing the second order with amazon and have no desire to use ccl again and will strongly_recommend against anyone i know using them .
M	we recently had to make_amends to my grandad ' s house as he had a nasty fall and is not as mobile as he once was .
M	had no_idea really on what we needed but after much research we were led to this site that has stuff you might need for all around the house .
M	they regularly appeared in google searches for many products and their prices were competitive - free delivery was a bonus too as some items can be great cumbersome .
M	since inviting andrew along to our company to assist with business networking skills , public speaking etc , our team ' s confidence has increased massively , as has subsequently their individual performance .
M	my father recently had some dental implants put in place by dr stewart and his team at the clinic .
M	the level of service , information provided and general professionalism impressed from start to finish .
M	i wanted to buy tickets for a weekend event but just for the sunday .
M	there was no payment button for the sunday and no information on how to buy the ticket .
M	it turned_out that the payment button was on the saturday part and that the ticket was valid for sat or sun .
M	took a while to find this out .
M	as soon as i pitched the tickets they were available immediately for download which is why i ' m giving this 0_stars .
M	also the site doesn ' t look very modern .
M	i ' ll definitely be happy to buy tickets through this site though and overall i ' m happy !
M	the whole_process is so simple and i had the money in my account within 0 days of deciding to sell my ipad !
M	absolutely_brilliant service and would recommend to anyone
M	when booking you have no_idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .
M	if you ask to know the name of the accommodation you ' re told that the information is only released once the full_amount has been paid .
M	i had so many people asking me where we were staying as they wanted to know what they were paying for but couldn ' t tell them !
M	i recently_bought the canon g00 ...
M	i seen this for Â£_000 in jessops compared to Â£_000 on digital_rev .
M	i was a little_sceptical at first buying from the internet but i read a lot of reviews of this site and hardly found one bad one .
M	the camera arrived from china in a matter of days , was well_packed and worked a treat .
M	the camera is brilliant and i would recommend digital_rev .
M	brilliant company , fast delivery , great prices with fast & helpful comms !
M	really helped_me out of a tight spot with delivery to our company .
M	cannot recommend them enough !
M	a very easy and efficient website to use with good search and navigation .
M	lens and bridge sizes are featured which is very useful and quite_often missing on other_sites .
M	fairly detailed product descriptions and relatively low free delivery threshold .
M	so , overall i would re - visit and recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk .
M	excellent service - very speedy_delivery , and reasonably_priced products .
M	another great service from cjs_cd_keys ,
M	purchased " medal of honor ", received the key within moments sadly had a slight hiccup with the system .
M	but luckily one of the staff sorted out this issue and sent me on merry way .
M	i ' d suggest if you want cheap and reliable keys for your games head over to here ;)
M	honestly these_guys are speedy and helpful .
M	order was sent fast and they offer continual help on their facebook_page if you ' re having any troubles .
M	fast , efficient service and great customer help too .
M	the online_chat with an advisor is really helpful , and the forums help to relieve some of the tension waiting for it !
M	prices were great , and it ' s a solid build , runs great .
M	would definitely use again
M	i ' ve dealt_with mpb many_times i can_honestly say they are simply amazing .
M	quite service , payment is made quickly when selling items and when buying an item , you receive it the next_day , perfect !!!
M	they are great in honuring the warranty .
M	i had a problem with a button on a one of my two cameras i purchased from them .
M	they accepted to problem and gave me a new camera rather then me having to wait for the repair .
M	quite simply they are amazing .
M	i would give them 00 stars if i could
M	website easy to use and navigate .
M	reasonable postage prices for special delivery and good selection of events to pick from .
M	happy to recommend and use this service again .
M	dean williams
M	printer basic offers fast efficient service with excellent customer serivce .
M	great quality .
M	would reccommend to anyone_wanting replacement refurb printer cartridges .
M	was let_down by a rival company so tried these .
M	couldn ' t have gone smoother .
M	they even text me the minute my parcel was delivered .
M	spoke with richard_mileham who was extremely_helpful and helped be perfectly with my query .
M	delivery was fast , the price was cheap and now i smell great ;-)
M	i have been buying from tackleuk for a few_years now , only ever had one problem and that a was a faulty product , but they quickly sorted me out !
M	fast communications , quick delivery and great prices , i would recommend them to everyone !
M	this service was awesome
M	i ' ve now used enviro waste on 0 separate_occasions for disposing of materials left over from re - building my house .
M	everything from start to finish was first rate .
M	they are very friendly to deal with and always go the extra_mile with their customer care .
M	would definitely use again and again .- lewis
M	excellent idea fantastic website that saved me over Â£ 0000 .
M	on my original independent quote thanks shiply
M	just made the switch to bulkpowders after my 0rd delayed delivery in as many months from myprotein , all down to their warehousing and logistics .
M	account cancelled and just take my first bulkpowders order , 0 . 0kg banana whey , quite a bit sweeter than myproteins blend but still really nice , and some bcaa and cee .
M	i ' m converted , regularly spend over Â£_00 in an order so will get free next_day dpd and double the points you get from myprotein on purchases .
M	thats me converted !
M	i use both the iphone_app and the website .
M	i ' ve been to slovakia , hungary , berlin and poland .
M	i only use hostelbookers , as it ' s safe and secure , and so far i have had no_problems whatsoever .
M	price our great and it is soo easy to use ,
M	i have been on a few best_stl courses , and on the whole they are very good .
M	my last one however was the best yet , due to the quality of the trainer , as well as my own interest in the subject matter .
M	the courses i had previously been on were for access .
M	the latest one was for excel vba , and i was 000_% happy it .
M	the pace was good , the materials were good , the teaching was great .
M	if you want to learn about vba , you can ' t go_wrong with best_stl .
M	awesome very fast and smooth payment .
M	i though might be longer then what i have expect but was very fast thank_you .
M	was having trouble booking my parcel , up popped emma and she booked the whole_thing for me .
M	great service .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	does what it says in the tin !
M	no issues .
M	customer_service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different stories and never give you an update .
M	the synergy centre , stannington , sheffield is very happy with gotabackup protecting our members ' data .
M	this week , one machine died a death and we were able to assure all thirteen people that used the machine that their data was safe .
M	so glad we saw your advert on facebook before this happened !
M	a site whereby , even if you join , you still cannot contact anyone because the intended recipicent has to also be a member .
M	nowhere is this clearly_stated !
M	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
M	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
M	after three days of membership , only getting views , which is caused by others merely scrolling through the two search features , ' who ' s online ' and ' search ', as well as seeing that you still need to buy ' coins ' to unlock other features , both meaning you never truly know who is interested , i gave up on this useless site .
M	i wrote to complain_about the misleading claims and suggest they change it as it would benefit everyone , no reply !
M	Â£_00 wasted !
M	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
M	numerous short positive_reviews all taken within the last few_days , all by members posting their first and only review ??
M	this is the true specsavers experience :
M	00 / 00 / 00 whilst looking , the staff were helpful in selection , yet during the finalisation , no mention that i couldn ' t return them due to disliked or refferal to a larger branch despite knowing i wasn ' t happy with the second pair !
M	bought two_pairs - Â£_000
M	rimless - didn ' t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn ' t -- exchanged for a second pair
M	timberland - settled for them -- it had two right arms , one bent to be the left one -- could not do a trade - in or exchange -- i gave it a try , but it proved to be uncomfortable -- the staff in the other croydon branch , north end , said they still won ' t exchange -- had to do what they didn ' t even try : manipulated them to fit better .
M	' we believe that only 000_% happy is really happy "?
M	?
M	-- just a belief , as they didn ' t care that twice i walked out their stores stuck with glasses that i could not possibly have assessed properly in the short time with them prior to purchase ; didn ' t truly want before and certainly didn ' t after .
M	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - Â£_00 . 00 )
M	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 no reply from email i sent on the same day i wrote initial review , wrote to them via fb .
M	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
M	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 - from two stars to one , Â£_000 spend yet still no reply in regards to the complaint !
M	as with too many companies they care more about the image of good customer_service rather_than the implementation of it !
M	unfortunatly my package arrived torn , with no item inside .
M	i quickly established that this was due to royal_mails ( man ) handling of the package before discovering the joys of thier utterly appalling customer_service .
M	i therefore contacted hifi_headphones for advice who were quite the opposite .
M	as well as taking over responsibility for the royal_mail claim , they also offered to replace the item immediately at thier own cost .
M	communication was friendly , professional and polite .
M	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this company again and highly_recommend them for anyone_looking to buy audio_equipment .
M	always has good deals and also is doing that spend over 00 pounds in store and get 0 pounds of your next shop
M	good for finding information whats bean on in the news or for bbc_iplayer and what else there is
M	trustpilot is brilliant for writing reviews for websites you get points for writing the reviews and im not quite sure you can do with them yet but other than that i would recommend it to anyone
M	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
M	it is a brilliant store has near enough every electronic or technical thing you could think of i can never get off it but the prices are a bit higher_than you would expect
M	always has excellent cheap deals on plus have a price guarantee and if you spend 00 pounds in store you get 0 pounds of your next shop
M	google is a good search_engine because you can near enough find anything you type and it used by alot of people
M	used iparcels for the first time and was very impressed with the service all_round .
M	i booked a collection late one evening that was collected the following_day and delivered the next which surprised me due to the busy time of the year .
M	i will certainly be using this service again in the future .
M	this is the second time i have used fonebank the first time being a few_years back .
M	nothing has changed the service is still easy to use and my orders have completed with the exact amount being paid for each phone .
M	i have read negative_reviews but in my opinion if you send you old phone in and it is exactly as it should be meeting the criteria then you will be paid the full_amount simple !
M	i look_forward to using fonebank again in the future when my next upgrade is due .
M	thankyou hifi - tower .
M	my purchase of a 000w subwoofer was reasonably_priced , with reasonable postage_costs and , when it arrived ( within the given time bracket ) it was very safely_packaged to ensure it arrived with no complications .
M	thank_you for your hard work on my order guys , i shall buy from you again .
M	ben smith
M	not the first time buying this product , will more_than likely continue to buy it each time i run out , smells great and lasts long :)
M	just to add to everyone_else ' s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
M	i booked internal_flights brazil with tam airlines using opodo , but had to make changes .
M	i called up and they said the terms and conditions state it is not refundable or changeable .
M	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
M	i was shocked to find out when we arrived at the airport in rio that the flight we had booked did exist and our booking never happened .
M	we missed the game in salvador because all other flights were fully booked .
M	tam were extremely_helpful and changed the original flights to the dates we needed at no charge .
M	even more reason to book directly with airlines .
M	i have learnt my lesson and will never use opodo again .
M	i ' ve wen to equipyourtrip directly in their store and the guy who showed us the products was amazing , always willing to help and to provide good assistance with the products !
M	paid with credit_card without problems and was happy as ever !
M	was told about these_guys from a friend , and its great to find someone who actually has what i was looking for in stock !
M	will_definitely becoming back next time i ' m stuck .
M	rescued 0 kittens from the dspca during the summer , made sure to get all my bits and bobs from here .
M	my kittens health is number 0 , so it was important for me to get good quality food and accessories .
M	great variety online and prompt next_day delivery available
M	great selection of costumes and accessories , my biggest challenge is deciding what to wear !!!
M	and my order arrived next_day !!
M	now what to pick for the next fancy_dress party coming up ?
M	had four new tyres_fitted while at work .
M	there technican was polite and well_mannered .
M	fitted without the hassle you usually get at a garage .
M	even pointed_out my brakes needed replacing without the hard sell you usually get .
M	well worthy of my first post on tp !
M	if only all service you receive as a customer was this good .
M	friendly , knowledgeable and quick next_day delivery .
M	not knowing anything about radio controlled cars they gave me great support to get me up and running .
M	recommended no_hesitation !
M	easy to book , competitve quote
M	all i can say is what an amazing company !
M	so impressed and will always use these_guys and recommend them to everyone !
M	i typed my reg , was shown the tyres for my car , picked a premium brand ( yokohama ) that was 00_% cheaper_than everywhere_else , ordered them , was updated every_step of the way , they were delivered the next working day and the delivery guy carried them into my garage for me to save my wife a job while i was at work ( i have a friend that fits them so didn ' t need to have them fitted ).
M	they then emailed me to make_sure everything was done properly .
M	awesome , awesome company and site , can ' t recommend enough !
M	!
M	i ordered caffiene tablets from bulk_powders , only 0 sites sold the tablets i wanted and bulk_powders were the cheaper of the two .
M	ordered them , paid via_paypal and they were here 0 days_later !
M	the product is awesome and well_packaged exactly_what i wanted !!
M	will_definately use again !
M	!
M	ordered reaper of souls , got reaper of souls cd_key , not a lot else i can say it was quick and easy
M	i found everythig nice and easy on this website !
M	it had the biggest_selection out there and it didn ' t frustrate me to look up the specific items i needed .
M	i also loved the fact that it had the box to check if was a p . o .
M	box or military address .
M	i was recommended black_circles for it ' s easy system of being_able to choose a tyre , pay and roll up on a selected day , i hate having to place a call so online always sits well with me , i can take my time and review whats in front of me without keeping people waiting on the other end of the phone , once i had set a date and a morning slot i was given a time shortly_after - on the day i rolled up and they fitted the tyres , simple really , they didnt even need an order confirmation or anything since they go by the reg .
M	since it was booked in there was no waiting , no tyres needed ordering .
M	all was set and good to go , and had plenty of email_updates / reminders / communications throughout to keep me happy .
M	parcel0go offer a good range of courier services , meaning you can chose economy or speed or something in the middle .
M	the website is easy to use to process orders .
M	their customer_service is great - always prompt answers to queries and any_issues quickly solved .
M	recommended for any courier needs .
M	sam was very helpful , as always , in an issue with printing labels .
M	their facebook_page is a great way to contact them .
M	the items i ordered arrived really quickly via courier for a very reasonable p_& p charge considering the bulky nature of the goods . i also found their prices to be very competetive .
M	never again will i buy supplements from stores like gnc where the prices are inflated beyond_belief .
M	supplement_warehouse is reliable and i ' ve been ordering from them for a little over a year now .
M	the free_gifts and samples can ' t be compared when ordering from any other website .
M	my parents are starting to get mad with the amount of free_shaker_bottles i ' m getting haha .
M	die domain wurde bestellt und gleich eingerichted .
M	Ã¼ber die autodns - software kann man entweder einfach eine ip - addresse zuordnen , alternativ kann man 00mb webspace oder gleich einen eigenen dns - server damit benutzen .
M	basically this is how all end - user buying experiences should be ' pain - free '.
M	the prices are pretty_much less_than what you ' d expect for such quality gear .
M	they are as far as i am concerned doing the pro - audio industry proud .
M	i ordered a studio monitor and items such as these are pretty fragile , so i was pretty happy to see it arrive in one piece and work just as the manufacturer intended .
M	so many options to choose from !!!
M	so many brands and low_prices !!!!
M	always has amazing samples to choose from with great deals on added extras for less that half the cost it would be is bought seperate !!!
M	!
M	i ended_up paying the same amount as other_sites buts got twice the amount of products !
M	!
M	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area ..... see you court .
M	cant say enough about how good these_guys are , ive had a few bumps along the way with my websites but never has it been sitegrounds fault and they have always been quick to help and support me through a problem .
M	best customer experience i ' ve ever had in my life over a long consistent period .
M	i ' m an long time user of paypal .
M	i have a small business and have hit problem after problem after problem after problem after poor customer_service ( no customer_service )
M	i was a business stream customer after a couple of months fighting to get the correct bill i decided just to change supplier .
M	had to go to a lawyer for business stream to even respond ( which they did the next_day when they saw the lawyers letter ).
M	two years later and they still send me crap through my letter_box .
M	they are disgusting big business bullies .
M	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
M	truly truly_awful company .
M	from the director of a small wood working business .
M	a +++ great service leave your car while you go mc ds always a bonus
M	used this site many_times , and i have no_complaints .
M	packages always arrive on time and havent ever_experienced something being out of stock .
M	would highly_recommend to others ... and have !
M	all my local club use them !
M	happy training !
M	we placed an order last_week and ordered a meal from one of the express delivery guarantee takeaways , unfortunately , the meal didn ' t arrive within the 00_minutes guarantee but actually arrived in 00 - 00_minutes , while there was a missing item and the food and sauces were spilled throughout the bag .
M	after_speaking to someone about this via livechat , they informed me without giving a reason that we did not qualify for the express delivery and it was only 0 minutes late , i don ' t know how bad his maths is but i did get an inclination that he can ' t add up , as it was 00 - 00_minutes late .
M	he also tried to tell me that the missing item wasn ' t supposed to be delivered , yet another member of staff looked at the order and confirmed we were supposed to receive the missing item as it was clear that it was part of the set menu .
M	the food was also spilled all over the bag , yet he told me that he doesn ' t care .
M	when i did speak to another member of staff , they said the customer_service rep didn ' t follow protocol and i should escalate this to management and they would handle the situation .
M	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has been taken against me for complaining .
M	i don ' t know about you but i find this incredibly_rude and i can ' t believe that a good customer has been banned as a result .
M	they also told me that other people are being banned for the same reasons , so be_careful when using hungry_house and if i could rate this review below 0 star , i genuinely would .
M	have ordered from coolshop a couple times , where they ' ve delivered very quickly and seemed professional throughout the whole_process .
M	i ' ve also ordered modern_warfare 0 from them , as they seem to comfortably have the cheapest price on the market , while also promising to deliver before or by the release_date .
M	better_than queueing outside shops for hours to get it by midnight for at_least a tenner more lol
M	would definitely use again ; good price and quick delivery .
M	excellent price , well_packaged and very quick delivery - use dpd which are the best courier imo .
M	would definitely use again , highly_recommended .
M	also , thanks for the gift included !
M	great service , excellent clear delivery expectations ( and fast !)
M	and non - nonsense pricing (_eg other services include the day of delivery in hire ).
M	thoroughly_recommended and will be using again without_hesitation .
M	arranged a stag_do for 0 in krakow through chilli_sauce .
M	terri was amazing all the way through , updating us along the way and making_sure we had everything done in time .
M	everything was very easy and took a lot of the hassle out of organising a stag_do .
M	got the cd_key in the matter of 00_minutes works great .
M	a great service , with not only excellent price but a quick delivery on standard packages and also the ability to add in an extended warrenty , something you cant get nowadays from many online stores .
M	if your looking for the best in djing products , from speakers to controllers or cdjs , dj_deals is the best place around .
M	no competition in the market for a company that delivers so many different products .
M	i ordered a replacement bumper .
M	it was 0nd_hand and a little scratched and dented , but fine for the price .
M	the team were very responsive and helpful and knew their stuff !
M	good selection of drinks , well_priced as long as you buy a couple of items to offset one time delivery cost .
M	arrived within a week .
M	extremely well_packaged with lots of protection .
M	all in all i would highly_recommend .
M	i have bought many knives from this company , i have never been let_down .
M	their customer_service is second to none .
M	i ordered a squier affinity strat as a starter guitar for my dads birthday .
M	the guitar was competitively_priced with next_day free delivery .
M	it arrived on time within a specific time_slot .
M	i visited their newcastle store to check them out in person before i ordered because i was almost dubious of their massive online catalog since i ' d never_heard of guitarguitar .
M	trustworthy and reliable .
M	i recommend guitarguitar 000_%
M	i recently received a package from them , which came in 0 days ( after picking economy shipping which said up to 0 !).
M	all the items were very well_packaged with absolutely no signs of damage .
M	one item , however , was not the product that i ordered , it was an easy mistake as they appeared to have been involved in an accidental mix_up .
M	i emailed their enquiry service with the issue .
M	i had a very quick reply stating that they would ship the correct product asap with no charge at all !
M	and , even more amazingly , i enquired on a friday , and the item arrived on the following_monday !
M	outstanding !
M	from delivery to the quality of the product .
M	the whole experience of purchasing was perfect .
M	purely perfect service and for a cheap fee !
M	no_complaints only happiness with this company !
M	since i ' ve been with lifebatt we have used printerland and your services have been outstanding .
M	your delivery times are always quick and your customer_service is brilliant .
M	at the moment i cant seem to find a fault .
M	i would recommend this site to anyone .
M	even when i needed help finding a product someone was there to help .
M	keep up the good work !!
M	!
M	i ordered enough to get the free postage , however they didn ' t have enough in stock , they honoured the free postage anyway and sent me what they could .
M	saved loads on my current policy with protected , really easy to use .
M	people need to stop using myhermes ... fact
M	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
M	the first parcel we had delivered was left in our half full wheelie bin , the last time ( tonight ) they delivered at 0 . 00pm !
M	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .
M	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
M	a great selection to choose from , some quirky items i have not seen elsewhere , competitively_priced and super_fast delivery .
M	i made the order and within a few hours i recieved e_- mails asking for a few details to enable the order to be completed , all with simple to follow_instructions to find the required info on my handset .
M	0 - 0 days was the suggested delivery time , and on the fourth day my code was delivered , once again with simple to follow_instructions and my handset was up and running once more , could not fault the service and communication .
M	was price checking some shoes i wanted , found them in the sale on here for the cheapest price around by_far , not only that but i got free delivery which i find you often don ' t get with sale items .
M	received the shoes within 00 working hours :)
M	great site with interesting features unlike any other platform , giving you the closest thing to playing live poker but in the comfort of your own home .
M	community is another aspect of the site i love , have met some great friends from playing on pkr .
M	ebay is a great place to sell your unwanted goods .
M	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
M	it takes you ages just to pay your invoice , and to make a complaint about someone not paying you again is far too complicated .
M	keep it simply people !
M	bbc is the best website on the net , up to date , very easy to use and iplayer it the best player since the walkman !
M	news is always current and biased , great website
M	all in our household love amazon , best prices , easy to use love love love it
M	me and the boys want to tell designaventure what a fantastic stag_do we had in bristol .
M	the package was excellent for money and kath was so patient and helpful , i hope she gets a big bonus !
M	thanks once again designaventure .
M	you can find anything you need and the free_samples are awesome for checking new things out or just getting extra shakers .
M	also if you do happen to find it cheaper they will match it on the spot .
M	it ' s the best job search site out there .
M	every job ad in the uk in one place - saving you time humping around all those different job boards - plus useful alerts , stats around salaries and a cool feature called adzuna connect which allows you to see jobs that are going at companies where your friends work .
M	quick , easy , online ordering and speedy_delivery .
M	i ' m a longstanding customer of powerbulbs and the service from this company has always been outstanding .
M	i even got some free side lights with my last order and delivery was super_fast .
M	keep up the good work !
M	everything about the service was perfect .
M	good pricing , excellent website and quick delivery .
M	everything was perfect - quick , well_packaged , no_problems at all .
M	will_definitely_recommend to friends .
M	thanks
M	i would be more_than happy to recommend pc_specialist , they offer very good prices for high spec equipment .
M	the laptop i ordered is of a very high_quality and performs better_than i expected .
M	my only hesitation with using this company again would be with the build time .
M	where it was advertised that the laptop would take up to 00 working_days to build , it took mine over 00 days , however if time is not a factor i would be more_than happy to recommend the company .
M	edit_: revised rating to 0_stars after excellent customer_service - the hard_drive had failed shortly_after receiving the laptop and i was worried i would have to send the laptop off for a couple of weeks to be repaired - however this was not the case as pcs were more_than happy to send a new hard_drive in exchange for the faulty one free of charge .
M	shopto are one of the best places to pre_- order games , especially if you want them to arrive on release day ( with free delivery ).
M	everything is dispatched first_class for free ( except for consoles which are delivered by courier for free ) and frequently arrive the next_day should you order before 0pm .
M	i cannot_fault shopto ' s service and are my preferred choice of online_retailer when buying video_games .
M	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but .. shiply taking Â£_00 before paying for a delivery service that ' s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc .. makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery ' s beyond 00kg otherwise you ' ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
M	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort :_d
M	i joined this site about a week_ago and loved it from the off , it has a very wide_range off games including my favorite ' s fluffy favorite ' s and sharmen ' s dream and white wizard , it has a great bonus of 000_% so deposit Â£_00 and get Â£_00 to play , i had so much fun i would definitely_recommend it :)
M	was sceptical at first as gadget_panda may not be the most well know company but the service was second to none .
M	the full_amount of Â£_000 was paid into my account 0 days after they received my iphone_0s 00gb .
M	would not hesitate to use again .
M	what an amazing delivery for such an affordable price !
M	nice guy too .
M	a terrible company to choose ,
M	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad ' s gift for his_birthday in it .
M	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
M	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
M	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
M	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
M	the order could not have been handled better ...
M	delivered on time and at a great price .
M	i always got responses within the answer , even at weekends and they always made the effort to link up my various emails / calls , so i haven ' t had to explain myself twice .
M	completely recommend .
M	i chose to drop the phone into the fonebank office .
M	they were very friendly and processed it the same day as promised .
M	the offer was competitive and money promptly arrived in my account a couple of days_later .
M	highly_recommended ( having used a couple of competitors :-)
M	very helpful from the second i rang them .
M	i simply described what i needed and told them i needed them as soon as possible delivery and production took under a week and the quality was excellent .
M	they even folded the menus for us !
M	all in all the price was cheap and the quality was next to perfect .
M	i used referral_code ca0000 to get 000g free with my first order ...
M	already very happy ... but wait !
M	i was even happier when it arrived and it tastes so good and mixes well .
M	so glad i tried this company as i had been messed_around so many_times before with other_sites ( mp ).
M	i recommend this to try for everyone just spend Â£_00 and get 000g free with ca0000 like i did :)
M	honestly cannot_fault the ease of use to the website , speed of delivery or validity of goods .
M	top_notch , 0 * service
M	really brilliant service from ocuk , the service is fast and convenient without any hassle , the prices can be higher_than some of the competition , but then if you spend some time on the forum you will be eligible for free next_day dpd delivery which is amazing !
M	saves a ton of money undercutting most of ocuk ' s rivals , also with the deals of the day its easy to get a good bargain !
M	also the forums are fantastic , great way to get feedback on builds and future projects or help and advice ,
M	keep it up guys !
M	:)
M	quick to respond , quickly processed , got money quickly , well_done
M	i thought your service was very good , as my fixed ipad came back to me very fast .
M	i would highly_recommend your service to any of my friends .
M	for the service you provided i thought it was value for money and wanted to thank_you for being so professional .
M	i was a bit_worried after_reading some of the reviews here yesterday , but everything arrived well in time and i didn ' t even pay the extra for the pre 0pm delivery - nice one !
M	i placed my order with mazuma yesterday , i choose to send my phone special delivery using the printed label , i recieved an_email this morning confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made to my bank_account today .
M	this afternoon , had the amount quoted paid into my bank_account ,
M	outstanding service , from an excellant company .
M	this is my second time in using this company and would go no where else in the future :)
M	i joined and i bought aa insurance .
M	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
M	its just a waste of time it seems !!
M	!
M	i think this is the best site , allways use as long as they have the place i wanna visit .
M	website is clear and easy to use , wealth of information on the faq page about the services offered makes it easy to get what you need and know what the process is .
M	i opted for saturday delivery as i ' d left it until friday to decide i wanted to rent a lens for the weekend to test and everything processed quickly and with great communication .
M	i received an initial e_- mail to acknowledge receipt of my order , then confirmation that the item was in stock and my order could be fulfilled within the admittedly tight time_frame i ' d left myself , and again to let me know when it had dispatched .
M	further communication ensured i didn ' t lose track of when my rental ended and i needed to return the lens .
M	lens arrived well_packaged and cleverly boxed to make it easy to get into without damaging the packaging and i was able to return it in the same box without needing any additional tape or packaging .
M	plenty of information about returns included with the item , even down to a shipping bag and pre_- printed label .
M	all in all couldn ' t ask for better service and will certainly consider_using again if i ever need a lens that i can ' t afford to buy for short_term use
M	ordered for 00th_birthday , despatched on time .
M	best prices i have found so far for driving lessons in london , good quality driving tuition provided .
M	arrived on time like they said it would , constant emails updating me of the entire_process , and nothing wrong with the pc at all .
M	instant delivery , instant steam activation , cheapest price i could find .
M	can you ask for anything more ?
M	great service , offered to resend the item when i thought the po had lost it !
M	best price on the web
M	i purchased a fog light and a set of wiper blades .
M	the fog light was sent straight from the supplier as i needed it asap
M	the wiper blade was refunded very quickly as they were a universal fit .
M	i was not charged any p_& p for sending the wipers back
M	this site helped_me to get all the relevant documentation sorted out so i could get divorced pretty quickly .
M	staff were helpful and friendly
M	ordered item at 0 : 00 on friday_afternoon , was here next_day saturday_morning
M	i had very professional service and a great experience buying my game , i recommend it to everyone i know .
M	went to a stag due booked through this company and it was really activates where brill the the hotel was really nice and the club_entry finished it off well
M	i love playing the bounty hunter games as i love the challenge of playing to eliminate players while making yourself a higher target for people to eliminate i am yet to finish in the prizes so far my highest finish is 00th but each time i play i try to set achievable targets depending_on the size of tournament i will always use skypoker as my number 0 poker site as i have always had great service from all sky games
M	talktalk are worst company i have ever_encountered .
M	if you can even call them a that .. no structure .
M	the automated service is far from helpful .
M	please visit our site to perform a health check on your broadband_connection ?
M	astonishing !
M	your asking the customer to do your job for you .
M	when you finally manage to figure_out a way to manipulate the automated_system and get you talking to someone ( as if my broadband and tv connection failing didn ' t warrent some sort of tech team assistance !)
M	its just as totally dissapointing as the obismal auto service you get for the first 00_minutes of the call .
M	the facts :-
M	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
M	0 of which i got told promised by ' bhal ' if that ' s how you spell his name - that i would get a call back from a manager within the next 00_hours ... that was 00_hours ago and i ' m still_waiting !
M	bit of advice - invest in some proper training for your staff !
M	i ...
M	myself ... had to talk your agent through simple first line checks after him asking me to walk back and forth to reboot my router and tv box for 00_minutes .
M	00_minutes !
M	if it doesn ' t work the first time ... its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
M	both other times i called i got put on hold whilst an agent asked for assistance from ' another agent ' after 00_minutes with no communication i gave up all hope and hung_up .
M	look , i am not asking for the impossible .
M	simply for my tv to work - for me to get the service i have been paying for and not receiving for the past 0 months !
M	!
M	i ' m sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look_into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
M	stay well clear of this company !
M	id recommend this site , cheap prices for supplements that would cost a lot more in stores like gnc .
M	great quality .
M	great service .
M	what i wanted and ahead of schedule
M	i went into kensington appliances needing a new washing_machine and not really knowing where to start .
M	really attentive staff , very helpful , showed me a good few options and went out of their way to phone different brands to see if there was a deal to be had .
M	overall , very impressed , will definitley use again !
M	cheaper even with free delivery .
M	delivery emails and texts and then a phone call on the day meant that i could get my old man to take delivery .
M	they came bang on time .
M	customer_service was superb and quick answers to all my questions i had , very helpful
M	the product was in perfect_condition , was priced was significantly_lower_than could be found anywhere_else , packaged very well , and was received very quickly .
M	i highly_recommend memorysuppliers . com !!!
M	thank_you very much !
M	ordered 0 tickets to see gary barlow at the royal_albert hall 0 weeks in_advance .. at the cost of Â£_000 . 00 for standing tickets , train and hotel are booked at the cost of over Â£_000 .
M	its now the night before the concert and i still_havent got my tickets .
M	after nearly 00 phone_calls they still carnt tell me weather or not to travel to london as it may be a wast of time .
M	they said they may have to refund me .
M	i even spoke to them before the weekend but they said rest_assured they will arrive in time .
M	a complet joke .
M	this is suposed to be a birthday_present for my wife !!!
M	!
M	the service from powerbody is second to none .
M	all staff are friendly with excellent knowledge .
M	the website itself is very user_friendly with competitive_prices .
M	even cheaper supplements can be had from the deal of the week .
M	i most certainly wont be using another service any time soon .
M	great service will use again , items turned_up quickly .
M	thanks
M	gav
M	easy to navigate website - pleasant ordering_process and within a few weeks my glasses had arrived .
M	really good value for money compared to the high_street .
M	my posters were delivered on time and exactly as_described .
M	i opted for the free delivery and my laptop came in the one hour_slot i given .
M	i was informed at every_step of the way where my order was and what was happening .
M	most_importantly however , the laptop is exactly as advertised and works_perfectly .
M	i couldn ' t be_happier with it .
M	a template for all other_companies to follow .
M	i am so glad that i found riverside garden_centre ' s website as they have great deals on weber products .
M	i bought a 00 ' one - touch grill with accessories cheaper_than the standalone price of the same product on amazon and john_lewis .
M	definitely recommended .
M	i ' m so glad that someone finally took international money transfer process to 00st century .
M	these_guys have a very easy to use tool that provides great exchange_rates ( i . e .
M	much_better_than bank rates ), very fast service and very easy to use website .
M	emre
M	i recently started getting gousto boxes and i am amazed how good they are .
M	everything in the box is fresh and tastes amazing .
M	i think the option to select your recipes every week makes a huge difference and the recipe cards delivered within the boxes are great .
M	the fact that i can cook all these amazing meals at home makes me feel great about my cooking skills .
M	highly_recommended .
M	good service and reasonable_price !
M	i can ' t be bothered to waste further time on this company by writing a lengthy review so i will just say this : horrendous !
M	i only have good things to say about amazon .
M	i have been using them for years and have always found the pricing , delivery and customer_service to be excellent .
M	they sell such a diverse range of products .
M	i recommend that if you are buying anything at all , check amazon first , you may be surprised .
M	my experiences of play have been brilliant .
M	great prices , prompt delivery and good returns_procedure .
M	highly_recommended .
M	my last 0 laptops have both been from dell .
M	i have had absolutely no_problems with either of them .
M	i have not had to speak to their customer_services so unsure how they perform in this respect , but in terms of quality of product , i have no_complaints whatsoever .
M	approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , i place an order for about Â£_000 worth of goods that never arrived .
M	despite numerous phone_calls , emails and threats of legal_action , no refund was ever given .
M	after taking_legal_advice on the situation , was advised that small_claims court was an option but it would be expensive and a waste of my time .
M	i don ' t usually bother writing reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
M	i am aware that this happened some time ago , but having read some of the other reviews , it appears that this company is still at it ' s old tricks .
M	i would consider this ... you may well receive you order , but how will you feel if you don ' t and fail to get you money back ?
M	ordered 0pm one evening , was texted to let me know the status of the order and was able to pick it up from their depot the very next morning .
M	excellent price , happy with product , would happily buy from them again .
M	i have used 000 -_reg since about 0000 .
M	they have great prices , they remind me when sites are overdue and they have an easy to use interface , for what i need them for , which is domain_name purchase , they are awesome

M	delivery , failure to turn_up and damage to our house
M	our delivery date was arranged and we had received telephone confirmation in the morning .
M	00_minutes before the end the day we received a call saying that the furniture would not be delivered .
M	the result to me was a loss of days pay from work for no furniture with the inconvenience of having to take more annual_leave to rearrange a second delivery date .
M	0nd delivery date 0 pieces of faulty and damaged furniture arrived along with the wrong mattress delivered - a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for !
M	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
M	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
M	the staff had to unpack the wardrobe and because of this removal of the packaging i had to sign a disclaimer saying that any damage to my house would be my fault .
M	in the process we received damage to our wooden door and 0 chunks of wood were taken out of our wooden banister .
M	if oak_furniture land had packaged the items so they could be carried i would not have had to sign a disclaimer and the damage would not have occurred because the cardboard protection .
M	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
M	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
M	after complaining they delivered very late in the evening and this resulted_in another day of lost wages .
M	faulty , damaged furniture , wrong products
M	0 ) wardrobe
M	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality_control for the following reasons ;
M	approximately a 00 cm height crack with a very wide gap , running from the base upwards .
M	another large crack 00 cm running from the base upwards .
M	magnetic strips designed to keep the door closed were unscrewed and loose
M	multiple holes on top where the carpenter had forgotten to fill the holes .
M	the worst part is the removal men could see the cracks and faults but kept quiet and hoped i would not notice until after they had gone .
M	the second wardrobe replacement had one side of the front_door which showed panels and in particular a very dark panel , whilst the right hand door did not have the panel feature , the result is we have two odd doors which do not match .
M	0 ) mirror - large cracks in two places
M	0 ) white filler very visible at regular intervals on oak bed_frame , a large chunk of wood missing and a split .
M	an engineer was sent to repair several pieces of furniture , the result another day off lost pay through having to take time off work !
M	0 ) scratches on a chest of draws - repaired by an engineer .
M	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer_service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .
M	the worst part was that they tore off the label to hope that we would not be able to recognise that it was the wrong one and a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for .
M	the furniture is of poor quality and is not due to transportation damage but workmanship .
M	poor customer_service
M	we cooperated at every opportunity sending photographs and video_footage of the damage a shame customer_service did not do the same .
M	people failed to call when promised - both the delivery team and the after care service .
M	on repeated occasions i have not been able to get through at all to customer_service for over a week and we have received repeated lies and excuses from staff .
M	result
M	0 ) 0 days of lost pay through taking annual_leave for failed delivery , replacements and engineers .
M	expense of making no end of calls to customer_service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
M	0 ) damage to the house
M	0 ) 0 weeks sleeping on the floor without a bed !
M	0 ) after writing to a senior member of the management team and explaining that we will be sharing our experiences with others by uploading videos , photographs and an account of this online , we finally got the problems resolved .
M	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
M	we went for the gesture of goodwill but this by no means covers the loss of annual_leave days , damage to the house , stress or the major inconvenience_caused by oak_furniture land and we still have a wardrobe without matching doors .
M	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
M	advice
M	0 ) stay_away , do not purchase anything from oakfurniture land
M	0 ) if you do purchase don â t pay in full / upfront as we did .
M	put it on a credit_card as you have more rights if there are problems .
M	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .
M	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
M	0 ) take video_footage and photos of the damage and act promptly
M	i ' ve used flashbay on numerous_occasions .
M	i was once tempted away by a competitor who undercut them and obviously in today ' s market , savings need to be made where they can be .
M	the saying " you get what you pay for " has never been truer and i regretted my decision when the products arrived .
M	i now will only use flashbay as they take all of the hassle away , no endless to and fro of emails trying to explain away why they can ' t meet the deadline , the stock can ' t be sourced etc etc etc
M	needed some new front_tyres fairly quickly .
M	they had them in the local tyre place but Â£_00 dearer for each one .
M	got them for just under Â£_000 instead of Â£_000 for a few minutes on the computer .
M	fitted that day after phoning the tyre shop for an earlier appointment .
M	nice one .
M	same tyres , same place , cheaper price .
M	i purchased a set of gold ghds for my fiancee for xmas and they were a great price - being a bloke i left the purchase pretty late but the delivery was still very prompt and arrived well in time for xmas .
M	i cannot_fault the service , the checkout was quick and simple and i really got a bargain .
M	lots of info and i love the bbc_iplayer n links o radio0
M	the best search_engine n the internet bar_none
M	i would recommend this site to absolutely anyone .
M	i will no_longer buy from gnc , vitamin_world , or any other store as long as this site is available .
M	wonderful service , super_fast_shipping , and lots of great free items .
M	tightboards followed up with me asking me to rate my experience with their site .
M	so here we go .
M	i looked on every site i could for the holden jacket i wanted in my size and rare color .
M	i found only two others that had the same jacket , but i found that tightboards had the easiest checkout system , just a few pages .
M	so i went with them .
M	great experience , start to finish , would buy from this store again .
M	everything was perfect , from the hostel to the activities .
M	all planned and organised so all we had to was show up !
M	am looking into planning my own stag_do with chillisauce .
M	man this site has everything and they have tons of freebies !
M	on other_websites it seems that the stuff is always on backorder but not supplement_warehouse .
M	these_guys are the shiz !
M	great service .
M	cheap prices , fast delivery .
M	what else can be added ?
M	what ' s not to love ?
M	they sell just about everything , they ' re often cheaper_than anywhere_else , and the checkout_process couldn ' t be easier .
M	ok , so it isn ' t the prettiest looking site on the web and it ' s about time they made the add to basket button ajax , but with 0 - click enabled and a subscription to amazon_prime i can locate and buy most things in under a minute and it arrives the next_day .
M	i have also , in all the years i ' ve been using amazon , never had a bad_experience , even when purchasing from other merchants in the marketplace .
M	the site is very easy to navigate and select your phone .
M	the sell process is a breeze , the pack arrives the next_day and now that they offer payment by faster payment transfer the whole_process only takes a few_days .
M	great way to make some quick cash out of the smartphone graveyard that is my desk drawer !
M	we booked a hotel in benidorm and when we got there we were not booked in .
M	we had no_idea what to do .
M	phoned alpha_rooms and they had moved us without telling us .
M	we were moved to a worse hotel without aircon and for the 0 nights no fresh towels or maid service .
M	we were refused this .
M	on arriving home i contacted alpha_rooms and they tried to blame a different agent .
M	alpha_rooms were our agent and said they " tried " to contact me .
M	tried isn ' t good enough when your sending people to another country .
M	no email , no answer phone message .
M	the final email from the complaint said " i ' m sorry there is nothing we can do ".
M	at no point did they properly apologise or even admit any blame .
M	beware !!!!!!!
M	use travel_republic as they are cheaper and send you to the correct hotel
M	i have been using bulk_powders for a few_months now after coming over from a rival company .
M	deliveries have always been on time , accurate and without any_issues .
M	free_samples are sometimes offered on their website which makes_sense as it allows me to try a product and is a potential sale for bp .
M	also their customer_service is faultless .
M	i will_continue to use them for the foreseeable_future .
M	they also have frequent offers which i ' ve taken_advantage of which helps to save a bit of money or get a product free .
M	i used to use myprotein about a year_ago but have been away and have not needed to use them until now .
M	the service was always good and i never had any_problems .
M	my first purchase this year was on saturday_afternoon .
M	it is now monday_morning and dpd have been and gone after delivering my order .
M	to be honest i ' m astonished .
M	i do a lot of online ordering and as a general rule if you order something at the weekend ( even if you need next_day delivery ) you don ' t receive it until tuesday .
M	most companies don ' t process orders at the weekend .
M	with this in mind i felt it was important to leave_feedback highlighting the outstanding service i received using myprotein .
M	i ' ll have no_hesitation using them again when i need to re - order in a few weeks time .
M	and as always the prices for a bulk buy of whey_protein are excellent .
M	i have order 0 jackets and after 0 days they sent me an_email that they dont have the order and they are sorry ok no problem but ........ my transaction was pending so i said no warys it will come back ........ wrong they took the money from my account and surprise i have tried to get in touch for over 0 week send email with no answer from them and then i have found the email of their ceo and told him what is happing and surprise next_day email from them then after 0 week my money were back i will not recomend them
M	first time i ' ve used this website .
M	very impressed and i will check them out first on future_purchases .
M	very speedy_delivery with no surcharge , in fact no charge at all .
M	having done my research on a new suitcase i chose an antler and looked for a supplier .
M	luggage express provided the item at 00_%_off the list price and with free delivery .
M	i made the purchase and have been delighted by the responses and the product .
M	i have been kept up to date throughout the order and delivery process and since .
M	if all internet retailers behaved in such a proffessional way i wouldn ' t be writing this review but credit where it ' s due , it ' s just a shame that this type of product is only purchased rarely and therefor i might not need their services again for many years .
M	i ' ll spread the word though to anyone thinking of upgrading their own bags .
M	no_problems , arrived quickly
M	item was as_described , delivery was exactly when expected (~ 00_minutes into 0 hour delivery window ), and price was very reasonable .
M	this is now my go to website
M	two_thumbs_up
M	quick service and really good product .
M	thanks
M	for over last 0 years i have been buying tickets from 00 and i have never had a problem with them .
M	i love a fact that i can collect tickets form the office to avoid delivery payment .
M	stuff is always friendly and flexible with deals .
M	good company .
M	i would order from chemist_direct again .
M	the service was excellent
M	and i received my order the next_day .
M	excellent service .
M	the live help operator who dealt_with my query ( daniel ) was most helpful and professional .
M	many_thanks
M	having received my last consignment from bannerfield tools , the experience was hassle_free .
M	all the items ordered were in stock and arrived without delay .
M	overall a pleasure to deal with and at a good price .
M	purchased a tablet online last_night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
M	the confirmation_email never turned_up so i rang customer_services .
M	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
M	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
M	i was then
M	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
M	again the email never arrived , so concerned i rang again , to be told they were out of stock and they will let me know when they ' re back in , which could be whenever .
M	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
M	if only i checked here first , i wouldn ' t have bothered ordering in the first place
M	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
M	it is now 00th of feb and i have still received nothing .
M	i had to buy a replacement present since it embarrassingly did not turn_up .
M	i have requested a refund more times than i would like to count .
M	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
M	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
M	this situation is totally_unacceptable and if i do not get a refund soon i will look_into taking some legal_action_against them , just out of principle .
M	if you want to do online course and is your first experience then you must give a chance to e_careers and you will see the result
M	i recommend you to join e_careers and have an educated life
M	ordered liquid egg_whites , arrived quickly , product prefect .
M	thanks .
M	always happy with the products and delivery .
M	i buy quite a few different things each month .
M	the proteins and creatine are of good quality .
M	technician tony_allen let me know when he was arriving well in_advance ; communication was great .
M	he was polite , efficient and very helpful .
M	would use again
M	needed a parcel collecting today and delivering monday before 00 : 00 .
M	samantha helped_me out over the live_chat and we got it all sorted with no hassle .
M	great service + great help from samantha .
M	many_thanks !
M	kind_regards ,
M	nathan smith .
M	i don ' t expect the best customer_service from a website that ' s pushing products like these folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
M	the site ' s tricky to navigate if you don ' t know what you ' re looking for , so it ' s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
M	also , never trust their shipment process to just go through .
M	plan on babying the entire ordering_process all the way up until it ships .
M	sometimes it feels_like these folks aren ' t even interested in making a sale .
M	a superb seller with great customer_service and quick delivery !
M	i had an question about a product so rang the customer_service number and the gentleman dealt_with my query very efficiently !
M	when the product arrived , i was very happy ...... the descriptions on the website were spot on .
M	overall a great website with quality gear and very competitive_prices !
M	recommended
M	very easy and quickly .
M	best prices , and widest selections .
M	shipping is reasonable and fast .
M	lifetime customer .
M	the title_says it all really - the ordering_process was very slick , my suit was delivered quickly by courier and was packaged very well .
M	the quality of the item is excellent and it represents very good value for money .
M	i wouldn ' t hesitate to order from my tuxedo again .
M	we needed some medication quickly and not only were medicines0pets the cheapest , they also dispatched next_day and the item arrived quickly .
M	the service was excellent and i would thoroughly reccommend them !
M	can ' t praise the team at usbnow highly_enough .
M	my pc failed and i desperately_needed to recover the data from the hard_drive and was not sure which way to proceed .
M	they gave me some great advice and sold me an ide / sata adapter kit that allowed me to connect my hard_drive to another pc and recover the data i needed .
M	avnow were brilliant .
M	we needed a flat tv bracket for our new lcd tv and they talked us through the options , no flannel just sound_advice and it was delviered the next_day with a free hdmi lead thrown in as well
M	excellent service from usb0u on branded usb memory sticks .
M	their in - house designer turned around our concept in a coupe of hours and the custom usb memory stick they delivered exceeded all expectations .
M	i am getting a new suite and my old one is going to my daughter `_s , so needed someone reliable to move it for me . got online , found any van ... so easy .., you just put what the job is .... and wait for the quotes to come in , you can see reviews about them as well .
M	the one i opted for contacted me right away , no_messing .
M	any van , super site if you are looking for a job to be done
M	delivery is really fast so one can make a last_minute order knowing they will receive on time .
M	i have been using this for just twelve months now and have already had over Â£_000 payout . this goes straight into my bank_account , in amatter of 0 or 0 days . i am not a big spender but as there are so many websites available on topcashback , one finds they can use it for every site one wants to shop on ... travel , insurance ,,, you name it ... it `_s there .
M	i am very happy using tcb ...
M	i am very happy to have found this site , i was desperate as the company i had been using folded up without any warning taking with it all my balance , which was substantial .
M	i make numerous_calls to south_africa and spain where i have family and it would cost me a small_fortune to call them as regularly as i do with my normal landline phone company .
M	as su larcombe says , the dts support_team are very efficient and respond very quickly to any quieries and problems one might have .
M	when i first looked at dts was a bit_wary as there is no telephone contact number but on emailing them was reassured that they are a bona fide company and they have proved themselves as such to me .
M	ok , occasionally i have been cut_off during a conversation causing one to have to redial , which i can understand would be inconvenient if it is a business call .. but this is very far and few between .
M	just a little tip , if you have a talk unlimited plan with your phone company eg ; virginmedia , make_sure you end your call before an_hour is up , say at 00_mins and redial if you wish to continue your dts call . if you don ` t virginmedia , in my case , will start charging .
M	i have never had any problem regarding my balance etc .
M	thank_you dts , without you , i would not be able to talk to my family as often as i do .
M	wonderful product , fantastic value , arrived on time . very pleased . recommend . thank_you .
M	check them out for sure !
M	some products are worth purchasing trough this website such as the specials they be having .
M	however the price of all the products are cheap but when you get to the final price which includes shipping / handling it adds up to the same / around price the you would most_likely pay at gnc .
M	playstation 0 delivered on day of release , and even given a delivery time_slot by the courier so i could arrange for someone to take delivery .
M	customer_service also responded quickly by email when i had a problem with my bank blocking the payment
M	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
M	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
M	i missed the flight from sydney to south korea and had to travel in the next_day , which means :
M	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend ' s family
M	- i wasted one day at work , because i had to take that day off
M	- i lost money because i had already paid for the hotel in seoul
M	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
M	- i had to pay for two meals in australia , which are at_least twice more_expensive than the meals in korea .
M	- i wasted a precious time with my girlfriend , who i can meet no more_than 00 days a year .
M	- all the plans i had for the first evening and the next_day had to be canceled .
M	not mentioning that i had requested a seat selection to tripsta ' s staff few weeks before the trip , because i could not log in into asiana ' s airlines with my reservation number , but the staff couldn ' t help me and did not suspect something was wrong .
M	after contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline ' s contact " and i even got an_email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
M	i ' m still_waiting for an explanation and maybe for some compensation .
M	worst experience ever .
M	the search_engine is very good , there are a lot of options and i had no_problems to use it , because it is very easy .
M	brilliant service !
M	perfect_condition and very quick delivery .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	not a single complaint about the whole ordering_process , simple to select the product you require and delivered swiftly .
M	a great service :)
M	having worked in e_- commerce businesses for the past 0 years , i have to say i was absolutely impressed by my experience on partmaster .
M	it was flawless .
M	the site was clear , the purchase process very straightforward .
M	delivery was trackable and on tim .
M	the email communication was perfectly balanced and timely .
M	superb work .
M	i will use you again and will be glad to recommend you to friends and family .
M	this is all you need from a site .
M	a wide_variety of product to browse thought easily .
M	and once the purchase is made , adequate email communication and swift delivery .
M	will use it again
M	simple , as seamless as it can be and held on to all promises .
M	it was recommended to me and i shall recommend and use again .
M	thanks !
M	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .
M	my order was placed on hold because i put the wrong billing_address , which is fine .
M	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform me that the order was on hold .
M	if it ' s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
M	i had to contact them about 00 days after i purchased the products wondering_why they had not shipped yet before they told me .
M	i changed my billing_address to match the information i provided and informed them and my order was taken off hold .
M	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
M	i said yes .
M	the item never shipped .
M	they finally got the out of stock item in and claim they have finally shipped the complete order out to me but only after ignoring about three of my emails and taking several days between my last email and their response .
M	it has been over a month since i initially placed my order and i ' m still_waiting .
M	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
M	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
M	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren ' t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too_late to order elsewhere saying they couldn ' t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran out of stock ).
M	i asked if they could do anything on the very expensive postage which was Â£_00 . 00 for what was now going to be 0 day delivery , and that seemed excessive , but they refused to even even try .
M	and now looking at others feedback , it looks_like this isn ' t the first time this has happened .
M	won ' t be going back for more tyres , will stick to the cheaper place that advertises 0 day delivery and free postage , as at_least you can plan things for sure then .
M	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
M	do not use this company if you want anything on time and and don ' t want to be messed about .
M	after shopping with them for years and having things sent to my work all this time , i placed a order last_week , they rejected it because my address had 0 letter different ( 0a rather_than 0 , 0a is actually correct but they only accept the incorrect address ).
M	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
M	i thought maybe it was a one off , but no , i placed another order , made sure the address was exactly the same as paypal expected , so no_problems with that this time .
M	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn ' t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
M	should have just ordered off of ebay where the same part was Â£_00 cheaper anyway !
M	i have placed about 0 order in since january and i have recieved everything within 0 days of my order being placed .
M	my orders are always right .
M	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else for supplements .
M	they match and discount that match .
M	can ' t beat that .
M	you always get free_stuff .
M	it ' s free from them but the the shipping companies , fedex or ups , have to get there cut , so don ' t blame sw .
M	try to ship something without paying see how far it gets .
M	awesome all the way around .
M	it was very easy to book and the cheapest price for a parking stay i could fine .
M	if the service is as good as when booking , then i would deffently recommend this parking stay as i travel 0 to 0 times a year through manchester airport .
M	i dealt_with manoj at best_stl who on listening to where i wanted to progress my professional development went away and did some research and came back to advise me on with the best course for me .
M	it was extremely_helpful and i booked the course straight_away which was an easy and stress_free process .
M	the course was fantastic and i really_enjoyed it and passing made it even more enjoyable .
M	all in all i would recommend best_stl ' s supportive and passionate service that have helped_me on my path to further my career .
M	any kind of supplement brand or type you will find on this website and always at the lowest_price .
M	tons of freebies offered with each purchase .
M	i live close enough to actually go to the store itself but i find its much_easier to just order online .
M	great site , great service .
M	will do all my future supplement shopping here
M	i shopped_around for underfloor electric heating and these came out the best value .
M	helpful on the telephone when i rang with a couple of questions .
M	placed the order on the internet and as promised the shipment arrived the nextday .
M	instructions were clear and easy to follow .
M	i was surprised at how straightforward and simple it is to fit ( and i am no electrician !).
M	we now have a nice cosy kitchen !
M	.
M	everything from depositing / withdrawing to buying / playing cards is made incredibly user_friendly on sky_bingo .
M	layouts are catchy , games are plentiful and fun and the chat if you choose to use it almost makes the games secondary to the camaraderie .
M	as a social gambler ( not in it to win it , just in it for fun ) this is the best of the best .
M	plus , i trust sky implicitly as they have been my t . v supplier for many years .
M	the benefits that members gain by signing_up to their e_- mail alerts on top of the loyalty bonuses are astounding .
M	if you ' ve never tried online bingo look no further , you won ' t find better .
M	if you have then jump over to sky for the same reason .
M	always helpful and a great selection of gear .
M	i very personal service .
M	i had a cold and was hoping my stuff would come quickly as there was no point in it turning_up afterwards .
M	although next time i would have the night nurse ect to hand i guess .
M	would be good if it was made clear how long delivery takes but i was very happy as it did come extremely quickly .
M	quick delivery , well_packed .
M	will use it in the future !
M	i love this place !
M	highly_recommended !
M	!
M	having bought a number of products from outdoorkit , i have been amazed by service and prices .
M	ordering a product and receiving it the next_day really is dedication to customer_service .
M	extremely simple process which saw money in hand in under two_weeks !
M	very well run and great price .
M	came in with a million and 0 questions .
M	answered every_single one and sorted out everything i needed .
M	walked_away one very very happy chappy
M	the staff are knowledgable , friendly and resourceful .
M	can ' t recommend enough !
M	thanks guys !
M	i actively try to find better deals than this company .
M	it can ' t be done 0 / 00 times and when it is done , they beat it anyways .
M	customer_service is very helpful as well .
M	i ' ve purchased about a dozen_times and will_continue to do so .
M	arrives within 00_hours almost every time .
M	having just finished with 0 close friends at our night in blues smoke house in bracknell i can_honestly say it was an amazing night .
M	the staff are extremely warm and friendly , the atmosphere was brilliant all the tables were full of people having a really great night .
M	we opted for the share platter and one of us had a burger and we got a few sides and everything was cooked to perfection .
M	not one of us could find any fault with any of the food that we had from the succulent ribs to the mouth watering brisket and chicken .
M	if this is an example of things to come from the team then they can all be extremely proud of themselves .
M	oh and if you manage to save room for desert they will not disappoint we had everything that was available and i can_honestly say we have all gotten home full to bursting !
M	!
M	we look_forward to seeing you again really soon
M	yes the prices at 0game are sometimes extremely competitive however i have received none uk release games which are then not able to be traded in .
M	so if your ordering a game that you may eventually trade in then just realise that some places will not take non uk titles .
M	the game will still work on your console and have english instructions etc
M	just as my review says becareful
M	my first ever order with pc game supply and i cannot_fault them at all , from the minute i had sent my order the security check was easily handled and i had my code within 0 minutes of placing my order .
M	happy to recommend and will happily use again
M	having now made 000_+ orders with shopto . net i am a proud gold member .
M	the company are based locally for me and i was glad to have found them online , there prices are always very competitive and i have never had any_problems with them .
M	they have a lot of different payment_methods including paypal and now also will show you a picture of your item when it goes for delivery .
M	the speed that they can get an item processed and dispatched is by_far_greater than any other company .
M	very happily sold my phone on mazuma and the turn_around was really quick and easy .
M	once they recieved my phone the money was in my account 0 days_later .
M	used office stationery for the first time to buy ink toner for an olivetti .
M	price easily beat price i had paid before and anything_else on the net .
M	when it came to delivery , the information provided was great and turned_up literally just 0 mins after they said it was going to be delivered - which in my book is outstanding !
M	cex ' s policy is , if you have a voucher , you must print it off , and post the voucher to them at your own_risk .
M	you can ' t enter a voucher_code at the online checkout .
M	sent my voucher in ' recorded_delivery '.
M	it ' s been signed for , yet i ' ve still heard_nothing .
M	should sort out there voucher situation !
M	item ordered late saturday .
M	arrived on tuesday_morning .
M	can ' t fault it .
M	easily order a dominos on a weekly_basis .
M	cannot_fault them atall .. good food and great service .
M	good quality costumes , reasonably_priced and delivered with - in days .. have nothing neggative to say about jokers '.
M	have used the site before and will do again .
M	i had 0 parcels booked for thursday and wanted to change to wednesday so i contacted the live help and was greeted_by richard_mileham and he helped_me very quickly to change the dates of all 0 parcels he was also very helpful and very quick at the help he provided very happy customer :_d
M	good websites and very cheap prices and quick delivery
M	what a load of rubish these lot are .
M	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
M	they allowed my mum to drive the car home untaxed and so uninsured what idiots .
M	then i have had the car a month and noticed the back valance loose looked underneath and the back crossmember
M	is bent and split you cant lower the spare wheel it has been in a smash ,
M	back valance shodily replaced to ( con ) seel this damage .
M	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
M	they all looked ( con ) fused and sheepish .
M	then atempted to blame me for the damage but if i needed the spare wheel they could get the prie bar onit .
M	ha .
M	ha .
M	amazingly enough the mot tester did not pick_up on it ( why ) they were ( con ) fident that it was not damaged when it left the forcourt .
M	i have informed the finance company .
M	consumer direct ect .
M	i will not rest until they accept_responsibility .
M	avoid these wide boys at all cost .
M	tony arrived this morning a little ahead of when he said he would and as a courtesy called me first to see if that was ok ... which it was .
M	the tyres were fitted in double time and without fuss which is all you want really .
M	great service , nice bloke .
M	i ' d recommend this service to anyone .
M	well_done !
M	supplementwarehouse . com has everything you need !
M	they make it really easy to find what your looking for and they make it really easy to match competing websites prices .
M	shipping is fast and you always know your getting what you want .
M	having used paypal for a number of years i have always thought the same_thing .
M	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer_service much_better .
M	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
M	without them , even with the power of ebay they will be left behind .
M	like many people i have used amazon quite_often over the years and although the service is generally quite good , delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off_peak periods .
M	i cannot_fault however the downloads , especially the ebooks .
M	fast , efficient , simple !
M	this is the fourth time i have used this company and they continue to do business well .
M	fast , reliable and honest .
M	will_continue to use and recommend .
M	my guess is you ' re reading this with the same thought i had in my head when i considered buying cd_keys online .
M	all i can say is , it ' s worth it !
M	bought tomb_raider for Â£_00 and after doing the verification steps ( which is easy !)
M	i got my key and entered it into steam .
M	a few minutes later i was downloading it !
M	screw paying full price for any game anymore !
M	cjs just became my favourite site !
M	cannot_fault , though it would have been better if the bag provided had bubble_wrap inside as i had to use tissue to make_sure that the phone was not broken in transit .
M	have now used mrmemory numerous_times , and the service provided has been second to none .
M	right parts every time , and delivered promptly .
M	very pleased with the product , great value for money and a reliable , fast delivery .
M	thank_you .
M	i ordered from freestylextreme for the first time when i saw they had the ken block clothing range and a t shirt which i couldn ' t get anywhere_else in the uk ( sullen ).
M	once i placed the order i received an_email_confirming it and another one telling_me it had been sent using dpd , the courier .
M	it came the next_day and i even had a text from them giving me a rough time it would be delivered !
M	they put lots of cool stuff in with my order too , would recommend them to anyone :-)
M	perfection !
M	precisely what you want in an electronics retailer ; the best service at the lowest_price .
M	this is the third time i have used gameseek , and i will_continue to do so as they are almost always the cheapest , and items are delivered promptly and safely .
M	thanks again gameseek .
M	from finding their clear and simple to use website , right up to delivery , simplygames provided an excellent service .
M	this was especially amazing since they also had the lowest_price for what i was buying ; i will_definitely return for any future gaming purchases .
M	supplement_warehouse has always had low_prices and is very quick and reliable with the delivery of their products .
M	excellent value and super_fast delivery even during the xmas postage frenzy .
M	all i can say is this is a superb company to deal with .
M	i have dealt_with them for a few_years now .
M	they continue to supply me with first_class products at very competitive rates , often cheaper_than what you can get directly from the manufacturer .
M	i have bought mostly for business use .
M	i supply everything from laptops , pc ' s servers monitors , switches , server cabs , ups ' s etc .
M	i supply for domestic , commercial and also local government / schools .
M	all of which are always more_than happy with their purchases .
M	most of the kit is 000_% brand_new so still comes packaged with the original boxes with full manufacturers warranty .
M	for some people , refurb is absolutely fine as its much cheaper again , still back by a limited warranty .
M	my account_manager caroline hendry gives me a first_class service often turning quotes around for me within an_hour .
M	i have had situations where i have bought kit and for whatever_reason the item was out of stock so they have given me a higher_spec more valuable item for the same cost .
M	this has happened on more_than one_occasion .
M	thats just one example of how good these_guys are .
M	my account_manager has an excellent understanding of my needs and also my cusotmers needs .
M	she also has excellent technical skills .
M	there is also a fantastic technical_team who can talk to you on any level should you need to run anything past them .
M	i would also like to commend the accounts_department .
M	tracy houston has also helped_me out in the past being_able to send over all my account activity so that i can keep up to scatch with all my paperwork .
M	it all amounts to a friendly , efficient service .
M	the whole package really takes the hassle out of purchasing equipment .
M	i cannot recommend them enough .
M	you dont need to go anywhere_else .
M	found exactly_what i was looking for .
M	fast service .
M	again !
M	i haven ' t had any trouble_finding supplements on sw . com .
M	they seem to have everything .
M	they are great to shop around with , the only problem is shipping adds a lot to the final cost .
M	factor that in and you can find some great deals .
M	don ' t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
M	because it ' s not .
M	it ' s at_least 00p / minute .
M	in the 0 years i have been with o0 there wan ' t 0 month that i paid the supposed and agreed monthly package price .
M	you are going to pay at_least Â£_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
M	and you will call these numbers because it ' s raining you don ' t have a landline and its just a short call to edf energy anyway ... bullshit .
M	and boy they know this very well .
M	this is where their business lies .
M	bastards .
M	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
M	i mean they do take out a new contract with o0 don ' t they deserve some discount as against to those who just walked in from nowhere with no history with o0 at all ?
M	i have been with them for 0 years and i wanted to upgrade as usual 0 month early .
M	but now i can go eff my self and shove up teh 0 year up my a $$ becuase now we have this brand_new brainstorm of a 00 year_old executive from o0 called refresh and " be more dog " bullshit .
M	i cannot get any discount .
M	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
M	he could be a serialkiller for all we know and i am listed in the same category .
M	it ' s simple .
M	get the phone you want , pay cash and get a pay as you go sim from any network it doesn ' t matter just don ' t get an o0 pay_monthly package because you will regret it .
M	i walked in the other day and the kid (!)
M	in the branch called me " boss .
M	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
M	we don ' t want halifax executives and managers to lose their jobs now do we ?
M	i am from europe and a company like this would not last for 0 months there .
M	absolutely_ridiculous people at customer " service " completely clueless .
M	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
M	what the hell is this a construction site ??
M	lies all around about broadband speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
M	all in all i am not surprised .
M	the sole reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
M	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
M	want your card terminals to be installed in a manner which breaks health and safety regulations ?
M	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
M	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
M	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?
M	want to be charged for goods you never received nor signed for to be then declined refunds ?
M	want to wait 0 months for simple complaints and queries to be replied to , to just be told your complaint has been declined !!
M	?
M	then payment_sense is the one for you .
M	my advice is pay the extra penny a transaction and use a reputable firm that deal with technical break downs within 0 hours and are polite and helpful .
M	if i could give less_than 0 star , i would have .
M	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
M	would recommend no hassle , stress_free process
M	so ...
M	i ordered my dslr on a monday_afternoon , slightly irritated that i wouldn ' t have it by the time i went away on wednesday_afternoon ( i had the delivery address as my work so i wouldn ' t miss the courier when away ) - but it was totally worth it for the fact that i ' d saved so much money over purchasing from a uk retailer .
M	in fact , it was cheaper to buy brand_new from digital_rev than it was to buy used on ebay / dp forums .
M	well , much to my surprise and joy the camera turned_up on the wednesday_morning and i was able to collect from work and take it away with me !
M	it was impressive watching the dhl_tracking status update from_hong_kong to germany , from germany to london and from london to the north_west in less_than a day ( it was dispatched on the tuesday ).
M	i really couldn ' t be_happier .
M	it ' s come with the digital_rev warranty , which i ' d heard people were wary of due to shipping times etc ... my mind is now at rest on that front .
M	the product was extremely well_packaged and is exactly_what you ' d get if purchasing from your local curry ' s - all usual accessories , english paperwork etc .
M	stop thinking about buying from them and just do it , it ' s a great way to keep the costs reasonable on an otherwise piss - taking hobby ( when it comes to uk pricing , the hobby itself is obviously great ).
M	hope this helps someone , mainly because - and i don ' t want this to come out racist in any way - i ' m obviously british .
M	i read some reviews that were either penned by someone whose first language isn ' t english or by someone whose is but they clearly have no regard for spelling and grammar .
M	it ' s easy to dismiss those reviews as so many nefarious websites will review themselves to give false scores .
M	i ' m confident that ' s not going on here , my experience followed the same path as all the other positive_reviews i ' d heard about them and i ' m beginning to think that the negative_reviews are from people who ' re bitter about us not paying vat with dr ... seriously , what ' s with everyone blowing a gasket that i ' m buying it cheaper_than they are ??
M	they can buy it here too !
M	i don ' t buy into this " morally grey " rubbish they preach , it ' s not illegal to import these from abroad and the items are going through customs fair and square .
M	do these same people go on holiday and not purchase anything ?
M	no memory_cards from spain ?
M	no ipod from florida mall ?
M	etc .
M	get over it .
M	enjoy your purchases , i am .
M	managed to get some great shots of my brother - in - laws gig that i didn ' t think i ' d have the camera in time for , so we ' re all happy .
M	i ' ll give a very general review of their services .
M	i ' ll avoid going into specifics of what laptop specs i ordered .
M	ordered a laptop with relatively high spec for light gaming , media consumption and postgrad work .
M	i needed it in time before i relocated for my studies .
M	as such , i opted for the fast track service for an extra Â£_00 .
M	their expected build times given on the website at the time indicated that they were very busy .
M	i accepted the cost as a fair price for the rush service that i required .
M	the fast track service stated that it would be dispatched within 0 working_days .
M	mine was dispatched on the fourth working day .
M	i was impressed , but hoped that they did not rush the testing and quality_control phases ..
M	packing was very good .
M	the laptop was encased with foam pieces inside a cardboard_box designed to hold laptops .
M	the power cables were also in the same box , within some foam .
M	this box was then within another oversized box with foam pieces to take up the empty space .
M	the laptop arrived with plastic sheets protecting the cover and screen from scratches .
M	the laptop itself was very well built .
M	i immediately inspected it for the build_quality when i received it .
M	the only problem i found was with the plastic casing around the screen - it seems not to be ' meeting ' together properly by about half a millimetre in one area .
M	this was very minor as i am usually quite scrupulous .
M	one would not even notice it unless you pay very very close attention to it .
M	it does not affect the aesthetics or the performance of the laptop either .
M	thinking about it , it might not even be a problem at all .
M	a previous reviewer mentioned finger marks on the inside of the battery ' s metallic - faced compartment .
M	i can corroborate his findings as i also have some inside mine .
M	i do not personally consider this to be a problem .
M	you can probably rub it off with some alcohol .
M	the laptop runs fine .
M	very fast on startup .
M	no bloatware , quiet operation .
M	no_problems so far .
M	very good value for money for a given spec compared to ready - made systems offered on the high_street .
M	downside is the lack of choice for higher - end laptop cases .
M	their website is very clear .
M	when selecting components the overall price adjusts accordingly so you can work out how much it costs .
M	everything that i wanted to know was on their website .
M	order was slightly delayed for some reason .
M	phoned them up and a gentleman apologised and had it send that day .
M	arrived next_day .
M	i think they upgraded me to 00hr next_day due to the delay in processing .
M	other than that i cannot_praise their packing of the bottle enough .
M	the box is so sturdy .
M	i have a lot of foam void filler peanuts to play with now .
M	looking_forward to good transactions with them in the future .
M	a simple online ordering service culminating in a thorough and satisfying customer experience .
M	my girlfriend loved the flowers and chocolates .
M	the item was delivered one day before arranged , and the delivery guy was really nice , he arrived when he said he would do .
M	best price on the internet .
M	would recommend .
M	their prices are almost always the lowest , huge_variety of products and the amount of free_stuff they give away in incredible .
M	i get my dog_food from here as it ' s a competitive price and has free delivery when buying in bulk
M	got a good deal on iams dog_food and was delivered in a couple of days
M	great service , fast postage , quality products , thank_you
M	just one of the best company ' s out there , always fast delivery , top quality
M	will always use again
M	they always have a good selection of items and so easy to order online !
M	i had purchased my blackberry from the store , my blackberry had a manufacturing_fault so this had to be taken in for ' servicing ', they advised me that this would be back to me in 0 weeks .
M	0 weeks_later i had heard_nothing , i contacted them and the lady i spoke to was really rude and said that it ' s not their problem and it will still be a further 0 weeks , they never offered me a curtosy phone and when i had asked for my money back for a months line_rental as i have not been using the blackberry package they said this was not their fault so they arent going to refund me .
M	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !
M	so my girlfriend ordered me chocolates for today , 00 / 00 /_0000 and i found that the truffles expired on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	she got them custom made online on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	this is disgusting service , she paid her hard_earned money only to have expired chocolates delivered .
M	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
M	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
M	* update * it has been sorted , they said the old box was used by_accident .
M	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset .... as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
M	lol
M	awfuly awful service .
M	i cannot begin to vent my anger about these people .
M	all they do is lie and when you call back they pretend it never happened .
M	cannot_believe i wasted Â£_000 on these_guys .
M	i would have much rather paid Â£_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
M	definitely have to expose these criminals .
M	i ordered on the sunday , they sent on the monday , i recieved on the tuesday , the day the game was released .
M	very pleased .
M	also very cheap , and payment went through paypal , much_quicker_than having to enter all your card_details .
M	00 / 00 .
M	booked a parcel and i was given the collection time between 00 noon till 0 . 00 pm
M	waited all this time and no one turn_up to collect my parcel .
M	contacted to interparcel .
M	and what ?
M	shocking custemer service .
M	complete_joke
M	then i decided to stop sending parcels with interparcel . never ever agein
M	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
M	if you want reliablelty stay_away from interparcel
M	graet custemer service , i get all i need in seconds and she made it very easy .
M	thanks to catherine .
M	will definetly cary on working with parcel0go
M	i went with the sports bike shop as the web_site was well_laid_out and was easy to use and i could pay with pay_pal .
M	i didn ' t find them any cheaper for the item i was after it was the web_site that closed the deal .
M	id say the cost of shipping is still good considering im getting 00 lbs + at a time with other things .
M	i could use a discount_code once in awhile being i spend $_000_+ a month or less
M	hifi_tower were helpful and professional from start to finish .
M	pre_- sale support was great !
M	delivery was only 0 days from when i pushed the button and my new hifi system is a dream .
M	will be coming_back very soon !
M	thanks hifi - tower !
M	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it ' s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn ' t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0 weeks !
M	it ' s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it ' s an inconvenience .
M	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
M	after an easy price_match and quick shipping , i just made my second purchase from supplement_warehouse .
M	do your research , and if you ' re able to find a supplement cheaper anywhere_else , they ' ll match it plus an extra 0 %.
M	i have been a vodafone customer for more_than 00 years , great company !
M	i have shopped at all the major brand and have finally found one that offers great value for money all the time and most_importantly great food !
M	i have been using viziononline for more_than 0 years now , amazing guys to work with could not recommend them enough !
M	!
M	i have bought from e_- outdoor in the past as their prices have been the cheapest , and the dispatch time and service is second to none .
M	what really inspired me to write this review is the fact they were able to order a single pair of shoes just for me .
M	it was a color and a size they didn ' t have in stock but they were able to get me a pair .
M	really impressed by their dedication to their customers and now i will not look_elsewhere for any outdoor products .
M	bought from them a few_times and will_continue to buy from them .
M	prices are the best around , product query emails are answered_quickly .
M	items are dispatched quickly and the delivery takes a few_days .
M	items are well_packaged .
M	will_continue to buy from this store again and again
M	last_year i bought something from wiggle , which turned_out to be too much hassle due to the courier company they used .
M	my stuff came damaged and took a week for city_link to get their heads out and deliver .
M	i was a little cautious_about buying from again but then i read that they had changed their delivery courier .
M	my products arrived quickly and undamaged .
M	my opinion has now changed to a positive and i will be buying from wiggle again , as their prices for some products cannot be_beaten
M	i ' ve used sportpursuit many_times now .
M	i originally only wanted to buy some vivobarefoot shoes via this website but the other great sales drew me in to buy more .
M	never had any_problems with them , they have always been quick to reply and my deliveries have always been on time .
M	i will_continue to use this company and would recommend to all ( but be sure to read up how it works / delivery times )
M	i needed to clear away my old cd ' s and dvd ' s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
M	wasn ' t too impressed when i made the order on some of the prices but the total was over Â£_000 so i went_ahead and used the free courier service .
M	they then took over a month to even acknowledge that they had the order even_though it was couriered in , which i find strange given the order would have been with them the same day it was sent .
M	i then got an_email_saying that they were only paying me Â£_000 as some of the cd ' s on the order i hadn ' t sent .
M	i emailed to tell them this was incorrect and as it was couriered in then they courier must have lost some boxes .
M	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .
M	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd ' s and what were they going to do about it .
M	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an_email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
M	i took this to mean that i was getting my order value in full so waited to get the new cheque in the post .
M	0 month later , 0 further emails unresponded to and i still_haven ' t got the other cheque .
M	think i now need to work out how to take them to trading_standards .
M	avoid this company like the plague ..... h
M	im waiting for almost 0 months and they didnt unlocked my iphone and since 00 / 00 / 00 they didnt answer my questions and so , i can ' t get my money back .
M	they not professionals .
M	i lost my money !
M	i sent this message at facebook and they simply erase it
M	good prices and products , shocking delivery service .
M	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0 weeks .
M	when i initially started using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
M	now i kind of expect it ' ll take a while and order way before i run out .
M	i called 0 days ago , got put on hold for 00mins than gave up and emailed instead .
M	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
M	it was apparently delivered to a neighbour .
M	it wasn ' t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
M	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
M	three days and 0 emails and still no reply !
M	just an_automated email_saying they will reply in 00_hours .
M	good products , non_existent after care and stay well clear of hermes because they will not discuss any_problems with you , they refer you back to myprotein , who dont reply !
M	!
M	ever since my first order from shopto . net ( a long time ago ) they ' ve always have a great delivery service and also good prices on the pre_- order games they sell ...
M	the recent game fear 0 was the best ever delivery i ordered from shopto i ordered at 00 : 00 and by 00 : 00 item sent and lo and behold item arrives on my door matt at 00 :_00am next_day !
M	!
M	absolute awesome web_site would recommend to everyone ...
M	0 * from me ....
M	first time i heard of simplygames and wasnt sure about it , researched online read a few negative_comments did not make me feel any better buying from them .
M	but i placed my order anyway because the most i am going to lose is 00 odd pounds .
M	however !
M	i am totally stunned !
M	i placed my order at around 0ish , and i received my hitman ( xbox_000 ) next_day !
M	ok the box of the game is abit pressed , i guess they can do better in their packaging and give it abit more padding .
M	nevertheless , i am delighted !
M	not to mention their games is one of the cheapest on the internet !
M	i would definitely shop and recommend it to friends !
M	buying our first house also meant buying our first kitchen_appliances , so i wanted the process to be smooth as possible - thankfully ao exist !
M	after doing some research of various products and prices , ao . com came out on top every time .
M	the next_day free delivery was a huge bonus , and they deliver on bank_holiday friday / monday .
M	i picked my delivery day and on the chosen day was given a 0 hour time_slot .
M	the products turned_up in the first minute of the time_slot .
M	the delivery men were good at transporting the products into the house without any_issues , and were very friendly .
M	overall i ' d say its the best internet shop i ' ve used with the best customer_service i ' ve ever received , with the added_bonus of having the best prices around .
M	i even had to swap the washing_machine ( due to my poor measuring skills earlier in the week ) and it was a painless process and had an_alternative washing_machine the next_day !
M	will_definitely use again and will be encouraging family to use !
M	after doing a little digging around for some frontline for dogs , i came_across petfleas . co . uk .
M	i had not heard of them before but found some excellent reviews and also noticed they are a vmd accredited retailer , so i went_ahead and purchased the product .
M	as well as being the cheapest across all sites i checked , they also did free delivery .
M	the item arrived in 0 days , very impressed .
M	overall an easy transaction and a great service .
M	i will be returning to purchase more products in the future .
M	thank_you kindly
M	products dispatched within 00_hours ?
M	nope , ordered a pmdg product on tuesday , and now its saturday , still no game or no notification on where the game is .
M	no email telling_me whether its been dispatched , no email giving me a refund when i asked for it , purely unacceptable and they basically lied to me !
M	i ' m going to stick with [_external reference ], more_expensive ( like Â£ 0 more ) but at_least i know i will get it !
M	Â£_00 pounds for the game , and it ' s still not here !
M	edit_: forgive my anger , but to pay Â£_00 and still be waiting for 0 days after ordering , i cannot forgive gameseek for this , and i hope it comes by monday or i ' m getting a refund .
M	can ' t beat prices , and a great selection .
M	never shopping at gnc again !
M	found the car i was looking for and checked it history using 00 000 from my mobile phone .
M	thanks
M	a fantastic business contact database much_better_than microsoft crm .
M	the invoicing software is great and really easy to use , simply the best .
M	sitefront is great for making a free website .
M	all in all the best software for business in the uk .
M	happy to give a testimonial anytime .
M	huge_amount of information .
M	iphone and web great !
M	my product did not arrive on time and they had not replied to two of my e_- mails .
M	i decided to call consortium as they had not sent an e_- mail to me confirming that delivery had taken place .
M	i rang them on monday to which they confirmed they would call me back on that day , to which they did not .
M	i called again on tuesday and was promised a call back within half an_hour .
M	they called back within half an_hour to confirm that a royal_mail delivery driver was being investigated with my product being with that driver and they could not confirm my product reached the depot .
M	the man i spoke to said that a new product would be dispatched by express delivery to me and would arrive the very next_day , which it did .
M	although my customer_service experience wasn ' t the greatest , they did their utmost to offer an explanation and to get a new product to me the very next_day hence the five_star_rating .
M	my product was delivered as_described and they delivered my product within the timeframe specified .
M	highly_recommended and i would definitely order from them again .
M	i ordered a pair of matte black polarised ray - ban wayfarers and i had a slight_issue in terms of delivery .
M	i changed my day of delivery to the next_day and unfortunately , dpd , managed to send my sunglasses back to the main depot instead of the local_depot meaning i had to wait an extra day for my sunglasses .
M	red_hot sunglasses were brilliant and their customer_service was second to none and made sure i received my sunglasses and gave me an explanation as to what had happened .
M	i would highly_recommend this company as the delivery issue was no fault of their own but they still did as best as they could to offer their support and chase up the issue as quickly as possible .
M	great company , great customer_service and thoroughly_recommended .
M	thanks you for the speedy_delivery of my promotional pens and keyrings .
M	they are exactly as i wanted them to be .
M	i will be using promo_parrot for future orders .
M	fantastic company to deal with , always looked after and nothings ever to much_trouble .
M	quick delivery on orders .
M	i ordered a christmas_gift_card on the 0th of december .
M	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
M	hof offered no solutions to this on the phone or by email .
M	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
M	now they tell me they can ' t give me a refund on the gift_card - even_though it ' s missing with royal_mail ( royal_mail didn ' t get it until the 00th ).
M	if they do find it , what good is it to me now ?
M	!
M	i ' ve had sky for 0 and a half months and all of a sudden my signal went one night , sky are saying they cant come out as its a council property and there not insured ??
M	the council won ' t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it ' s an_absolute_joke , the customer_service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same_thing as in there reading off a script , that ' s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
M	if i ' d had know they were this bad i would never of gone with them , i ' m not paying for something what i can ' t use so if sky can ' t stick to there side of the agreement never can i !!
M	!
M	please anyone thinking of joining sky don ' t as you will be disappointed , very
M	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
M	thanks
M	the company is an ubsulte joke , there quick to get a uk_based call_centre to try and keep you with them but soon as you have a problem your get through to someone in india who cant understand i word your saying , they sound like robots and keep repeating the same_thing as if there reading off a script .
M	they talk over you and make you irate , i work in customer_service myself and find it hard to understand different uk acents over the phone at times so i dont see how the orange exeutives feel that there indian_call centresare usefull , i just cant_wait to see orange go bust in a few_years when everyone doesnt use them , ive been waiting over 0 weeks formy problem to be resolved and stil not heard_anything ,,
M	i ' ve been using quidco for 0 years and earned a lot with great offers .
M	at first it seemed just too good to be true , but we trust nectar and they pay us in points ; quidco pays with real money .
M	the retailers want your business and pay quidco for a referral ( like running an ad of the tube or any website ) which quidco pays to its members .
M	the few_times things have gone wrong , their customer_service has been the best , better_than many uk retailers .
M	i wouldn ' t use anyone_else !
M	five - stars all the way .
M	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble opinion .
M	the pattern that has emerged is that once a bad review is left then you get a follow_up of good reviews of similar sort .
M	well here is my experience but before i start if you believe that businesses should be fair non discriminatory please boycott @ ocado in the name of what dr . luther king stood for .
M	well see why .
M	evidence collated after contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
M	so why in modern britain ?
M	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
M	just read for yourself comments on other review sites , company has a draconian culture of ruthlessly segmenting / profiling their customers based on flawed assumptions , customers sent mould bread or best by products , orders cancelled if they presume your are of minority ethnic background ( of which their pathetic_excuse is that you want to export there already expired products ) is that how the cater for the needs of if you the supposedly top 0 %?
M	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer_service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
M	today i vote with my feet and raise awareness so you are not humiliated as this cannot be accepted .
M	look through the statistics it is basically self explanatory .
M	i won a competition from oks and the service was really great .
M	it was fast and clear .
M	i got my key and i ' m really happy with it .
M	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
M	honestly don ' t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
M	( using instant , which is the only useful thing as you cant spontaneously watch a movie if it takes like 0 days to arrive )
M	the whole_process took 00_hours !
M	i printed off the forms , packed the envelope with my htc hero and sent it off .
M	money was in my account in 00_hours .
M	very impressed with the service and the price i got was competitive with other_sites .
M	there are a lot of sites out there offering maybe Â£ 0 more but i have heard some terrible things .
M	definitely stick to a reputable company like mazuma .
M	can ' t recommend it highly_enough .
M	you should buy from magicmadhouse because they stock all you need for magic the gathering and they deliver and its free delivery over Â£_00 they also do other card games as well .
M	just come back from a great day of quad_biking and rage_buggies organised by chill sauce .
M	the company are professional and organise wicked events at a reasonable_price .
M	had a great time , thanks !!!
M	!
M	after finding some well_priced priced i booked with this company handing_over just under Â£ 0000 for 0 tickets to thailand .
M	a week_later i get an_email_saying my tickets were unable to be issued with no explanation unless i phoned back by 0 the next_day .
M	phoning around midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
M	i asked for a refund which over 00 days_later has still not arrived despite many correspondents .
M	no replys to emails and very unhelpful on the phone .
M	i went for the dozen luxury red_roses .
M	really impressive .
M	it was even nicer to find out afterwards that she had never been sent flowers before , so thanks serenata_flowers for helping me to make her day :)
M	superb fast service , a huge choice of quality engagement_rings that i could not find on the high_street at a very respectable price , many_thanks .
M	will use diamondsfactory . co . uk again for my wedding_rings !
M	russell clarke
M	i constantly wonder_how these_guys are in business at all .
M	arrogant customer_service .
M	unclear terms and conditions .
M	i will throw a party when this company shuts down .
M	i had a query over delivery on a bank_holiday , and i got a response the same day from the ceo assuring my delivery terms .
M	can ' t ask for better service .
M	bought a pair of the ' mule ' slippers for my mother ' s birthday .
M	really impressed with the quality of the slippers as well as the time it took for them to be delivered ( ordered on the 00th and they arrived the very next_day !)
M	i ' ll definitely be ordering from them again in the near_future ...
M	thanks again !
M	i ' ve only been with orange for two years ( after being with o0 for 0 + years - bad service , but i ' ll leave all that for another review ).
M	orange have been fantastic so far and i feel really valued as a customer .
M	their customer_services team are great , and usually respond rather quickly to my queries .
M	definitely_recommend !
M	good price paid for my phone .... was paid in 0 working_days .
M	i ' ve used this service 0 times previousd always got the same reliable service .
M	stayed for the night friendly staff and fantastic parking convenience of a large brand hotel with the staff friendliness of a family run business
M	got delivered item next_day .
M	had a fault , next_day delivered replacement with stamped envelope to return the faulty item !!!!
M	i can not recall when was the last time i had such an amazing customer_service experience !!!!
M	actually if i ever had !!!!
M	will use them again ?
M	- yes !!!
M	!
M	had been emailed 00_%_discount_code which been used to get a helmet .
M	order arrived within 0 days .
M	no_complains
M	item has been delivered next_day for 00p postage upgrade
M	even it says cut_off time by 0pm for the next_day delivery ordered 0 . 00 and still got it the next_day .
M	the keys i got was all good and working it was soo good that i wanted to buy more but i had no cash to buy more with :( but when i next get some i will get more
M	we have saved loads of money in the past from this site .
M	it have also given us loads of good advice when needed from their forums ..
M	we applaud oak_furniture solutions for their excellent custome rservice team .
M	we spoke to both sam and john who both were helpful and sorted our initial issues out
M	fast delivery , good product , good customer_service , comes with warranty etc brilliant fantastic couldnt get a better price or service
M	turned_up when they said , phone was already to go .
M	and most_importantly they were cheaper_than going directly to ee .
M	sent the phone on the friday , had the money on the tuesday .
M	cant_fault it .
M	my first review .
M	this moment will go down in history probably .
M	emma was fab !
M	couldn ' t help more .
M	thats why i use parcel 0 go for my business x
M	a few_months_ago i was looking for a new place to shop from , decided on shopto . net and zavvi . com , so i tested both by placing an order , then immediately requested a refund .
M	shopto . net sent the funds back next business day , while zavvi . com did not .
M	and getting items next business day from shopto . net is great , i will have to try them with pre_- orders .
M	great company , competitive_pricing combined with flexibility and professionalism .
M	i would recommend lopa for any paris to london removal .
M	i ordered the kangertech aerotank mega and it was delivered very quickly ( including a bank_holiday ) at a brilliant price .
M	this is my 0nd purchase from here and wont be the last .
M	reasonable prices , fast_shipping , good products , cant ask for more
M	if your looking to sell your old_mobile these_guys are definitely one to watch .
M	best prices on the net .
M	even out did cex on my old phone .
M	not always the best but better_than most
M	i waited in all day ( 0am until 0 :_00pm and someone the rest of the night in case they decided to show up ) and no parcel , only to check the tracking at 00 :_00pm that they ' attempted delivery ' at 0 :_00pm and no - one was there so they left a card for re - delivery .
M	no attempt , no card , nothing .
M	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
M	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
M	do not use this company if there is another option .
M	excellent items , quick delivered without delay , will recommended it to my friends and family !
M	thanks you so much for the items !
M	trials arrived within 00_hours , finished glasses turned_up three days after i ' d placed the order and they look great .
M	the idea of using specsavers or optical_express ahead of this lot melts my brain to be honest .
M	immediate delivery and they stock absolutely everything .
M	had a pair of headphones that developed a fault - my credit note was processed immediately and a new pair despatched the same day .
M	best customer_service i ' ve experienced in years
M	i ' ve always wanted a baracuta jacket but never got round to buying one .
M	at this price i couldn ' t resist .
M	super_fast delivery and great service .
M	i sent my order via special delivery ( i paid extra ) so that it would arrive by 00 . 00pm the next_day , i received an_email to confirm delivery about an_hour ago , with payment being made today !
M	fantastic service .
M	my only concern was the live_chat , i have tried a few_times and never anyone there , however the positive was that i emailed them and had a reply within an_hour so that made up for it .
M	thanks again !
M	was really impressed as this was the first time i ' ve ever used a service like this on the internet .
M	sent my package recorded_delivery just before new year and recieved payment during the first week of january !
M	what was even better was that the quote they provided was paid in full !
M	would definetly recommend to everyone .
M	very pleased kept me in the picture with email and text in regards to shipping thanks x
M	the hard_disk drive was very well_packed and protected , thank_you very much
M	excellent online shop , finally i was able to find and buy here in the uk hardware only available in the us , the cost of the components is reasonable and the shipping cost is cheap , very good , thank_you very very much .
M	kind_regards
M	searched for product , found it , ordered it , paid for it , tracked the delivery , with in a few_days the goods arrived in perfect_condition .
M	a literally faultless service .
M	thank_you .
M	i called them up after they were supposed to be closed , they still picked_up and helped_me with my order and got the sunglasses that i couldn ' t find anywhere_else sent off the next_day by special delivery !
M	very impressed cheapest i found on internet delivered straight_away excellent product would recommend dvd_player to anyone .
M	fast delivery pre order arrived a day early !!
M	and Â£_00 cheaper_than anyone_else !
M	i ' ve ordered many components from aria as their prices are generally lower_than ebuyer or ocuk , and they often have some very good special deals .
M	never had a problem , delivery is always quick .
M	worst retailer i have ever come_across .
M	ordered a tv because it was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	big_mistake .
M	has been 0 weeks and it still_hasn ' t arrived .
M	i have called every week and got the same response " we will send you an_email in the next few_days confirming your delivery date ".
M	even worse , they dare to charge Â£_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
M	please everyone , save_yourself the hassle and get your tv from somewhere reputable , the tenner or so which you might save is simply not worth it .
M	we booked a bar guide with these_guys as we have heard some of the better places in budapest can be hard to track down !
M	there were 0 of us in our group and at Â£_00 each it was an_absolute bargain .
M	we were originally thinking it may be a little awkward having a stranger with us but any_issues we thought of instantly disappeared as soon as we met our_guide kinga , she was just great !
M	not only did she guide us seamlessly around this amazing city to the types of bars we wanted to see , the conversation was effortless and she really made our big night out in budapest great !
M	the company sent us texts to let us know what times to be ready for and everything was as smooth as you could wish for !
M	although we only saw a small part of their repertoire , i am sure their other services will be just as good .
M	thanks guys and thanks again to kinga ; we hope to keep in touch !
M	my advice : don ' t think_twice , book these_guys !
M	without a doubt the best nutrition site available !
M	great products , great prices all delivered quickly with no hassle !
M	their reward schemes are great too , particularly when recommending friends ...
M	i cannot_praise them enough !
M	having used maximuscle & phd items previously ( amongst others ) i can safely_say i will be sticking with tpw from now on ....
M	thanks guys !
M	used igadgetrecycled to sell an old phone .
M	their service was very quick with the phone being sent off on the friday and fully processed on the monday .
M	would highly_recommend .
M	i have now placed quite a few orders with vesternet and have been more_than delighted with the customer_service .
M	the guides and tutorials on the site have been a great reference for setting_up my system and customer_services have been extremely_helpful with answering the technical questions i had .
M	really good service all_round .
M	website is easy to order through and had emails all the way through the order and delivery process .
M	would highly_recommend to others
M	really great service .
M	have been using for years now and never had any_problems .
M	product quality is top_notch and the delivery turnaround is the best of any online company i have used .
M	always next_day delivery and give specific times of when to expect the delivery meaning you don ' t need to sit around waiting all day
M	tried many well_known , high - street brands , and they don ' t even come close to the products bulk_powders supply !
M	very efficient shipping and great value for money .
M	you can also use my referral_code rm000000 when registering for Â£ 0 off your first order !
M	easy to order .
M	great when you are with several people that cant decide !
M	very simple and tidy interface .
M	brilliant .
M	i was initially pleased with the service provided .
M	a little annoying to receive newsletters / specials a few_times a week .
M	please have a better sign_up option box ( maybe unchecked by default )
M	always had a good experience .
M	anything i ' ve ever ordered seems to be at the best price around .
M	haven ' t ever spoken to customer_service .
M	all seem great quality products at brilliant price .
M	free next_day delivery ( actually took less_than 00_hours !).
M	was passed to a very knowledgeable manager for advice which helped_me a great deal .
M	very pleased and would use again .
M	i ' ve just joined parcels 0 go and am amazed at how helpful they have been so far .
M	thank_you rowan for helping me resolve my problem :)!
M	i ordered one of their bundles online and from the off , the service was rubbish .
M	sent only part of the order despite telling_me i signed for it all !
M	the bits they forgot to send were the actual camera and bag !
M	phone every day for a week and was promised a call back each day .
M	this never happened .
M	finally spoke to a manager and was assured a call back but again never happened .
M	asked for full_refund to which she said we will refund you in full .
M	i checked what they were refunding and she said Â£_000 .
M	i had paid Â£_000 !
M	!
M	the customer_services at this company is a total joke and in a way i am glad it all fell through as i found the package cheaper elsewhere .
M	avoid unless you enjoy hassle
M	i always try and fly ba where i can .
M	subject to acts of god ( thanks for the volcano !)
M	ba nearly always leave on time or within an acceptable time_frame .
M	the planes are always clean and the staff on board could not be friendlier .
M	they are also very helpful .
M	maybe not the cheapest about but then you get what you pay for and i have always had a good experience with them .
M	flying with them again next month .
M	both online and in store , i can fault argos .
M	it makes shopping so easy .
M	i really like their reserve and collect , takes the hassle out of a drive into_town to find the item not in stock .
M	that said , its very rare an item is out of stock .
M	00 / 00
M	really happy with the service tesco provides .
M	never had to complain .
M	drivers always very helpful ( even in horrendous rain !)
M	when they dont have an item i order , the replacement is nearly always acceptable .
M	keep up the good work tesco !
M	i have been with o0 for years and years .
M	always found them to be very reliable and customer_service is great .
M	i have had numerous phones from them as well as various different sim_cards & deals .
M	well_done o0 !
M	great communication , thorough info provided , and a fir deal done .
M	nothing much more to say , just happened in the way it needed to , where competitors that i enquired with seemed intent on making the process hard !
M	my 00 months with vodafone were excellent bar the issue with not putting insurance on my phone which was resolved within a couple of calls to them and receiving a call or 0 back to resolve the matter ; however my next 00 months have been littered with dissatisfaction and stress .
M	the customer_service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more_than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave me incorrect_information over the phone which_resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i ' ll pay the other half .... that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
M	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i ' m sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
M	not happy in the slightest !!
M	!
M	chose big bus london tour as they offered a 00 hour ticket which was great for my 0 night stay .
M	the buses were clean and comfortable , were very frequent and there were stops close to all the major attractions .
M	i mainly used the red route with the live guides .
M	the guides were friendly and helpful , provided an interesting and often humerous commentary .
M	one guide apologised for some traffic delays and ensured that we were provided with rain macs when it started to rain .
M	i also enjoyed the free river cruise along the thames !
M	thankyou big bus , i had a great time !
M	i don ' t pay for next_day delivery ( as it is a waste of money with any company ) and it always arrives within 0 - 0 days .
M	i ' ve built up lots of points which have lead to free supplements .
M	people complained about the courier , i ' ve had two problems with the courier ( not affordable , but dhl ) and they have sent me brand_new tubs , within days - free of charge .
M	its the only website i use for supplements !
M	limit your money over anything .. so they can earn interest on it .. avoid
M	i would recommend this company to anyone , they quickly sent me a reasonable quotation via_email within a couple of hours of filling out the form , i sent the item to them and they literally had the package for half a day before i had my money transferred to me .
M	i dealt_with alex and rich , 0 great friendly people .
M	thanks again !
M	really bad customer_service , store manager rude and not helpful ...
M	got all the bits that i wanted , ordered sunday , bits arrived tuesday .
M	great service .
M	organising a stag ?
M	these_guys have got it .
M	i was fussy and they still managed to fit everything i wanted in to my package at very very short_notice .
M	00 idiots running around brighton with no_problems .
M	brilliant .
M	cheers [_name ]!
M	found this website and haven ' t ordered from a different once since .
M	the prices are the lowest on the internet ( shipping is a little more_than others but if you buy in bulk it isn ' t a big deal ).
M	the fast_shipping and freebies added with every purchase really makes this site much more worth it than others .
M	free magazines , free_samples of everything you can think of , low priced supplements , etc .
M	really can ' t be beat .
M	i called printerland on three different occasions while i was trying to sort my businesses dot matrix printer , every time i called the phone was answered within a short_space of time and i was able to deal with 0 person .
M	printerland knew our requirements and were able to match our needs with a printer which has proven to be perfect for our needs .
M	the after sales have been great and as an icing on the cake it was the best price for the printer on the web .
M	a great experience
M	i was / am a business customer with talk_talk .
M	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
M	they are happy to trick you into any contract .
M	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
M	their staff all worship the ground talk_talk walk on and their communication with bt open reach is awful .
M	do not use talk_talk - they are scum .
M	perfect , the delivery arrived earlier_than_expected which is always a bonus .
M	will_definitely be shopping with digitalrev again in the future !
M	:_d .
M	cheap good quality so far ( yn ) and really quick posting
M	i had the dreaded ylod ( yellow light of death ) and i thought that was the end of my ps0 !
M	got in touch with chris booked an_appointment for a few_days_later , dropped my console off with him then an_hour later i got a call from him saying its done !
M	couldn ' t believe_how quick it was and how much of a bargain !
M	would definitely_recommend !
M	and would use again !
M	while searching for the crystal bath for my new home , i luckily found victorian plumbing .
M	was amazed with its wide_range of products and the description which was very helpful in making the decisions .
M	also the customer_service was second to none and the bath was delivered on time .
M	i have recently buy one play station from this site and its really working very smoothly .
M	i am going to buy a one more playstation for my cousin .
M	adverts for selling your mobile have been around for some time .
M	about 0 months_ago i thought i would dig out my old_phones ( which were just lying_around gather dust ) and see if they were worth anything .
M	after some research i decided to use mazuma as they appear to be the largest company doing mobile buybacks and their prices were marginally better_than their competitors .
M	i got Â£_00 for the two old_phones but the best thing was the ease of the service , pop details of your old_phones into the mazuma website , wait for the prepaid_envelope to arrive ( it takes only a couple of days ), pop your phones in the envelope ( in some bubble_wrap ) along with the delivery note and send back .
M	it couldn ' t be easier .
M	a couple of days_later i had the cash in the bank .
M	i now use mazuma to get some cash for my old_mobile whenever i upgrade my phone contract .
M	they are great , well recommendable .
M	once i ' d decided to use quality diamonds i spent a long time assessing their vast_range .
M	i finally chose and ordered a diamond engagement_ring and received prompt confirmation with an estimated_delivery date .
M	the ring was ready a few_days before this and i was given a choice of delivery dates to suit my availability .
M	the ring arrived , as promised , on my chosen date and a few_days_later i popped the question .
M	unfortunately , whilst she said " yes ", the ring turned_out to be a size too big .
M	i contacted quality diamonds and they advised me that i could return the ring to be resized free of charge ( with the exception of the postage back to qd ).
M	i did this and received the resized ring within a week .
M	nick
M	so stag_do in cardiff with the boys .
M	0 nights of pure carnage drinking !
M	guest_list to some of the bigger bars there which came in useful .
M	gorge scrambling was ace though !
M	perfect way to get_rid of a hangover !
M	overall a great weekend and would recommend chilli_sauce to anyone who hasn ' t used them .
M	just plug in your dates , and find available hostels , searchable by price of shared or private_rooms , location , etc .
M	the prices are very reasonable and you pay a percentage online before paying the rest there .
M	one thing they are starting to implement is pictures of room_types and i strongly encourage them to keep doing this - saves on surprises when you get to your hostel !
M	love the reviews , i honestly have no_qualms with this site , and it ' s my go - to every time i ' m travelling .
M	easy to transfer and very less amount u need to pay as service charge
M	great content and easy to use .
M	ordered my new guitar , paid for next_day delivery .
M	i had to phone call them the next_day asking about the order because i received no email to confirm my order .
M	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
M	then the next_day , no email confirmation for when the courier was picking the item from the depot .
M	at the end of the day i had to email them and inquire about the order .
M	it has been sent to the wrong depot therefore i had to wait another day to get my guitar .
M	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
M	it was not my fault and they were supposed to support the entire cost of delivery for this mistake .
M	their replies were always very short and cold .
M	nothing was offered in exchange for this .
M	a friend_recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
M	they need to have systems in place to guarantee that they deliver what they promise .
M	great selection of items and brands on an easy to use website , nice big pictures of what they sell so you can see what your buying .
M	reasonably_priced sale and postage_costs with fast delivery too , all the ingredients you need to get people to use you again i think .
M	the company made my shopping_experience wonderful , finding prices i couldn ' t get anywhere_else and shipping incredibly fast .
M	a must buy for all supplements .
M	online video on how to diagnose the fault , simple easy ordering_process and lots of emails to track progress .
M	excellent service will use again .
M	stag_do to bournemouth was booked with chillisauce , with superb communication and customer_service from anton throughout .
M	we booked accommodation ourselves but the handling of the event booking ( rage_buggies , blind driving , clay pigeons and human table footy ) was fantastic .
M	given the low commission companies like this are on i was amazed at the level of contact from anton , the communications and the easy at which i was able to make last_minute changes when the inevitable drop - outs occurred .
M	will_definitely use these_guys again , although hopefully not for a while , being best - man was hard work - but made a whole lot_easier by chillisauce .
M	thanks again guys , ray .
M	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
M	i will update my review if an adequate explanation is given and the issue is resolved promptly , if it isnt then i would suggest taking your custom elsewhere
M	purchases proceesed extremely quickly , lowest_prices i found and every possible payment solution is available , great site keep up the good work
M	i spent age on internet searching for a replacement quad bike battery at a good price .
M	searched again & came_across this company .
M	they covered a vast_amount of sizes which meant i could get the exact size .
M	i was more_than impressed with the price , especially as it included next_day delivery .
M	i had a couple of questions about the battery which i phoned & asked ' kylie ', which she replied the information friendly & efficiently .
M	i purchased over the phone with kylie , which all went very smoothly & my battery arrived perfectly packaged the next_day .
M	the instructions were easy to follow & the battery works just fine .
M	i am known for being a perfectionist & a bit ' picky ' & i cannot_fault this company in dealing_with my purchase at all .
M	even better is that i save Â£Â£ s from buying anywhere_else .
M	thank_you very much , i shall be constantly recommended you .
M	nice and easy site to use , much_better_than others which are far too busy .
M	seriously cool and user_friendly bit of kit .
M	kicks the teeth out of linnwords and the others

M	anyone who is thinking of ordering any headphones shouldn ' t hesitate for a second to use these_guys .
M	amazing , honest advice / knowledge of products , friendly staff , great delivery service and an impressive range of top quality headphones / earphones .
M	wish all modern day companies were as good as these .
M	at last a company that cares_about their customers as much as their products .
M	can ' t say enough good words about them .
M	what can i say ?
M	a fraction of the price you would pay in any pharmacy or supermarket .
M	quick delivery , received my order within 0 days of ordering .
M	will use again .
M	absolutely awful !
M	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
M	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .
M	another two days pass and guess_what .
M	those frames are also discontinued .
M	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .
M	go to spex0less . com .
M	ordered from them on the monday night and received my glasses on the thursday_morning .

M	i ' m a gamer and at home have a custom_pc , this laptop is awesome for games and in general i get anything from 00 - 000 fps ranging_from medium to high settings , never need to switch to low .
M	ive never considered acer a company to buy from but this has changed everything .

M	cons_: none
M	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
M	this is not the first time ive had issues with these_guys .
M	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
M	i ended_up paying an extra Â£_00 for a garanteed delivery slot .
M	lets_see what happens ...
M	again , please do not use these_guys , i would proberly not order from your company if i know you use dpd as your delivery choice .
M	update_: 00 : 00 - 00 / 0 / 00

M	item was delivered later today buy city_link .
M	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
M	website is simple enough and can ' t complain with the prices , but the service is rubish , its ment to be instant delivery ( email code ) but i had to wait around 0 days , i actualy cancelled my oder because the service was so bad , i won ' t use this site again and have told all my friends to not use it either .
M	thank_you cant_wait to go online and use ur service thank_you for makeing this easy to use
M	pc_specialist rightfully deserves their name , offering relatively cheaper and highly customisable computers than the high_street or any other_retailers .

M	all i have to say is perfect 000_%

M	straight_forward deal , nice and speedy and the chap who dealt_with our application did his absolute very best to ensure i was happy all the way through .
M	john griffith ' s is a real asset to nation - wide and on the whole they are a really respectable and genuine company providing a top service .

M	i was a first time customer and i have to say the game i bought was a preorder ps0 title which was nicely priced compared to the usual shops ( amazon , game , play etc ), the title arrived both quickly and quicker_than_expected , the interface of the website is well_designed and i will be shopping with simply_games again .
M	in fact i have already preorder another 0 titles with them for my ps0
M	ordered cheapest whey on the market , next_day free postage
M	i bought two one stop extremes and they gave me a free nox product !
M	love echo - great delivery , and even dealt_with one of the team on the phone - gave me some great advice .
M	exclusive supplements / favors , ridiculous amounts of samples , great promo ' s , and competitive_prices .
M	even if the price is not competitive , these_guys will beat it with the click of a button .
M	i am more_than impressed with this organization , which is why i will be giving them repeat_business and telling others about them .
M	i found these_guys through word of mouth through one of my friends .
M	have been having a on going battle with vodafone about signal issues and to cut a long_story short they sent me out a new ( reconditioned ) phone that arrives in a plastic_bag and they take the old one away in a plastic_bag .
M	well that one lasted 0 weeks before it packed us so off it went again .
M	chucked in to the plastic_bag then chucked in to the back of a courier van .
M	about 0 weeks_later i have just received a bill for Â£_000 for screen damage .
M	?
M	the screen didn ' t have a scratch on it when it left my hand and went in the plastic_bag .
M	so after about 0 hours on the phone and 0 emails i have been told that it ' s not there problem .
M	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don ' t want to know and have said they want there Â£_000 .
M	i feel that this is a disgusting service , i have been with them for 00 years and will have payed them in the region of Â£_00 , 000_+ with my phone and employes .
M	and this is how they treat you .
M	well vodafone i would like to say that me and all my employees will now be getting orange phones so say good buy to your Â£_000 per_month .
M	morons .
M	had a small error on the booking so i contacted customer_service , a girl named stephanie help me out imediatly .
M	fantastic service she is offering !
M	i will strongly_recommend your company thanx to the staffing of such professionals !
M	book_depository is always my first call for books .
M	i buy a lot of manga ( japanese comics ) and book_depository always have what i need , if it is not in stock then they will do their best to source it for you .
M	their prices are consistently the lowest and more often than not they better amazons prices , which is saying something .
M	i have made over 000 orders with book_depository over about 0 years and am yet to be disappointed by them .
M	amazon . co . uk have the widest selection of products available to buy out of anyone in the uk , as far as i know .
M	in conjunction with the excellent choice , they offer some of the best service in the industry , which is remarkable given the popularity and the amount of orders they must receive every day .
M	i check amazon daily for new deals and price drops since they are consistently updating their website and prices .
M	whenever a new game is coming out i always look to pre_- order with shopto before anyone_else .
M	why ?
M	because they ' re consistently the cheapest and offer the best and most reliable service .
M	every game has been dispatched on time and always arrive on the day , or even early .
M	shopto are # 0 for service bar_none .
M	supplement_warehouse . com is the best web_site ive ever used .
M	it has the easiest checkout system and very affordable products from all the products you are looking for if you are looking for a good deal this is the sight you need . so much free items all you have to do is buy one thing
M	love this guys art - have got about 00 different canvas up in my flat which i have bought over the last 00 years .
M	highly_recommend checking the website for some quirky , unique and colourful artwork
M	i â ve been using supplement_warehouse for a few_years now .
M	i have told tons of people and i give them such high praise that many say â you should work for them â but i speak so highly of them because they are seriously a great company !
M	with great prices and fast_shipping you can â t go_wrong with supplement_warehouse !

M	this is a review of my experience of ' optical_express customer_service ' relating to the refund of a deposit for laser_eye_surgery .
M	i had lasik eye_surgery over 0 months_ago .
M	on the day of my first aftercare appointment my wife accompanied me and was tested to see if she was suitable for the same procedure i had had .
M	she was , and so the clinician pressurised us into making the holding deposit payment of Â£_000 and booking the procedure then and there .
M	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
M	the clinician advised us that ' yes this would get paid back up to 00hrs before the surgery '.
M	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
M	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant documentation and t &_c ' s , but were advised ' don ' t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any_questions that she may have '.
M	since then i have suffered many acute side - effects including severe dry - eye ( waking me up 0 - 0 times a night with my eye - lids fused together ), ghosting & glare ( making me unable to drive at night ) pain in my eyes , and hugely variable clarity of vision that has meant i have been off work .
M	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
M	clearly , having faced these side - effects we decided that it was not wise for my wife to go_ahead with the same procedure .
M	however , we were informed by optical_express that the deposit made is non - refundable and that they only return the money if cancellations are received within_00hrs of booking .
M	for the last 0 months i have written letters , had hugely frustrated phone - calls and am now at my wit ' s end .
M	i still keep getting the company line from their staff , ' due to our terms and conditions this deposit is non - refundable '.
M	these are the same t &_c ' s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c ' s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c ' s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
M	so my advice is simple .
M	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
M	then , and only then , with 000_% certainty should you book a procedure and pay the deposit , as once it ' s paid , you will never see it again .
M	very well_packaged .
M	buying bulbs online left me fearing the light touch of the couriers .
M	paid for the insurance but needn ' t of bothered .
M	turned_up on time and we can now see at night too !
M	they don ' t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
M	lots of hidden_fees , 00_% final value 00p here 00p there paypal .
M	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
M	avoid
M	in store is generally ok . online are useless , loose items send unsigned cheques and take 0 weeks to process orders
M	sent over 000 phones to this company never had a problem
M	i recently used hermes after giving up on them for some years for shockingly rubbish service , it took 0 days ( not including them picking it up on the saturday ) for them to deliver a pc tower which they also managed to dent in the process .
M	the side of this pc tower is 0mm steel so god_knows_how badly it must have been looked after for them to " achieve " that .
M	luckily the buyer was happy enough to live with it as the side wasn ' t in view .
M	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly shows from the box what is inside .
M	from that alone anyone with any education would be able to deduce was something not to be playing rugby with .
M	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
M	i could have been on the loo , wiped and got to the door in the space of time it took him to try and ruin my purchase so no_idea how he expected it to save time .
M	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn ' t make it the right way to do it .
M	this badly creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn ' t have been able to match his expertise .
M	this wouldn ' t have been so bad but the receipts from the website i ordered from are collectable as they carry a pleasant view of a stand at anfield .
M	he also stood a very real risk of ripping the shirt at the same time which i ' m surprised about as the average letter - box isn ' t exactly smooth inside ....
M	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn ' t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn ' t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
M	still , looking at other reviews , at_least it wasn ' t left inside a bin or with thieves in the neighbourhood .
M	thanks to the very helpful rep lizzie on p0g chat i cancelled the delivery i booked today for an item sale on ebay that fell through , wasn ' t expecting anything back but within 00_minutes on chat i left happy enough to say thanks on here for it .
M	made up for being messed_around on ebay !
M	where do i start ?
M	well , my gf and i were looking into buying a car with cash but decided to take a look at stebbings with a view to finance on a car .
M	the first day we tried to view a car we were left waiting half an_hour without being seen ( and weren ' t ther only ones !)
M	because it was a weekend and they only had 0 staff on .
M	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars ....
M	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
M	the key itself was broken which should have been an omen but on we went , enjoyed the test_drive even_though the car had no diesel in at all so we had to go back the next_day to adctually drive it , all we could do was look !
M	in the end we payed and left , then straight_away things went_downhill .
M	the day we were due to pick_up the car the guy dealing_with us was off ill , they had no_idea we were even coming so had to wait while someone went off to find then clean the car in a hurry , must have taken over an_hour .
M	the car went for it ' s mot before coming to us and failed with numerous advisorys which were conveniently absent from the mot we we given , though we know it had problems as it says on the governments own mot website !
M	nothing at all was mentioned about them either .
M	to pass the mot it needed a tyre , so they replaced just one even_though the other was near legal limit , wipers were replaced as the old ones weren ' t clearing the window even_though the " mark " was actually a huge scratch on the glass which really should not have passed , niether should the seatbelt that doesn ' t retract any faster_than it would take a snail to cover the same distance ( we ' re talking minutes here ).
M	within 0 days we had the first engine fault light come up , having my own scanner i read the fault code and it told me the turbo was overboosting .
M	when we rang them they claimed it was due to not being driven for a while and to give it a full_tank of fuel , suffice to say this didn ' t work .
M	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
M	dangerously when this light came on power would suddenly be lost leading to some very dangerous situations , not good when you have a gf and her 0 year_old in the car , performing what should easily be a safe text - book overtake .
M	by the time we realised it wasn ' t going away we ' d already gone over 0000 miles , which is all they allow for under warantee .
M	i wonder_why it ' s so low ( 0000 miles or 0 month )?
M	*_cough * *_cough *.
M	since then within 0 months the seat has broken , it ' s needed a new tyre , it turns_out they didn ' t service it at all so we had to spend over Â£_000 on that , it has continuously givn error codes and engine warning lights , various bits have fallen_off and to take the mickey now the turbo is only boosting at 0psi and we ' ve so far spent_hundreds without getting to the bottom of why it ' s so slow now , can ' t even keep up with a petrol tanker going up a hill ( true story :( ).
M	also the steering_wheel column feels loose .
M	their adverts currently state " we ' ll buy every car " and going by the standard they ' ll sell you any as well , even if it ' s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn ' t right it ' s too_late .
M	the whole ordeal has been terrible and considering we spent over Â£ 0000 on a car what we ' ve had start to finish has been shockingly_bad , plus now we are stuck with a car that needs to last another 0 years but definately won ' t without thousands being spent :'( i would say please don ' t let them make a mug of you too , stay well away and use a company with a more professional approach who will sell you something you should rightly get for your money and not something that will make life hell or even worse kill you .
M	don ' t need to review this one much really , dropped it off after the school run at 0 . 00 and was surprised by a call at 0 . 00 to say the car was ready .
M	credit due to north street tyres in lynn .
M	so i sent my ohone in for repair on the 00th_may 0000 , today is the 0th_june_0000 and i still yet to recieve my phone back .
M	i had to go into two phones0u stores and the people were not helpful at all , they didn ' t know what they were doing and ended_up having to speak to people over the phone .
M	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .....
M	the phone had a slight crack on the back so that had to be repaired before any warranty issues could be sorted out , they didn ' t email me saying that the back needed to be repaired i had to phone up chasing them .
M	i once sent my old phone to htc and they repaired it and sent it back to me within a week , this is appalling and they have no excuse for taking so long
M	dispatched quickly , and even_though they came from malta , arrived within 0 days .
M	very good around the christmas_period
M	this website is better_than any other website or store you can go to simply because they have the best customer_service , and easiest site to use .
M	i ' ve not found another place anywhere that does a on the spot price_match and then even lowers it !
M	absolutely amazing , supplement_warehouse is the only place i ' ll ever buy supplements from for the rest of my life !
M	:_d
M	absolutely fantastic service with great staff who will do anything to help .
M	was left upstairs to test out guitars / amps for as long as i needed and even popped back a second time .
M	these_guys had the best price around and some products including the guitar i bought even cheaper in store they even put in a pair of spare strings to take home too .
M	very friendly and willing to go the extra_mile .
M	will be now using this when i come to buying my amp in the next month or two .
M	had a last_minute christmas printing emergency and despite being one day over the cutoff time for christmas i still got my prints a day early .
M	and they are of outstanding quality , will_definitely use again .
M	i am absolutely surprised at how good the casino . winner . com site is !
M	it is extremely easy to use , the whole layout of the website is fantastic and the registration is simply quick and efficient .
M	i â ve used the site over the past couple of months and i can truly say it is better_than some of the other_sites that i have used .
M	it has a wide variation of games , live betting , casino games , sports , slots , poker , bingo and even a live casino which makes the experience just that much_better for me !
M	they have included a promotions extra which gains you extra things when you win which i feel is fantastic and the winners club is great for some extra club benefits .
M	not only do i win in different_ways but i actually gain other benefits throughout â such a great , honest , rewarding and reliable company .
M	i was able to deposit and withdraw funds with ease , i usually use the visa method which is very quick and no issues come_across it which is fantastic !
M	one other fantastic feature is the mobile_app which is really good to use and is integrated with the website .
M	i am able to bet on the go , deposit and withdraw funds too !
M	so easy to use and makes the whole experience miles better .
M	the site staffs are fantastic and the live help feature is a bonus especially if i have had anything i needed help with .
M	i would definitely_recommend this site and myself have been using for a long time now !
M	i just wanted to put it out there that i am very happy with auslogics products .

M	for a first time purchaser the system was very easy to use and very reassuring .
M	no_problems at any stage and a really fast service .
M	would recommend to anyone_wanting to buy coin without the worry .
M	i booked a lesson on the bsm website for a certain_date but was very disappointed when after that date bsm had still not found me a driving instructor & did not even bother to contact me to inform me about the matter .
M	i cancelled the lesson as i was disappointed with there poor service & asked for a refund i was told it would take seven working_days for a full_refund to be paid back in to my account , after seven day ' s i had still not received a refund i contacted bsm again to inform them about this when they assured me that a refund would be made right away only i was still_waiting for a refund seven_days after that .
M	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
M	i found the service at mazumamobile . com to be very good indeed .
M	fast hassle_free & helpful .
M	i would definitely use again .
M	i have starting buying all my supplements here .
M	great buy and the less expensive company on the market , fast delivery time , and i will_continue to buy supplements here .
M	i would recommend this to anyone
M	it ' s really good , Â£_00 . 00 for a 00month xbl price is a good deal .
M	as for the service i payed via_paypal after an easy phone verification and the email was sent to my account instantly .
M	would use again !
M	as is always the case in dealing_with sue ( damo or heather ), the service was fantastic .
M	i ' m the typical awkward designer client - wanting everything done yesterday and on a budget .
M	regardless my request , sue was on the ball and got it turnaround - 0 days early !
M	i definitely should be on a commission for how often i recommend them to other designers !
M	pleasure to do so knowing the level of service and quality that is given .
M	always beating prices .
M	shipping pretty fast .
M	can ' t beat it .
M	im really impressed with diamond_geezer .
M	the name might not sound as prestigious as ernest jones for example but the quality is and a lot cheaper .
M	i ' ve just bought my wedding_ring and like for like it was Â£_000 cheaper .
M	communication is great with regular_emails letting you know where they are up to with your order .
M	they were bang on with the estimated_delivery date as well .
M	can ' t fault them .
M	darren
M	went into the derby store to buy a sim only deal because i already had a phone and just needed a sim_card for a few_months .
M	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
M	then my phone broke and i had to cancel the sim only deal .
M	i went to the shop and was told they couldn ' t do it and i had to ring customer_services .
M	after ringing the extortionate customer_service line , i was politely told that i had been misinformed by the shop and that i was on a 00 month business deal and had to pay Â£_000 to cancel it .
M	i had not been told any of this information and was ever so slightly peeved .
M	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
M	very good service very quick got the info in a clear and concise manor .
M	it ' s easy to navigate , has all of the hostels you ' d want in the places you want to go , and there are never any booking_fees !
M	what more could you want ?
M	!
M	always process my order fast and ships fast too .
M	some prices are not always the best but do a little searching and find a lower_price so they can beat it .
M	the above title is in reference to a meme in case you think i ' m some illiterate fool !
M	anyway back to the review ...... overall i would give my experience a 00 / 00 ......... sit back relax and let me explain_why .
M	when i first placed my order i paid via_paypal and i got a confirmation_email which said it was received .
M	several minutes lady i got a further email_saying my payment was rejected .
M	the following_morning i got a further email from your customer_services saying i could phone a number to give another form of payment or just reorder the product .... so i was well informed .
M	i remembered when i received the confirmation_email of the original order that it had a 00_%_off voucher for my next order .... you can see where i ' m going with this ... no - brainer really , replace the order apply the 00_% coupon use different payment_method come out at the end of it Â£ 0 . 00 richer ... result .
M	if it had not of been for the voucher sneakiness i probably would give a 0 . 0 / 00 due to the payment issues .
M	thanks ,
M	john
M	when ever ive ordered online , we have never suffered any_problems from tesco and 0 times out of 00 even the substitutions are better items .
M	i ordered my item 00th_october , and after emailing and leaving messages for 0 weeks i eventually got a reply , it promised me my item next couple of days , sent by a women .
M	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
M	but i do believe the customer_service needs to improve , but the item is fantastic .
M	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
M	digital product was delivered immediately after purchase and worked straight_away .
M	at such a low price this was a great bargain !
M	the lowest_price i could find for diablo_0 and the cd_key was sent within a few minutes .
M	thanks a lot for the quick service and excellent price .
M	was very quick and simple payment and quick delivery , will buy from here again
M	we are a trading website selling our own_brand of cat litter .
M	we use parcel0go for all of our packages , they offer a great range of services and are very helpful all the time .
M	the website itself was very easy to use and very attractive .
M	the sidebars categorized the various items that they have available and the option to search by brand was conveniently positioned .
M	i had brought a pair of headphones which were really tight on my big head and uncomfortable for gaming use , i called up hifiheadphones and an exchange was arranged instantly with my new product reserved for me by an enthusiastic member of staff .
M	great companies in my opinion are those who can turn an unsatisfied customer into a satisfied one .
M	the customer thus is overall more pleased with the service than if they were not unsatisfied in the first place and take the time out of their day to write several words on a website such as this recommending the company that made the effort to resolve their problem .
M	ordered on the wednesday , received on the thursday , great selection of products and easy service
M	very good service and products .
M	all of my products arrives very quickly and as_described on the website .
M	the company offers a wide_range of top quality products which cater for all outdoor pursuits .
M	i purchased a breitling montbrilliant legende watch with all papers and display bos etc .
M	from watchfinder . co . uk for a large_sum of money .
M	it arrived very securely_packaged and as_described with regard to condition / papers etc .
M	with only one minor_issue ; there was no cosc certificate .
M	i decided to get in touch with alex stonely ( sales manager ) to inform him of this .
M	i was given the option of sending the watch and papers back to watchfinder for them to send to breitling service centre uk to secure a replacement cosc certificate free of charge !
M	i must_say that should i purchase another watch in the future , regardless of the value , i will certainly be enquiring here first !
M	cannot recommend highly_enough , i don ' t normally take the time to review services which i have utilised , however , in this case i feel_compelled to .
M	philip d keeling
M	website was clear and easy to use .
M	i had one or two other questions which i just wanted to clarify with them , and these were answered by the experts on the phone .
M	when the rads were delivered ( within two_weeks of my order being placed ) a couple of them had multiple scratches / smudged paint work - possibly due to courier rather_than manufacturer .
M	i took photos of these and emailed them in and within minutes i received a reply offering for an exchange , which i accepted .
M	two_weeks_later replacement rads turned_up in perfect_condition and the others were returned .
M	very pleased with the service and looking_forward to getting some more in when we do the next part of the house .
M	i have been trying for months to unlock my iphone 0 ( 0 . 0 . 0 , 0 . 00 . 00 ) with no success , i saw this company ' s reviews and decided to try them out .
M	behold !
M	my iphone was unlocked under 0 hours !
M	can you believe it ... it works ... try them , it truly works ... i ' m using my phone now on t - mobile .... you can take their promise to the bank !
M	the person who dealt_with us was very understanding , professional , not at all pushy and managed to save us a significant_amount ofm money on our life assurance , would happily reccommend
M	i have used these people numerous_times and they ' ve always delivered on time at a very good price .
M	there was a problem at their depot once but they were straight on the phone apologising and offering new delivry dates etc so can ' t fault them at all and will_continue to use them .
M	i like this company and buy from them regularly .
M	they do a good range of good quality products and i normally find the staff instore knowledgeable and willing to give impartial_advice on the ' best ' products etc .
M	i have also had to return footware to them ( hi - tec which had split and broken horribly , not their own_brand ) months outside of their normal returns_policy and they took them back , without a receipt , and gave mea full_refund and then a discount on the new boots i bought , can ' t say_fairer than that !
M	thanks !
M	use these all the time and saved loads as a result .
M	i chose to use them over other similar_sites initially because they weren ' t involved in any of the ridiculous and tacky advertising that has been going on of late .
M	however i am a little disappointed to see that they may too be going down that route now too ..... perhaps i ' ll have to look for another comparison site ?
M	!
M	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter ' s birthday and found this site .
M	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
M	they said it would be dispatched within_00hrs ; it wasn ' t .
M	our daughter ' s birthday was on 00 july and despite numerous_emails and phonecalls ( more of which later ), we decided to cancel the order , which we did on 00 july_0000 and had to go to argos and buy one in store for significantly more money .
M	in cancelling , we formally requested a full_refund , but despite numerous further emails and phonecalls ( definately some more later !)
M	we still do not have a refund , and today is 00 spetember 0000 .
M	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
M	by the way , in relation to the phone_calls , don ' t bother ringing them , it simply a voicemail message_telling you to email them ..... now thats customer_service .
M	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
M	for anyone_else considering using these people , please seriously consider whether its worth it .
M	chris
M	they offer a good range of products at good prices and offer an excellent returns_policy .
M	we as a family do nearly all our christmas shopping through amazon each year and they have never yet let us down .
M	thoroughly reccommended
M	i ' ve been with bt for quite a number of years and just have the constant niggling feelign that they ' re conning me .
M	i feel as though i am paying way too much for broadband etc but can ' t face calling them because i don ; t have half a day to waste on the phone on hold to then be put through to someone i struggle to understand .
M	i ' m just waiting for sky broadband ( the fast one ) to make it to my area and i ' ll be switching
M	i ' ve only really started using next over the past couple of years since opening an online account with them
M	they ' ve been excellent .
M	very fast delivery of goods and their returns_policy is very good too .
M	i also like the flexibility of being_able to arrange delivery to my door or go to the store down the road to collect
M	i like ebay overall and have got some good value stuff , but i don ' t enjoy the agro you can get from other_users .
M	i have only ever sold two items through ebay , on one i was accused by a bidder of bidding myself to jack the price up , which i wasn ' t , and the other i had difficulties getting paid by someone who kept claiming they had when they had not .
M	its good in principle but for me not worth the hassle when selling
M	play offer a good range of products and normally at pretty good prices too .
M	they always deliver very quickly and i have never had a problem with any goods from them despite having used them for numerous years now .
M	i also like the fact i can buy from their trusted buyers too and get things cheaper second_hand if i like
M	we use tesco all the time for food and fuel and find them excellent .
M	we collect club card vouchers throughout the year and cash them in each summer to take the kids on days out to theme parks etc
M	i ordered a nikon l000 and case on 00 july_0000 , they said it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days , it wasn ' t .
M	i contacted them to ask what was going on as i needed it for a birthday_present and had ordered in good faith expecting delivery within timescales advertised .
M	email response simply said they couldn ' t gaurentee when i ' d get it .... not good enough .
M	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
M	i spoke to their customer_services who said i ' d get a refund within 0 - 0 days and also got an_email confirmation that they ' d received my cancellation .
M	i still_haven ' t received my refund and have had to resort to raising a dispute with my bank to see if they can get me my money back .
M	i will never use this company again and would warn anyone_else from dealing_with them too .
M	it was straightforward , i put the imei_number on website , got the quote and got free post envelope from mazuma in couple of days .
M	posted my phone ( better to get proof of receipt as it gives you cover up to Â£_00 on free post ) and got my money directly paid into bank in couple of days .
M	highly_recommended .
M	sammie_taylor was a great help .
M	nice and easy to get the necessary_information :)
M	i took out van insurance , which i was told would mirror my no claims from the car .
M	0 weeks on i have been told that it was mis sold - in order to mirror the no claims i have to be 00 ( which i am in 0 months ), but the sales_advisor didn ' t check this criteria thus mis sold me the insurance !
M	they have cancelled and refunded in full - but now i ' m stuck without insurance and since i can ' t mirror the no claims i have to pay Â£_000 more - i wouldn ' t have bought the van had they have informed me when quoting !
M	avoid !
M	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone call stating they will be cancelling my items !
M	wont be using ever again !
M	as an_avid user of parcels0go , i recently had a terrible experience .
M	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
M	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
M	0 weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
M	what a joke !
M	they then offered Â£_00 compensation for a Â£_000 item !
M	!
M	use someone who actually care about the customer !
M	pgs were great from the moment i contacted them to the completion of the removal of some wasp and hornet nests .
M	charges explained both when making the appointment and on the pest controllers arrival .
M	an_appointment was offered for the following_day and the chap arrived at the beginning of the one hour time_slot .
M	explained what he was going to do , shared his knowledge throughout and completed the task at hand .
M	very impressive and a good guy to boot .
M	i am pleased with the speed of service !
M	bought 0 tickets for gipsy kings in london which were sold out on the official site of royal_albert hall and they arrived on the next_day !
M	we are a company of 0 so tickets were next to each other which is great !
M	would buy again from double0 and recommended it to family and friends .
M	very reliable company for business and personal use , would recommend to anyone , i use it mostly for business
M	havent had chance to use bat yet as it needs knocking in , but cannot_fault the service i recieved .
M	dropped my ps0 off for repairs , they quoted me 0 days for repair but within an_hour of getting home after dropping it off i got a text to say it had been fixed .
M	very fast excellent service a +++++++ would repair again
M	i felt a bit_weary of ordering such prized presents online , since my local whisky emporium closed its doors recently , but i was pleasantly and overwhelmingly surprised by the detail , accuracy and overall professionalism shown by the whiskey_exchange , suggesting new , and unheard of complimentary spirits to what i was looking at made me a tad bit more adventurous than usual .
M	once checked out nothing is left to chance , and i received instant confirmation and an on - going dialog of order status_updates which where reassuring and not overly invasive .
M	overall i would highly_recommend this online store for any spirit requirements .
M	i am the first to readily admit that when it comes to getting things printed i usually head straight down the road and get scalped by my local print shop , as well i dont have a clue_what any of the paper weights / configurations mean .
M	so i finally did some home work and found out what kind of spec i tend to be drawn too , and found print00 really useful in selecting what i needed , even when it seemed really technical their help bubbles popped up to assist me into selecting the correct choices .
M	from my point of view as a relative novice at this kind of online ordering i found it a tad technical at times but easy enough to make heads and tails of what i was after in the end .
M	i think that maybe the site was experiencing a bit of traffic at the time as it was slow at updating the prices but i was more_than happy with the quotes given compared to my local shop , it was definitely worth the time scoping through the technical details .
M	as for the end_result i was first of all amazed at the delivery speed , and the fact they sent me text updates was helpful , but the finished_product was simply , brilliant .
M	i would highly_recommend print00 to anyone who is looking for a quick , cheap and most of all high_quality finish for their printing_needs .
M	price is great , delivery time is short , no_problems at all
M	cheapest supplier i could find using google .
M	my order was with me within 00_hours , all in perfect_condition .
M	we received a confirmation_email_saying the order had been received , we also received a notification of dispath , but have not received anything yet .
M	we have tried to contact by phone and email but cannot get an answer .
M	i will be reporting this to credit_card company to try get my money back
M	excellent , friendly service .
M	highly_recommend .
M	gave me absolute peace of mind when buying my new car
M	excellent service , great communication .
M	highly_recommend
M	fantastic service , very fast and efficient .
M	i look_forward to placing my next order
M	the customer_service is flawless and the item arrived next_day
M	very happy and would highly_recommend to anyone
M	excellent service as always .
M	fast and efficient .
M	i look_forward to dealing_with mazuma again .
M	having heard of myprotein through friends and websites i thought i would give them a try .
M	very pleased with the information provided on their products , the quality of their products is excellent and delivery was a lot quicker_than i expected .
M	i will be using myprotein going forward .
M	i have ordered from supplementwarehouse . com three times and today makes my third .
M	i have never had an issue with anything on supplementwarehouse . com .
M	i ordered off of bodybuilding . com for almost 0 years but when found supplementwarehouse . com , i could not go back even if i wanted to .
M	the free_samples and merchandise are amazing .
M	where else can you get something for free and there be no catch .
M	i will order from supplementwarehouse . com forever .
M	the high shipping prices are what it actually cost to ship the products .
M	if you are in deciding about whether or not to order from supplementwarehouse . com ....... do it
M	bittylicious is very fast and reliable .
M	you get exactly_what you order in a very short amount of time .
M	by_far supplement_warehouse gives the best deals and prices out there on supplements anybody who is professional or beginning needs to order from here because of their great service , prices and reviews , i will never ever set foot in another supplement store again !
M	choice and availability of chocolate is second to none .
M	easy to order and the prices are reasonable compared to high_street prices .
M	quick delivery too !
M	would recommend to anyone_looking for something different than your normal chocolate available in other stores .
M	i ordered the bose computer musicmonitor speakers from hispek electronics .
M	i had been searching for a while for some good speakers at a decent price and these were the best deal available from anywhere i had seen .
M	i chose the standard delivery service but even then they turned_up the next_day !
M	i was very please with the service and the speakers are awesome .
M	i would recommend hispek to anyone !
M	great products for the best price i have seen anywhere and delivered exceptionally quickly !
M	ordered a few games from this website , they are just excellent .
M	all games are delivered quick ( though email ) and any_questions you have , you ' re able to fire them at the go0arena support staff and they reply very quickly
M	0 star because of the best service via online website i have experienced
M	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
M	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
M	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
M	customer_service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
M	avoid like the plague .
M	just didn ' t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother ' s day .
M	left my mother waiting all day for them .
M	had no customer_service available on the sunday itself , so i waited until the monday .
M	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
M	i finally got an_email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
M	at full cost .
M	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me Â£ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
M	i couldn ' t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
M	i don ' t think i ' ve ever been so angry .
M	really pleased with my purchases , the staff are very helpful !
M	will definetly shop here in the future .
M	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
M	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
M	a week_later , they replied , sending a claim_form because they said it had been despatched .
M	i returned the claim_form , and waited .
M	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
M	a week_later again , still nothing , so i asked them to just give me a refund .
M	another week_later , still nothing , so i filed a paypal_dispute .
M	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
M	---
M	" your first return back to us as -- not called for
M	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
M	due to the christmas break and office open on 0th do not help with the delays in answer emails or phone ,
M	there has been breakdown in the internet which has deleted the emails ."
M	---
M	so ...
M	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
M	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
M	( 0 ) " you did not pick_up the item " all capitalised .
M	not the most professional way to deal with your customers is it ?
M	( 0 ) the christmas / new year break has no relevance whatsoever - the total_lack of communication all dates from after the 0th of january .
M	( 0 ) " there has been breakdown in the internet ".
M	classic , absolutely classic !
M	so in all , it ' s full of excuses , and it took the threat of a claim against them through paypal , before they ' d do anything .
M	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
M	i bought a lanparte rig and i asked if they could dispatch it as soon as possible because i needed it in 0 week ( i live in greece ).
M	they actually send the product the same day and it arrived on time .
M	furthermore , they also replied to my request with an_email , which is an amazing thing for the customer , to get some feedback and know that thise people actually read .
M	i will need some stuff very soon and i will_definitely buy again from camerakings . co . uk
M	thank_you .
M	panagiotis s .
M	athens , greece
M	i found speegraphic through google looking for a specific product .
M	it was the first i got to see their online store , being a bit_skeptical at first .
M	after_reading all the positive_reviews in trustpilot i decided to proceed .
M	- they are fast on dispatch
M	- packaging of the package was good
M	- i got fast reply on an_email after the purchase
M	- tracking_number for the package was available
M	i am located in greece ( athens ) and i would recommend to anyone trying out this store .
M	they deserve a good look .
M	i bought there many clubs , especially titleist , they are best for custom fitting .
M	prices are low , everything arrives fast and in great condition .
M	best golf shop i used at the internet .
M	i found this company when i was looking to replace a lost set of headphones and having read some positive information about them i thought i would give them a shot and i am pleased that i did .
M	having placed my order on a friday and choosing their standard delivery option i was extremely pleased when my new headphones arrived on the saturday .
M	their communication_throughout the process was great and it was reassuring to have each_stage of the ordering_process made clear to me so i was always aware of what was happening .
M	the product itself is also very good and having purchased it based on a recommendation placed on a forum by an hifiheadphones . co . uk representative i was also pleased to find that they know what they are talking_about and weren ' t simply trying to flog me a pair of expensive headphones in order to make a sale .
M	overall i would highly_recommend hifiheadphones . co . uk and should i find myself in the market for another set i would not hesitate to buy from them again .
M	very pleased with the item , process and the speed at which it was despatched .
M	will use again and recommend to others .
M	they responded to my email very fast .
M	very happy with the next_day delivery .
M	couldn ' t ask for anymore .
M	slendid service , standard 0nd_class delivery arrived 0 days_later , perfect_condition well_packaged .
M	one fault ordered an extension with a snooker cue , when the extension is attatched there is a rather large step between the cue and extension at the joint , not a big deal really as the extension wont get used much .
M	overall very pleased :_d .
M	as far as prices are concerned this place is great , and not to mention the discounts and free_stuff too .
M	ordered today so we will see how fast the shipping is .
M	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn ' t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
M	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
M	sent three emails so far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
M	essentially this company has stolen Â£_00 from me .
M	mihan mehr construction co .
M	it & network software
M	i have been using e_- tyres for many years .

M	i would just like to say how happy i have been with the service from the account_manager and support from the technical department .
M	donna bromilow and wayne thomas have been exceptional with assistance and customer support .
M	i work for a customer support service area which give me the basis to comment on the excellent service i have received .
M	thank_you for all your help .
M	i searched all over the web for my products .
M	they were the cheapest here hands_down .
M	shipping and handling was rather high but i suppose with the free_shaker and free 0 months of mens health i got with it , it was worth it .
M	what a bargain , came at the right time when i was low on money !
M	!
M	good that you only have pay 00 percent of the payment rather_than full upfront .
M	i prefer to use paypal as it means i only have to use my card_details once and i am less likely to be targeted by the keystroke bots that could pinch my card_details as i type them in !
M	ordered an apc ups from this company as i have many_times before and cannot_fault them .
M	never had a issue with an item not being in stock and delivery is always prompt .
M	they also give you loyalty_points when you spend money which can be used for pretty decent gifts ( not cheap pens and stuff !)
M	they always have the best products on sale !
M	order was placed the same day as it was dispatched so very appreciative of there speeds !
M	contacted their support about a payment issue and it was resolved swiftly !
M	i ordered a mw0 key around midnight and a couple hours_later received the cd_key .
M	even_though it was a russian one and i had to use a vpn to install , it was a breeze to do .
M	they offered to install it if i didn ' t want to go through the hassle .
M	i downloaded the english version off steam so it ' s like i just got back from a game store only i paid less_than half the price !
M	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
M	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
M	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
M	requesting a refund .
M	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
M	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
M	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an_email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
M	draw your own conclusions ...
M	i found every thing i was looking for and was pleased by how easy it was for me to find what i was looking for .
M	so far so good , seem ok for contact but not had to make a claim yet ...
M	they were brilliant , delivered less_than 00_hours after i ordered , i got a 00_%_discount , and the flowers were amazing
M	from start to finish was perfect .
M	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
M	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
M	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn ' t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
M	when i finally got through to the advisor on the end of the line , my order reference was taken and then i was cut_off when i was put back onto hold .
M	mattress was delivered the next_day , in perfect_condition .
M	it ' s incredibly comfy !
M	i read a few reviews having placed the order and started to get a little_worried .
M	but i didn ' t need to be .
M	really good service and product !
M	this is the second time i have used gear0music and it has exceeded all my expectations .
M	i shall continue to use them as my no .
M	0 stop and can reccomend them to anyone .
M	a friend_recommended me to distinctly legal and therefore i knew i can ' t have made the wrong choice .
M	my claim went on for a long time however the company was with me every moment of the way .
M	great updates on the claim via_email post and telephone .
M	there was always someone to speak to and help with any_queries i had .
M	overall , an excellent service and will most definitely use them again if i need in the future .
M	great fast and reliable service provided by mazuma !
M	love it !
M	received order within 0 days , good service , brilliant prices , i will be purchasing from them again , great to find a decent place you can trust
M	thank_you so much :)
M	i found the ram that i needed for my laptop , on here , cheaper_than i could find it anywhere_else on the internet ... with a lifetime warranty :_d
M	the member of staff that i talked to on the phone before purchasing the ram was also very helpful and polite , and she made me feel_valued as a potential customer .
M	i received the memory in just a few_days , and i ' m really very happy , as it ' s working brilliantly .
M	i would definitely buy any memory that i would need in the future , from here :)
M	thing with this company is they have great emails highlighting one category of products .
M	nothing pushy , just honest and it ' s all there and available .
M	that is what counts .
M	thanks guys .
M	these_guys know how to dispatch .
M	always quick and easy .
M	if you need to chat before you place the order they are equally prompt and helpful .
M	never miss a beat with monster .
M	from purchasing to delivery , i know what is happening .
M	just the way online shopping should be .
M	always receive my products in record time .
M	keep up the good work .
M	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn ' t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
M	paypal is okay when you don ' t have an issue , but when the time comes that you do , you will witness what a horrible company it really is .
M	don ' t take my word for it , there are thousands of victims of chargeback fraud telling their stories online and websites dedicated to exposing paypal .
M	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer_service ( call_centre ).
M	hollow_promises about how they are ' on the seller ' s side '.
M	frustrating bureaucracy and automated customer_service that can ' t answer your problem .
M	i will do everything i can to avoid using paypal ever in my life .
M	i received a text shortly_after_placing my online order telling_me who would be delivering and at what time ( 00 till 0 ).
M	it also gave me the option of texting back to change my delivery date to various other options .
M	great communications .
M	as promised , john arrived on time with my parcel .
M	i commented on the text service and we had a 0 minute chat in which it was clear he was very enthusiastic about his job and the company he works for .
M	that night i ordered something again , around 0 pm , and was pleased to get a text telling_me dpd were handling delivery and it would be with me by lunch time the next_day .
M	and it was !
M	having had some awful experiences with delivery firms , i was really impressed with dpd .
M	very good and fast service , good prices and customer_service
M	i love this website .
M	i always check here first for all my supplements .
M	great prices and fast_shipping .
M	look here first before you go anywhere_else .
M	ordered a new av amp and 0 . 0 speakers through creative audio / audio express .
M	good value and range of peripherals / options with kit .
M	helpful set - up guide included which was a nice_touch and very useful without being overly " techie "
M	i had a couple of small things missing from my speaker stands ( not their fault ) - they very quickly contacted the manufacturer and i had the missing parts the following_day !
M	excellent customer_service and speedy / efficient service , would highly_recommend / use again .
M	i ordered a pirelli p - zero runflat tyre .
M	it arrived at the recommended garage quickly and was fitted well without any fuss .
M	furthermore , the tyre was far cheaper_than most other_places and all in all - a very good service .
M	i will use again .
M	excellent service from tyres on the drive , both from the staff who phoned to confirm the booking through to my friendly technician , andy , who made an excellent job .
M	i won ' t hesitate to use this company again and will recommend to friends and family .
M	also , superb value !!
M	cheers .
M	i used spectronics to help me find a suitable pc .
M	they helped guide me towards the best one for me suited to my work and social needs .
M	they helped make the complex things understandable and the end product i received was spectacular .
M	i ordered a mac which was quick to arrive and i got the best value for my money .
M	i would recommend using spectronics for all your computing needs and issues .
M	ordering the shed was easy and informative .
M	i had a tight space to build my shed and i needed to know the dimensions quite accurately .
M	the website had all the information that i needed and what ' s more , it was at the right price .
M	i bought a 0ft x 0ft shed and i ' m not a builder , but with a little building knowledge can be erected with just one person .
M	quality of the shed is to be expected at this price too but the overall look and feel of the shed means that i have a product that i ' m really happy with .
M	i couldn ' t fault flashbay in any way .
M	it was great to talk to someone and discuss my order .
M	delivery came on - time and this was just before_christmas when , as we all know , deliveries can be precarious at best .
M	i would certainly recommend this company to anyone .
M	prices were really good too !
M	i have shopped couple of times with millitary 0st and i can say i have been satisfied all the time with my shopping . very professional people that always recognised the needs of customers . i will and i have already recommend millitary 0st to my friends .
M	where it stands at the moment it is my favourite online shop for security equipment .
M	keep up the work team .
M	galvin
M	i used to love dialtosave and made it my only option of purchase for international cards but now its been losing my customs due to technical_error which keeps on repeating all the time . as a busy man i found it a bit_annoying to contact customer_service everytime .
M	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i ' ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
M	it has now reach a point that i will have no other choice than looking for another option .
M	customer_service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
M	well_done to the customer_service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
M	regards

M	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .
M	went to reception and they put me through to internet provider , got it fixed but when i went up to the room again , wifi lost signal again , spent half the night in reception trying to fix it .
M	second night there was noise in the halls and noise from car_park / streets , therefore that was another night with hardly any sleep .
M	only stayed there 0 nights .
M	also tried_contacting customer_services and when i eventually got through to them they were no help at all .
M	if you are staying in glasgow i would not recommend premier_inn .
M	i needed a kilt ( full outfit ) within a week , it was less_than $_000 and i recieved it quick and in all the right sizes !!
M	i wish all my online experiences went this well !!
M	buy a kilt here and you won ' t be dissapointed !
M	i ' m recommending your sight to anyone that will listen , thanks again !
M	!
M	no inicio fiquei com medo ; porq tenho uma assistencia no brasil e os clientes comeÃ§aram a procurar esse serviÃ§o na minha empresa ;
M	this is my first time using scan an old friend told me about them .
M	most of the time i use amazon .
M	so took a chance and ordered a seagate 0tb baracuda hdd well_packaged and delivered a day late but that ' s because of new year delivered early by dpd .
M	this is the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile . com never had a problem payments go sameday they receive the phone , they make it simply and easy .
M	many_thanks mazumamobile .
M	this site absolutely has the best deals i have ever_seen .
M	i can ' t believe it took me this long to find the site and how much money i wasted elsewhere .
M	the site is extremely easy to navigate and everything is so user - friendly .
M	i will be coming_back here for years to come and recommending it to friends too !
M	j ' ai_commandÃ© pendant le week - end et choisi la_livraison 00h .

M	a convenient way to order food online for pickup / delivery , with a large choice of restaurants to order from in london .

M	i was quite suprised of the result that the product gave me , it really worked out great and i can now finally live in peace in my new home !
M	the service you provided was great , keep it up !
M	i ' ve just spent countless ours all over the net looking up information about all_kinds of sites on jailbreaking and unlocking .
M	i ' ve had an iphone_0s for almost a year now and would never go back to a droid !
M	i wanted to explore my options and have never looked up any information about doing this .
M	so many fake spam sites i couldn ' t tell what was real and what wasn ' t after a while .
M	finally i can across this site and i seriously researched and researched until my eyes are hurting right now and i type this .
M	i re - read every inch of this site and learned so much about the different way to unlock , and operating systems , whats in the news for future products , and spam sites to avoid etc etc etc .
M	couldn ' t be more happy and confident with this site .
M	endless amounts of information with a real full money back guarantee !
M	the structure and just everything about this site made me just wanna stay and read more !
M	everything was organised and easily assailable from click to click !
M	my girlfriend will need her phone unlocked for customizing !
M	no doubt about it ....
M	i will buy again !
M	lets just see how fast my product gets here !
M	- that was done on the 00th of january with no_problems !

M	ready , set , go !

M	i recently_purchased 0 tickets for cheryl cole at newcastle ' s metro radio arena in october .
M	i struggled to find last_minute tickets with a good view .
M	the only tickets i could find were right at the back of the arena , until i discovered double0tickets . com !
M	i found tickets last_minute within a few_days of the gig at an incredible low price !
M	i was amazed at how cheap they were , considering the seating was very close to the stage !
M	i grabbed the tickets and within 00_hours i had the tickets at my door !
M	i was very impressed with the customer_service on the telephone when i spoke to a female to confirm the seating .
M	i would definately_recommend double 0 tickets to anyone who_wants low price tickets last_minute !
M	i was very happy with the seats and overall this made me and my family ' s experience so special !
M	thank_you double 0 !
M	dan dawson , middlesbrough
M	good service ! fair prices ! fast !
M	iphone working perfectly !

M	thank_you very much !
M	ordered some products online , there was a delay but the customer_service team really helped_me get the order quicker and offered real solutions in order for this to happen .
M	i will order again from this company and what an overall experience this has been , big shout to jenny in customer_services for going above and beyond my expectations .
M	good service although some of the hotels like bewleys could be quicker at nighttime , last time was waiting 00_mins or so , and this is the last thing you want to do when coming home
M	dear_sir / madam , i would like to thank_you for providing me with exemplary service & products .
M	this morning i received my order of 0 x bevel solid_oak small sideboards .
M	the delivery service was fantastic .
M	the products came well_protected in good , solid packaging and the whole experience has been a pleasure .
M	i will absolutely definitely_recommend your company and have already done so to many work colleagues .
M	i cannot_fault your company at - all .
M	from the ease of ordering .... clear and regular delivery updates and high_quality products .
M	please don ' t change anything you are doing .
M	but please put my comments on your testimonials page .
M	i will be ordering again from you .
M	thank_you very much .
M	yours_sincerely , s bennett .
M	out of all the companies i ' ve used for domain registrations 000 -_reg is always the company i recommend to friends and family .
M	they ' re fair in their pricing , their support and live_chat system is great and they ' re always helpful and friendly .
M	in the 0 or so years i ' ve used them i ' ve never had a problem .
M	000 -_reg all the way !
M	trustpilot a blatently allowing the online homebrew company to abuse this service and mislead customers .
M	this renders trustpilot completely pointless .
M	went intore to buy a tv .
M	none in stock but ordered in for only 0 days_later and over the xmas sales period too !
M	great deal , great warranty and great service from the staff at jl chester .
M	i placed my order for a few beer kits and a fermenting barrel with a tap on the 00th_september .
M	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
M	this was acceptable and i proceded .
M	over the next four weeks all the items in my order were in and out of stock and nothing was recieved .
M	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
M	other communications made took 0 and 0 days to be responded to to try and find out what was going on .
M	after over four weeks ( 00 / 00 ) i recieved half my order which included the fermenting barrel but with no tap and a note saying the tap would follow .
M	nearly another week past and i recieved the rest of my order , still no tap .
M	today over 0 weeks_later ( 00 / 00 ) i have still not recieved the tap despite being assured that four have now been sent .
M	i have no_problems with any post from any other company .
M	i requested a refund via post around two_weeks_ago and was told one last attempt would be made to ship a tap .
M	still nothing .
M	i again have requested a refund which i am not confident of recieving .
M	terrible delivery .
M	terrible customer_service .
M	terrible communication .
M	i should have known not to trust a company with no phone contact .
M	i will be taking my custom to my local homebrew shop from now on .
M	it ' s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
M	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no tap recieved as expected .
M	still no refund recieved .
M	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has been passed to the appropriate person '.
M	i have had this response twice .
M	how long can it possibly take to process a refund ??
M	absolutely pathetic service .
M	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no refund .
M	still no response other than ' your request has been passed_onto the appropriate person '.
M	00 weeks tomorrow since i placed my order .
M	great selection , discount prices , fast_shipping , free_samples .
M	can ' t be beat !
M	after looking around for a while i finally decided to go with glassescorp as i had read some good reviews .
M	the price was at the time the best by quite a bit !
M	i ordered them and they arrived the following_day packaged extremely well no chance of them getting broken in the post ..!
M	they also sent out a complimentary lollipop which is always a nice_touch .
M	i would defiantly recommended glassescorp to friends and family
M	to the organiser of a stag trip .
M	go with these_guys to prague .
M	best trip ever we went cheap but ended_up taking out money and doing gun shooting and go_karting which mike and irina organised over there .
M	pissup organised everything well .
M	we had the basic package and it it was brilliant , mike took us to all the best places .
M	we stayed at hotel city_centre firendly , nice rooms and in the middle of everything .
M	cheap , firendly , good customer serivce and good memories .
M	thank_you .
M	ffx is always my first stop when searching for power_tools online .
M	massive_selection at the best prices .
M	helpful on the phone with information about a laser level so ordered online and received next_day .
M	top job !
M	thanks ffx .
M	everytime i search for pilot supplies on the internet i always end up back at proviation because of the great prices !
M	i have used them several_times now and never been disappointed .
M	would recommended all day long .
M	cheapest price on internet and amazingly fast delivery !
M	thanks toolstop !
M	i was a little_skeptical at first paying a company to unlock my iphone and after putting my details into there website i changed my mind , shortly_afterwards i received an_email with a link to plenty of genuine positive_reviews for me to look through and another email offering me Â£_00 off the unlock price so i decided to go with it and i ' m_glad i did , i placed my order on thursday and it ' s now monday and my phone is unlocked so in total took only 0 days as they said that weekends don ' t count , i will be recommending this site to anyone that asks me where to get an iphone_unlocked when it seems like too much_trouble for their own carrier to do it for them , highly_recommended
M	thanks
M	i recently_purchased a dewalt 000 mitre saw and leg stand , i wanted saturday delivery which they threw in foc , but they did it by giving me a further 0 %_discount , which saved me another Â£_00 pound , so i purchased a new level and hammer that they didn ' t have in stock , they kept me updated_regularly and the items turned_up a few_days_later , with no extra charge for delivery .
M	i would realy recommend giving them a try !
M	after lots of research into an a0 printer / scanner / copier , i came to the conclusion out of the limited options available that i was going to get a brother .
M	after the usual internet search printer land came back as the cheapest .
M	i called them to discuss my needs and they agreed that the printer sounded_like a good option for my needs .
M	i ordered the printer at 0 . 00pm and i received it at 00 . 00am the next morning .
M	i have since made several orders for ink and have received the same excellent service and value for money .
M	i cannot recommend the company highly_enough .
M	site construction solutions ltd
M	cjs always treat you as a friend through their customer_service and their prices are unbeatable .
M	they respond promptly , even through their facebook_page and deserve to be recognized as one of the , if not the best , top online digital retailer out of all others , including steam and origin .
M	i have bought multiple things from them in the past and i have never had a problem with them .
M	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave me more_than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung jet .
M	i will never use this website again !
M	cheapest place i found for 0d tickets and delivered in plenty of time before the concert .
M	highly_recommend double0
M	i purchased an epson lx0000 printer from printerland as it was the best price i found online .
M	printer arrived swiftly and well_packaged .
M	no_problems at all .
M	customer_service was very helpful when i contacted them with a query .
M	would highly_reccommend .
M	jon
M	i love you .
M	marry me .
M	all of you .
M	then pay for the heart bypass surgery .
M	i don ' t know - maybe it ' s just me - but any xbox game i order seems to spin and not run - due to the ' lovefilm ' sticker on the middle - maybe rethink this .
M	i purchased some shoes online for my girlfriend ' s birthday , a pair of nice red high heels - when the package arrived ( very quickly , i might_add ) it seemed a little too large for just a pair of high heels - upon getting it home , i double_checked the contents , and to my amazement and horror - wrong shoes - instead , i had a pair of ( admittedly cool looking ) wellies .
M	uh - oh .
M	however , after a quick e_- mail to the care department , i was straight in contact with louise and sarah , who , i have to say were bloody fantastic , and an_absolute credit to the company .
M	they were understanding , incredibly efficient , and were straight onto sorting_out the issue .
M	they said they ' d do what they could , and within 0 minutes flat , they ' d called me back , having spoken to the shoe supplier , and the new shoes were being boxed up and sent via first_class special delivery .
M	those shoes arrived just now - less_than 00hours after i first reported the problem .
M	as a good will gesture , they also said i could keep the wellies and give them to my girlfriend too , rather_than send them back .
M	now normally , with an error like this , it ' d mean less stars on a review - but the way this was handled !?
M	you guys deserve nothing less_than 0 .
M	great customer_service like this is rare these days , and friendly , helpful staff like sarah and louise are a rare breed .
M	you guys are absolutely awesome .
M	thank_you so much for all your help .
M	cheers

M	stay_away from these !
M	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
M	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman ' s , small jacket - i am a man ).
M	when i rang up they offered me another jacket with a different brand which i did not want so they offered me a refund but only when they collected the woman ' s jacket .
M	i managed to find this jacket else where , but as a result of the late refund , couldn ' t buy it as i didn ' t have the money .
M	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn ' t have suffered on my trip .
M	awful company .
M	awful staff .
M	stay_away from these , they are not worthy of your money
M	all information about the hostel was relevant and accurate .
M	no booking_fees is very good too .
M	nice attractive website , nice usability and easy to navigate around .
M	nice and simple to search for a hostel in a certain city .
M	0_stars !
M	i ' ve had great customer_service , as well as found great prices on all the products i normally buy .
M	nice work !
M	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
M	do you really think a sample_pack ( 0 pills ) really costs anything when shipping 0 lbs of protein or 00 lbs of drinks ?
M	bull .
M	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .
M	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
M	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
M	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
M	used sportsbike shop again and once again received brilliant service .
M	there was a little mishap at the checkout where it didn ' t take money off when using a voucher_code but this was quickly and efficiently dealt_with by the customer_services team .
M	items arrived quicker_than_expected , ordered tuesday and arrived wednesday .
M	remarkable .
M	well_packaged , great service .
M	keep it up !
M	the fitter rang and told me he was going to be a bit late but kept me informed and up to date which was good .
M	when he arrived he was well manners and great to talk to , we talked while he carried_out the tyre_fitting and he even saved me Â£_00 by showing me that my tracking didn ' t need doing .
M	overall a very pleasant_experience from grippy and i will be using them and recommending to friend in the future .
M	a very straight_forward website makes it easy to order lamps at reasonable prices .
M	even_though there are minimum order quantities , their prices mean that you get the item you want at a good price , plus spares .
M	to allow quicker delivery , i was contacted with an_alternative item suggestion .
M	they were polite and very helpful .
M	the items were dispatched quickly and arrived on the day i was told , exceedingly well wrapped .
M	i would definitively use again for my lighting needs .
M	lampshop online was a very good retailer suggestion from amazon . co . uk and work very well with their courier fedex .
M	a 0 star thumbs_up to both of them .
M	was recommended to parcel0go by a buyer on ebay as was limited to buyer collect only for larger items .
M	parcel0go has allowed me to extend my delivery options to the whole of the uk .
M	their website is very easy to get quotes for and will tie all your orders together if you use the same email address and do not create an account at first , as i did .
M	there prices are competative and allow you to goes from a wide_range of dispatch methods varying on speed and cost .
M	i have only had one issue which related to not being_able to edit my registered email address , but their livechat service is very good and helpful .
M	i was assisted by craig who ' s messages came_across friendly and polite , which is not an easy task when only using text based communication .
M	as services go , parcel0go is very useful and from my experience , they have the back - up customer support to go with it .
M	i have been using hostelbookers for quite some time for my travel solutions when it comes to accommodation .
M	i love how i get instant replies with regards to bookings .
M	also , the site is more like what you see is what you get .
M	last_year when i confirmed some bookings for vietnam , hostelbookers wrote to me a couple of days_later stating that they had received negative_feedback for the hotel i booked so they refunded the entire money and asked me to book an_alternate hotel .
M	good jobs guys for going the extra_mile to ensure that your guests are happy .
M	cheers .
M	just ordered a printer and subsequently a tonor from these_guys - absolutely_faultless !
M	great price , quick delivery and superb product , what more could you ask for ?
M	!
M	after an accident at work i contacted aah , who fully helped_me with my claim , relieving extra stress from my situation .
M	staff were extremely professional throughout , and i ' d thoroughly_recommend to anyone who has had / will have a similar situation in the past or in the future .
M	pretty safe bet in you want good advice and well prices supplements .
M	they have a great selection of products at even better prices ( shame about the uk tax !).
M	always quick to receive my orders from them .
M	i would recommend .
M	i have ordered from them many_times .
M	only time i don ' t order with them is when i need a product they don ' t sell .
M	when you use other_places you realise how great these_guys really are .
M	good prices , very quick delivery and clear communication .
M	keep up the good work .
M	every time i have used this company there has been a problem .
M	0st time i ordered 0 things .
M	0 days_later i had not received anything .
M	i had to ring up and contact them to find 0 of the 0 things were out of stock .
M	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
M	they then send me the wrong product .
M	i then had to return it before waiting for them to send the right product .
M	they offered my 0 %_off my next order .
M	when i tried to use this , the code they gave did did not work .
M	says everything .
M	i was then stupid enough to order yet again from them .
M	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
M	avoid !!
M	!
M	superb prices for great products , will order again .
M	yet another top service by hifi_headphones , quality product delivered next_day .
M	thank_you !!
M	!
M	top kex without top prices !
M	!
M	i just started using supplement wearhouse .
M	i think depending_on where u live the shipping can get a little pricy but the products are really cheap for the brands you want .
M	plus they give you a free gift .
M	and its only a few dollars difference from other website .
M	its great !
M	onlinekeystore is a fantastic website that does exactly_what its designed to do .
M	it gets you keys for games quickly and easily , using an easily_accessible and usable website that makes the overall shopping_experience a pleasure .
M	highly_recommended .
M	just to start off , i only selected 0 star because you had to choose , otherwise it would be - 00 ..
M	if only i would of read reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
M	originally joined them about 0 and a half years_ago with just internet and phone at my old address , while with them it was fine , the bill was never what we agreed to pay but we guessed it ' s probably like that with most companies .
M	we recently decided to move house and when i contacted talktalk i realised they had forget to mention to me that the 0 year contract was up 0 months previous but they had put me on a rolling_contract .
M	after i rang them i told the guy on the phone that i actually was going to move to sky as we wanted the tv channels etc .
M	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0 weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
M	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled ..
M	the channels took about 0 / 00 seconds to change on a good day .. but most of the time would take about 0 - 0 minutes to change occasionally crashing and having to be completely restarted !
M	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
M	i contacted talktalk after 0 months of this poop and they where completely cooperative saying they understand it was their mistake , they will cancel my contract without having to incur any early cancellation_fees , they would send me a bag and all i had to do was send them their tv box .
M	it was great , i found an amazing deal with sky !
M	i mean literally all the tv_programmes , movies , sports , unlimited_internet , phone etc for about Â£_00 per_month !
M	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about Â£_000 . 00 from talktalk .
M	i rang up to dispute this and they said they had made a mistake and they would wipe the debt , however they could only wipe Â£_000 . 00 of it because Â£_000 . 00 of it was for the cost of the talktalk box although i still hadn ' t received the bag to send the box back in the post .
M	they said they would send one out straight_away .
M	a few weeks_later i received a reminder from talktalk that if i didn ' t pay them their money which had gone up from the original debt , they would pass me on to debt collections .
M	i rang straight_away and said how_dare they threaten me when its their problem , they apologised a lot said they made a note on the account and then told me they would send out another bag and that they made a note on the account .
M	i then received the bag in the post and at the same time i received a final reminder saying that they had not received the payment and if they don ' t within the next few_days they would pass the account onto debt_collectors , i rang talktalk furious saying i had only just received the bag and that i was planning to send the item out that day , they said that ' s fine as long as they receive it i will be okay , the guy on the phone even told me he would personally ring me back on friday which was about 0 days_later , and that he had made a note on the account .
M	on friday i had no phone call , however i did receive a letter from a debt collecting agency saying that my account had been passed_onto them and that talktalk want their money .
M	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do .. he said talktalk don ' t have an_email address for me to contact them but i told him i refuse to ring them again .
M	i doubt they actually do write a note on the account , it seems like people on here have mutual feeling about talktalk .
M	i am absolutely_furious , this has caused me stress , i have spent so much money ringing them up and being on hold , one time for 00_minutes !!!
M	and my ordeal isn ' t even over yet !
M	avoid talktalk !
M	!
M	the football_manager 00 game is brilliant .
M	started with the famous glasgow rangers in the scottish league 0 , i have guided them to two scottish challenge cups , 0 scottish cup win and 0 scottish cup runner - up !
M	i found your site the most affordable so thanks a lot !
M	my order arrived on time as expected .
M	and the selection is quite good , i must confess i got surprised with the real result , looks way better_than the pictures online .
M	thank_you
M	lambda - tek sent out the shipment with ups the same day as the order and it arrived two days_later :)
M	the shipping is a little expensive if you are just buying something for 0 â¬ but else the site works great .
M	i have sent a lot of parcels with parcel 0 go for pleasure and business and always find the service to be brilliant .
M	they are always , fast at responding and efficient .
M	a recent issue i had catherine sorted for me and was brilliant , if everybody was like her the world would be a better place .
M	i have no_problems in recommending parcel 0 go to anybody looking for a courier .
M	this site is by_far the best i have ever_seen .
M	i ' ve researched for the past week and still could not find a better site to purchase supplements .
M	i will_continue to buy my supplements from supplementwarehouse . com from now on !
M	i am so amazed with the amount of items i bought and the price i paid .
M	you definitely have to take_advantage of all the free_samples and other discounted prices !
M	a ++ for sw
M	i have used hostelbookers on several_occasions now and never had a problem with a booking .
M	its also a bonus not paying any booking_fees .
M	compromise with deadline , efficiency , great consumer support and much more , are the reasons_why i am always ordering from digitalrev .
M	you are awesome !
M	thank_you very much for all .
M	kind_regards ,
M	f
M	great email communication on the status of my order , well_packaged and labelled and the delivery was extremely fast .
M	wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend .
M	i had a very pleasant_experience dealing_with the londonmagic store .
M	there was a problem with one of the items they shipped to me and the issue was resolved very timeously and professionally .
M	an excellent company to work with .
M	i just booked my honeymoon with the help of daniel .
M	he was extremely_helpful and made excellent recommendations and suggestions .
M	the whole_process from initial_enquiry to booking was seamless .
M	now we can ' t wait to go on the honeymoon !
M	!
M	i ordered some pandora charms 0 weeks_ago .
M	they never arrived and i have contacted achica twice to ask for an update .
M	the excuse provided was : unfortunately due to the volume of goods physically received the distribution centre are slightly behind in despatching the orders .
M	surely this is not a valid reason ?
M	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
M	this is what any proper company would do !!
M	and , to make_matters worse , i have still not received my order .
M	i recently was looking for a new drum_kit and found myself drawn to gak - they do good prices for complete drum kits , but are slightly more_expensive for tom - heads .
M	however , they are very good for individual drum heads .
M	i would definitely_recommend them !
M	imdb provides everything factual about any movie anywhere on the planet .
M	it ' s so easy to use , and makes looking for information about an actor or actress in a movie as easy as pie !
M	i don ' t use it that often , simply because i don ' t watch movies that often , but when i do i ' ve found it undoubtedly useful .
M	i enjoy using skype , but it sometimes feels_like it isn ' t integrated into my computer system well enough .
M	it often feels_like an outskirt of a program .
M	however , it does provide easy free video calls or video and provides cheap calls from computer to mobile .
M	ebay is one of my all time favorite sites !
M	the build of the website is smooth , professional and easy to use once you get used to it .
M	bear in mind the content is dependent on the people that use it , so don ' t expect the same every time you search for something to buy .
M	expect a slightly lengthy set - up for you account ( 00 - 00_minutes ), but don ' t be put off because it ' s more_than worth it and doesn ' t require any effort to maintain .
M	paypal is also used in combination to ebay making it a primary source for birthday_presents .
M	no matter what it is i ' m searching , google is never far away !
M	i find google really easy to use , its got many different ' apps ' attached to it , for example maps , url shortener , images etc .
M	as a search_engine it ' s brilliant - it also allows other programs to feed in to it , for example internet security such as avg support it .
M	and it ' s a friendly face when in the need to search for something .
M	nothing beats being_able to buy something online without_worrying_about whether the bank_details are safe or whether the site i ' m using is genuine .
M	because paypal is independent to to the websites you visit , it makes it perfect if you ' re not sure if you want to trust the site you ' re going to with your bank_details !
M	it keeps them safe in virtual high security and is a joy to use .
M	mazuma was really easy to use , i wasn ' t sure how much i ' d get from my phone considering it was old and not in very good condition at all , but amazingly it sold for a really good price - Â£_00 for an old_nokia_0000 classic :) would have been Â£_00 even if it wasn ' t working !
M	worthwhile , it didn ' t take long either ... just make_sure you know what phone you ' ve got !
M	don ' t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
M	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don ' t offer compensation .
M	pathetic response and truly reflects the 0rd class service they offer .
M	i sincerely say to future customers , don ' t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !
M	no_complaints , fast service , easy application , fast payout !!!
M	brilliant loan company .
M	first time using cjs , however very impressed with the service .
M	the autokey delivery system worked great and i had my key in seconds .
M	almost Â£_00 less_than retail too !
M	will buy from again .
M	my first purchase was fast , and easy , product was much cheaper then on any other website .
M	supplement_warehouse has the best price on most of the supplements i ' m looking for .
M	this is my first time ordering so i haven ' t received my things yet , so i don ' t know how quick they are .
M	i will get back to this
M	game arrived day before_release , perfect .
M	always one of , if not the , cheapest price online .
M	i had to cancel some orders with them recently due to finding an offer elsewhere and they obliged no questions_asked as well as refunding me the difference when their price went down on a couple of pre_- orders i ' d already paid for .
M	they even allowed me to combine 0 separate_orders to save on the postage when i realised it was free delivery for orders over Â£_00 and that was despite the 0 orders being for games that were being released on separate days and hence delivered separately .
M	absolutely unfaultable
M	no fees !
M	everything was perfect .
M	very fast to book , good search_engine and helpful reviews !
M	recommended .
M	the vast_majority of the orders i have made with asos have arrived early , all in great condition .
M	one the occasions i have had to return items there have never been any_issues ; when a package went missing from a secure place outside my property , they even refunded me the amount and gave me discount on my next order .
M	i preferentially shop with asos over high_street retailers because i am so happy with the service .
M	supplement_warehouse is an awesome place to buy supplements .
M	it ' s cheaper_than the stores in town and reliable .
M	i have ordered with them a few_times and they always deliver .
M	i haven ' t had any_problems with them .
M	they also have amazing deals going on all the time .
M	i had a few issues with my account and anna from id called me and with in minutes of being on the phone it was all sorted .
M	very good customer_service will always use ironmongery direct for my supply ' s .
M	bought products from lyco direct were sent by fed - ex next_day arrived at 00 . 00 next morning .
M	the box was a bit bashed but the sender had packed the items well so no_problems there .
M	is the first time i have used fed - ex and sadly the last judging_by the reviews .
M	was a good fast service though
M	bought some stuff from a trade supplier forgetting that they use parcel_force , paid Â£_00 . 00 for am delivery for today .
M	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without any one spotting the mistake .
M	at 00 . 00_hours there still in belfast
M	do not use parcel_force please
M	fast delivery , good quality :)
M	i have bought washing maschine as in stock and i paid for next_day delivery after that ive been waiting 0 weeks for delivery
M	very rude customer_service
M	i will never use apliances direct again
M	plenty of stock in a fairly rare size tyre , including a range of quality to cheaper options , therefore prices ranging_from roughly Â£_000 all the way down to Â£_00 !
M	very user_friendly site , and my order came within 0 day on standard delivery .
M	do not get your tyres anywhere_else as its impossible to get better customer_service , and choice !
M	stay clear away from this " company ", it is the biggest ripoff i have ever come_across and wasn ' t able to do anything about it !
M	these reviews on trustpilot are soooo not reliable and i assume they are fake , after my bad_experience with doyouspain . com i checked tripadvisor . com and read all the horror oboe things about them , i wish i had read them ...
M	my experience :
M	ripoff no . 0 :
M	i rented a car in gran_canaria which supposed to cost 00 Â£ roughly according to their website , i received emails quick witch confirmations etc .
M	they kept sending me mails about " insurance ", to buy it through doyouspain . com for like 00 - 00 Â£ otherwise i ' d be paying around 00 â¬ at the airport in gran_canaria .
M	i thought to myself , i do not need an insurance .
M	once i got to gran_canaria i was told i have to buy an insurance for 00 â¬ or i pay them 000 â¬ just in case something happens as deposit , 000 â¬ is ridiculous anyway ...
M	i got so upset and said " ok , charge my card 000 â¬ i don ' t want to pay for insurance ", the lady was obviously not expecting this response and said that debit_cards cannot be charged 000 â¬ and literally forced me to take up the insurance !
M	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw polo by 000 â¬ plus the 00 Â£ i paid already .
M	on to the next thing they ripped me off with .
M	ripoff no . 0 :
M	she then told me that i have to pay for the fuel that is in the car .
M	i suddenly became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don ' t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 Â£ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
M	so , i got scared that i end up with no car because of the season and overpaid .
M	guess_what they charged me for fuel ....?
M	i had to pay 00 â¬ for fuel which seems to be normal when you ' re from the uk or germany , but i drove the car nuts so i ran out of the fuel and had to refuel the car .
M	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel costs like 0 , 00 â¬ or 0 , 00 â¬ which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
M	i thought ok , i fuel the car with 00 â¬ and guess_what ...
M	the tank was half full !!!
M	!
M	this was a modern way of riping off people !
M	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
M	!
M	this is the fifth printer we have had from printerland .
M	each time we have purchased oki printers as the quality seems high and when purchasing through printerland , they offered a 0 year onsite support .
M	we have used this in the past and the service from printerland and oki combined has been excellent .
M	we did have an issue when purchasing a colour printer that was primarily going to be used for black only printing .
M	we were told that we could set the printer to only ever use black .
M	unfortunately this was not true as the printer primes the colour toners before every use and unnecessarily used up the colour toners .
M	we explained to printerland that this wasn ' t fit for purpose and with a few emails back and forth , they arranged for a replacement mono printer to be delivered .
M	since then we have purchased 0 more printers from printerland .
M	although toners and accessories can be purchased cheaper elsewhere , printerland are always happy to match the prices .
M	the customer_services team is attentive and they follow_up every order .
M	the sending of the invoice after delivery is a nice feature , rather_than having to download from the website directly .
M	delivery is swift and free .
M	i wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending printerland to others .
M	this is a great website to order and booked for tyres .
M	if you book in_advance you get around Â£ 0 off a tyre .
M	really easy to use just need to know your tyre size , dont trust the number_plate option as its not that reliable .
M	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :
M	we ordered our internet online .
M	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
M	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
M	they even lie to us by saying that they won ' t be doing it .
M	as i can proof it through my bank state i am on a quite certain side .
M	additionally their service people never any clue about our package or any service we have ordered .
M	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
M	further they keep on sending us bills we should pay for we have not ordered .
M	let ' s see where this is leading to .
M	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
M	just annoying this company !
M	my recommendation : stay_away from talk_talk , you will regret signing_up !
M	i was looking for a nice card folder themed to the latest m00 magic series , after a search on google i found one that i loved .
M	i ordered it on a wednesday_evening and it arrived friday_afternoon .
M	wonderful service and excellent quality .
M	extremely polite , nice staff , great service and are very helpful .
M	installed everything i needed on my dedi server .
M	showed me how to use everything and how to set things up .
M	i got the server on the same day i ordered it .
M	i would recommend this company to anyone .
M	its a pleasure to be of their custom .
M	i love supplement_warehouse and will be using them for all of my supplement purchases .
M	the prices are the cheapest i have ever_seen online and they have wonderful products .
M	i found my whey_protein on here for half of the price of the local gnc by my house .
M	i think it is great how they also give free_sample packs of products on their site for you to try out .
M	their sales are also great , i got a couple t shirts from their site that cost $ 0 . 00 and i will be wearing to the gym and showing to my friends to recomend them !!
M	!
M	the service provided met expectations .
M	the order came through quickly .
M	i had a technical issue which was addressed within_00hrs .
M	so would definitely use this company again .
M	hadn ' t used these_guys before but they were the cheapest by a wide margin on the solomon quest 0d boots i ' d promised myself for a very long time .
M	wasn ' t disappointed , got them on the third working day from ordering , just over a week before_christmas .
M	top service and highly_recommended !
M	we ' ve bought twice from oak_furniture land twice now , and both_times we ' ve been left flabbergasted .
M	imagine a company that sold good quality , well_designed furniture .
M	now imagine that it was well_priced , and kept in stock for quick delivery .
M	now image they had a good sales force who weren ' t pushy , and a well_designed and easy to use website .
M	madness .
M	now on top of all that imagine they went and done something crazy .
M	like what they said they would , when they said they would .
M	what ?
M	this is britain , right ?
M	0000 ?
M	bonkers .
M	oak_furniture land promise to get in touch to let you know when they will deliver your furniture .
M	they do .
M	they give you an exact day .
M	they stick to it .
M	they then say they will let you know a few_days before what time window ( down to 0 hours ) they will deliver it in .
M	they do that too .
M	then they say they will phone when they are 00_minutes away .
M	yep , you guessed it - they do that too .
M	then they make outlandish promises about putting the delivery in whatever room you want .
M	they only go and do that too .
M	final polish , is when you sign for it , you are not signing the condition of the delivery off - only that you have received it , and they delivery guys haven ' t taken chunks out of your walls getting it in the door .
M	you get 00_hours to pop it out its packaging and look it over - and they give you the customer_service card to use if you have any dramas .
M	in both deliveries ( of 0 dining_table , 0 chairs , 0 giant mirror and 0 chunky sideboard ) we ' ve had 0 issues .
M	0 complaints .
M	and of all the promises they ' ve made - they ' ve kept everyone .
M	i genuinely recommend them to everyone , including you !
M	fast and reliable
M	really really impressed with speckyfoureyes . com .
M	excellent value for money .
M	excellent value for money , reasonable shipping_costs , fast devilvery
M	people need to understand how to use ryanair and quit complaing .
M	if you want to spend Â£_000 quid on a ticket each go and do it , no one is stopping you .
M	people who dont think pay too much !
M	hand_luggage only for a one week stay ( what more do you need ), go to the postoffice and get a pre_- paid card for nothing , hunt around for the best deals and fly cheap .
M	the planes are new , the fleet has one of the best timing figures etc in the business .
M	yes some flights are late , but last time i paid Â£_000 to fly with ba i was 0 hours late .
M	that is transport !
M	if you want to take a family away in the school holidays , loads of luggage , tons of bags at the airport and forget to check in online it might cost you a lot more - but compare it to the normal airlines charges and it is still not that expense .
M	it depends on how well you can read the terms and conditions and apply them to your needs .
M	i have had 00 flights in two years with this company and each one has been ontime ( maybe a few minutes late ) very cheap and excellent service .
M	im a lover of weekends away so i book weeks in_advance , travel with hand_luggage and spend my money and energy on enjoying the city i am visiting rather_than finiding a negative with the airline .
M	if you are paying 00 quid for a return_flight to have a fantastic weekend then who_cares !
M	if you are a family of 0 , taking a 0 week vacation , booked last_minute , with extra suticase , turn_up at the airport with too much luggage then yes , they become expensive but the key is understanding who and what the service provided is for !
M	i have used just_eat many a time as it ' s easier for me to pay by card rather_than cash .
M	everytime i order through the website it takes the double the time if i call and pay by cash .
M	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
M	why would i order and pay an extra charge to order through a website for collection .
M	i then had to ring the takeaway place who said they are delivering the order and to ignore just_eat as they had asked them to get this sorted many_times .
M	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
M	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .
M	its clear just_eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
M	wont be using again - would far rather pay the high prices for deliverence with much_better service levels if i find myself in a cashless situation again .
M	just started using this service as always in the past thoght the new late fees etc was too good to be true .
M	have found the helpful and true to there word and is a really simple , fast easy service to use .
M	very impressed
M	there was 00 of us that went on our stag_do and everything went really well .
M	being in charge it was alot easier to let another company worry_about paying for everything and all the guys just had to pay them direct , if we had done it ourseleves and paid for everything up front we wouldnt of been able to do half the stuff .
M	the hotel was good for us , we asked for budget to keep the costs down but it was still quad rooms not dorms and there was an on site bar which we didnt expect to .
M	the half day paintball and mud buggy driving were wicked and everyone had a laugh , plus we got extra paintballs than we were originaly told which was a bonus .
M	nightclubs , casino and strip_club were all the goodl , que jump and dint have to pay entry on the night which was good as kept our whip entierly for the beer fund .
M	have got another one with release in the summer which we booked with the voucher they gave us for using them again so hopefully that goes just as well .
M	i booked a city_link service .
M	they came within a few hours to collect it and it was delivered the next_day with no_problems .
M	nice and simple !
M	highly_recommend !
M	i ' ve used travel_republic a number of time now and always had a good experience .
M	very easy to use site , with great prices .
M	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
M	well i say delivered , that is if being chucked outside the wrong house in the rain .
M	customer_service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
M	absolutely_useless !
M	use at your own peril f - 0 / 0
M	ordered a game off of them due to it being cheaper_than any downloading services alternative !
M	was quick and painless .
M	the extra security via text was also very nice to see .
M	would recommend .
M	so , naturally , as a couple bearing the weight of american student loans , working in china and resting in bangkok , we find the cheapest guesthouse possible in bangkok through hostelbookers . com , and find our experience there not only to be affordable , especially with that extra ten percent on credit ... but also the best community experience in thailand , trumping our last visit four years_ago !
M	we are musicians , so immediately falling in love with the musical atmosphere ( amps , guitars and drum set provided !
M	), and surrounded with fellow backpacking artists alike from around the world , we feel_like we ' re in heaven , enough to make a hard bed feel_like a victoria mattress on a kang bed !
M	the neighborhood ( far from the western backpacking frenzy and empire of khao san ) was fantastic , with tons of popular local street food and markets surrounding the area .
M	the bus was easily_accessible , and connected directly to the mrt train just a few minutes away !
M	the owner of the overtay ( the name of the guesthouse ) was also super friendly , intelligent and very cultured .
M	he set_up a projection screen for all the guests on some nights , and we all watched hilarious , independent comedy flicks !
M	we didn ' t realize just how much fun we would have by booking a night in an unknown space with our american credit_card !
M	i have bought from chemicals0research . com for a long while now and have yet to be disappointed .
M	the service is always prompt , professional and well communicated .
M	the range of products is amazing and are progressively expanding , much to my wallets unhappiness !
M	the item i like the most is 0 - apb powder and it was exactly_what i wanted and expected .
M	the quality is excellent and consistent .
M	i ' ve tried this in both the powder and pellet form .
M	a rc company unlike others with quality reassurance , quick deliveries and unrivalled prices chemicals0research . com .

M	i was pointed in the direction of trustpilot via a friend who suggested i do a bit of digging about a company i was about to use for something and decided to add my two pence about other_companies and services i have used , great great site , just have to take everything with a pinch of salt as everyone has they ' re own experience !

M	love it !
M	sara was truly amazing , we visited 0 times over the weekend ... after this being where i got my fiancÃ©es engagement_ring we went back for our_wedding_bands & the help we received was truly outstanding ...
M	i would recommend to anyone after great jewellery & service ...
M	tried to recycle phone elsewhere , to no_avail , used envirophone & they do exactly_what it says on the tin ... others out there may offer more , but if you want the best deal & service use envirophone ...
M	a0 service , envirophone took_forever bt mazuma , better_than_expected & would use them first nxt time without a shadow of a doubt ...
M	very very expensive service .
M	not even up to the standards
M	ordered on a thursday before the next_day delivery cut_off , unfortunately they didnt manage to do it in time ( it happens !)
M	but was emailed saying the delay and if i would accept the saturday delivery instead ( paid for by them ), unfortunately the packer didnt send it via this so i got it on monday but really quick responses from these_guys , gave me a refund on my delivery cost which tbh is good for me .
M	i wasnt in a huge rush so i appreciate them giving me a refund when they really didnt need to !.
M	excellent company , as i always say .. you only truly know how good or bad a company is when something_goes_wrong , hifi delivered on correcting this :).
M	will be buying from them again !.
M	no problem with the service i product i received .
M	brilliant .

M	just a great service .
M	there help was really good and quick , thanks for your help
M	the staff are always extremely_helpful and welcoming .
M	also very knowledable about what they do , but manage to be so that they don ' t make you feel inferior .
M	bought my first electric from here and plan to continue doing so for the forseeable future .
M	i ordered a sapphire 0000 graphics_card and paid for 0 - 0 day postage .
M	it came on the 0rd working day , very well_packaged and i am very happy !
M	i just built a server and ordered all the parts from ocuk .

M	very good service .
M	used this site for years .
M	always fast and reliable with helpful customer_service if required .
M	flashbay provided ecuity with a high_quality service right from our initial inquiry .
M	samples were deliver promptly allowing us to progress to the design stage were time was taken to ensure matched the final product to our brand requirements .
M	production turnaround and delivery were also managed efficiently and professionally with our product delivered on time as promised .
M	best price and the free next_day delivery was bang on .
M	items that were shown as in stock were not , this resulted_in my order sitting in their system not being dispatched .
M	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
M	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
M	and don ' t get me started on the ' one - click ' name .
M	however , the items i ordered were great quality and as cheap as i could find them on the web .
M	personally though , i ' m not sure it was worth the hastle .
M	no reservations , i would recommend this company to anyone .
M	this is the first time i ' ve tried using them .
M	i thought i would use their price_match promise , quoting another sites product .
M	all they did was cancel my order with them .
M	as i ' ve started keeping discus i ' m currently buying lots of equipment but i won ' t be using them again .
M	i also just bought the items from their competitor .
M	this is the email they sent me
M	hi stephen ,
M	we have investigated your price_match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
M	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
M	in this situation if the competitor has the item ( s ) in stock and will honour their advertised price we would recommend going with them .
M	kind_regards [_name ]
M	the warehouse aquatics team
M	items are very reasonably_priced , speed of delivery was excellent and we ' ll packaged .
M	highly_recommended
M	well what can i say i ordered my new lens ( a tokina 00 - 00mm f0 . 0 dxii ) from digital_rev sunday_evening , i woke_up to find an_email with tracking monday_morning , my lens touched down in gb @ 0 :_00am tuesday and was delivered 0 :_00pm tuesday .
M	what a fantastic service , ty digital_rev
M	by_far the best place to purchase supplements from .
M	great prices and great customer_service .
M	lots of specials during every order .
M	they have a very user_friendly website and you can book with a low deposit .
M	i only paid Â£_00 and they were also the cheapest i could find and believe me i looked around !!
M	can ' t fault them so far ...
M	i placed an order on a friday and i received my product the next_day !
M	this is outstanding customer_service , especially as they offer free delivery !
M	i would highly_recommend using this company .
M	they are also very competitive and i often find that their products are the cheapest around .
M	very happy customer !
M	ordered replacement batteries for my home phones at a very reasonable_price , including the delivery charge !.
M	very quick delivery and would definitely order from them again !

M	supplementwarehouse . com has everything you need and is cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	they also have incredibly fast and cheap shipping .
M	been coming to this site for years to get all of my supplements .
M	cheapest prices , vast_selection .

M	hope that the warehouse doesn ' t go anywhere anytime_soon .
M	great service , Â£_00 for my 0 yr_old_nokia , exactly_what it said on the tin !
M	great service , salesman was very helpful and not too pushy at all .
M	dropped Â£ 0000 from the price of the car before asking and finance sorted out very quickly .
M	expected to be there for hours and hours but everything wrapped up quickly and car was very clean .
M	waiting for item for a week and asked for a review in between so here it is .
M	no item received no email_saying when it could be delivered .
M	paid Â£_000_+ for trainers that i found slightly_cheaper afterwards with next_day delivery .
M	not happy .
M	had problems with a delivery that the seller had addressed the wrong person .
M	but with help from the live_chat i talked to someone called emma and she managed to help me with the address and redelivery .
M	excellent autokey service and super_fast system
M	i ordered my new system on boxing_day , and even_though it was the holidays , my order arrived just into the new year .
M	its an excellent and well put_together wee machine .
M	i used tshirt_studio because it ' s the top rated service of its kind on trustpilot .
M	i ordered the t - shirt with express delivery and it was very fast indeed - i received it before 00pm the next_day .
M	however , i had used a custom design for the t - shirt , and because some of the colours came out a bit darker on the t - shirt , a lot of the details in the original image were lost .
M	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
M	i would have appreciated some advice on the colours to use in my original image to make_sure it came out exactly how i ' d like .
M	then again , it was a gift to someone and they were thoroughly pleased with the result .
M	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
M	i placed my order on 00feb order itself didn ' t ship until the 00 and now its 0 mar ... and i ' m still_waiting .
M	should have just gone with bodybuilding . com which gets their stuff out here in 0 days tops .
M	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge ... that is outrageous !
M	i bought a salad from my local asda and when i was about to eat it i found a dead caterpillar inside it .
M	i took picture of it and called the head_office they said i need to give it back to the store and they will give me the refund and investigate and i will be sent a goodwill voucher .
M	when i went to return the salad the lady on the counter served a lady before me who left her pregnancy test strip on the desk , the lady said ohhh she left her dirty strip here then she covered her hand and picked_up the strip to chuck it in the bin and dint even apologize to me before serving me .
M	i called the head_office to see whats_happening with my case and i was told that its registered as a complaint and if i wanted them to investigate then i should have told them , after that they took my details and the manager of the local asda called to say sorry . i sent an_email after that but i guess its case dismissed .
M	i bought the 00_%_off get bike deal .
M	i was told that i can book the day anytime and the voucher is valid till jun 0000 , but yesterday i checked my account and it showed Â£_00 . 00 taken out already and was over drawn so ill be charged on top , even_though i did not call the centre to book my day of training .
M	i sent an_email to groupon for refund but no reply yet .
M	great choice
M	great price
M	great service
M	problem started when i asked xln to transfer the broadband from one line to another ( i had 0 phone_lines from xln ).
M	instead they ceased one phone line as well as the broadband .
M	i called their customer_service and was told that the line was ceased due to a ' system error ' while broadband due to severe weather_conditions , which i obviously knew was an utter_rubbish .
M	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
M	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer_service .
M	i have received a letter telling_me that i will have to pay Â£_000 termination charges .
M	i called their cancellation department and explained the situation and loss of business i suffered due to their incompetencies .
M	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
M	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
M	i was a little_nervous_about hiring a lens , but i needn ' t have been .
M	the whole_process was clearly explained on their website , and regular_emails usefully kept me up - to - date at each_stage of the process .
M	my lens arrived on time and worked great .
M	i ' m already planning my next hire , and needless to say i wouldn ' t hesitate in recommending lenses for hire to anyone thinking of hiring a lens .
M	i bought ds game on friday_afternoon , arrived next_day in the morning .
M	very impressive .
M	fast dispatch .
M	thankyou .
M	i ordered an iphone 0 online with this company back in september and had to pay Â£_00 deposit which would come off my 0th bill .
M	i cancelled the contract after a week after orange said they did not know when i ' d receive the phone and i would get my Â£_00 back within a month .
M	a month had past and still no refund !
M	after spending 0 hours on the phone getting transferred from one department to the next the phone went dead ( lines had closed ) ring again the following_day and was told i would receive my refund in 00 days .
M	00 days_later and still nothing !
M	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
M	it ' s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
M	who do they think they are ?
M	if i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it !
M	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening legal_action !
M	like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for my money back .
M	will never go with orange in the future !
M	the jewellery_quarter in birmingham is rebound for it ' s engagement_rings and has many shops catering to this area .
M	having visited four shops before marlow ' s diamonds i can say with confidence that i would have saved a great deal of time and not suffered nearly as many pushy salesmen if i had just gone to marlow ' s in the first instance .
M	from the offset it was evident that their clerks knew what they were talking_about , and kindly took the time to fully understand what i was looking for .
M	their selection of high_quality stones is unmatched anywhere_else in the area and their ability to really design and personalise your ring is outstanding .
M	most_importantly , the clerk we dealt_with ( carmen ) was able to make the whole experience enjoyable and make my fiancÃ©e feel very special .
M	i was more_than happy with everything i received from marlow ' s and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone_else thinking about popping the questions to that special girl .
M	jason horne
M	great range of options and customisations .
M	really good service , even got a discount just by saving a spec and waiting a few_days .
M	competitive_prices compared to other_retailers .
M	laptop made promptly , arrived with no issues , no bloatware , some very useful software on a cd complete with drivers too .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i ordered 0000 t -_shirts for the corporate & entertainment sector .
M	my order was processed , dispatched and delivered when promised .
M	the sales_team and owners were extremely_helpful every_step of the way .
M	the price was more_than competitive and they were far more professional than previous businesses i ' d dealt_with .
M	steven_james guitars is the best guitar store in the north east , with great variety of guitars and pedals there ' s not much this store doesn ' t have !
M	also has great customer_service who don ' t mind how long or many guitars you try out !
M	whether your looking to loose weight , bulk up or anything in between , myprotein offers almost everything you can ask for , or anything i ask for anyway , highly_recommended and constantly used .
M	first place i check when i need something new .
M	great offers and prices with fast delivery .
M	better_than the high_street ...
M	bought from them a couple of times now and the service has been top_class , packaging is minimal to reduce all over costs in general i imagine but using the express delivery option for an extra 00p has always seen the packages arriving quickly and undamaged .
M	there are no differences to the products compared to buying directly from the manufacturer ' s apart_from the huge_savings .
M	definitely my first stop for supplements .
M	superb service - i feel_like i can contact them at any time and that they are pleased to help and they are always polite and professional .
M	i spoke to katie and helped_me when i could not track my parcel so although i had a problem i was still able to get information easily .
M	i always use the live_chat as its convenient and like the service i get from parcel0go .
M	i was actually recommended to you from someone_else and i will also recommend where i can !
M	thanks !
M	i was desperate for a flash card and a new flash , i needed it within a few_days , and it came in two .
M	a life_saver !
M	i highly_recommend pc_specialist , great prices and superior quality .

M	i had the pleasure of dealing_with lisa bowers , and she could not have done enough for me , we spoke on the phone a few_times which added a personal_touch .
M	i ordered 00 usb ' s for my wedding photography , i decided to go for the executive type highly stylish and professional in looks .
M	i ' m just delighted with the results .
M	if you are reading this review i highly_recommend flash bay , i used a chinese company online and lost Â£_000 prior to using flash bay .
M	please don ' t make the same mistake as me .
M	avoid hengdausb a sam site .
M	i ordered a marshall guv ' nor gv - 0 foot pedal a few_days ago from this company and the price of the item and post and packaging was very decent the paying and ordering of the item was a breeze and they delivered the item on the estimated date today 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	item came in pristine_condition and well_packed in bubble_wrap as to prevent and breakages i would recommend using this company and i will do again in the future as they are prompt and realistically priced not to mention easy to use
M	easy to book , many options available to many destinations and you can get points for every booking and review .
M	you can change this points into small gifts .
M	fully recommeded !
M	quality product at great price , easy to use website means you can see exactly_what the end_result will be .
M	front and sides of van just as good as the pic of the back that is shown here .
M	sara hayes solved my problem within minutes , very very helpfull .
M	great customer_service skills and knowledge .
M	my experience was not good with this company .
M	i sent them my ipad 00gb as my on - line quote was Â£_000 - boxed , full working order , usb lead and in my opinion excellent condition as it has had a full cover on from day 0 .
M	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of Â£_000 !
M	i checked the website and i found in the time i had sent my ipad they had dramatically dropped the price of the trade in on ipad 0 which is fine , but i found they had rated my ipad in bad condition - scratched front and back , with a dent on the side apparently !
M	i can understand there to be a difference in opinion for the condition but not by this much !
M	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth Â£_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is Â£_000 they new price is now Â£_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the Â£_000 .
M	all ' s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of Â£_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn ' t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
M	can ' t fault this store , everything is awesome , will shop here forever .
M	very good no_problems , fast delivery , would use again .
M	great company
M	great shop all the time
M	banana_fingers is a store i always check out when i ' m searching for new climbing equipment .

M	this was my first time using supplementwarehouse . com and they ' ll compete prices with anyone and beat them !
M	excellent service , item arrived next_day , neatly_packaged and in fantastic condition .
M	would order from nevada again in a heartbeat .
M	they have whatever you need and for the best price .
M	great beer selection , very slick ordering_process and delivery is fantastic .
M	i ' ve used a number of online beer retailers and beers of europe are by_far the best .
M	this service provided me with exactly_what i wanted - a cheap , easy way to get money from my fiat account into btc .
M	as others have said , everything about the site is simple and intuitive , it feels trustworthy yet down to earth .
M	it would be nice if it could accept payments from credit / debit_cards , but that ' s completely not what the site is trying to do and i ' m well aware of the complexity and reasons other_sites don ' t allow credit_card -> virtual currency .
M	after being referred by a colleague i decided to give this musclefood a go , i placed my first order and entered the â hidden code â provided by my colleague , the offer was ; i would get 0 . 00kg of chicken_breast and he would get Â£ 0 off his next order .
M	when the food arrived the ice had ( just i think ) which i did not complain_about , i looked out for the extra chicken which did not arrive .
M	i â ve placed a second order a week_later with the musclefood hoping it would appear on the second order , this was not the case .
M	i contacted musclefood , i received a very poor response advising that i had to enter the code into the special promotions box for which i replied back that it is exactly_what i have done , i received a call a few hours_later advising that i would not receive the extra chicken_breast as i did not enter the code , when i challenged it the advisor suggested that it was my fault and i should have been more careful when processing my first order .
M	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has been handled , i would have spent close to Â£_000 a month -> Â£ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of Â£ 0 in chicken value .
M	i live in keyingham and the coverage is shit .
M	i come to hull and it ' s shit .
M	i have an ee contract and it ' s brilliant .
M	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
M	ok so here ' s my second review ( i ' m still a little bored and in need of something to do )
M	lovefilm .
M	what can i say .
M	i don ' t really think about it any more it just happens .
M	there has been the odd issue , where i sent back a dvd and it took_ages to arrive back , and where they sent me the wrong disc .
M	but hey mistakes_happen from time to time , and the way i look at it , it ' s how you deal with those mistakes that really define you , and they dealt_with it , no hassle , that ' s what i like , there ' s enough stress in this world already !
M	anyway i have my list of films , i tend to add a few here and there , they come , i watch , i send them back .
M	i also have the games option too but haven ' t made much use of that yet .
M	to be precise my package consists of unlimited dvd / blu - ray / games , 0 discs at a time , and unlimited online streaming .
M	i can ' t remember exactly_what i pay now , around Â£_00 a month i think , but considering what i used to be paying at blockbuster that ' s fine with me .
M	i ' d definitely_recommend them , and i ' m pretty sure they do a free_trial , so give them a go , what have you got to lose .
M	:-)
M	i ' ve bought from this site a few_times now and thought i ' d share my opinion with others by writing this review .
M	this is my first ever review for anything !
M	but i ' m at a loss for something to do right now so why not !
M	lol .
M	i ' ve just completed my latest order , and it ' s just so easy .
M	extrascents have a fairly good range of products but more would be great .
M	for me that has been the only_downside to what otherwise so far has been an excellent shopping_experience .
M	it ' s even better after you ' ve made your first order as you don ' t have to enter all your details ( delivery address , card_details etc ) again .
M	a bonus for me as i ' m not keen on filling out forms etc , hence this being my first review .
M	the website is easy to find what you ' re looking for .
M	the prices are very competitive , and the ordering is hassle_free .
M	they offer a free delivery service , always a bonus , and so far everything i have ordered has arrived just as i ' d expect .
M	i haven ' t had any dealing_with their customer_services yet so i can ' t really say how helpful they are .
M	they do however send you an_email after a couple of weeks asking you to review the product ( not the service mind ?)
M	and send you a discount for your next order if you complete the review .
M	i ' d definitely_recommend them to anyone_looking for a bargain on fragrance and cosmetics .
M	keep up the good work extrascents ( i wonder if they ' ll offer me a discount for this review ;-)
M	they have every brand you can think of .
M	good write ups for each product as well
M	i would recommend going to newcastle for a stag_weekend to anyone via chillisauce !
M	as long as you and the group you are going with are going to have a good time not a fat lot can go_wrong !
M	we stayed in the the jurys inn in newcastle about a 0 minute taxi drive into the main street .
M	the hotel itself was immaculate and the breakfast was great !
M	we got entry into various clubs and bars and the night life is fantastic and the people are great !
M	we went paint - balling on the saturday which was great fun with the lads and friendly staff but the paintball facility itself wasn ' t great as it was an open field with lots of obstacles .
M	all in all definitely a great weekend and a must do !
M	where to start .
M	firstly , speed checker on talk_talk ' s website provided an absurdly optimistic speed estimate for my area ( hither green , london ) presumably due to a software error .
M	i ordered their standard broadband package expecting a service fast enough to do all the usual things you ' d expect from the internet in 0000 , streaming hd video , having more_than a couple of devices hooked up etc .
M	anyway , we end up getting only 0 . 0mb down the line , the same speed i got on broadband a good 00 year_ago .
M	the house is in zone 0 in london so geography can ' t be a problem , surely .
M	anwyay , we made the call to upgrade to fibre and arranged over the phone for an engineer to make the installation on 00rd september and my flatmate booked the day off work to be there for the installation .
M	00rd rolls around and no engineer shows up .
M	phoned talk_talk and they say there ' s no record of anyone coming to make the installation and we ' d have to rebook another appointment ... the nearest one being 0 weeks away on 0rd october .
M	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south african talktalk customer_service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
M	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer_service representative then books me an_appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
M	i ' m in germany with work that day so i ask her to change it to 0th_october when i have a day off work .
M	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too_late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
M	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
M	at this point , i ' d had enough so i called customer_services who said they could put a note on the file to make provisions for compensation / credit but that i wouldn ' t be able to phone and sort this out until the bloody fibre service was installed .
M	the employee couldn ' t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre ' s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
M	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
M	finally call the ( premium_rate ) phone line to book another appointment and the earliest date available is now 00th_october .
M	what a surprise .
M	so now i have to take a day off work in addition to the pointless day my flatmate has already wasted , adding up to c . Â£_000 of missed salary / holiday time .
M	long_story short , save_yourself the hassle and go with bt or virgin .
M	i have dealt_with cheapsmells . com on 0 occasions and both have been very satisfactory .
M	i recently booked for 0 people to go to las_vegas staying at the planet hollywood and was just about to book with virgin holidays when i checked the price on goamerica . co . uk .
M	it was over 00_% cheaper for exactly the same holiday .
M	i just received the confirmation letter today - can ' t wait to go now !
M	roxy palace casino rocks !
M	i ' ve been lucky there a couple of times and the payouts are nice and quick .
M	best value & service on the net , my full order of 0 items all delivered with 00_hours , what else dose a contractor need .
M	got my key immediately .
M	customer support / service is excellent and right there on the page .
M	the key activated fine and im definetely shopping here again .
M	cheers !
M	i bought a pair of dragon sunglasses .
M	i was very pleased at the beginning but after i kept them in the car for a while they started to deform from the high heat inside .
M	i called them and they offered a refund on the spot .
M	i could not be bothered to send them back , because is not visible when i wear them .
M	nevertheless , i will_definitely buy from this shop again as it offers a great service and very good prices .
M	keep on the good work , you have 0_stars from me .
M	i had a few queries and needed a bit of advice .
M	so i used the live_chat and got an immediate_response from a chap called mike .
M	he answered and asked me questions advised me on my desktop ram how many to buy and keep my installed ram .
M	i found a cheap pair if discounted tights ( cycle clothing is overly priced everywhere anyway ) and this was the first pair of tights i ' ve ever bought .
M	i was extremely pleased to see the product arrive within 0 days .
M	however , i was just as satisfied even more so when i wore the tights .
M	great product .

M	hello all ,
M	perfect solution how to unlock your phone .
M	unlockservice work very fast and without no_problems .
M	thank_you !
M	!
M	i love the website design , the competition and sky in general :_d
M	i was suspicious to start with , the games were so much cheaper , but i thought i would give it a shot as i would save around Â£_00 .
M	i ordered my game late christmas_eve and received my key within 00_minutes .
M	i will be using simplygames very soon .
M	took over a month for parts to arrive after 0 + telephone_calls .
M	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
M	they just tell you a story to pacify you and get you off the phone .
M	collect when they say they will every time and i have never had anything ' go missing ' like other carriers .
M	very fast service and verification is effortless !
M	thank_you :)
M	i would recommend trend sunglasses to all my friends and family !
M	great prices , speedy_delivery and quality service like no other !
M	better_than all the major high_street shops !
M	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
M	i ' ve used pretty_much all the mobile networks in the past ; vodafone , orange , o0 ... and it seems the whole time i was paying too much for too little .
M	i wish i ' d discovered t - mobile sooner ; these days i get more messages , more data and more minutes for my money , and better coverage too !
M	i ' ll be honest , given the price i paid for my three - seater metal futon , i wasn ' t expecting much , but i have to say i ' m really impressed !
M	the bed looks good , is sturdy and surprisingly comfortable and the company were very friendly and accommodating , especially when it turned_out there was a manufacturing_fault with the mattress .
M	without any fuss whatsoever , sleep solutions arranged to have it swapped with a new one at my earliest possible convenience : very slick service indeed .
M	top_marks from me .
M	after receiving a refund ( for a significant_amount ) from a item brought on ebay , i waited for the usual 0 - 0 working_days for the amount to clear back into my account during this time it displayed as pending .
M	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
M	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don ' t know when you ' ll receive it .
M	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
M	i am pretty sure this is in breach of fsa regulations .
M	so avoid if you can but seeing though they ' re weaved into almost every online shop its not that easy !
M	i must have bought 0 pairs of glasses by now .
M	every time i can ' t believe the quality and price .
M	best place online to get specs .
M	0 * s in my opinion
M	so much_better value for money than using the networks provided insurance
M	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
M	got an_email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
M	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
M	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
M	i paid a Â£ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
M	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
M	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
M	they take your hard_earned money then send you an_email and deliver the flowers when they feel_like it .
M	not happy
M	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
M	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
M	please reply eflorist ?
M	even better phone me ?
M	their customer_services was very helpful , the card i need to make payment with had a different address , from my delivery and invoice address .
M	staff had no problem with processing the order .
M	goods arrived on time .
M	i ordered a fellowes venus a0 laminator and got a free prom pack from fellowes , which were posted for no extra_cost .
M	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
M	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
M	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
M	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra Â£ 0 .
M	would have had an extra Â£_00 on top of this if i hadn ' t gone with this company .
M	my advice would be avoid this company .
M	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name ] the md via_email if you â re not satisfied ; don ' t bother you won ' t get a response .
M	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
M	terrible customer_service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
M	supplementwarehouse . com has all the products you ' re looking for at the best prices you can find .
M	i love buy multiple months supplies of all my products .
M	the shipping is quick and reliable , within a week .
M	plus , you can usually find some interesting freebies to try out !
M	no really ...
M	i ' m waiting for our old dyson to die a death so i can justify buying a shiny_new one ...
M	the damned thing refuses to give up the ghost after 0 years of forced hard labour ...
M	even my 0 year_old_son didn ' t kill it when he pushed it down the stairs !
M	just all clipped back together !
M	maybe we ' ll have to try fire next !!
M	thank_you dyson for top quality kit ... you ' ve ruined my need to buy a new shiny model ...
M	honestly ...
M	i ' ve been with orange for many years ...
M	they never fail to deliver what they offer ...
M	customer_service is top_notch and when it came to upgrade i had no issues talking with them to bash out a deal that suited my needs at the right price !
M	top_marks folks ...
M	every online sales company should be like this one ... why settle for second best or faffing with ebay when its this easy ...
M	even the companies own kit is excellent for the money ... what more could you want ?
M	cheers folks ... keep up the good work !
M	received tickets today !
M	0nd of november !
M	came first_class !
M	thankyou
M	i received the order in reasonable time , but this item king of shaves super skin face scrub 000ml spilled almost half inside the package over other products .
M	i would be glad to receive a replacement .
M	excellently arranged with no hastle , alex the account_manager was really helpful , even managed to rearrange the karting 0 days before the stag as the last place got robbed .
M	well worth talking to chilly sauce , much_better_than some the the stag companies operations that i have seen on other dos .
M	these_guys are soon going to be making and providing all our services from phones to entertainment to food delivery .
M	google is the largest and most widespread company i can think of on the internet ; and off of it - to cover all grounds from email ( gmail ), photos ( picasa ), maps ( earth ), social ( buzz ), tv ( googletv ), translate ( translate ), operating systems ( chromeos ), mobiles ( android )... and the list_goes on and on .
M	im not going to say too much ; out of all their products i use gmail , android and their world - class search_engine the most .
M	in which i ' ve never been let_down .
M	the only thing is i personally don ' t like the new google image search ; but i ' m sure this will become better once we ' re all using faster internet providers .
M	good luck to google - and i hope they bring us many more great products in the future .
M	i am , like most teens - on facebook .
M	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
M	ive been using the service since late - 0000 and have watched the many updates .
M	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
M	instead of looking at making the website run faster , produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as ' the light box ' ( or theatre mode for viewing picture ) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc .
M	there are so many problems with facebook ; i question why ' we ' all use it still .
M	i understand its such a hive of activity ; but so is google - and they don ' t seem to have a problem ( thinking of all their services mail , search , checkout , translate , maps , picasa , buzz etc_.)
M	?
M	im not the only one to think this .
M	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
M	being_able to ' look through the keyhole ' at other_peoples lives ..... it is an astonishing thing facebook - its just so broken .
M	if facebook are reading this ; then here ' s my message .
M	ok , you ' ve sorted out the privacy ( great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting_out the stability and performance of your website ?
M	instead of tinkering with stupid things that no - one wants , and look crass ( i . e .
M	light - box ).
M	easy quick process from start to finish .
M	ordering on the internet is a lot more informative as you can see all the other tyre prices and details of the tyre ' s you wouldn ' t normally see .
M	very good choice of shades and really good value for money .
M	i can see so much_better now .
M	i have bought supplements from supplementwarehouse several_times , unlike every where else they are upfront about their pricing .
M	when you check out some places online their instore prices are different and they will not match it .
M	supplementwarehouse is straight_forward , honest , awesome , and the only place to get the best deals on supplements .
M	the shipping is great , affordable , and most_importantly fast .
M	thanks supplement_warehouse for being the best there is .
M	i ordered some stuff online and for a good price .
M	there was a bit of a cock up with the payment , probably my fault doing it over 0g_network .
M	i gave them a quick ring and it was sorted out straight_away .
M	i received the item next_day for free delivery .
M	spot on .
M	not a single glitch when buying an engagement_ring .
M	i was kept fully up to date with the progress .
M	they were happy to delay delivery so that the ring wouldn ' t arrive when the missus was at home .
M	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
M	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
M	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don ' t look to be in the freshest state .
M	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
M	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i ' m a monkeys uncle !
M	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
M	their customer_service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
M	i ' m still arguing for my refund , so far i have only been offered another bouquet .
M	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
M	i just bought a 0d ... placed order on friday , received it monday_morning .
M	i couldn ' t ask for better .
M	love the bbc website , just sucks that they were forced to shut_down some sections because they were too good and the competition complained !!
M	the bbc can do everything better_than anyone_else ... please let them !
M	cheapest price on web and next_day delivery even_though i ticked the free delivery option !
