F	i used live_chat today and sarah_h helped_me out with an order i was finding hard to book myself , rather_than talking me through it she gave me the option to do the order for me it took 0 mintues and she made it stress_free .
F	the service was great and i will use again in the future .
F	thank_you !!!
F	!
F	this has got to be the worst company i have ever had to deal with !
F	i ordered 0 tickets at the end of june this year ( that is 0 months_ago ) for a ben howard concert that took place on the 00th_november .
F	i was getting regular email_updates telling_me not to worry - my tickets were being tracked , they would be here etc .
F	well that was a load of s ** t . i rang the customer_service number several_times 0 days , 0 days and on the day of the event explaining i was yet to have my tickets !
F	i was originally told they would try and find me some other tickets - this was never taken up and on the day of the concert when i was still_waiting to receive my tickets i was simply told i would have to get a refund .
F	hold on , i booked these tickets 0 months_ago , have waited very patiently , they were for a birthday_present - and i was being told i could go to the gig ??
F	anyway 0hrs .. yes 0hrs before my gig in london - i am based in kent , my tickets finally arrived !
F	not only was this unacceptable and diabolical enough , leaving me in such a rush , but when i read the face_value of the tickets £_00 . 00 each i had paid over 0 x each per ticket plus nearly £_00 for p_& p that arrived so late i nearly missed the show !
F	this site is disgraceful , i got no help and should have been offered some kind of refund or at_least my £_00 postage returned back to me .. at the very least !
F	never use this site .
F	very badly run , and a massive rip_off !
F	i have been using this company to purchase gifts , cosmetics and fragrances for years now , i have never had a problem with their service and find them better_than some leading online stores who i have had a nightmare with .
F	fragrance_direct have always delivered my goods promptly and in perfect_condition , they have a gift_wrapping service which is absolutely divine .
F	their sales and promotions are amazing , i would definitely_recommend them !
F	spend a lot of my free time on smooch winning big money !!
F	:)
F	the company was really accommodating and managed to pick_up the coffee_table with just one day ' s notice .
F	they called us to let us know when they would be arriving and helped_us with the unloading .
F	the only thing i regret is not getting their business card !
F	thank_you :)
F	had a problem and sammie_taylor sorted it straight out for me .
F	i use parcel to go on a regular_basis and never have any_problems with them , if there is a problem they always sort it out !
F	very good company to deal with . fast and proffesional after dealing_with groupon and the infurn saga since nov . very good customer_service . thank_you
F	i ordered a big_boy beanbag in wk 00 and was told wk 00 .
F	now its wk 0 . so even if it does get sent out it will still be 00 weeks .
F	not good customer_service .
F	same as with everything right now as soon as you see unlock , iphones etc .
F	the first thing you think , oh .. maybe it is an scam ... should i ?
F	we ' ll i was thinking exactly that but i gave it a try .
F	and it has worked_perfectly .
F	no issues_whatsoever .
F	the only minor thing is the time .
F	it took 00h , but right now my iphone is perfectly unlocked via itunes .
F	as soon as i plugged it in , itunes itself said : congratulations , your iphone is now unlocked .
F	and since then everything works .
F	many_thanks officialiphoneunlock .
F	would recommend you any day .
F	i went to the doctors on the thursday to see if i could get an asthma inhaler and found out i wouldn ' t get the prescription until wednesday .
F	my inhaler was basically empty and i really needed one .
F	then i found health express .
F	i ordered on the friday and received my inhalers on the saturday .
F	absolutely amazing .
F	very fast delivery - would recommend to others
F	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my friend in australia for her wedding on february 00th .
F	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
F	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
F	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
F	two days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
F	today i rang the office number for iflorist and the call was answered by a completely disinterested member of staff .
F	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
F	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn ' t know what to say .
F	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
F	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn ' t seem at all concerned .
F	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
F	the occasion has passed and the surprise has been spoiled for a dear friend .
F	all i want in a refund for the £_00 i handed_over .
F	terrible , terrible service all_round .
F	please avoid this company at all costs .
F	lovely chat_hosts always welcoming and free money its lovely
F	i visited the tictac stand at blair atholl horse trials last month and saw a hat that i really liked .
F	the girls were friendly , approachable and helpful .
F	they went above and beyond to help me .
F	they ordered me a hat in and it was with the a few_days_later , posted to my door free of charge .
F	would highly_recommend this company .
F	trustworthy , reliable service !
F	website was recommended to me and have never ordered tyres this way but was simple to do and when i arrived at the garage at a time that suited me i get great service , dealt_with me straight_away and staff very pleasant and helpful .
F	would definatelt tell friends / family to order this way to
F	i originally found this site by trying to purchase the brand of vitamins for women called ' wellwoman '.
F	i went to hollands and barret first , then thought i ' d compare prices from the wellwoman official site .
F	not only was the vitabotics webpage better laid_out , the prices for the vitamins were alot less_than they were on h_& b , plus there was a sale on !
F	so i could not have been happier .
F	this will be my staple site for getting this amazing brand of vitamins that work for me .
F	the delivery time was ok and even got some freebie which was totally awesome !
F	i mean , which company ever give away freebies in this economic_climate ?
F	vitabiotics are number one !
F	wooohooo !!
F	!
F	fantastic weekend that included quad_biking , extreme buggy races , nude life_drawing , copious amounts of alcohol , sexy superheroes and toe jam !
F	i was particularly impressed with how well pet prescription handled my order .
F	they rang to check details and were pleasant and helpful on the phone .
F	the order was dispatched promptly too .
F	i would definitely_recommend this website .
F	i put my order at the same time as my housemate , she got hers 0 days afterwards .
F	i ' m not bothered by a delay in delivery per se , but i ' ve sent them 0 emails requesting despatchement confirmation and they simply do not reply .
F	can ' t find any telephone_numbers or other email addresses on their website , and it ' s just incredibly annoying .
F	i got an autogenerated email regarding my order - it had been put on hold .
F	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
F	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no_idea if my order went through or not .
F	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
F	we had shopped about quiet a bit for my wife ' s engagement_ring but found the perfect one at marlows .
F	we got a very fair price but nothing tops the service we received .
F	honest_opinions , great knowledge and such genuine friendliness that the purchase became even more special .
F	although living just outside london , there was no question of going anywhere_else when the time came to buy the wedding_bands .
F	ann & tor
F	thanks clive ( diginate ) for the assistance you had provided ; bumping up the production line to make it in time for my deadlined and giving me a student rate !
F	on top of it all , the results were fabulous !
F	i will be sending you pictures soon !
F	best !
F	i ordered a game for a christmas_present 00th_december_0000 .
F	needless to say it didn ' t come through in time , and upon_checking the website it was out of stock .
F	no communication , nothing .
F	i emailed asking for a refund .
F	no response .
F	0st march_0000 , i finally receive the game !!
F	that ' s almost three months with no communication whatsoever !!
F	what a joke .
F	we live in california and get our items shipped !
F	we love all the freebies and extras and the price_match does work accurately ( no you can ' t scam them !).
F	overall great company !
F	easy to navigate , provides all the information you need .
F	very clear about cancellation policies and doesn ' t rip you off on booking_fees .
F	great price , quick delivery and quick response to questions ask .
F	would use gameseek again .
F	horrible company will never use ever again not customer based just god_awful in general not plesant at all .
F	very condisending .
F	signal problems never listened to the problem and just presented written excuses .
F	poor company in general .
F	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
F	i decided to order some flowers for my grandma ' s birthday last_week and they didn ' t just come very late in the day but the quality of the flowers were awful .
F	they ' re already dying and only received them on thursday .
F	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
F	you just cant_beat supplement_warehouse in price or selection .
F	they have everything you need and then some .
F	the fast_shipping is a plus .
F	as well as there descriptions of each product .
F	giving good detail that allows you to know what your buying .
F	the coolest thing is the free_stuff you can get upon every order .
F	its not just 0 or 0 things .
F	its a whole list of items you can choose from for free .
F	i also look at there sales or closeout deals .
F	because sometimes i have a little extra money and dont mind spending it on a rediculous deal like the closeouts .
F	then other times im tight in money .
F	so i look toward the sales to try and get what i need .
F	now that was everything good .
F	not that there is anything bad for say .
F	just that there is always room for improvement .
F	right ?
F	well what supplement_warehouse can approve is the site itself .
F	its not awful .
F	but its not the easiest site to operate either .
F	sometimes its hard to find what your looking for .
F	so the navigation part needs to be tweaked a little or just simplfied .
F	also , it would be nice to have a option to arrange from lowest_price to highest price .
F	or most_popular to least popular .
F	and then i would like to know if im signed in or not .
F	i cant see anywhere that lets me know im signed in .
F	which in turn there could be a box that lists what ive ordered before or what i order all the time .
F	to again make it easier and quicker to place a order .
F	these are just a couple things i would change if i could .
F	but over all i still stand firm on .
F	that supplement_warehouse is the best supplement supply store on the street and on the web , hands_down !
F	thanks for reading my review and take care .
F	i was worried when i read a lot of negative_reviews but can_honestly say i had no problem with the company !
F	i ordered the flowers on the tuesday_afternoon to be delivered to a london office the following_day .
F	the order process was easy , then i was getting email_updates re my order and then had an update once it had been delivered the next_day !
F	all in all it was great .
F	arrived on time , flowers were lovely and the choice to add like a balloon was a fab idea !
F	thank_you for making my sisters 00th_birthday that bit more special .
F	i enquired_about recycling my phone on the thursday , by friday i had received the free postage packet to send my phone back in , i sent my phone out on the saturday ( i chose to add ' signed for ' delivery ), then on monday i had an_email and text to say my phone had been received and by that evening the funds had been transferred to my bank_account ... may i add that the funds were what i was quoted !
F	i have read some good & bad_reviews but i can_honestly say that the whole processed was so easy and fast and the transaction from start to finish was excellent !
F	very impressed !
F	!
F	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0 days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn ' t in stock and wouldn ' t be for the next 0 - 0 weeks .
F	i emailed back asking to cancel my order and they did so immediately and a refund was issued .
F	the wesbite is easy to use and you can manage all your bookings online - habdy when you ' re on the road .
F	the customer_service team are really good at dealing_with questions and come back to you fairly quickly .
F	only negative_comment is that the company doesnt have a smartphone app - would love this !
F	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
F	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
F	i had expected the daffodils to arrive in a similar state as you would purchase them in a shop , a mixture of unopened and just starting to open flowers so they could be enjoyed for a number of days .
F	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
F	couple this with the expense of sending daffodils ( in comparison to the couple of pounds you can buy them for in a shop ) i would not recommend serenataflowers . com .
F	i purchased an item on 00th_november delivery within 00 days , even_though they were charging extortionate £ 0 . 00 for a small item you would think it would be sent first_class recorded .
F	however since then nothing , obviously the two_weeks has past and i have sent two emails and i am still none the wiser .
F	in times of recession people can ' t afford to have their money taken from them especially when the voucher was a gift for a date which has now passed .
F	not acceptable and not worth the risk .
F	i don ' t see how hard it is to reply to an_email surely the profit from p_& p is enough to pay for a customer_services team .
F	i originally thought this was a good site but that ' s when you redeem from 0rd_party suppliers .
F	when you redeem direct from wowcher you ' ve basically lost your money !
F	great variety of supplies for every type of party , great service had my order delivered to ireland in less that 0 days .
F	all items ordered are better_than described !
F	staff where very polite and helpful called to ensure my order was ok and to make_sure what i ordered was correct as my order was so big also called for extra security on my card .
F	highly recommed partyrama .
F	will use them again in the future .
F	all items very resonably priced .
F	they refused to guarantee a driver who rude and intimidating to myself ( i was alone in the house with my baby ).
F	would not be allowed to deliver to our house again .
F	after sending written confirmation my monthly pass would be cancelled in nov 0000 they have just taken 0 payments for may and june_0000 despite not having ordered anything from them .
F	do not use !
F	i highly_recommend serenata_flowers excellent service !
F	will be using them again in future .
F	the website is very easy to use and it details the frame sizes , which is very handy as i require smaller frames .
F	the prescription_sunglasses arrived ahead of the predicted timescale , just in time for the sun !
F	the style looks fashionable and the glasses feel good quality .
F	the fitter arrived on time and changed the two tyres promptly .
F	it was easy to book and pay online and the service provided was excellent .
F	so much more convenient than taking the car to a garage .
F	the tyres are reasonably_priced , but good quality .
F	i would recommend etyres .
F	as per_usual hospitalityfinder did all they could for me .
F	the freight team had two amazing events in a matter of weeks .
F	firstly wimbledon for the second year running , this time centre court .
F	secondly , for the first time we attended the british grand prix , fantastic day was had by all clients and staff .
F	this is definately an event we will take part in again next year .
F	i always find sue a pleasure to deal with and nothing is ever too much_trouble .
F	i would highly_recommend sue and her team to anyone_looking for the best hospitality experience .
F	just one brilliant company with such great service and customer_relations
F	i recently sold two mobiles through mazumamobile and what an excellent price and such an excellent service .
F	payment in the bank before i could blink without any hassle .
F	if you are looking to sell your mobile then deal with this company .
F	brilliant and all in time for christmas .
F	thank_you
F	despite having an ann_summers in my area , i thought i would save myself some time by ordering online for my first valentines with my boyfriend .
F	i placed an order for a lingerie set on the 00st of january , allowing plenty of time for valentines .
F	my voucher_code wasn ' t applied in my confirmation_email , so i rang customer_services to sort it out .
F	a lovely_lady made the necessary amendments and i continued to wait for the products to arrive .
F	after 00 days ( on an apparently 0 - 0 working day standard delivery ), there was still no sign of the item , so emailed via the website .
F	no reply .
F	so i rang up and spent a good 00_minutes on hold .
F	still no pick_up .
F	so i rang the next morning , and still spent 00_minutes on hold .
F	so i emailed again .
F	still no response .
F	after 0 more emails and another 00_minutes total time on hold , i eventually got hold of a man from the team , at about 00pm on the 00th - only one day before valentines .
F	he was very unhelpful and said that my order had been on hold .
F	later on in the conversation when i questioned why my package hadn ' t been delivered , he blamed it on royal_mail ( contradicting his previous comments ).
F	he then_proceeded to tell me that if ann_summers hadn ' t been notified of a problem , they couldnt fix it .
F	im not sure what else i was expected to do , having already sent 0 messages and clocked up a whopping hour ( plus ) of time on an 0000 number .
F	eventually , after much grovelling , i had still no empathy , nor compensation for the fact that my valentines surprise for my boyfriend was no_longer arriving .
F	he finished off the conversation by saying that the cancellation was fine , but the refund may take up to 00 days to get back into my account .
F	he was very unapologetic and didn ' t seem to care about my loyalty to the company .
F	i am so gutted to have been treated so badly by what i had previously considered to be a fantastic company offering great products .
F	i am still_waiting for my refund and wouldn ' t be surprised if it took over the 00 working_days to get to me , considering the previous standard of service i have been subjected to .
F	with a growing number of competing companies , i ' m surprised to have seen such appalling customer_service .
F	my advice : in store service is great , but if youre considering buying online , go elsewhere .
F	its not worth the hassle .
F	i needed a lens but wasn ’ t sure if it was worth shelling out £ 0 , 000_+ just yet , as it may not have been suitable for the photos i wanted to take .
F	then i came_across this site hiring lens to customers and when i read the reviews thought i ’ d give it a try , after all i would be covered for insurance etc and the prices were more_than reasonable .
F	aside from the fantastic lens ( which i give canon credit for , on this occasion !)
F	the customer_service from lensforhire was second to none !
F	there are no negatives i could attribute to this service and would definitely be using them again !
F	well_done on such great customer_service !
F	this website contains any pen you can think of .
F	free and prompt delivery makes it worth the while .
F	have been buying from here for years and the prices are reasonable compared to high_st retailers .
F	excellent service !!!
F	second time i sold my old phone to mazuma and i have nothing else to say apart_from brilliant !
F	i have shopped @ jokers_masquerade for many years now for various fancy_dress costumes including christmas & halloween .
F	always had a wide_variety of different costumes for all ages , sizes & gender .
F	have recommend them many_times to friends & family_members who have also being pleased with the site .
F	will_continue to shop there for my future fancy_dress needs :)
F	the t -_shirts are really smart , a really quick delivery , great price and amazing quality and variety of t -_shirts and other items just brilliant !
F	this bingo site is great come and join us you won ' t be let_down .
F	they sent me an extortionately high bill stating that my energy use has tripled !!!!
F	when i called and stated that i cannot imagine how i could have used that much energy , i was told that i simply have to pay the £_000 within the next 0 days .
F	i refused this and cancelled my direct_debit .
F	i was then offered to monitor my meter and take a reading at the same time of the day for the next 0 days , which i did .
F	this showed my daily usage to average 0 units and not the alleged 00 !!!
F	when i called back to report this , i was told that i still have to pay the £_000 but that i can spread this in my direct_debit over the next 00 months .
F	i had to agree to this as the guy stated there was no other option .
F	a couple of days_later i noticed that my meter had dropped more_than 0000 units .
F	again , i called edf and was then told that the meter might be faulty and that i now do not have to pay the £_000 and my monthly direct_debit has dropped right back down .
F	no apology , no nothing .
F	i will be changing energy supplier !!
F	!
F	low_prices , free_stuff !!
F	!
F	very pleased with my first order and i will be using them in future for any of my reptile requirements .
F	very fast delivery , have unfortunately returned the shoes as they weren ' t comfortable but they offer free returns so that was quick and easy .
F	i have used animed several_times now and each time they have delivered very quickly and their prices and range of goods are both great .
F	i have used medicanimal several_times and have always found orders are received quickly and their prices are some of the cheapest on the internet with free delivery on everything .
F	bean_bags are high_quality at great prices and are delivered next_day by courier .
F	i bought the purple suede xl bean_bag and loved it so much i also bought the matching bean cube .
F	fast delivery in very plain packaging .
F	great product range a +
F	i found monster pet supplies prices are very good and they delivered my item quickly .
F	fast delivery and great choice of products at low_prices .
F	we have been delighted with the quality of your products , and hope to place many more orders in the future , even_though quoted 0 - 0 day delivery , items received carriage free next_day from ordering .
F	will_definitely give your name to friends who require mobility equipment .
F	thank_you !
F	snabb leverans , och supersköna underkläder , välplacerade pengar , helt enkelt !
F	jävligt bra service , pack - snubben rickard på lyko ser alltid till att mina beställningar hamnar hos posten inom 00h och jag har oftast paketen dagen_efter , det är riktigt snabb service på kanonprodukter och jag älskar utförsäljningarna och reaprodukterna och kampanjvarorna , har uteslutit alla andra siter nu och gått över till lyko helt , nu köper jag till och med_min tandkräm från lyko eftersom det är så enkelt !
F	i placed an order fro over £_000 of items .
F	they seemed like a great price at first .
F	i then paid for my items and waited for the order confirmation .
F	i received the email and to my surprise there was an extra charge of £_00 because i paid by mastercard . what a joke !
F	this did not show clearly on the last ordering page .
F	i phoned them within 0 minutes of placing the order and asked to cancel because of the card charge .
F	they said i could cancel but i wouldnt get £_00 refunded !
F	they also said that the order would still be dispatched as they couldnt contact the warehouse . i then asked what courier they would use so i could reject the parcel , and they couldnt give me those details either !
F	john sharma the sales guy , then said if i do sign for it accidently .
F	then i would have to send it back at my cost , plus pay the cost of original delivery and then when it was received at the ilgs warehouse , i would have to pay an extra restocking charge of 00_% the total value of the order .
F	never use this company .
F	and if you check other forums , no one has anything good to say about them , i wish i checked before hand .
F	at_least ive try to warn other people !
F	ah - mazing !
F	being in a very small town , there are not many choices here , but when i found this company , i was stoked .
F	i was able to order my dymatize from them , and they went even lower_than the lowest_price i could find on the web !
F	so , for 00 bucks ( yes , 00 ) i got my 0lbs shake mix , a shaker_cup and whisk ball , an 0 oz sample of sculpting lotion , and a t - shirt !
F	that even included my shipping !
F	andi could have gotten literally a ton of samples , but i am already beyond happy just with the prices i payed !
F	i applied to sell my laptop on a sunday , it was picked_up on monday , acceptance confirmed on tuesday , and money hit my bank_account on wednesday .
F	you don ' t get more efficient than this !
F	myself and my fiance decided to buy from quality diamonds purely on their great reviews and total value for money .
F	i knew_exactly_what i wanted in terns of diamond cut and quality and with qd they had a wealth of stones to suit within our budget .
F	i have no doubt that if i went into a another jewellers and picked the spec of my ring we would be charged double what we paid .
F	the service is truly great and qd were also able to resize my ring within 00_hours when i found it was a little big .
F	no one should just walk_into jewellers and buy a ring blindly , do you research and then check out qd and get an amazing piece of jewellery at an amazing price !
F	i have recently placed an order with outdoorkit , the delivery was prompt and well communicated .
F	i then realised i had ordered the wrong_size and had to make contact to exchange .
F	the whole_process was handled absolutely superbly by the team at outdoorkit and i would strongly_recommend them to any of my friends for outdoor clothing and equipment .
F	i was impressed with the range available and prices were also reasonable .
F	it was well_packaged and arrived as per postage paid .
F	i would definitely use this company agsin and have already_recommended them and joined their facebook_page .
F	this purchase was for my first dslr camera as i want to take up photography .
F	after looking around on the internet for my chosen model ( nikon_d0000 ) digitalrev offered the best price by quite a substantial margin for the body and a 00 - 00mm_lens , which is great to start with .
F	after_placing my order late on a sunday_evening i was not expecting to receive it until the end of the week at_least , as i live in south wales , uk .
F	however , it was dispatched on monday and it arrived on wednesday which was amazing .
F	the tracking on the order was brilliant as you can check the progress too .
F	the camera was extremely well_packaged and a uk plug adapter was also included which was helpful .
F	i am really pleased with the camera so far and would recommend the camera to others .
F	you can find plenty of reviews on the internet about this camera .
F	as previous reviews state the instructions aren ' t in english .
F	however , you can easily download a pdf manual off the nikon site so this isn ' t a problem .
F	i would definitely_recommend this site to others , and already have done .
F	i will also return to purchase lenses etc in future .
F	cannot_fault the item or service supplied by digitalrev .
F	i was amazed at the level of customer_service i received from edge &_wax !
F	the skis i ordered arrived very quickly and well - packed to avoid any damage .
F	adam whom i talked to was extremely_helpful and nice !
F	amazing service , quick and efficient .
F	will buy from again .
F	i booked the transfer in_advance as i required a child seat .
F	driver was on time and bus was in excellent condition with the baby seat i asked for .
F	price very reasonable compared to other transfer websites .
F	i would use this company again and would recommend it to friends and family .
F	helpful clear advice , paperwork was done for me .
F	great pricing .
F	i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a credit_card machine or to swap their current supplier .
F	also got something for a referral .
F	very professional at all times , very clear information .
F	main thing i love about cams is the chat_hosts an the friends i have met on there
F	this site is fabulous
F	alias is mummyof00
F	with the recent heat waves i ordered a cooling coat for my small crossbreed dog .
F	due to the weather and the coat ' s popularity it went out of stock fast and their suppliers were slow getting more in - not viovets fault , the coats were just in high_demand everywhere .
F	viovet asked if i wanted to cancel my order for a complete refund , i asked them if i could be a bit_annoying and swap the order for another cooling coat that was available at the time and that cost slightly less .
F	viovet arranged this quickly , with no_fuss and gave me a partial_refund on the extra_cost but alas the new cooling coat was then also out of stock .
F	i can say now that the coat has now arrived and been used for the first time today and it works_perfectly so i have got a cool , comfy , happy pup snoozing away .
F	the viovet team are fast , friendly and efficient at their jobs and always aim to please .
F	my pets and i look_forward to dealing_with them more in the future !
F	keep up the good work everyone !
F	fast , friendly , accurate and you can pay with paypal !
F	delivered by royal_mail so if you miss the delivery and it doesn ' t fit through your door you don ' t have to go far to collect your items , just to your nearest post_office .
F	good packaging and speedy service / delivery .
F	very impressed as usual so far and will_continue to use and recommend you .
F	x
F	never had a problem with the products or service .
F	superb as always , keep it up .
F	can ' t wait to receive the latest order i just placed .
F	; )
F	great service and was deliverd by city_link today in the last 0mins they kindly but big box in sided for me every thankful and will be reccomend to friends and family
F	:)
F	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn ' t even turn_up .
F	very difficult to get hold of them on the phone , waited for an_hour to finally get through , sent a pic like they asked but they wouldn ' t refund !
F	do not use this company !!
F	very bad service and terrible flowers !
F	waste of £_00 !
F	great service and always have good deals on the printers .
F	never had a problem with delivery .
F	i always by printers for work from here
F	not sure whether they sell second - hand good as ' new ', but i ordered a phone and it came with just the phone and charger in a box - no instruction_manual or anything .
F	they really screwed up my delivery by failing ensure that the correct instructions were on the parcel .
F	this caused me immense inconvenience and ruined a weekend ( it was a birthday_gift for a friend ).
F	i paid a large_amount for next_day delivery for the privilege .
F	when i complained , they were rude and sarcasitc and did not deal with my complaint in a professional_manner .
F	they also absoutely refused to answer my question about whether the phone should have an instruction_manual with it .
F	they did not refund any postage either .
F	incredibly incompetent people , and zero customer_service .
F	the way that a company treats their customers is one of the best indicators of whether they are worth dealing_with .
F	it is fine to have cheap prices , but i would rather pay more to have the confidence that any_problems will be dealt_with satisfactorily .
F	i would advise_anyone against using this company , as they are only interested in the sale , absolutely no regard for their customers , or take any responsiblity in the event of a problem .
F	prices are significant savings compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
F	i would expect much faster delivery for ordering online .
F	great holiday with blackpool promotions .
F	staff are all very friendly and helpful from reception to waiters to bar staff .
F	cabaret staff are great too .
F	my flight time got pushed back by 0 days and i asked for a refund and some compensation towards booking a new flight since they notified me last_minute and flight costs have doubled in price ( i couldn ' t take the new flight since i had a connecting flight with the original flight ).
F	the customer_service lady ....( name ) ( sp ?)
F	was very rude and confrontational saying they are not responsible since it ' s the airline ' s fault and won ' t do anything to appease the situation .
F	finally they agreed to issue me the refund but said it will take 00 days to get the money back !!!!
F	worst service ever ...
F	i will never book with them again !!
F	!
F	very good dealing_with all your questions and queries !
F	great !
F	thanks a lot !
F	the best company i ' ve dealt_with in my life .
F	no bull sh_** fast and easy ordering , cheap prices , quick delivery , always on time , and never had an issue with my orders or payments .
F	the best !
F	hands_down !!!
F	!
F	i would definetly recomend double0tickets .
F	was buying tickets last minuite for a mcfly concert and ended_up mucking up my order acciently ordering 0 instead of four tickets .
F	but just called their number and they sorted it out adding an extra ticket to my order with no additional posting cost .
F	the tickets arrived the very next_day , much to my relief !
F	i bought a pair of shoes at a remarkable discount .
F	received the shoes , didn ' t fit .
F	now as anyone will know who shops online , the usual procedure is that you let the company know the shoes didn ' t fit , and they come and collect them whilst delivering another pair .
F	i had no clue how to get a refund with groupon , so i contacted them and a week or so later i got an_email requesting details and to reply back to help @ groupon . co . uk ( or something like that ) and then a week_later i was informed i had sent it to the u . s groupon ( even_though i did send it to the uk ) so i emailed the uk again .
F	after a lot of timely and annoying back - and - fro i eventually got the info i needed to contact the vendor .
F	the vendor then informed me that i would be charged to send my shoes back as the postage would be at my own_expense .
F	this was about 0 weeks after receiving my shoes and to avoid hassle i never returned them .
F	groupon need to make_sure they have the vendors refund policy clearly_stated on groupons website , and have a more efficient help system .
F	i am very dissapointed and will never buy from them again in fear of not liking the product .
F	the good deals are countered by the rubbish service .
F	beware .
F	i found everything i needed on one site and they compare prices to anyone_else .
F	free_stuff with every purchase .
F	everytime i order from the protein_works i am impressed !!
F	delivery is always earlier_than_expected , products are always top_notch and the service from the staff at tpw is great !!
F	they are supportive and always happy to answer any_questions .
F	i would highly_recommend tpw to anyone .
F	so many products to choose from and at great prices too
F	thanks millions
F	jen
F	i could not recommend payplan more .
F	from the first time i contacted them almost 0 years_ago they have been super helpful , explaining everything and making me feel at ease and now i am coming to the end ( 0 months remaining ) of my plan , i know without payplan and the plan they put me on i would be so much worse off .
F	can look back now and see getting myself into debt was a bad thing .... but we all make mistakes and payplan didn ' t judge at any point .
F	my case officer has been there whenever i have had questions and it ' s really easy to amend payments at any time during the plan ( like if u want to increase or decrease monthly_payments )
F	they deal with everything on your behalf and it ' s been a god send
F	i don ' t know how i would of been able to cope and repay all my debt without this in place
F	i can ' t thank_you enough

F	in april_0000 , i ordered a double sink vanity unit , back to the wall toilet and back to the wall cupboard unit from onlinebathrooms , at a total cost of £_000 . 00 including shipping .
F	i was very happy with my items .
F	last_week , i went back on to the website to order the matching mirror unit .
F	to cut a long and infuriating story short , the mirror was only available as an add - on to the vanity unit at a cost of £_000 .
F	when i rang to try and order it separately they updated the website to list it as a separate item but increased the price to £_000 !!
F	i make that 00_% increase .
F	when i complained they said they ' d had a price increase from their supplier which they hadn ' t known about until i called .
F	despite me explaining that surely that wasn ' t my fault they refused to sell the mirror at the advertised price and i have been forced to contact consumer direct for advice .
F	there are so many bathroom companies selling online so my advice is avoid this lot and shopping elsewhere .
F	they are great , your never waiting to long for your car to be picked_up or dropped_off and the staff are excellent ( even at 0 :_00am ) haha !!
F	also very informative on where to go ...
F	i always use aardvark parking and would recommend it to any of my friends and family !
F	excellent service overall !
F	i was a little_nervous_about using gadgetpanda because i ' ve never sent off items for payment .
F	however , i found them to be excellent !!
F	i was informed on progress at each_step including when my item had arrived , how much the item had been revised for and when the payment was on it ' s way .
F	i was paid within the 00_hours as stated on the website .
F	i was happy with both the service and the amount offered for the items .
F	i would recommend gadgetpanda to anyone and will_definitely use again in the future !!
F	thanks .
F	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
F	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
F	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother ' s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
F	a phone call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
F	disgusting service !!
F	surfice to say i will be taking this further
F	cheapest for the monitor and delivery on time .
F	keep it up
F	i won one of the friday easter competitions and within a couple of days i had my easter eggs and my free t - shirt with me , as well as a £_00 voucher on the web_site .
F	the person who i had to phone to claim the prizes was very friendly and helpful , telling_me exactly_what i needed to do .
F	everything is great quality and a perfect fit and i ' ll definitely be using the site more often .
F	thank_you =)
F	i was looking for a flavor of protein at a good price and you guys have it , always .
F	i was told the flowers were lovely and the delivery was the exact day i asked for , would definitely use again
F	beautiful quality print of my husband ' s work .
F	as a professional photographer , he ' s pretty picky about his prints , and was delighted with the canvas .
F	quickly dispatched , and the most responsive company to do business with .
F	will always use this company again in the future .
F	i purchased a beauty treatment through wowcher over 0 weeks_ago , it was cancelled by the client and wowcher emailed me to let me know i would receive a refund within 0 - 00days .
F	i have yet to receive any money back despite sending them 0 emails and calling twice and requesting a call back , but still nothing .
F	the website was very easy to navigate and has a wide_range of hostels and other accommodation types .
F	i was also pleased there was no booking_fee and only a 00_% deposit was required :)
F	i really needed to find some flowers for next_day delivery and i hunted through google and found serenata_flowers , ordered a bunch for next_day , then i began reading reviews !
F	i was horrified , and very nervous that my flowers would not make it and i have been checking the status update all day only to have a very pleased mum thanking me for beautifull flowers .
F	i ordered the flowers around midday the day before and they were with her by 00 the next_day !
F	very happy customer and i will use them again !
F	:)
F	my appointment was booked for between 0pm - 0pm , andy turned_up early despite all the problems on the road today , great service and will_definitely use again !
F	thanks
F	purchased from shopto several_times and each time have had my expectations exceeded .
F	prices are always better_than anywhere_else , delivery has always been next_day ( even_though it ' s free !)
F	and when there has ever been a problem with the game itself , they have exchanged it without any fuss at all .
F	we never look anywhere_else to buy games now !
F	thanks shopto !
F	my husband is so awkward having his_birthday on 00th_dec .
F	this makes it really tricky to get an online sale item and have it delivered in time .
F	zavvi had the game i wanted for the best price .
F	i ordered it on boxing_day and it arrived on the morning of the 00th_dec !
F	i was amazed !
F	hi mates :
F	everything worked smoothly in less_than one day ( from at & t to an italian carrier ).
F	absolutely recommended !
F	cheers
F	in short .
F	they just stopped my internet one day ( the same day i paid for the previous month ).
F	it just stopped , nothing .
F	i spent about a week back and forth with their customer_service who blamed my computers and router constantly ( despite the problem happening on multiple computers and 0 routers ).
F	when i finally got to speak to technical_support they laughed at the customer support and then told me they haven ' t done any of the internal tests they said they were doing .
F	after technical_support done their tests they told me it was their problem as their system wasn ' t accepting my username and password and if it wasn ' t fixed the next_day to phone them .
F	i phoned the next_day and i was back to square one , they were asking me to reset my router and other stupid tests i had already done .
F	i got my mac_code from them and it never worked so i had to outright cancel it .
F	avoid talk_talk
F	evil company , take your belongings and do not honour the agreement and do not pay you any of the money you are owed , and refuse to have contact with .
F	i will be taking the company to a small - claims court , so look_forward to hearing from me soon jack williams .
F	theft and fraud is illegal , and you won ' t get away with it .
F	great conference call service , never had any_issues with it .
F	we needed a new dryer and the whole_process was painless and very quick yet through .
F	we got advised on an affordable yet energy efficient product with no pressure .
F	we will_definitely go back its the best appliance store around .
F	i am very happy to have discovered healthysupplies . co . uk
F	i just love how everything on the site is healthy & i can buy whatever i want without_worrying of hidden ingredients .
F	in fact , i was so happy that i told everyone !
F	from my best friends & family to my neighbours about healthysupplies .
F	also i just love how they include healthy tips & recipes too .
F	i have placed 0 orderes in 0 week when i first discovered healthysupplies .
F	everything came well_packaged next_day delivery & the products couldnt be more high_quality !
F	as a bonus they have discount schemes & prize draws which is awesome !!
F	will be always ordering from healthysupplies
F	the website was great , very user_friendly .
F	i liked the easy to understand performance information .
F	i liked that i could choose which garage to use and they too were very efficient .
F	also there was no_hidden_charges .
F	very impressed and will use them for tyres again in future .
F	“ dear oak_furniture land team ,
F	having now received the final delivery , we just wanted to send a quick thank_you note to say how happy we are with the furniture and the kind and courteous staff who delivered it .
F	we look_forward to doing_business with you again in the future .
F	kind_regards ,
F	catherine & rob :-)
F	p . s .
F	for anyone_looking to purchase from this company .
F	the rustic oak range in the bedroom_furniture is highly_recommended .
F	the triple_wardrobe , 0 + 0 and bedside cabinets are so beautiful and have exceptional storage space .
F	:)
F	wimdu is great because it offers options for travelers of all budgets .
F	i loved how easy it was to use their website , and all the people who are renting out their apartments are really friendly and helpful i ' ve noticed !
F	i ' m even considering putting my place for rent as it seems like a really trustworthy company .
F	thanks wimdu !
F	my experience is clearly much_better_than some others or perhaps it ' s those with problems who are more likely to leave a review :- i ordered a new cooker door handle for my v old cooker and also emailed the company , belling , at the same time ' just in case '.
F	within a day my order at spares 0 go showed ' on order from supplier ', however a few_days_later i received an reply from belling to say the part was obsolete .
F	i emailed spares0go to let them know and to ask whether this meant that they couldn ' t get the part for me .
F	within 00_minutes i had a reply to say they had a pair of slightly different handles and they would be sending those , so that cooker and grill door handles matched , at no extra_cost .
F	they arrived today and although i need to use a washer , not supplied , with them they are otherwise perfect .
F	i received my new cannon mg0000 printer yesterday morning at 00 . 00am after ordering the day before at around 0 . 00pm , the speed of delivery is almost unbelievable and has to be highly commended .
F	the printer is absolutely great , i have been using hp professional printers for the past 00 years and this cannon mg0000 absolutely knocks spots off my old hp officejet 0000 and is about half the price .
F	well_done canon and many_thanks to printerland for your superb service - highly reccommended !
F	received cheque within 0 days of sending phones , have used this company twice now and believe it to be first_class .
F	i ' ve always loved this site , but the recent website revamp has made it so much_better which is why i felt it was time to leave a review !
F	when the whole family ' s contracts are up it can be both expensive and stressful but phonesltd had everything i needed and their customer_service was brilliant .
F	would recommend to anyone !
F	!
F	i would absolutely use this company again .
F	absolutely_brilliant , great prices , super_fast delivery .
F	i always used hostelbookers as it ' s always quick , easy and reliable .
F	i like that i can filter it according to what it is that is most_important to me (_eg .
F	from lowest to highest cost ) and it clearly shows which rooms are singles , doubles , triples , etc , which is handy when booking as a single , as i often get caught - out by prices that can seem cheap , but are per_person for a double - booking ...
F	i like getting the reviews , pictures and that i only need to pay the 00 %; makes me feel more secure in my booking .
F	highly_recommended .
F	ordered timberlands and got them the next_day .
F	the fact that they gave me texts to let me know when the driver would be arriving was great and was given an_hour_timeslot which i got to choose so wasn ' t waiting around all day .
F	definatley recommend
F	very helpful on the phone and by email , easy to use website
F	lovely item , arrived really quickly .
F	nicely_packaged with some amazing stickers .. will be shopping there again !
F	:)
F	great boots received quickly and at a great price .
F	what more could you want !
F	the map is a real talking point and people always stop to take a look at it in more detail .
F	the quality of the canvas and mounting is excellent , the writing is clear and the map is educational whilst being fun .
F	the service that i received from the company was second to none .
F	i have no_hesitation in recommending this product or company to anyone_wanting a fun interesting world map .
F	this is the second time i ' ve been unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of a tnt delivered parcel , and both_times have been equally as disappointing .
F	each time they claim a they tried to deliver and i was not home - funny as i ' d taken time of work to wait for them - foolish i now know .
F	calling the customer helpline is of no use whatsoever ; yes they are very kind and borderline helpful in that they can tell you your order will ( yet again ) be sent out the next_day , but i ' m_afraid that ' s no good when the driver doesn ' t bother to show then claims you weren ' t home .
F	if you ' re lucky_enough to actually receive your parcel , chances are it ' ll be in a sorry state - everything i ' ve had from them i ' ve returned to sender , probably due to being loaded & unloaded multiple_times from the mystery delivery van ( s ) that operate through edinburgh city_centre .
F	save_yourself the hassle and don ' t bother - unless you want to wait 0 + days for a damaged parcel to appear .
F	i ' m honestly at my wits_end with this company .
F	i bought a new build apartment in june and the supplier was first_utility .
F	i changed back to my original supplier therefore i was only with them a short while yet seem to be plagued by letters relating to an ' overdue ' ( estimated !)
F	balance on my gas account .
F	this balance is in fact false as i spoke to someone last_night ( after finally getting trough ) who confirmed that they do have the correct meter_readings - to which i owe for 00 units of gas and not the 000_+ as per the estimate but couldn ' t explain_why i ' m still being harassed by their credit control team .
F	to top it off i came home today to find yet another letter from credit control threatening court proceedings !?!
F	seriously !?!
F	the best part is - i actually emailed the credit control team last_week about this , surprise_surprise that email was ignored too , yet they managed to send me another threatening letter just the other day ..... come on guys , sort yourselves out .
F	let ' s be clear on one thing - i have no issues in paying for what i owe , none whatsoever .
F	i just want a correct bill without the constant harassment .
F	i ' ve honestly had enough , time to see my solicitor i think .
F	the only positive thing i have to say about this company is the staff ( when you get to speak to them ) are very polite and helpful , it seems to be more their system that ' s an utter disgrace .
F	an intuitive and very well_organized layout , fast_shipping , excellent customer_service and the prices are extremely appealing .
F	no doubt , i recommend this company to everyone i know .
F	the service was superb from start to finish .
F	as a business customer we were especially impressed with the speed of the payment .
F	we couriered the package ourselves , then mazuma did the rest .
F	highly_recommended .
F	i have used amazon for a couple of years now and over all that time and many many orders , i have never once been dissappointed !
F	the purchasing process is simple and quick , the delivery times are accurate and almost always arrive before expected which is a bonus at xmas !
F	the offer of free supersaver delivery is just fantastic and since purchasing a kindle from amazon i have been really impressed with how it works and just how lightening quick books etc are downloaded within_seconds !
F	this company is worth its weight in gold .
F	i have yet to try the selling side of amazon but i think i am sure this will also be a straightforward no - fuss procedure also !
F	will_continue to use this company long into the future !
F	i contacted pc_specialists for advice after looking at their website > i didnt have a clue about megabites , ram or soundcards etc so had to put my trust into this company to make me a gaming_pc .
F	the man who i spoke to asked me various questions in otder to get an idea of what i needed and then took me ( patiently i might_add !)
F	through the various stuff i would need .
F	when he had finished i told him i would ring back after considering the quote .
F	i spoke to my children and they were really chuffed with what i had been offered as other gaming_pc ' s they had looked at on the net were far dearer than the price i was quoted > i phoned back and bought the pc that day > following purchase , i received regular_updates via_email as to where the pc was in the processing stages .
F	i received the pc before_xmas with no_problems at all .
F	setting_up the pc was very simple ( even for me !)
F	and runs like a dream .
F	i would definately recommed pc_specialists to anyone_looking to purchase a pc from a friendly , helpful and patient company like this one !
F	i have very mixed feelings regarding this company .
F	on the one hand ; the food was generally good , although the sausages were very bland .
F	on the other ; their customer_service was the worst i have experienced in a long time .
F	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
F	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
F	so i called to let them know and request a replacement .
F	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
F	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
F	after a number of emails , in which i was condescended to quite badly , it turned_out that i had been lied to in the first instance .
F	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
F	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !
F	they were , however , very quick to refund for the low quality sausages , so i am grateful for that , and the rest of the food was very nice .
F	i have had fantastic service from this company .
F	not only do they offer competitive_prices on a wide_range of technical gear and clothing but they will go above and beyond to ensure you get exactly_what you want .
F	i have dealt_with carl in customer_services and he has been nothing but awesome in helping me get the right product for my needs .
F	i highly_recommend and will remain a loyal_customer for as long as their great service continues .
F	i ordered the neon pink shaker_bottles as i am fed_up of my husband using all of our black ones so i haven ' t got a clean one to use when i want .
F	i ' ve looked for ages to find ones with both screw caps and screw lids for added security because i often take my shakes out and about and am sick of leaky containers .
F	these deluxe nutrition ones are awesome : robust , water tight and best of all ... bright pink !
F	my husband won ' t touch my shakers now and i love how funky they are .
F	they wash really well in the dishwasher too .
F	i ' ve used them many_times .
F	always simple and effective
F	the website has a huge_range of foods and some great recipes to inspire you .
F	i was really impressed with the order dispatch speed , and having a choice of couriers was perfect for me .
F	many companies will not deliver to where i am on a saturday so i was happy to pay extra for royal_mail .
F	they offer easy to understand discounts and are great value for money .
F	we ' ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
F	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
F	we ' ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
F	will keep ordering but remain cautious !
F	great clothes , great website , love my premier delivery service and great customer care .
F	thank_you .
F	my grandmother ordered a pair of step ladders in december , the cheque she posts is cashed straight_away , one month after purchase she receives a letter stating the ladders are not available until the 0nd week on march .
F	0nd week of march comes and goes ... no ladders .
F	the phone number on the letter and the offer strip is no_longer in use so , not having access to a computer connection , she is unable to contact them and is obviously very upset and worried .
F	after i google a new number and ring around 00 times , i get a delivery date for the following week .... low and behold they do not show .
F	after another 0 weeks the ladders arrive .
F	0 months late and guess_what ... they have pieces missing .
F	' customer_service ' were rude and unhelpful and my letter of complaint has gone_unanswered .
F	diabolical all around .
F	will never ever use again .
F	quite surprised at the volume of negative_comments posted on here .
F	i have shopped with achica for around 0 months and in that time have not had any_problems , all products have been great .
F	contact to customer_service was fast , easy and friendly .
F	good job guys .
F	keep it up .
F	i love the products featured on this site .
F	they mainly concentrate on home accessories that are very contemporary and colourful .
F	i had excellent customer_service from this company when i enquired_about some wineracks .
F	good range of clothing , and an ok customer_service .
F	i am new to using supplement_warehouse but it has been recommended to me by friends many_times .
F	the price_matching is a nice feature to have .
F	i also really enjoy getting free_stuff along with my orders .
F	jv carpentry built and installed alcove storage units for the living_room of our victorian mid - terrace .
F	they were very professional , giving us different options and making suggestions on what would look best .
F	they were flexible about when they could work to fit around us , and the guys who came to fit and paint the shelves were professional and friendly - they also tidied up completely after themselves !
F	the units look great - and look like they could have always been there .
F	the price was very competitive and was broken down and exlplained clearly at the start of the process .
F	this company advertises items that are not even in stock .
F	i only found out that they did not have the item i paid for because i contacted them as my order was taking a long time to be processed .
F	no one bothered to contact me and no one bothers to answer the phone .... ever !
F	!
F	if you want good customer_service - don ' t use this company .
F	i had pre_- ordered a box set of prisoner cell block h and have been waiting for them to arrive i went into my local_store the other day to find them on the shelves .
F	i got an_email from them today saying they were out of stock .
F	i feel very let_down by the online service whats the point of having the pre ordering service if they don ' t follow it through
F	i attended the complete nail tech course in newcastle starting on the 00rd september .
F	my trainer was kate who was fantastic .
F	my day to day job is working as a manager of a technical testing department and i have worked their for over 00 years and attended many training courses and kate has been by_far the best trainer .
F	kate was able to reach out to all of us .
F	our class was mixed with some ladies who had worked with gel polishes or paid for manicures and pedicures to others who had never had any of these treatments .
F	i really_enjoyed working with kate as she is very enthusiastic and passionate_about her job .
F	she has the ability to to make you feel confidant about your work as well as being_able to criticise your work but also advise you on how you can do better .
F	she was chatty and also took the time to get to get to know everyone .
F	the group i was in was a very loud group and we chatted and giggled through out the course and i was very impressed on how she was able to calm all of us down and get us to focus on the tutorials .
F	every morning kate would have a great big smile on her face which made the course a joy to attend her classes .
F	i personally would recommend this course and kate as a trainer and i look_forward to my next course with her in the near_future .
F	i got the tigi catwalk volume shampoo , root boost and thickening gel and also the epic volume conditioner .
F	i have lots of very fine , silky and limp hair .
F	i wanted to try some products to see if i could get some good volume for my diy wedding hair .
F	i put some time aside on saturday_afternoon to use the products and style my hair , all i can say is wow !!
F	i think i was a bit heavy handed with the boost and thickener , but boy oh boy do they work !!!
F	it ' s now tuesday pm and my hair still looks thick and has much more volume than normal .
F	plus it still looks clean too , where i would be pushing it by today if i had it au - naturel .
F	if i wasn ' t going swimming tonight , i would be tempted to see how long the look can last .
F	only v minor negative is that my hair isn ' t quite as shiney .
F	great products , would definitely_recommend and buy again .
F	also - the products were very quick and easy to purchase , the cheapest prices out there on these items and arrived very quickly .
F	thanks guys !
F	i have been using viovet for years and even with the new charges vets apply for prescriptions , viovet is always much cheaper .
F	the service is great and the drugs always arrive quickly .
F	thanks viovet !
F	the service i received was exceptional and i appreciate the communication i received .
F	thank_you so much for your professionalism !
F	i will do business again !
F	after researching every product i wanted to buy on other_websites , i could not find anything cheaper any where and if i did , supplementwarehouse . com beat their price !
F	i have bought several domains and set_up a website via 000 -_reg . co . uk .
F	the support service is great especially for someone like me who can just send emails .
F	thanks to petru
F	this is the first time i ' ve used this company and i ' m very impressed !
F	the order itself came very quickly , and the products are perfect for a fraction of the price !
F	the customer_service was great , when an item i ordered was not in stock i received an e_- mail of apology and refund the same day .
F	as well as this , any e_- mail query ' s are answered the same day which is very helpful !
F	very happy , would recommend .
F	would definatley reccomend mazuma , did everything it said it would do on the website , in super_quick time .
F	will_definatley use again !
F	we received constant progress updates on our delivery and a time_slot was given by the courier was it had been dispatched .
F	we were really happy with the service and the speed of delivery .
F	the bag we bought was cheaper here than anywhere_else .
F	great value for money and exactly_what we wanted for holding a laptop and clothes whilst cycling to work .
F	great service and very fast delivery , no_problems whatsoever .
F	would definitely use again and would recommend to anyone_looking for cylinders
F	fantastic communication , emailed me to confimr my order , emailed me to confirm ennvelope had been sent , emailed me to inform me they got my phone .
F	then another email to tell methey had all paid .
F	all this in the space of 0 days , would definatley use again and highly_recomend to friends
F	the items i bought worked out £_00 cheaper_than others online arrived within a few_days of ordering .
F	previously i have had huge problems with the prescription being lost , then the prescription running out , having to buy a second , playing phone tag with the customer_services etc but there was none of that .
F	clear emails let me know when the order was sent and that the prescription had been received .
F	will use again .
F	i placed an order , within hours i was being emailed reminding me to send the prescription , which had been sent .
F	email after email arrived , threatening to cancel the order , which they did , while all the time they had received my £_00 vets prescription !
F	had i not chased them and replaced the order my prescription would have been lost .
F	this is the senpcind year this has happened , i wonder if it ' s worth the few pounds i save ordering it from them ?
F	next year , i think i ' ll pay more but get it from the polite staff at the vets who speak to you rather_than fire out automated emails !
F	just completed the sage lien 00 course is easy to follow and very thorough .
F	you can revisit any sub - catagories with ease .
F	the e_- careers staff are always at hand to offer you any help .

F	bbq was 0 day late arriving due to an admin error and when finally being_able to open it discovered that the bbq had a wooden slag missing from the base .
F	i tried_phoning over the weekend after delivery to resolve the problem but couldn ' t get through so resorted to email which got through instantly and an_automated fault / replacement case was raised for the missing part with a following email_stating case approval and dispatch in a lead time ( which i now realise is 0 - 0 working_days .
F	this part arrived a week after the bbq did , but it was the wrong part .
F	instead of a wooden slat they sent a whole wooden base .
F	once again unable to get through over the weekend i phoned first thing monday_morning when a lady assured me they would send out the correct piece as urgent and we would now have it by wednesday .
F	today is now wednesday and lo and behold no part has arrived .
F	00_mins of waiting on the phone i finally get through to parts and the man on the phone states no urgency is on the order it will be with us on friday 0 weeks since the bbq arrived .
F	i tried to ask why there was no urgency and could be clarify it was definitely the right part which he couldn ' t .
F	i then asked to speak to a manager but they left at 0pm ...
F	so i have given up disinterested customer_service employees and incompetent back of house employees .
F	i have now requested a refund but i have to wait for the bbq to be collected which will be anytime in the next 0 - 0 working_days ...... what a joke !
F	website ordering was very easy to navigate and ordering was very easy .
F	asked for next_day and i received text and email_updates to let me know when the flowers were dispatched and when delivered !
F	extremely good service and flowers were lovely .
F	they arrived in a box which i found interesting !!
F	will order from them again !
F	i ' ve ordered sporadically from all beauty ( and before when they were known as cheap_smells ) and i really don ' t have a single bad_word to say .
F	i ordered perfume for myself recently , it arrived well_packaged , quickly and as_described .
F	the price of the perfume was cheap and competitive , postage is free and only took a few_days , everything was a positive experience .
F	they ' re a really great company and i ' d definitely use them again and again .
F	i never usually leave reviews , but i think the habit is to only leave one when the experience has been a negative one .
F	having just bought an iphone_0s at the weekend from the westfield white city branch , i have no_complaints .
F	the guy who served me was very knowledgeable and friendly .
F	he also gave me a discount on the handset and the phone case , which i bought there and then , as he said i was spending a lot on the price plan i ’ d chosen .
F	i wanted to transfer my current mobile number across from o0 to vodafone , he did all the necessary steps as i ’ d already got my pac_code from o0 in_advance .
F	i was a bit_weary when i got home to find out that the new vodafone simcard didn ’ t seem to have a telephone_number attached and that my new iphone was showing ‘ no service ’.
F	from previous experience of transferring my number , usually you ’ d be given a temporary mobile number , call the new network ’_s customer_services , give them your pac_code and so on .
F	perhaps because my pac_code was entered at the time of sale straight_away , this was done differently ?
F	the person serving me did suggest i buy insurance for the phone , with the first month being given free .
F	i usually don ’ t cave into these gimmicks , but when he pointed_out i had £_000 worth of technology in my hand , it did make me think .
F	he advised i could cancel it within a month , which i probably will do and perhaps look for something cheaper .
F	but overall , i ’ m pleased to say that 0 days_later ( not including the 0 day weekend !
F	), i am now a vodafone customer and the whole_process was a smooth journey .
F	the transfer time did take longer_than_expected , but that ’_s not a fault of carphone_warehouse .
F	i would certainly advise to take the negative_reviews with a pinch of salt .
F	had a faulty car from there took them 0 days to take the car in and fix but they did fix it eventually ... beware and always check the car your thinking of buying
F	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
F	i found this hard to do and couldn ' t really see an easy way of doing this on the website .
F	also when i paid for the room i thought i would automatically be signed_up to hostel_bookers website but i wasn ' t i just had made booked and not created an account .
F	however - really good variety and other that than it is easy to use .
F	insurance , breakdown_cover , utilities etc are all so boring to search for to get a good price , so when i saw this site i was very surprised .
F	i landed on a comparison table , it told me what i got for my money , how much it would cost , and what special_offers i could get and within 00_minutes of searching , i got a fantastic offer .
F	i wish everything else was as easy , can you not make a car_insurance page like this ?
F	i think a lot of people would use it .
F	i sent in my iphone_0s 00gb with an estimated value price of £_000 .
F	i then received a revised_offer from bozowi of £_000 with them stating : ' engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a significant scratches on the unit or screen that does not meet the minor wear and tear criteria .
F	we therefore offer you the revised price below for your phone .'
F	there were most definitely not ' significant scratches ' on the phone .
F	but that ' s fine if they think that , so i rejected the offer to get the phone returned to me .
F	this was on the 0th_february - 00 days ago .
F	i have since received no communication from them , i have sent 0 emails - the most_recent stating if i do not receive some form of communication from them i will resort to taking further_action .
F	i am unable to telephone them as their working hours are finished before mine are .
F	and just to clarify , i check my junk email everyday as well - it hasn ' t slipped into there either !
F	would never recommend or use this company for their sheer lack of incompetence and poor customer_service .
F	so bozowi , if you are reading this - i hope this will prompt you to respond and finally return my phone , or revise my offer to the original price you offered .
F	then maybe we can finally get this matter resolved without having to take it further :)
F	--- update ---
F	since writing this review i have been contacted by bozowi , who apparently have not received any of my emails due to a server issue .
F	because of my unhappy review my phone has been placed in quarantine until my complaint has been resolved .
F	i was asked to take this review down , however i have refused and said i will update my review accordingly .
F	upon updating this review i will be receiving a revised phone price , and if i accept this will be paid into my bank_account the same day .
F	this has been a long drawn out process , however it looks_like i will finally get a resolution , and i am finally happy with the outcome .
F	for this reason i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
F	as although they may have had issues with their emails , it should still be understood that the level of communication is considered to be unacceptable .
F	-- further update --
F	after a promise that my money would be with me the next_day after i had updated my review , i received nothing .
F	the next_day i sent yet again another email to be told that they had been out of the office the previous day and hadn ' t come in until late the day after that .
F	why tell me that everything would be sorted the day after our phone call then !?
F	it is now sunday , almost 0 week after being told i would receive my money and still nothing .
F	i am completely and utterly fed_up now and will be refusing to update this review again .
F	this is an absolutely awful company , who lies and does not keep to promises and has no urgency whatsoever about them .
F	i recently sent a different phone to <_external link_removed > and received payment into my account 0 days_later , no_hassles .
F	it has been almost a month now .
F	- further update -
F	have since been contacted by a management member , the original member of staff dealing_with ( or not dealing_with ) my query quit , i was offered the full phone price and it was paid into my bank_account the next_day .
F	thanks to <_private data_removed > who finally managed to help me in this ridiculous situation , i am now happy that this has all been resolved and i can forget about this horrible experience !
F	i recently booked a flight with bravofly from belfast to barcelona and broke up with my boyfriend so called up to change the name on the ticket .
F	the woman on the other end of the phone took_ages to understand what i wanted to do because she clearly did not speak_english and she then preceeded tospell the name change incorrectly .
F	when i tried to tell her this she simply ignored me or did not udnerstand me and told me i would get a confirmation_email soon .
F	i waited on the email to prove she had spelt the name wrong but the email did not come .
F	i called again and got the same person .
F	she laughed at me and told me " jus to wait " and that i have " plenty of time ".
F	what sort of customer_service is that ?
F	ryanair who everyone complain_about did the name change straight_away and nobody laughed at me .
F	also they did add a lot of charges onto the original fee .
F	never ever go with this company !
F	they have absolutely no customer_service !
F	was so impressed with the level of privacy , the speed in which it arrived and i received results .
F	doctors replied quickly .
F	i have been using liz_earle products for just over a year now and i can_honestly say that they have made so much difference to my skin !
F	everyone should use the cleanse & polish - it is a real lifesaver .
F	the service is amazing too , the online advisor is so helpful and my orders always arrive promptly , beautifully_packaged and with lovely personal touches :-) thank_you le !
F	myself and a friend booked a spa day through this company .
F	we got an_email 0 days before telling us they ' could not fulfil our request '.
F	i called the hotel and they had us booked in for nearly a month later than agreed .
F	called wahanda and was told ' your call is now next in the queue ' over and over again for over 00_mins before i was hung_up on .
F	called again and stayed on hold for 00_mins before being told it was cancelled .
F	never again .
F	ordered and received very quickly .
F	was impressed at the speed and price .
F	would use again !
F	this is the second time i ' ve used glasses0you and again i ' m not disappointed .
F	the website offers lots of options and for me being_able to see the exact measurements of glasses and filter by size , shape etc .
F	means it ' s easy to find suitable glasses for me .
F	it ' s more accurate and has more choice than the high_street .
F	the returns guarantee means you cannot go_wrong and if in need of assistance the staff have always been helpful .
F	saying that i ' ve not had to exchange any of the glasses i ' ve ordered .
F	i ' ll definitely be back to glasses0you .
F	it was easy to navigate around the website , everything was clear and the order process was efficient and easy .
F	as such i have been using get lenses for years and have never had a problem .
F	i loved my lovefilm subcription before greedy amazon took over !
F	i paid £ 0 . 00 a month and i got my lovefilm instant and my lovefilm by post .
F	i didn ' t even realise that anything would change when amazon took over as they told me nothing was changing but the name , what a load of bull .
F	i had to email them several_times before they clearly told me that i would be expected to pay £_00 for amazon_prime for the year otherwise i couldn ' t get instant video anymore .
F	i don ' t know about anyone_else but i don ' t have that kind of money to just fork_out .
F	absolutely_ridiculous .
F	don ' t fix something that ' s not broken !!!
F	!
F	ali was a star in helping me get ready for google ad words exams as well as some really helpful tips in regards to conversion_rate optimisation .
F	i was a little_nervous of ordering online .
F	advice i can give other people .
F	have an up to date prescription and measurement of pupil distance .
F	it may help to measure your previous glasses too for the right lens size .
F	i received my glasses yesterday and can see clearly with them no troubles .
F	the glasses fit like a glove .
F	the service is very good .
F	thank_you so much .
F	def_recommend and buy again great service and value
F	i have shopped quite a lot on boohoo and i have to say it ' s my favourite for value fir money , style ideas , availability , variety and service so quick you almost need to be ready to answer the door as soon as you place your order .
F	my 00 year_old_daughter just got a little part time job and now i have another boohooer at home lol .
F	fully recommend to everyone everywhere .
F	never had a problem thanks boohoo xx
F	found them to be cheaper_than stores selling similar products on a number of prodecuts and delivery was really quick .
F	i just bought a french style chateau bed at half the price of my local furniture shop , has just been delivered and assembled in my bedroom and it looks beautiful .
F	this was great service , the price was fanatastic & the service even better .
F	thanks so much !
F	x
F	i love using hostelbookers for any travelling i do .
F	with all of their ratings and reviews they make it so easy to find safe , clean and fun accommodation pretty_much anywhere you could wish to go .
F	i always feel_safe booking with hostelbookers knowing i can cancel my stay if my plans change , which they often do , and they allow you to pay upon_arrival giving you plenty of change to get your funds sorted !
F	couldn ' t ask for more !
F	great company very friendly staff this is the only place i go to for all my e_cig products would definitely_recommend to all my friends and family
F	service was excellent !
F	any_queries i sent through were answered_quickly .
F	they helped_me with my print and to get it sent internationally which was above and beyond what they needed to do which was very much_appreciated .
F	quality of the canvas was great .
F	definitely_recommend to others , i ' ve used this company twice now and both with great results and customer server and would not hesitate to use again .
F	really easy to do , simple process , fast payment , recommend :)
F	ordered some wedding day and evening invitations , came and marriage was mispelt , a slight typo error and apparantly they dont read what they are going to print !
F	cause you think they would have noticed and done a nice thing by asking us are you sure this is what you want , if they had pointed_out the mistake ( which you think they would ) they could have said oops slight mistake and corrected for us .
F	but they just printed and said its our fault and want to charge all over again , even when the evening invites were not the colour we requested !
F	when we contacted them by phone customer_service were really unhelpful , and couldnt seem to make their minds up on whether they did read the proofs or not ?
F	which you think they would to help people find mistakes like that ?
F	honestly thought that would be part of the service regardless of if you typed them yourself , were not professionals and they are supposed to be ?
F	fab service , fast delivery fab cond , would recommend and now check ere for things i need before i go anywhere_else , they keep you so well informed about progress of your order etc xx
F	superb prices , brilliant customer_service ..
F	simple , easy website ..
F	spoken to katie today as i had trouble loging in and she had sorted everything out in no time !
F	well_done and thank_you parcel0go !
F	x
F	excellent good quality items , and fast delivery , thanks very much
F	i receieved my shower and called my plumber out to fit it , only to find i had the wrong one , i emailed bella bathroom to see if i could send it back to them - they said no , as i had recieved it 0 days ago , and that they only refund on goods that are received within 0 days !
F	so i asked if they would exchange the shower , they said no and attatched the delivery note with a signature !
F	the customer_service with this company have no_intention of helping you !
F	they have lost at_least one good customer :-(
F	i always use serenata to order flowers for friends and relatives .
F	not only are their costs extremely competitive , they are extraordinarily reliable and offer next_day delivery .
F	i have never been disappointed by their service - always arriving on time and delivered by very competent and pleasant people .
F	the flowers are also very beautiful and i have always had comments from recipients about how lovely the flowers are and how long they last .
F	i recommend serenata regularly to my friends and would use the service again and again .
F	my only comments would be 0 ) to add more design options for personalised cards and messages and 0 ) to maybe have an option for a sunday delivery - this is something offered by very few online flower delivery services and i think this would set serenata apart_from competitors if they could offer this service .
F	perhaps just on certain sundays ?
F	such as mothering_sunday ?
F	great service as of yet when i ' ve ordered what i ' ve ordered it has been sent as soon as possible which i find great
F	i had an old phone that had been in a draw for months i checked the price online and was very happy .
F	i sent the phone off on the friday and had the cash in my bank on the wednesday ! they offer you a good price even if your phone is broken everything on there website is easily_accessible and you can track your order . have used them before and will do so again !
F	!
F	first_class product , easy to access first_class service
F	this was the third time i have used your site to book a hostel and i have never been disappointed .
F	i find your site easy to use and very informative !
F	the items item the day after i ordered them even thought i went for the free standard delivery option .
F	items were exactly as_described and wrapped - a nice_touch !
F	would highly_recommend the website to anyone who ' s looking for a friendly and efficient service .
F	one very happy customer .
F	i was recommended by a friend tot his company , and i was pleased with the result .
F	i received a beautiful canvas for a great price and the customer_service was both efficient and friendly .
F	i would highly_recommend this company and would purchase again !
F	really easy - managed to sign_up and buy tickets on my iphone .
F	recieved email confirmation within minutes .
F	will_definitely use the site again .
F	i use it for my old girl who ' s 00 and still enjoys her daily walks
F	very easy process , would recommend
F	my payment cleared very slowly ( despite sending it straight_away ) and they were very polite and understanding about the delay .
F	the items were exactly as_described and arrived very quickly .
F	i recieved notification of the day my order would arrive .
F	can ' t fault this company and will_definitely use their services again !
F	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
F	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
F	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn ' t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
F	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
F	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
F	there is no limit to the amount of each item you can buy so bulk buyers buy the best things immediately to sell at a profit .
F	this seems to be provided as feedback regularly but nothing is ever done .
F	this is the only thing letting this site down .
F	excellent range of high_quality items and at a good price too .
F	reasonably fast delivery but have had quicker for less money .
F	website easy to use and easy to order .
F	i ordered a ps0 game for my partners_birthday .
F	i received it ... two days before it was released !!
F	excellent , quick service and the cheapest price i could find around .
F	thank_you !
F	alba_rose are absolutely amazing !

F	i cant_wait to wear it one the big day arrives !
F	!
F	thank_you so much alba_rose for being my number one jewelers !
F	!
F	i will recommended you to everyone and anyone !
F	the product was received within two days and was pacakged really well to protect the item .
F	thank_you very much !
F	it was east to browse the website and then to place the order .
F	great prices compared to other_retailers !
F	the delivery was quick and i was notified at all stages of the despatch .
F	a great experience !
F	i will_definitely buy from chemist_direct again .
F	thank_you to all involved !
F	i have used partyrama before and had no_problems ; however this time was a totally different_story .
F	i received a call on my phone from a number i did not recognise .
F	on answering the call i was informed by a gentleman that he had been delivered my deliver .
F	the box had been addressed to him however my invoice and items that i had ordered were inside the box .
F	the gentleman who received the box had my invoice details which include my contact number , payment details and home address .
F	i am luck that the gentleman was honest enough to call me and explain the situation .
F	upon calling partyrama ' s customer_service , although the customer advisor was helpful , she did not apologise for the mistake once .
F	this all happened on 0th_may and i am still_waiting for the items to be delivered .
F	since 0th_may i have had no communication from partyrama and we are now on 00th_may .
F	i accept mistakes_happen , however i believe the situation has been dealt_with appallingly .
F	i had a canon_000d bought recently but i didn ' t use very much .
F	i was thinking to sell but wasn ' t sure the best way to do it .
F	i read some positive_reviews about mpb and decided to take the plunge .
F	it was an immense delight !
F	everything worked_perfectly fast .
F	the contact , the quotation , the delivery , the payment .
F	certainly i will recommend to friends !
F	i booked 0 nights in " escape hostel " in lagos , and they cancelled my reservation cause they had an inspection and they had to close the hostel .
F	they charged the full_amount of the reservation , i ' m trying to get my money back but i have no answer .
F	i wouldn ' t book through this website again , cause i think they don ' t have reliable hostel to book .
F	can ' t fault .
F	ordering online was simple .
F	i made a mistake with the postage so had to call up .
F	the customer_service was fantastic , the guy was extremely polite , very helpful and sorted everything out straight_away .
F	i received my jacket yesterday , perfect .
F	exactly_what i wanted .
F	thank_you .
F	will_definitely use again and recommend to others .
F	fast delivery and quick payment , very good service
F	guinuine watches can be bought in cheaper price with frequent sales , vouchers and pointers .
F	i really love shopping in watch shop .
F	the description of the products are mostly accurate and it ' s totally worth it .
F	the packaging and delivery process is quick too , plus it ' s free !
F	come and shop in watchshop . com , satisfaction is guaranteed , and you ' ll definitely won ' t regret buying watches here .
F	^ _____ ^
F	i like this company / website ' s service .
F	quick delivery and cheaper_than other online contact_lenses shops .
F	the website is easy to use and i found what i was looking for at a much_better price than id seen elsewhere .
F	i was kept up to date with emails as the order was processed .
F	it did arrive a day or so later than_expected but it had come from guernsey so i don ' t mind .
F	will use again !
F	the watch shop had all the watches i had looked at on other_sites but at lower prices .
F	i struggled to find a watch big enough for my boyfriend but when i contact the watch shop they got back to me the next_day to say they could make any watch bigger at no extra_cost , they also provided a link to search_results filtered to the description i said i was looking for .
F	i ordered the watch on a sunday_evening and even_though the size was being increased i received the watch on tuesday_morning , and even received update emails at every_stage .
F	i honestly can ' t fault the service in any way .
F	easily found what i wanted at a lower_price than most other_places , quick and easy checkout and quick delivery .
F	will use again :)
F	wow !
F	this delivered fast and was cheaper !
F	really recommend this site :))
F	such a fast service so so so surprised .
F	easy to navigate site with super_speedy dispatch - my order arrived the next_day sensibly packaged .
F	excellent service , having been a sum what novice i rang modelsport on a few occasions , all staff i spoke to had a very friendly and professional_manner , who helped_me in making the right choice for my son , who is thrilled to bits with his new speed passion !!
F	thanks alot will be defo coming_back .
F	i recently received a very generous sample of the enliven shower gel and was pleasantly_surprised to find the fragrance very pleasant , not too over powering and long_lasting .
F	i have quite sensitive_skin but had no_problems using this product .
F	i was impressed by the nice lather it made .
F	i would be happy to but this product as you wouldn ' t need to use much , making it rather good value for money .
F	if i could give zero_stars i would .
F	i very very rarely have anything to complain_about but have to warn_people before using approved , i started off as an_avid fan , filling my cupboards for incredibly low costs .
F	the delivery charge is actually quite reasonable when you realise how much you can get and the choice and quality was very good .
F	however and this is the bit people should be_careful of ..... i made my third order a few_days ago and looked forward to the swift delivery , when it arrived , i discovered a very badly packed , well should i say not packaged at all , bottle of bubble bath had leaked over a large quantity of of my items .
F	when i contacted them , initially waited along time for a response but after messaging on fb , a gentlemen got back to me saying they were under staffed .
F	he promised to refund me due to having to clean everything and the bottle being damaged .
F	i had this in writing and photographs of the incident .
F	however a day later i was then informed that they were no_longer doing this and had to review my photos with the manager , they refused to refund unless they took all the items back and then decided if to refund .
F	so because of there mistake i would end up with no shopping and a possible refund in over a weeks time , if they decided ????
F	this is crazy .
F	after numerous_emails etc , i have given up .
F	they are obviously very under staffed and have a poor or should i say non_existent return_policy .
F	:-( now they just wont contact me back and have ignored my messages .
F	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
F	yes the food is tasty , yes it is convenient , yes i have lost weight but my warning is , it just isnt possible to stay on it as long as it states .
F	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
F	i expected to add some but this is ridiculous .
F	im not even that big and im nearly passing out .
F	plus i still had to calorie count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
F	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
F	if you are the sort of person who_likes fad diets , living off liquids and spending a fortune for the privalidge , try this !
F	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller portions .
F	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
F	would buy from here such good standard of products 😃
F	loved my fancy_dress outfit and can not wait to wear it :-)
F	i couldn ' t believe_how cheap the books are on here , so cheap too , and the site keeps you informed at every_stage of your order .
F	i love the layout , so simple and if you are unsure of the full title the search_function is a must
F	brilliant customer support , the site has everything all in one place , much cheaper_than anywhere_else in most_cases and the returns_policy is so straightforward , i continue to use amazon for most of my online purchases .
F	the site is so easy to navigate and the delivery men are always friendly and chatty , they take the time to explain the substitutes ( if any ) and make_sure we are happy before they leave us .
F	i really recommend asda , tesco quality has gone down in the last couple of years yet their prices have gone up and up , with asda the quality is amazing and the prices are brilliant .
F	a *
F	the customer_service centre is run from india who i can ' t understand , the gimmick is you can order up to 0pm the day before but they never have delivered it the next_day , i normally have to chase it up .
F	i may be unlucky but we have the most unsociable , ruse , tactless milkman ever who should definitely not be working with the public .
F	a disgusting ' service ', even the £_00 off won ' t make me return ( unless they sort their staff out ).
F	we recently_moved way out , no transport after a certain time so just - eat is great !
F	the reviews are clear so you see a new place at a glance , and the online order process is both easy and safe !
F	in the past when i had one bad_experience with one restaurant , they did all they could to make it right for me , i would recommend them to anyone :)
F	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can ' t fault the prices , i don ' t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!
F	also they maintain they normally send items the same day ... that has never happened to me infact i am_currently waiting for some dvds that have been in the ' stock pickingin progress ' stage for 0 days .
F	i didn ' t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn ' t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
F	site is easy to use and found everything i needed really quickly - ordered thursday , received next_day !
F	something else i really liked - i prefer to use paypal for my online purchases nowadays for security , especially if i don ' t know the company from name / experience - they not only offer paypal , but also google wallet which i ' ve been meaning to try , so definitely will use again !
F	i love ann_summers products and we have spent alot with them over the years but i wont be shopping with them again , the customer_service is getting worse and the returns process is just too long !
F	i purchased an item in october and decided to wear to for the first time on new years_eve , it was a lovely slip which made everything look fantastic - well for 0 hours til the strap snapped and i had to return home to change !
F	i returned the item on jan 0th , after emailing them since the 0st jan and finally getting a reply on the 0th asking me to send it in to them .
F	its now jan 00th and i still have no refund !
F	it was apparently processed on the 00th but im yet to see it !
F	i returned another item on the 00th and thats not even been processed yet !
F	ann_summers is great if you get a good product that fits well and doesnt break but the chances are it will be too small or poor quality and then you ` ll have to fight to get your money back !
F	not good ann_summers !!
F	ill be shopping elsewhere from now on - its time you realised theres alot of competition out there now and you need to step up your game !!!
F	!
F	if you need something sorting the details on here seem to be the best option , email sent - immediate reply !
F	fingers_crossed this will go somewhere now !
F	i use parcel0go alot , have done for about 0 years now and they have always been wonderful !
F	lots of choice , discount_codes , fab service and a company you can trust !
F	most packages arrive on time if not early and safe .
F	i have found out today that a package has been lost by the courier , parcel0go sorted this in just 00_mins !!!
F	i used live_chat to ask where the item was and was told it looked like it was misplaced and given a link to a form to fill , i filled and sent this back online instantly and was offered a refund moments later to the value of the goods plus the postage .
F	very very happy with the fast effective service and will_continue to use !
F	!
F	thanks so much for unlocking my iphone0s !
F	i ' m from the caribbean and i had gotten the iphone_0s sprint usa ...
F	i had tried different_ways of unlocking my phone and even ordered the gevy sim and jail broke it too ..... then i came_across you guys !
F	i was skeptical at first but after_reading all the reviews here and on facebook , i told myself these_guys have to be legit and i have the feeling that they can unlock my phone .
F	so i had pre_- ordered my unlock to get in the queue and within 0 week i got notification that i can complete my order for the unlock ..
F	i finished ordered my unlock and today 0 week_later i finally got the message that my phone was unlocked ....
F	my phone was jailbroken so i had to restore and upgrade and i smiled sooooooo much when i saw my country ' s carrier showing on my phone !!
F	:))) you guys delivered on your word that you do unlock iphones !
F	some get it right away , some wait a few_days or 0 weeks or more , but i can guarantee that these_guys can do the job !
F	if they can unlock my phone , they can unlock any other iphone !
F	:))) you just need to have a little patience and it will get done !
F	:)))
F	now i can use my phone as a phone and not just use it as a game console or music player ..
F	thanks so much again guys .. will_definitely_recommend !!!
F	:))) you rock !!
F	:))
F	using hostelbookers was probably the easiest booking experience i have ever had .
F	they list all your options in a full graphic menu making it super simple to pick and choose between establishments , and prices are upfront and fair .
F	i love the extensive user reviews each hostel has and that there are photos of what the rooms look like .
F	all in all it ' s a breeze to navigate and i will be coming_back for future_bookings .
F	the site compares all deals so you get the best offer and then routes you straight through to buy .
F	it has pay as you go phones at £ 0 . 00 which was great cos i needed something cheap .
F	a +++
F	has a great section on free phone and free line_rental , easy to find the best phone deal on one site with all the facts .
F	excellent customer_service and excellent product .
F	i will_definitely come back again for future frame purchases from picture gallery uk .
F	reasonable_price with high_quality product .
F	highly_recommended .
F	very good cust service and will_defo_recommend this website to friends .....
F	shoetique is user_friendly website .
F	i can simply find shoe based on the brand or by specific sort .
F	i would definitely_recommend this to all my friends .
F	i wish you could add more choices for each brand .
F	but so far , i am very delighted shopping online through shoetique .
F	keep up the good work !
F	i like that hostelbookers is so neatly organized in three tabs - that way i always know where to find the information i am tipically looking for .
F	i love that maps and streetview is integrated in the page !
F	the miniatures are perfect and i loved how you could choose as many or as little of each as you required .
F	the packaging was excellent , well_protected and delivery time was great .
F	i also really_appreciated the email when i wasn ' t sure of the date of delivery .
F	i was very impressed with how much care had been taken to bubble_wrap everything .
F	i don ' t understand the negative_comments on here , this company has been great !
F	they don ' t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
F	on the primark website you cant really see there range of clothes .
F	which i think is useless .
F	what if people wanna do their shopping online and they want to use primark ?
F	they need to step it up !
F	!
F	everything is easy to find on the website .
F	they were fast with the delivery .
F	nothing had been open like when i ' ve ordered products off other_websites .
F	i ' ve had no_problems with the products .
F	payment plans make everything easy
F	this company not only matches competitors ' prices but then gives a discount .
F	great inventory of different products as well .
F	i ' m a fairly new player on tombola ... only really been playing it for about 0 month on and off and have always enjoyed playing regardless of win or no win !
F	it ' s a site that you gamble on and can ' t always expect to win .... but the saying goes you have to be in it to win it and that ' s what i remember when i don ' t win !
F	rather_than mock others for their good luck .... yes sometimes people win more_than once but so do people at the normal bingo hall bingos ... it ' s the luck of the draw .
F	i would definitely_recommend tombola to anyone ... great to play when your out / in / inbed / sickofthehubby / inthebath / ontheloo haha it ' s so easy to play on my phone and i do love tombola
F	keep up the good work and feel free to pop my name into the winners machine since so many think it ' s a fix lol ( 0leafclovers ) jokes
F	in all seriousness 00 / 00 for site only_criticism is the music that plays when people win needs updated it ' s so irritating and old_fashioned .... nice big happy tune :-) i tend to play on mute for that reason
F	laura xx
F	perfect .
F	great value for money .
F	i bought nikon dslr camera with complete package .
F	quick and safe delivery .
F	i have chosen you after checking and reviewing many other online shopping sites for a few weeks ..
F	thank_you .
F	i am happy with dealing_with you
F	it was good experience and i will purchasing again from you organization
F	thanks a lot
F	regards
F	fatima
F	i got my north_face coat £_00 cheaper_than i ' d found it anywhere_else .
F	ordered it on tuesday night and it was delivered on thursday , even_though i picked free delivery that could have taken between 0 and 00 days .
F	in perfect_condition , very fast delivery , would definitely_recommend .
F	after trying to get beyoncé tickets for how many years now , i ' ve finally got 0 tickets ...
F	if only i knew about this website before i could have seen her a few_times .
F	beyoncé was sold out in minutes yet again & to be honest i want taking no 0 an answer .
F	i came_across this website & ordered tickets that were block 0 & guaranteed to be the 0st 00 rows from the front .. received rows j & k and they are rows 0 & 00 from the stage according to the plan ... so i am well_chuffed ... granted the tickets are nearly double the price of the face_value ( well in my case they were ) but to me it worth it better_than not going & some ppl are charging the same price i paid for a standing seat .. will do business again & thanks ...
F	i purchased a product on 00 / 00 /_0000 and to this date ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) have still not received my product .
F	i contacted beautybay and they informed that i needed to contact my national post service however as i was not provided with a tracking_number the national post service could not do anything about it .
F	i contacted customer_service several more times for more information about how i can track my order yet have had no feedback whatsoever .
F	i am disappointed with the service of beautybay
F	couldn ' t fault this company at all .
F	they were brilliant from start to finish - i ' d definitely use again and recommend to others !
F	always fast , reliable delivery with excellent prices on goods .
F	the sale section is amazing !
F	!
F	easy to find the phone , helpful instructions .
F	the envelope arrived the next_day , it was strong enough to hold the 0 old_phones i sent off .
F	i recieved an e_- mail the day after i sent the phones off just saying my phones had been recieved and to expect payment in the next two days .
F	i choose to give my bank_details and sure enough two days_later the money was in my bank .
F	if you do not want to give your bank_details there is the option to just get a cheque sent to you , but as you can guess it would take longer to get the money .
F	all in all it was every quick and easy to do and if i will no doubt do it again when i get a new phone .
F	great service . very efficient and helpful . would highly_recommend to others
F	orderd starwars 00 day time card had a problem with my mail live help sorted it in 0 min will be coming again
F	many thx
F	hostelbookers always helps me find the best value hostel for whatever destination i ' m headed to .
F	i used the website for my first few trips , and now i refuse to use another service .
F	i went to tesco express in petersfield and there was a staff_member called michael he was very helpful and polite he took me straight to the product i was looking for even carried the iterm as well that guy should get a bonus for being so kind
F	i ' ve had nothing but excellent service from this company .
F	the products are high_quality , well - selected and helpfully reviewed , delivery is 0 - 0 days ( courier is especially good , when you order compressed gas items ), loyalty_points and discount days are much_appreciated and they ' re very approachable if there ' s a problem .
F	easy to use website , very quick delivery , good quality products , very reasonably_priced
F	i ordered 0 items on 0th_september ; the website advised there was a 0 week wait for 0 of the items and the whole delivery would be sent at the same time .
F	0nd october nothing , so sent an_email , 0th_october no response to the email , called the free phone number ( 00000 000 000 ) but was a dead tone , had to call the 0000 number only to get through to a voicemail , 0th_october call was returned with voicemail left advising supplier delay no further details .
F	00th_october still absolutely nothing , no delivery , no email giving an update !!!
F	eventually after chasing via_email again i was advised by a customer_service advisor on 00 / 00 that my delivery would arrive on friday 00st october only to get another email 00th_october to be told 0 of the items would not be delivered ... cue yet another email to ' customer_services ' to be told the item was ' damaged in the warehouse ' and have now been told i can expact another few weeks wait .
F	how difficult is it to send 0 items in the post or at_least have continuity in information .
F	i completely understand that things get delayed but what ' s so difficult with telling your customers .
F	over 0 weeks from order to delivery is ridiculous , without chasing i would not have had a clue_what was going on .
F	would it be so difficult to send an_automated email to advise of supplier issues just to let customers know or is it too much_trouble for petplanet to keep their customers advised as to what is going on with the products they have paid for .
F	above all , as one of the other_reviewers mentions , why not just use basic business sense and keep all the items in stock by stock checking !
F	!
F	i have used petplanet before and encountered much the same issues , albeit not quite the same delivery wait but the customer_service provided is all the proof i need to not order use petplanet again .
F	handepay has helped my business succeed .
F	if your business is small or big , i was strongly advice you go with handepay .
F	i was dealt_with mark martin and he was friendly , professional and helped with any_problems i had .
F	it was easy and simple to order and receive my terminal .
F	i would advice all businesses to attend with handepay as you will receive the best offers , rates and professional service that you will require .
F	low_prices , always super_speedy_delivery and brilliant customer_services .
F	i am a regular customer and recommend to everyone !
F	the quality was good and as_described .
F	surprised to find a 0 months warranty on a refurbished mobile .
F	i ' ve booked lots of hostels with hostelbookers since it ' s easier than other_websites i ' ve tried .
F	you can browse hostels in an area by price , and it even shows you the separate prices for private and shared rooms which is really useful for finding a good deal .
F	all details of the hostels are shown so you know exactly_what they offer and what you get for your money .
F	paying is also fast and simple , and you can pay most of it to the hostel on arrival in case you need to make changes .
F	overall , a very user - friendly site !
F	i love supplementalwarehouse . com because they have the lean efx supplements at the cheapest price i have ever_seen .
F	they are very reliable and the free_gifts and merchandise are a great way to please the customer !
F	i understand_why the shipping is so much but at_least the free items make up for that cost and the cheap price of the item itself !
F	i ordered three onesies and paid for next - day delivery ( which was at half price - amazing ).
F	items arrived_safely and on time and my children have hardly taken their onesies off since christmas day .
F	thank_you boohoo !
F	love this site .
F	easy to find what i ' m looking for , great layout with pics , ratings and list of ammenities , also very easy to make a payment .
F	i love that it told me there were only two spaces left in the dorm i was looking at .
F	the juicer is very practical , not too big or heavy , just enough ... works_fine and we enjoy juices and pulp as well ..
F	couldn ' t be better
F	perfect customer_service ... and express delivery even on christmas time ... definetly recomended
F	i was able to take my parcel to a shop near work and drop it off .
F	the company received it in good time without any hitches or problems .
F	it was also the cheapest option for me .
F	would use them again .
F	hostelbookers is a very easy and convenient site to use .
F	they give great traveler reviews and rating and charge no booking_fees .
F	glasses are fab , prices that could not be_beaten and best customer_service experience i have came_across in a long time .
F	third time i have used health spark as as always kept up to date on order progress with emails .
F	goods received within a few_days .
F	customer discounts great , i always recommend to friends and i will be a returning customer time & time again !
F	lynne
F	booked tickets to newcastle and back for a friends 00th ( four of us ).
F	got there okay but when we were going to return to london , we noticed some tickets missing ......
F	with over 00_minutes to spare , i was in no panic , i was sure that this could be sorted out so we ambled over to the travel centre to explain , they asked for the seat numbers ( we had two , two were missing ) so we checked the original e_- mail which read no reserved seats , despite us having two at_least !
F	the lady at the travel centre said that there was nothing she could do and it was the choo choo trainline ' s responsibility .
F	fair_enough , we called them .
F	" you should have checked the tickets " was their excuse .
F	maybe so , but have you seen the amount of tickets they send you ?
F	receipts , reservation numbers , actual tickets , probably some shakin ' steven ' s concert tickets in there as well .
F	" well it ' s too_late for that now , can you kindly send the reference_number over so we can get the tickets re - printed and leave byker grove to return to good ole london town ?"
F	in short - no .
F	i was put through to about 00 different people who were just as rude as the last .
F	i was given their customer_service number to ring .
F	" can you just transfer the call ?"
F	don ' t be silly that would be far too simple .
F	why did they not want to transfer the call ?
F	because , as i discovered when i actually called it , it was flipping shut !
F	i called them again , they said they ' d put me through to someone who could help .
F	who was it ?
F	east_coast !
F	who we already knew had nothing to do with this !!
F	!
F	we obviously missed our train , we asked them to transfer our tickets .
F	would they ?
F	is the pope a muslim ?
F	the amount of time we spent on the phone to this sad excuse of a company i should have just paid the £_000 pound each they wanted for new tickets .
F	( we originally paid £_00 )
F	they wouldn ' t help , they didn ' t care that we were stranded with hardly any money , families to return home to and it was all their fault .
F	in the end we had to get the coach home .
F	i cannot even begin to remind myself of the terror of that journey ...............
F	in short , the trainline are a disgusting company .
F	they are foul .
F	they suck .
F	the customer_service obviously don ' t know the meaning of the words " customer_service "
F	the whole company deserves to catch syphilis and then go to hell and be locked in a flaming hot cell with adolt hitler , fred west and jimmy saville .
F	be assured that i will spread the word and i spread it damn good .
F	it was my little boys christening sunday 0th_may 0000 , we hired james from mobile disco wirral and what a great choice we made , fab play list songs suitable for all ages , brilliant with the kids they didnt sit_down all day he had them doing dancing compititions pass the parcel musical statues and many more party favourites he even managed 0 get few adults involved in the games , everyone commmented on how much fun they had had , such a reasonable_price aswell as i had tried a few different places and was quoted far more then i could ever afford , was nice 0 still have the entertainment we wanted at such fair prices , james was very friendly and very professional , i would definately_recommend him and will_definately be using him again next time i have a party 😃 he made what was already a fabulous day even better by keeping all the children smilling from ear to ear .
F	michelle ledsom
F	so easy to order , order response very good and postage very fast .
F	its clear we have a company that works to a high_standard in customer_service skills , i can tell you it goes a long way .
F	thank_you so much for a ourstanding service .
F	was very skeptical and it took 0 days instead of the 0 - 0 but it really works !
F	i now have a fully unlocked , brand_new phone !
F	i have used the service of iflorist on quite a few occasions and they have never failed to deliver .
F	there range of chose of flowers is brilliant , the ease of ordering on the internet is stress_free .
F	they have always delivered on the date that i have put in and who every receives them always sends me a text to say how lovely they are and how happy the flowers make them feel .
F	zoe
F	i find hostelbookers easy and straightforward to make a booking .. good prices and tips and i also love the fact there are no booking_fees .
F	been using for a long time now , always provide a great service , advice , delivery etc .
F	will_continue to use long into the foreseeable_future .
F	great weekend .
F	easy all in one package , saves booking everything individually .
F	hotel was really nice with great facilities .
F	a good night had by everyone .
F	hostelbookers is the best way to find and book your hostel without problem :) would reccomend the service to anyone lookin for a place to stay .
F	i placed a order , bag and letter came very quickly and i sent it off and the next_day recieved payment !
F	very good trusted service .
F	i ' ve purchased a variety of items from cash_generator in the past and i have never had any_problems .
F	the ordering_process is quick and easy and the delivery is always super_fast !
F	i would never hesitate to buy from them again .
F	they have some great items at brilliant prices !
F	very happy !
F	i ' ve ordered lots of items from e0p over the past couple of years .
F	bags , shoes , dresses , coats , tops , pretty_much everything !
F	i ' ve always received really good quality products in a good time , with parcel tracking too !
F	i can_honestly say there has only been one time that i had a problem ( a wrong item was sent in error ), i rang the customer_service number and was told that i would be sent an envelope to return the item free of charge and then the correct one would be sent .
F	the customer_service staff are really nice and very helpful , and i ' ve honestly never had an issue trying to get through on the phone .
F	the only possible downside i can think of is that things do sell out very quickly but it ' s not a major issue as there is always new things being added to the site the next_day .
F	overall , e0p is a fantastic company providing good quality items at an amazing price , which , let ' s face it , is what we all need at the moment !
F	:-)
F	hostelbookers is a really helpful website which is really easy to use .
F	it has a great range of information about the hostels including coherent and trustworthy reviews and photographs .
F	happy booking and exploring !
F	i found what i wanted and it was the cheapest price on any website and also came with free delivery .
F	i couldn ' t have asked for more !
F	i use viovet regulary to buy cat_food .
F	they are the cheapest around for what i want and they always deliver exactly when they say they are going to .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	arrived in time for a birthday_gift , items reasonably_priced and arrived well_packaged .
F	great seller
F	my clarisonic mia arrived quickly , was well - packaged and the whole transaction was seamless .
F	recommended seller !
F	overskuelig hjemmeside og god , hurtig_levering .
F	no_complains what so ever !
F	the kigs were great and so was the delivery .
F	the website itself is laid_out nicely and easy to use .
F	you can also use paypal which is something i like from websites as like most people i don ' t like putting my credit details on any site .
F	the delievery was fast , i ordered on a sunday and it arrived tuesday_morning .
F	the product was perfect and i also got the pre order edition even_though i didn ' t pre order which was nice .
F	the website provides cheap games in hard copy which is much_better_than buying a digital code for more money .
F	i would recommend , and i will buy from them again .
F	exeter printing . com is simply the best - and not just the best printing company ; i ' d go as far as to say they ' re one of the best companies is exeter full stop !
F	they offer fantastic customer_service , speed and top quality products time after time .
F	we have ordered about 00 different products in all and will never look at another printing company again .
F	also , i don ' t think we ' ve ever paid full price for anything as their monthly offers are so awesome and varied .
F	thank_you to ashley and his designers for provide our companies with such a great service .
F	highly recommenced to everyone .
F	we book online just few hours before and everything was just perfect , good descriptions and perfect service .
F	we find the perfect place in very short time and at the first search .
F	thank_you very much !
F	claudio & nadia < 0
F	cheaper products , quick delivery , no hassle !
F	perfume arrived quick , fully packaged !
F	genuine perfume , best price !
F	will shop again !
F	thanks cheapsmells !
F	:)
F	so happy that i didn ' t settle for some old_fashioned boots opticians glasses that are 0x the price !
F	i used the gd trial service which arrived two days_later i then decided on my frames and placed an order the same day !
F	two days_later my glasses arrive and they are perfect !
F	so glad i found gd !
F	will_definitely be back when i need new glasses !
F	thank_you !
F	i haven ' t received my delivery !
F	where did you leave it ?
F	who signed for it ??
F	i need it for this weekend .
F	i recently sold my phone on mazuma and i was very pleased with the speed of the service .
F	the money was in my account the day after posting .
F	amazing .
F	would sell here again and would recommend to others .
F	at the start of the process i received emails relating to other_peoples cases .
F	i was then sent an incorrect form to complete , when i did get the correct form and submitted it there were some bits of evidence needed that were missing but the forms had not been checked with the excuse " staff are not trained in that particular form ".
F	it was a fees exempt form which i would have thought was a fairly standard form .
F	emails go unanswered and they seem to need constant prompting to update the case and move onto the next stage .
F	complete_waste of money , if you have more_than two brain cells you are better off submitting the forms yourself it will be so much cheaper and so much less_stressful .
F	this company made an extremely difficult time even more difficult .
F	update after response :
F	so sending emails relating to other cases , not replying to emails , having to ask the same question 0 times before getting an answer ( i can provide_evidence of such if required ), needing to constantly prompt you to move onto the next stage ( which is the only reason my divorce was completed in 0 months nothing to do with your service ) that constitutes " no issues with our service to you " does it ?
F	says it all really
F	zazzle has the best stuff and their products are beautiful !
F	satisfied customer !
F	website is easy to use , customer_service is great and the order arrives swiftly .
F	was recommended by a friend and will_continue to use this company for all my lenses
F	i ordered havianas which were the wrong_size unfortunatley , i sent an_email enquiring what to do with these and how to get replacements .
F	i then decided to call as i assumed it would take days to reply via_email .
F	i spoke to a guy who was really helpfull , he went through the sizing as havianas all vary slightly and it ' s hard to tell what size you need .
F	we went and measured the length of the flip flop i wanted to confirm the size i needed .
F	once i had this sorted i got an_email from another person replying to my original email within 0 - 0 hours which was really fast .
F	i placed the order on the free shipping option for 0 days and it arrived in 0 working_days !
F	which is faster_than the next_day service i originaly used through amazon that took 0 - 0 working_days .
F	amazing service
F	also the flip flops i got were great
F	i just wanted to warn_people before booking with this company - not to use them
F	they are actually the worst company i ever_dealt_with .
F	i booked 0 tickets coming_back from belgrade to london .
F	i confirmed it all online which was correct .
F	after there was something wrong with the payment i called the next_day to pay over the phone .
F	after getting the email confirmation later that day , i saw they autocorrected the main persons name on the tickets to the card holders name when taking the payment over the phone .
F	once i saw the error i called but couldn ’ t get hold of anyone for weeks , just got told i had to email to get the name corrected again .
F	eventually someone got back to me and they refused to fix their error .
F	i had to cancel the flight , pay cancelation fees and rebook which i did with another company .
F	after waiting for the refund for 0 weeks , we found we were refunded all 0 flights less 0 cancelation fees after we specifically asked them to only cancel 0 flight
F	by now the flights have gotten much more_expensive and they refused to un - cancel the flights or let us pay the same amount we originally paid for them
F	eventually the flight sold out and all 0 of us have to catch all separate flights home and have paid loads more plus cancelation fees .
F	they refuse to give any discounts or money off even_though it was 000_% their error .
F	they also never reply to emails , i had to send the same email 00 times in a row from 0 different email addresses just so 0 person would respond .
F	0 months later we are still pending the refund but otherwise things seem to be sorted as we re - booked new flights through another company
F	i am usually very calm when it comes to these kind of issues but this was the worst airline and worst booking experience i have ever_dealt_with .
F	i really don ’ t want anyone to have to go through what i did so please don ' t use this company !!!!!!!!!!!
F	!
F	hats_off to webtogs -- i don ' t think i ' ve ever come_across such great customer_service , let_alone the fact that the item concerned was half price in the first place .
F	i had a small problem with an ( otherwise brilliant ) icebreaker top i bought last_year and rang webtogs ; they were super friendly and instantly emailed a returns_label with free postage .
F	in well under a week i had received a replacement they had obtained from icebreaker .
F	and this on top of low_prices , next_day free delivery , etc -- big_thumbs_up .
F	they ' ll be my first_port of call for outdoor_kit in the future .
F	i found a maggot in a piece of cheese bought from aldi which still had more_than a month before it ' s expiry_date .
F	when contacting aldi customer_services to complain i was contacted by phone and told that they would not refund the cheese as i did not have the receipt and had thrown the cheese in the bin .
F	when i started to explain how disgusted i was i patronised by the agent telling_me to stop shouting at her and she was terminating the call .
F	i did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call .
F	i said i would write a review about this and i was told " go on then " and was cut_off .
F	i have only been with scottish_power for 0 months and have never in my life known anything like it .
F	" we are experiencing high volumes of calls and the wait will be 0 hours 00_mins , your call is moving to the front of the queue " if you don ' t have a hands free phone find somewhere comfortable to sit .
F	i was on hold for 0hour 00mins during this time i did all my housework and 0 lots of washing with the phone cradled against my ear only to be cut_off by the stupid woman who couldn ' t get my name right .
F	i give my readings online but the woman said they can ' t be correct .
F	i assure they are correct but she was having none of it .
F	then they decided all my metre reading were wrong so i received a cheque wa hey !
F	£_000 . 00p i was delighted .
F	turns_out i had to pay them the cheque amount back as they had made a mistake .
F	i am absolutely livid and am deffinatly changing suppliers .
F	я второй раз использую hostelbookers . com ( раньше пользовалась booking . com ).
F	мне понравились все отели забронированные для путешествия по франции , поэтому я снова использую этот сайт для бронирования мест проживания в испании .
F	большой выбор отелей и доступные цены - вот почему я опять использую этот сайт !

F	so helpful !
F	was a little unsure_about buying from them but i went_ahead and did it and haven ' t regretted it !
F	loads and loads !
F	i like buying tickets on eventim , you can always get them when there ' s a rush & other_sites are crashing !
F	would definitely_recommend using this site .
F	i am looking_forward to comfortably purchasing my lady_gaga tickets on there on friday .

F	good prices , easy to purchase .
F	just simple and elegent would recommend to everyone .
F	an excellent night had by all our party , good value for money , easy booking process .
F	highly_recommend booking your hen_night with chilli_sauce .
F	i don ' t understand_why pretty_much the whole of scotland is considered an extended areas in the uk which may has additional surcharge for postage .
F	it costs no more to send to glasgow than it does to send to manchester and if their courier is charging them an extra £_00 to deliver a medium package to glasgow then they should sack their supply chain manager .
F	dont don ' t waste your time going through to checkout with purchases if you don ' t live in england as delivery will cost you .

F	i received a phone call from talk_talk saying that they wanted to give me a free tv package upgrade as they wanted to make_sure their existing_customers received the same deal as that offered to new customers .
F	he insisted several_times that i install the box as quickly as i could so that they could check it was working correctly and if i didn ' t they could charge me for the box .
F	so i agreed to the free upgrade and only towards the end of the call did he say that my contract would be extended for a further 00 months .
F	now , i was not an unhappy talk_talk customer as have been with them for years and so , caught offhand and realising that you get nothing for nothing no matter what the sales guy tells you , i said okay .
F	the box and router arrived lunchtime on 0th_november and my husband connected it that evening .
F	now for a variety of reasons including exposed cabling and router in the hall , dissatisfaction with tv offering and the fact that our smart_tv offered an equivalent service we decided to return the tv box and ask that we return to our old package of tv and broadband with the contract ending in a few_months .
F	this is where the trouble started .
F	firstly i spoke to an agent who asked me the details of why we wanted to return it .
F	she passed me onto someone in the loyalty team who again asked why we didn ' t want it and he tried hard to convince us to keep it .
F	i was adamant that we didn ' t want it and was dumbfounded to hear that it would cost us £_000 to return it .
F	i explained that at no time was this ever mentioned in the initial call selling us the deal , but he was equally adamant that we keep it or pay £_000 as the telephone and broadband deal we were on prior to this upgrade was not now available .
F	i asked to speak to a supervisor and after hanging on for a long while got through to a supervisor in india .
F	again i explained the situation and again the reasons we did not want the package and asked him why we couldn ' t return the tv box under the distance_selling rules or under the 00 day cooling_off period .
F	he agreed that we shouldn ' t have to pay the £_000 and i then asked him to organise that our account go back to its status before the " free " tv upgrade .
F	his computer failed and he had to call me back a while later .
F	on his return call he confirmed i could return the tv box and router , there would be no charge and he would arrange a return delivery bag .
F	he then passed me to the cancellations_team to have my account returned to its original status .
F	imagine my frustration when the agent started from scratch telling_me i couldn ' t cancel and it would cost £_000 to return the tv box - nothing on my file about not being charged !
F	i asked to speak to the supervisor who had passed the call to him ( mario i think ) but instead was put through to a heavily accented supervisor called rheyn suabez who told me it was not possible to return the box without incurring a charge and that i had agreed to an extension to my contract and the distance_selling rules and 00 day cooling_off period did not apply as i had connected the device the night before .
F	i explained hat this was only because the sales_rep had urged me several_times to get do this as quickly as possible after receipt .
F	i now had a 00 month_contract and a tv package i did not want .
F	the other option was to break the contract which would cost me £_000 !
F	on checking the terms and conditions i see that because i connected i will be deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions and agree that you will also lose your statutory right of cancellation under the regulations .
F	so that was why the sales guy placed so much emphasis on getting it connected so quickly .
F	the minute you switch it on your are stuffed !
F	i have gone from being an ambivalent customer to now being a very frustrated and angry one : {
F	perhaps now i shouldn ' t be surprised talktalk is prepared to employ such tactics to hand - cuff disaffected customers for relatively short_term , comparatively minimal financial gain , rather_than have them actively want to stay because of good service and good value .
F	do not trust anything these people say to you on the phone .
F	do not agree to anything on the phone until you see all their ambiguous terms and conditions or you will be trapped into their 00 month plan .
F	******* update *******
F	received phone call from talk_talk last_night agreeing to roll back my contract and arrange free uplift of tv box after registering complaint with them .
F	maybe they are getting their act_together .
F	i ordered a mattress and it was delivered the following_morning .
F	i received a text to say when it would arrive and sure enough , it arrived within the time_frame allocated .
F	i am really pleased with the qulaity of the mattress , it is so comfortable zzzzz
F	good quality website , fantastically priced tickets , no hassle at all .
F	i especially liked the follow - up call to check i had received my e_- ticket .
F	very professional service !
F	it was the best thing i ever done joining bingo cams i love the site see u later
F	i ' ve used these_guys a few_times over the years for different consoles and i have always been very pleased with the service .
F	recommended !
F	!
F	excellent service with friendly staff , received my tickets with no_problems at all .
F	will be using double0_tickets again :)
F	clearly organised webside , easy to navigate and find what you ' re looking for .
F	a booking can be done in a minute plus i have never_experienced any_problems .
F	always fast delivery .
F	records and sleeves in perfect_condition , have never received any warped ones from juno .
F	a parcel i had been waiting on from australia for 0 - 0 months arrived when i was on holiday abroad .
F	my first complaint is that only two attempted delivery notes had been left in the mail , but the last of them said it had been the third delivery attempt .
F	i rescheduled the delivery online for the next working day and was patiently sat waiting for the whole of the ( unacceptable ) delivery window ( 0am - 0pm ).
F	when no parcel showed up , i called the number on the call card and was told that the parcel had been returned to sender , without any notification of this .
F	yodel could give me no information whatsoever of the whereabouts of my package , no tracking_number , not even the name of the carrier who now has it or what address it is going to .
F	the person on the phone just kept saying yodel don ' t do international deliveries and therefore cannot help me .
F	my parcel is now lost , and as the sender was myself when i still lived in australia , there is no sender to take care of the package when it arrives .
F	booked a hen_weekend in cambridge for my sister and 00 girls .
F	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age group and also personalities .
F	had a few hitches with the company during the booking stage , i felt_like i was asking too much when all i wanted was a few more invites added .
F	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
F	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
F	but then when the final itinerary came out this was very different .
F	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
F	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary stress .
F	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
F	so the weekend itself started off great , we managed to book in early to the holiday inn which was great !
F	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
F	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
F	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
F	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
F	so all in all a fab weekend just a shame the organiser had the added stress .
F	we love topcashback , we tell everyone about it .
F	we have saved hundreds of pounds with it over the years .
F	if you are an online shopper this website is a must .
F	the list of retailers is huge and the savings are great , plus unlike_other savings website it ' s free to join .
F	keep up the great work topcashback team !
F	" i have bought quite a lot of products from dapw / soak n sleep , i find the quality of the bedding so luxuriously soft that the only_downfall is that i struggle more to get out my bed or the big cloud as my kids have now renamed it .
F	for quality , service and value i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else .
F	i highly_recommend and have to friends and family . "
F	super_quick and received the amount offered .
F	would recommend a *
F	always happy with littlewoods , quick and easy to use website , prompt delivery and great communication , plus love the interest free credit and cashback !
F	!
F	dead simple to use .
F	quick payment
F	would definatley recommend and use again .
F	hostelbookers is easy to use , covering a wide_range of accommodation to suit any budget .
F	all costs are clear and up front and the extra information is useful and vital for choosing the right place for my trip .
F	i would definitely reccomended to friends and will be using the site again .
F	very well made and really comfortable could sitiin it for hours
F	i was very pleased with charm school uk , a fantastic selection of chamrs and just what i was looking for .
F	charm price was very reasonable , as was the postage .
F	the item was delivered very quickly and packaged very nicely .
F	what more could i ask for ?
F	our booking with alpharooms was simple and easy .
F	after booking and paying we received our holiday voucher to hand in at the hotel and it was as simple as that .
F	very competitive_prices , cheapest on the net after shopping around .
F	highly_recommended .
F	thank_you xxx
F	ok , this site can be a little difficult to navigate and its not that simple to find the deals when they are out , but boy have i had some cheap flights in the past !
F	i highly_recommend that everyone keeps this in their bookmarks to keep an eye on
F	i love this site and i always check on there before buying anything !!
F	!
F	lots of great bargains and also assistance when required .
F	highly_recommended by me !
F	i have used play . com several_times to order offers and deals .
F	i love the way that delivery is free and arrives within a couple of days .
F	my family and i sat waiting for our food , all starvin !!
F	which never turned_up .
F	i phoned the chinese who said they had not received any order and had received several calls within the last half an_hour from other customers waiting for their food !
F	called just - eat - who reassured me it wasnt my fault !!!!
F	cheeky gits , and simply said that when the order had been sent to the chinese they had rejected it ????
F	i enquired whether it was not normal practice for them to tell me about this , save us waiting for our food and they said they usually do but this one seemed to just slip through the net !
F	!
F	wont be using them again i ' m_afraid !
F	excellent excellent
F	good service .
F	delivered relatively quick .
F	did leave with neighbour even_though that wasn ' t requested , which was slightly worrying .
F	i was not protected in this case .
F	the garment was lovely however after one wear the quality seems to have diminished already , which isn ' t desirable considering the amount paid for the dress .
F	beautifully_packaged but i did expect the dress to come with a protector bag given the nature of its fabric .
F	i feel luxury sites such as yourself should not charge shipping when i pay £_000 for a dress .
F	overall okay experience .
F	do not use them !
F	they offered me a two month free_trial with credit vouchers i put in the codes to come back .
F	these codes would not work , so tried several_times .
F	they ended_up taking four payments from my account !
F	after i had complained and informed them , they still took it out several days .
F	i have emailed them and they say it will take 0 - 0 working_days to be approved and refunded .
F	this was after finding they took two payments , i then discovered another two so have now had to email them again .
F	it is fraudulent and a mis selling of their products .
F	i would not recommend them due to this situation and their poor choice of films available instantly .
F	do not use !
F	i have read feedback on this site and a lot of it is negative , which is bad news for the brand , but they appear to not care as they keep repeating the same bad customer_service and poor business mistakes .
F	have used moonpig many_times , excellent choice and good value .
F	if i were to want anything more it would be a handcrafted option to customise for those really special occasions .
F	no - they may not always be the cheapest provider on the market , but their service is worth the little extra you pay in my opinion .
F	no bad_experience to date over several years of using them .
F	on more_than one_occasion , yodel have left my parcels with my wheelie bins , totally indiscreetly with valuable goods inside .
F	this is totally_unacceptable and is not a safe location - all of my neighbours are happy to keep parcels on my behalf and do so on a regular_basis with all other delivery services i have used .
F	sent my phone on friday and by monday my order was approved for the full_amount .
F	two days_later the moment was in my account , really pleased !
F	i was skeptical at first but after_reading the reviews on trustpilot . com i decided to take the plunge , after all the game i wanted was marked down to a very low price .
F	i needn ' t have been worried as the order was delivered to me within the hour ( i believe it took longer for me as i have a paypal and personal email .
F	very happy with my purchase and recommended them to my friends and so .
F	well i can ' t knock it at all .
F	less then 00_hours to arrive brilliant postage_costs and reliable service .
F	i will be using you again that is for sure .
F	thanx a lot .
F	well as i ordered these a week before_xmas and they came a week after to say i ' m impressed is an_understatement and having put them onto the devices they where for they look awesome and made them look like brand_new items thanx a lot i ail be using you again .
F	xx
F	well , i brought 0 lady_gaga tickets for stade de france in april of this year .
F	it is now exactly 00 days till the event and do not have any sign of tickets being dispatched and i know tickets dont usually get sent " 0 - 0 weeks till the event " but i have put a lot of time and money into this trip and as i am travelling from england i would like to be assured that the seller will be sending them soon as possible .
F	me and my friend are both hardcore gaga fans and decided that because at the time she was sold out in manchester and london nothing would stop us so decided to use the website which i have heard was so " great " which was of course viagogo . co . uk , this is my first time in dealing_with this website and i can safely_say this will be the last .
F	i have sent an_email_saying that if i do not recieve an_email_saying they have been dispatched by the 00th_sept then i will be requesting for a full_refund and putting in a formal_complaint !
F	my transaction_id is 0000000 and if i could get an actual human response that would be a bonus too !
F	hostelbookers . com is the best hostel booking website of them all because its format , options , and prices are better_than the others !
F	i love that they display all the options in a condensed easy to read format , showing pricing for both private and double_rooms , in slender rows .
F	i have found that they include just as many if not more hostels than the other_websites .
F	and their prices are often marked down .
F	their main page for each hostel is easy to navigate and read .
F	this is my go - to hostel booking site !
F	i am so impressed with the quality , service , extremely quick delivery .
F	i have ordered my 0d crystal for my husband for our_wedding_anniversary .
F	it ' s still two_weeks till our anniversary and i just can ' t wait to give it to him .
F	it is absolutely_stunning .
F	will recommend incrystals to everyone i know .
F	thank_you for my gorgeus crystal :-).
F	i will_definitely use incrystals again !
F	exellent !!
F	thanx
F	this is my second time ordering from sw and so far had no_problems with them .
F	there shipping time is reasonable and the prices are unbeatable .
F	even_though they don ' t offer free shipping they do offer lots and i mean lots of samples and i have not seen one company offer so many .
F	this not only compensates the shipping cost but it goes beyond that .
F	the whole_process is so easy and understandable to process with no_hassles or problems .
F	i will_continue to purchase my items from sw and i will recommend this company to anyone who is looking for quality products and low_prices .
F	you are great , as soon as i posted my old phone , that i had lying_around for ages , the money was in my bank within 0 days !
F	thank_you :-)
F	i recently_purchased a solid_oak dining_table with 0 chairs and an oak sideboard from wowcher , totalling nearly £_000 . 00 !
F	we were in the process of moving_house so didn ’ t open it straight_away left it all wrapped up , in the packaging etc … to open it last sunday to find the dining_table all broken underneath !
F	i contacted mountrose who the table was supplied from and they said to contact wowcher direct .
F	on monday i called wowcher and they advised me to e mail the damaged photos over to them and someone would return my e mail that day ….
F	surprise_surprise nothing heard .
F	so i called tuesday to be advised “ the lady in despatch wasn ’ t in yesterday ” one lady ?!
F	ok , no problem , someone would look at my damaged photos and get back to me that day ( tuesday )… by 0 pm id still not heard a whisper , so i called again wednesday to be told someone would get back to me that day … sure enough by 0pm id had an e mail yippee !...
F	they wanted to see damaged photos ( id already sent these on monday ) !!
F	and wanted to know a day the following week when someone would be available to pick the table up ….
F	after a long wait trying to get through to customer_services , they advised me that the lady named kennedy had gone home now and she was working her way through the various e mails and mine hadn ’ t got to the top !
F	here ’_s a suggestion wowcher employ more_than one person then !
F	so here we are friday_afternoon and i ’ m still_waiting to see if my table is going to be picked_up in just0 days ’ time as i have to arrange somebody to sit at home all day whilst they come … and weather the new table will be delivered on the same day !...
F	i have bought several items from wowcher and will never buy from them again after this utter_rubbish customer experience !
F	true relaxation of the mind , body and soul .
F	very friendly staff , makes you feel welcomed and a true value for money .
F	very clearly explained to me various forms of massage and very authentic traditional thai massage is practiced .
F	clean environment and makes you feel very comfortable .
F	advice - please book your appointments and get lost in the sabai thai massage .
F	love - rat
F	scandalous company , advertising totally fictitious prices !
F	they say ' good availability ' on selected seats but they are mysteriously ' sold out ' when you phone and then they quote a much higher price ( almost_double ).
F	the website is also a con , it looks_like your going to be able to book the flights but when you go through to the payment page the price shoots up , if you didn ' t notice you could end up booking at a much higher price !
F	representatives are incredibly_rude and patronising when you phone making out you ' re stupid for even thinking you can get flights at the advertised price !
F	awful that they are allowed to continue trading and awful that skyscanner continues to include them in searches !
F	i looked around at a few mobile recycle sites , and thought i ' d go with mazuma .
F	i sent of for a postage pack which arrived within two days , i posted the pack on the friday and by monday the money was in my account and it was the amount i was told , alot of sites give you less money when they actually receive the phones .
F	great company , great service !
F	000_% recommended
F	husband very happy = happy wife , thank_you
F	read some bad_reviews after i booked pole_dancing and butler in the buff !
F	wasn ' t sure what to expect !
F	i have to say that i couldn ' t have been more happier with the service i received .
F	the ease of booking and paying individually was great .
F	the queries i had were answered_quickly and to my satisfaction .
F	both pole_dancing instructor and butler were fantastic couldn ' t fault them .
F	00 happy girls after a great hen_do !!
F	thanks again :)
F	i placed an order yesterday_afternoon and have received it the next_day !
F	they have such a massive_range pf products , it was tough picking out a gift for my husband .
F	the products i did pick were of top quality .
F	thanks !
F	we have two of the large acrylics now and they are gorgeous .
F	we picked wedding photos with bright colours and they have turned_out so vibrant !
F	the delivery speed is brilliant too - when we ordered our second one , it arrived so quickly , we didn ' t even realise it was the acrylic until we opened it !
F	will_definitely order again .
F	thanks !
F	i almost sent my phone to envirofone for about £_00 .
F	fortunately , i used a price comparison site and fonebank offered me almost_double .
F	sent my phone off with the paid envelope and the money was transferred over quickly .

F	my son has yet to use it as he hasn ' t had his_birthday yet but i am sure he will be totally delighted with it .
F	great service and great product .
F	many_thanks !
F	fantastic service .
F	was sent an_email to notify me my dog_food was on it ' s way .
F	delivery was very quick .
F	the price was the best i found anywhere on line .
F	would thoroughly_recommend to anyone .
F	i also liked the possibility to be able to collect the food direct from their warehouse in markyate which we probably will do next time .
F	found the process really easy and would deffo recommend .
F	i like the fact that if they dont think phone is worth what was quoted they send it back :)
F	bought item then after a week was told not in stock .
F	0weeks later still_waiting for my refund !!
F	avoid id say !
F	as many have mentioned , i was a little_worried_about sending my old ipads to a company i had never_heard of - however i am pleased to say i was proven very wrong !!!
F	mazumamobile offered me £_00 for two , first generation ipads , ipad_recycle offered me £_000 !
F	!
F	they said that one was a grade b , rather_than a grade a like i claimed , however because i sent in two ipads they would offer me the original_quote - what other company would do this ??
F	?
F	i sent the ipads by special delivery on saturday , and by the time i was home monday after work , i had an_email_confirming the price , and the money was in my account - awesome service !!
F	!
F	will use you again , and recommend to others :)
F	incredibly surprised how well everything went , i was prepared for a bit of a haggle with mazuma over the price of my phone but they sent me an_email a day after i posted my phone saying a check had been posted for me for the exact amount i was quoted and the check turned_up the very next_day , very impressed , thank_you .
F	only reviewing on customer_service as have not recieved parcel yet .
F	but sam on their facebook_page was very helpful , and quick to respond .
F	the service was quick and easy to use and the entire transaction was smooth and efficent .
F	i received my clarsonic mia soon after i placed the order with a signature required .
F	i am pleased with the product as well as the service .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	where do i begin ?
F	i booked a hotel in san_francisco over the weekend with hotelsclick .
F	i subsequently attempted to call up and speak to someone about my booking .
F	for three days i called every_single number listed at the bottom of their website , including for their offices abroad .
F	i never managed to get through to anyone , despite calling several_times throughout the morning and afternoon .
F	i also called the hotel directly and they had no confirmation of my booking whatsoever , despite the money being taken from my account .
F	the red warning lights were now flashing .
F	i also emailed hotelsclick asking someone to call me , i have not received a reply nor a phone call .
F	i decided to cancel the booking which i was entitled to do since i was within the cancellation window .
F	i have confirmation that the booking has been cancelled but no refund has been given , despite the faqs on the website stating that refunds are given the same day .
F	my booking reference is h0000 - 00000 .
F	please can someone at hotelsclick contact me about my refund as a matter of urgency .
F	please , please do not book with hotelsclick - i have never come_across a company like this that takes your money yet does not pick_up the phone or reply to emails .
F	i look_forward to hearing from you hotelsclick .
F	regards
F	danielle
F	i would definitely_recommend this to anyone and will be my go to hostel booking site !
F	i found double0 ' s service excellent .
F	every time i called to find out when my tickets would arrive they were always very imformative and even called me to let me know that they had been dispatched .
F	i would recommend them and would use them again .
F	love the product , but was slightly disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i ' d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
F	the pack to send in my old phone arrived earlier_than i expected it to , and the money was in my bank_account the day after i posted it !
F	excellent service !
F	i love shopping here , sells things no one else does like fermented cod liver oil etc
F	everything has arrived , quickly , intact and with care .
F	really lovely mince wonderful marbling taste is devine
F	happy to be a very loyal_customer
F	fantastic range of gear with reasonable prices and great delivery service .
F	friendly and knowledgeable_staff who are always ready to help .
F	highly_recommended !
F	by_far cheaper_than many of thier competitors , it makes a realy difference to our stationary budget , being_able to get the same products from here at a much_better price .
F	customer_service and delivery are also faultless .
F	this site is ok .
F	it doesn ' t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
F	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
F	i sell everything on preloved .
F	it is my first_port of call when i ' m looking for something to buy .
F	they are quick to reply to emails .
F	obviously they can ' t be held_responsible for some of the sellers and buyers but as a site it ' s brilliant .
F	very easy to understand .
F	i like the membership .
F	it gives you more chance to buy the things you want before the rest of the world !
F	preloved is my favourite web_site !
F	i would and do recommend this site to everybody .
F	for value you can ' t beat them .
F	i have been with them now for two years and each year i could not find anything cheaper .
F	i haven ' t made a claim so can ' t comment on that but the staff seem polite and very helpful .
F	i recommend this company 000_%.
F	as i struggled through the door with three children ( 0 being in a car_seat ) and two under 0 , two men stood chatting away to each other .
F	i had around £ 0000 to buy carpet for my stairs and bedrooms .
F	i finally manage to get in and have a look around for 0 minutes clear in my mind what i was going to go for .
F	i look towards the door and an older man and women are about to walk in .
F	the to staff couldn ' t get to the door quicker !
F	speaking nicely to them and asking if they would like any help !
F	seriously !
F	because i have three children i must be poor right !
F	well that was it .
F	i decided not to spend my money there !
F	i shouted how rude that was as i left and wrote a letter of complaint .
F	they sent me a 00_% ( i think ) money off voucher .
F	no apology , just money off .
F	i would never shop in carpet right now or in the future .
F	very quick dispatch and delivery .
F	great value for money .
F	i recommend this company 000_%.
F	i have used viovet 0 times now and two of the three occasions i had next working day delivery .
F	i 000_% recommend them to everyone .
F	the products are very good value for money .
F	always a good sale on , the products are a lot cheaper on surfdome compared to a lot of other_sites !
F	i have just purchased 0 tickets for the david haye vs tyson fury boxing match in february .
F	the booking process was very straight_forward , and when i rang to enquire_about if the seats would be together , the call operator was very helpful .
F	the seats are in a brilliant position and i can ' t wait for the event !
F	!
F	this was the first time i have used double 0 tickets but i will_defiantly be using them for future events !!
F	!
F	client depuis quelques années , le_prix de croquette pour mes lapins devient le plus en plus cher .
F	le sachet de 00 kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
F	pour les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
F	customer_service is really excellent , shipping is super_fast to france all the way from the uk .
F	very happy with the service and the products , i will come back again :)
F	i recently started using wowcher when i saw a great deal for a break away to find that i could not book for 0 days after i had paid and that the only time i could go was not available .
F	i telephoned to ask if wowcher could assist in helping with availability however they quickly advised i had to call the merchant who said i then had to pay more money if i wanted the date advertised .
F	i telephoned wowcher back who advised it was out of their control and if i wanted a refund i could have one .
F	i said yes and the advisor said she would process the refund , i asked how long it would take to receive and she said within 0 working_days .
F	i have just checked my bank_account and no refund .
F	so i have called wowcher who are denying saying they would process the refund and it was up to me to request it ... correct me if i am wrong but the conversation clearly_states that i would like a refund and how long it would take to be received to which the rep answered , is this not classed_as requesting a refund .
F	i have asked the rep to listen to the call which clearly says that i asked the rep to tell me when it would be issued !
F	!
F	i am awaiting a call back .
F	however i will never use wowcher again , nor will i recommend them due to the poor service and when i you request a refund by telephone , letter or email you expect it to be sent !
F	just wasted over an_hour of my life adding items to my shopping_cart only to find that when i went to complete order , my delivery slot had been taken .
F	i am well aware of the 0 hour delivery slot hold time , but i was well within that .
F	it would usually take me around the same time to choose these items in a shop , however this time my shopping_cart was deleted .
F	this has happened to me before but i was willing to put it down to some sort of interupted internet_connection .
F	i ' m pretty sure that i will not bother trying to do this again even_though i have been a loyal_customer of yours for the past 00 years .
F	not happy .
F	very hungry
F	would definitely_recommend to a friend
F	i found this company on a search_engine .
F	took 0 minutes to find what i needed , order and pay for it .
F	arrived within the time scales stated .
F	such a hard website to navigate
F	i always google it !
F	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
F	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something else now i understand that they do run out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic ..
F	paid virgin mobile for next_day delivery and yodel deliver it to the wrong_address and it has been signed for , by the time i realise the company ' s call_centre had shut as for some silly reason they shut at 0pm even_though you can receive deliveries up until 0pm !!
F	who is employed by a delivery company who can ' t get a flipping address correct , now i cant find my very expensive product .
F	the call_centre when i did manage to speak to them briefly just fobbed me off and gave me the van drivers mobile number , now i guess its just because he wanted to go home , but the van driver wont answer his ruddy phone , so they will be getting an earful on the phone first thing in the morning until something has happened .
F	compareholidaymoney was recommended to me by a friend after i was unsure where to buy my currency .
F	i have never purchased it online before so was apprehensive to do so for the first time .
F	i had nothing to worry_about as this site is great !
F	it ' s user - friendly and simple to navigate .
F	it offered competitive rates and was delivered quickly once ordered !
F	i will_definately be telling friends and family about it !
F	quick delivery , excellent condition
F	absolute_joke of a company ... ordered £_00 worth of food for my boy cat who is on a special prescription diet .
F	within an_hour money was refunded though it took nearly three days for the money to actually credit back to my account .
F	having phoned for an explanation i spoke to two very rude staff_members who stated that pdol no_longer deliver to inverness scotland which is most certainly mainland_uk as it was too expensive though they always did up until recently so i find it difficult to believe they ' ve only just noticed the higher costs to themselves seen as they have been trading for years .
F	having found the same product on ebay i ordered from pdol0000 but did not realise they are the same company and same_thing happened only it took them four days to issue a refund through paypal which is now being held (£ 00 ) and won ' t be available to me until goodness knows when .
F	worst and most rude company i have ever_dealt_with .
F	i strongly_suggest you try petfleas . co . uk as they provided me with a first_class extremely quick service .
F	shame on you pdol , don ' t lie you don ' t give a damn about animals all you care about is profit !
F	just noticed a review from a customer in denmark , you can send to denmark but you can ' t send within your own country , bunch of idiots !
F	ordered moderate calorie urinary tract wet 00 pouch and order was delivered extremely quickly within two days ... amazing .
F	free delivery and if buying in bulk even cheaper .
F	a much_better and far more professional company than pet drugs online who refused to deliver the same product to a city in scotland as we were not considered to be part of mainland_uk , if pdol can ' t read a map properly i certainly would not trust them with anything related to my pets !
F	will be recommending this company to everyone as they have provided a fantastic service and i will most certainly be ordering from them again very soon .
F	thank_you petfleas . co . uk you have made my boy very happy and healthy with his prescription diet .
F	merry_christmas to all the staff and a very happy new year :-_d x
F	ordered effipro flea and tick treatment for cats four pack .
F	cheapest price i could find lots cheaper_than any other site and i checked loads .
F	received two days after ordering ... fantastic .
F	highly_recommend i will be back :-_d
F	have had a credit account for two months and owe only £_00 .
F	made first payment which was double the asked for minimum amount .
F	tried to place an order which was cancelled then tried again thinking it was just a glitch and again order cancelled .
F	phoned a 00p_per_minute line only to be told my account is under review ... the lady explained that the company were looking in to my purchases and payment history and that i should attempt to place an order after my next statement which isn ' t for another three_weeks !
F	customer_service agent then advised that i should pay for my order cash to which i replied " that kind of defeats the purpose of having a credit account doesn ' t it ".
F	this does not amuse me as i am trying to rebuild a dodgy teenage period of bad credit decisions .
F	what an odd company i would not suggest anybody no matter how utterly desperate you truly are and believe me i too was desperate but believe me i ' m not that desperate to be mucked about by a company who feed of the poorer in our society to line there own already fat pockets .
F	i will happily go back to purchasing everything cash from the likes of eb * y , am ** on and pl **. com where at_least you don ' t have to put up with utter nonsense !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !
F	only company i could find to return six sets of venetian blinds weighing in at 00 . 0kg .
F	parcel picked_up monday received by recipients on wednesday .
F	online tracking very useful .
F	would recommend :-)
F	received quickly and well_packaged .
F	great price even_though your vet rips you off in prescription charges to actually order online .. recommend :-)
F	product arrived within the delivery time stated .
F	product was great no_problems .
F	emails and communication over shipping was great as shipped to south korea .
F	i would use again and recommend .
F	i provided my details to mazumba mobile online on a sunday .
F	i received the postage bag on the tuesday .
F	posted the mobile wednesday_afternoon and the money was in my account by the thursday - excellent service .
F	cannot_fault at all !
F	hey there !!
F	!....
F	the overall experience was awesome , fast response & so efficient !!!.
F	i first heard of mazuma_mobile services on a tv ad that i had watched , i thought to myself " why don ' t i give it a go " since i have a few non - working mobile_phones laying around , why not trade it in for quick cash .
F	so i did .
F	i have never seen or heard of a fast response service that keeps to its word .
F	i ' ve even got my friends talking_about it .
F	awesome stuff , quality reassurance , customer friendly .
F	i already knew the shoes i wanted so didn ' t really need to phone up for advice but i phoned the office when there was an issue at the checkout ( it was trying to charge for delivery when it should have been free ).
F	my call was answered straight_away by a very friendly man who advised me to proceed with the order an if the delivery was added he would refund it straight_away .
F	i placed my order at 0000pm on the thursday ( no deliver charge was added in the end ) and received my shoes on the saturday_morning .
F	friendly staff who actually answer the phone , speedy free delivery - on orders over £_00 , the shoes i wanted in stock and much cheaper_than anywhere_else , what more could you ask for ?
F	!
F	very uncomplicated website to use .
F	it was simple to select when and where i wanted the cover for .
F	it loads the groups of sports in a separate box but not in a new page which is good .
F	automatically shows the comparison between the different levels of cover on the same page without having to select an option for that which is great to just skim through what my needs are and if its worth paying extra for it .
F	great prices overall and generally cheaper_than i have found elsewhere with more included .
F	fast and easy transaction and would highly_recommend everyone to use this service .
F	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren ' t great or true to the place in my experience !
F	great quick service .
F	well_packaged and instructions i left about delivery were followed ( not many companies do ) website quick and easy to purchase items .
F	best price for the gill suit i have seen anywhere and its perfect .
F	thanks again , was a pleasure buying from you .
F	will highly_recommend to my sailing friends
F	if you expect them to respond to you with any level of politeness you will be sorely disappointed .
F	not only have they ignored emails but they have failed to follow through on any of the actions that they stated they would take .
F	they have also taken to ignoring our pleas to sort out our flight details it takes them an average of a week to respond to each email and each email is usually followed up at 00 hour intervals .
F	the free home_trial was great - when i ' ve bought glasses before , i ' ve been in the opticians for at_least an_hour trying to decide which ones to get ( i ' m v .
F	indecisive !)
F	so the home_trial gave me time to try them on in my own home .
F	the whole_process was very quick - i put through my home_trial request on sunday , frames arrived on tues , ordered my glasses with prescription on tuesday_evening and they were delivered on the friday .
F	good quality glasses and a good price too compared to specsavers
F	this is the 0nd time i ' ve used mazuma and the service was very quick and easy both_times .
F	i would definitely use mazuma again
F	great service , good price and quality product , would definitely_recommend :-)
F	avoid this company at all costs .
F	purchased a new contract over the phone on 00th_october .
F	received phone the next_day on the completely incorrect contract costing £ 0 more per_month !
F	not what i ordered and not discussed on the phone at all , this was a unauthorised sale .
F	called twice on 000 number trying to return phone , left holding for over 00_mins each time costing me money .
F	had to request return details twice before they were emailed to me and have never come_across such bad don ' t care type attitude from staff .
F	don ' t be tempted by their cheap deals they don ' t exist and are lies !
F	as a first timer at amigo i found the staff very helpful and the form easy to use i would recomed them to anyone .
F	all perfect and bla_bla_bla ...
F	but , i found a mistake on the website that could cost the shop pretty a loottt of money .
F	i managed to place an order worth 0 , 0k pounds for 00 gbp .
F	according to law , i didnt have to cancel my order , i could claim the shop to send it to me .
F	but i did cancel , asking only for a little discount on the next purchase i was planning to make .
F	for whet ?
F	for the help i provided , showing how stupid the system is and how much mony they could lose if more people did the same and decide not to be so polite .
F	this is what dissappointed me reallllyy badly when shopping in this shop .
F	never book with odopo !!
F	they canceled my flights the day after i booked them and didnt even inform me .
F	they are now saying i am only entitled to a tax refind of 00 pounds which will cost 00 pounds to apply for .
F	they are a scam !!!
F	!
F	we had an order cancelled at 0 . 00 on sunday_night 00 / 00 / 00 so no other supermarkets were open so we had no shopping for the week .
F	i put_together a letter and email it to them and i have still not had a reply from tesco letter below
F	dear_sir or madam ,
F	i am extremely annoyed about the way tesco has let us down .
F	when you read what happened i am sure you will be just as horrified .
F	i was going to write a letter of complaint to your chairman and send it by recorded_delivery .
F	after_speaking to my daughter i decided to email you first and give you the chance to restore my faith in tesco ’_s before taking the matter_further .
F	my daughter always orders the weekly_shop on line and we normally have it delivered between_0am and 0am on a saturday .
F	this week my wife and i were away until sunday_afternoon so the shopping was ordered for between 0pm and 0pm on sunday .
F	when there was still no sign of our shopping after 0pm on sunday my wife rang your helpdesk and spoke to darren a customer_services manager .
F	instead of making matters better they were made much worse .
F	my wife was told the order had been cancelled she asked why and by who but darren did not know .
F	she was horrified .
F	she was put on hold .
F	darren came back and said the delivery vehicle had broken down .
F	my wife asked the obvious question why no one had bothered informing us .
F	the reply was i don ’ t know .
F	my wife passed the phone to me i asked darren why you could not have used another vehicle .
F	at that time on a sunday_night there must have been several vehicles parked up .
F	darren cut me off and said i am telling you about the store .
F	thinking i had got it wrong i said so the problem was with the store not the vehicle .
F	darren said the problem was caused by a vehicle breakdown .
F	i replied the question is still valid why you hadn ’ t used another vehicle .
F	darren replied it was not just a vehicle you needed but also a driver .
F	i pointed_out the obvious that you had a driver for the broken down vehicle .
F	that driver could have driven one of the other vehicles .
F	it became obvious that darren was not helping the matter .
F	darren then said the delivery could be rearranged .
F	i pointed_out we urgently needed milk and also bread and meat for three lots of sandwiches for the following_morning .
F	i passed the phone back to my wife because she knew if and when she wanted the order to be delivered , darren then became very off hand and said .
F	i want to talk to one person not two .
F	well pardon me we are the ones that have been left without food on a sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
F	it must have been much worse to have to speak to two people .
F	customers need to be able to rely_on you .
F	i know the vehicle breakdown could not be helped , but you could have handled it so much_better .
F	to just cancel the delivery without informing us i am sure you will agree it is totally_unacceptable .
F	as i tried to point out to darren i am sure all your vehicles were not in use at 0pm on sunday .
F	customer_services are supposed to at_least try to make things better darren made it much worse .
F	as you know it is not what someone says but how they say it .
F	my daughter has received an_email from you .
F	no explanation of what went wrong or assuring us you will do your best to deliver our order if it ever happens again .
F	not even a promise that in future you will bother to inform us if there is a problem .
F	your email did contain a voucher for £ 0 off our next shop .
F	we had used a £ 0 voucher off the order that you failed to deliver that is now lost .
F	we also prepay the delivery charge .
F	during the recent bad_weather you cancelled our order .
F	we understood why even_though we managed to drive to the store in wrexham .
F	it did not alter the fact that we lost out on the prepaid delivery twice .
F	not a very good deal .
F	can you imagine our horror finding out after 0pm on a sunday_night that your entire food order had been cancelled ?
F	any other day of the week ok but sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
F	what were we supposed to do ?
F	as i am sure you know a company ’_s reputation is hard won and very easily lost .
F	people need to trust you to deliver what they order and deliver it on time .
F	if they can ’ t trust you they will go elsewhere .
F	i am hoping you can restore my faith in tesco ’_s , supply a valid explanation of what happened and reassure me that if i continue to shop with you i will never be treated so badly again .
F	if not i will be sending a copy of this email with a letter by recorded_delivery to your chairman .
F	on the 0th_april “ you and yours ” on bbc radio 0 broadcast a feature about why tesco price_match is misleading .
F	i am sure they will do a follow_up .
F	if the follow_up feature mentions that customers also cannot trust you to deliver their order it will make customers think_twice about using your company .
F	it ’_s up to you now you have the opportunity to put all of this right .
F	i look_forward to hearing from you .
F	regards
F	ken smith
F	a very angry ( and very probably ) ex customer
F	supplement_warehouse sells double the amount of d0 thermal shock for nearly the same price as gnc .
F	and lets just face it , its much_easier to shop online without a sales representative pushing you to buy something more_expensive .
F	used ao . com twice .
F	first time was for a freezer and the second was a fridge .
F	excellent experience on both_occasions .
F	wouldn ' t go anywhere_else now .
F	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
F	specified for delivery on mother ' s day , as they offered .
F	flowers were delivered saturday , however nobody was around to recieve them , as obv we were expecting them on sunday !
F	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
F	i contacted customer_service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
F	the reply was rude , & with numerous grammatical errors .
F	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave me when i received flowers from them ).
F	i suggest they dont give customers voucher_codes if they dont want to accept them !
F	i would never use them again , too expensive for the few flowers you get , and very poor delivery service !!
F	!
F	just bought new washing_machine and fridge_freezer from this lovely family run business , staff delivered and installed for me , great service .
F	i love to book in hostelbookers since i don ' t pay booking_fees and the site is friendly .
F	you can manage easily to find the right place for you .
F	ratings are accurate and prices the most competitive i ' ve found .
F	if you are about to book a hostel , do not doubt about it .
F	i can tell you even cancelling is easy to do .
F	i have used parcel to go a number of times and can say that the chat_function is great .
F	have had a great service today from sammie_taylor
F	they say that there are seats available at a specific price , but then try to charge you three times as much .
F	never book with them !
F	complete mess , courier couldn ' t be bothered to deliver my parcel .
F	neither courier or parcel0go wanted to listen to my complaint .
F	kept getting passed between the two .
F	avoid
F	since the end of august ( it is nearing october ) our internet has stopped_working .
F	this was firstly due to a faulty router and now the exchange where i live has been down .
F	i received a message last_night to say it had been fixed , but lo - and - behold it is still not working .
F	i spoke to the customer_service team who , after some convincing , told me i wouldn ' t be charged for the engineer for problem number one .
F	upon_checking my bank_account yesterday when the money was due to come out , they took the full balance including the normal payment for the internet service we haven ' t received for one month .
F	i am_appalled at the audacity they have to say one thing and do another .
F	they have let me pay for a service they have not been providing and i was assured that the money wouldn ' t come out of my account , so i didn ' t cancel the direct_debit .
F	even if i did cancel it i would get blacklisted , and so you see they have caught me in a catch 00 .
F	please let me leave talk_talk and give me my money back .
F	do not go near .
F	the website was aesthetically pleasing and easy to use , all products are well described ; what you see is what you get .
F	i made a purchase in no time and selected special delivery which indeed came the next working day as promised .
F	the items ordered are of great quality ( with the exception of one item which is the provider ' s problem , not honour ' s fault )
F	definitely would recommend !
F	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout ..
F	there is absolutely nothing wrong with my broadband speed and have used " just_eat " before which i never had this problem with .
F	sort it out hungryhouse !
F	i ' m going to a few european countries in the next few_months and knew straight_away that my best chances were to use hostelbookers . com .
F	i ' ve booked all my accommodation with them , i can search fast and it ' s easy to compare hostels and best of all not hidden_fees !
F	amazon is one of my favorite online_retailers , constantly good service , fast delivery even when i ' ve chosen the free post and packaging , items are always well boxed and wrapped .
F	this is the third time i ' ve orderd online from them and it just isn ' t worth the wait !
F	first order was over two_weeks , second order was three_weeks and third order was dispatched on the 0th_jan and still_hasn ' t arrived :-(
F	really great service and products , so easy to get the photo_book you want as you can choose the layout .
F	my hard back small square photo_book arrived today and just could not be_happier as it ' s the same quality as a book ( reading ), would definitely_recommend paying for glossy pages as it really is worth it .
F	will_definitely be ordering from here again .
F	i received a code for 00 free photos and had some images i had been meaning to print for a while so though i would give them a shot and was really surprised at the quality of the photos and also the handy photo size plastic case which is a great for protecting your photos during_transit .
F	fabulous selection of jewlery and watches and some really pretty pieces that would be fab for christmas .
F	so already starting christmas shopping and my 0yr old has been constantly stopping outside jewllers and showing me the watches so need to find a fun watch but that wasn ' t to childish as he really dislikes the ones for children round his age so had a look on tic watches and was pleased to find oclock watches which have an adult feel but are quite modern and now are doing disney which i know he will love , got the xsmall and is a perfect size for younger children , was delivered fast as living in jersey it can take a while for deliveries just super impressed with the service .
F	was really impressed withthe chooice of products avaliable and even more impressed by the fast and reliable delivery especially as live in the channel_islands and getting deliveries here can sometimes be slow .
F	was really impressed with the product and definately plan to order from here again .
F	absolutely love moon_bingo !
F	the chat_hosts make you feel at ease , you can have a giggle while you play and over all it is a fun experience , the bingo rooms are great with lots of ones to choose from 😊
F	great site would recommend to my friends and family fab hosts make you feel very welcome no faults what so ever keep up the good work guys mummytojacob00
F	absolutely_brilliant service !
F	so quick , the money was in my account before i even knew about it .
F	they also offered the best price for my handset .
F	will_definately be using again !
F	i ordered my small fish reefs on sunday_afternoon , it showed on system that they were in stock and as i was in desperate need of them i chose this company , it is now thursday and they are have still not even been dispatched , i know its not as bad as some problems you get with buying on line but i do spend a lot of time buying stuff on line and in my experience , some shop that have items in stock have a 0 - 0 day dispatch time .
F	i have emailed the company and they did reply with in couple of hours to say that item will be getting dispatch end of this week so will be with me 0 - 0 working_days after this .. so tuesday 0 days after i ordered it .
F	very friendly and efficient customer_service .
F	all my queries have been responded swiftly .
F	thank_you very much , emma !
F	third order from eframe , always pleased with the service .
F	thank_you !
F	i ' ve bought my contacts from lenstore for the last 0 years .
F	they are great value ( i shopped_around for ages before i found lenstore ), ship quickly and when i had a delivery lost in the post ( only once !)
F	they sent another by special delivery which arrived the next_day .
F	really reliable , swift and no faffing with prescriptions etc once you ' re all set - up .
F	great customer_service too .
F	would definitely_recommend them very helpful
F	i was looking around to trade in my phone and found a site that offered me £_000 i looked up reviews on the site and so many people complained about them saying they never recieved the full_amount , so i decided to trade in with mazuma for £_000 instead and i ' m_glad i did i applied online recieved the pack a couple of days_later sent out my phone and within about 0days of applying on the site i had £_000 in my bank_account !!
F	more_than impressed !!
F	my advice would be if your looking around for the best trade - in price for what may seem maybe £_00 more you ' ll get a much_better deal and service with mazuma !
F	i ordered my washing_machine on 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	it was due to be delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 , i received a phone call on 00 / 0 confirming delivery between_0am - 0pm .
F	at 0000 i called bestbuy as i still hadn ' t received my washing_machine , they stated that my order had been cancelled and didn ' t know why .
F	i was promised a call back the following_morning .
F	the next_day i called them at 0000 having not heard_anything .
F	danny the cust service rep stated he needed to place a new order and it would be delivered on thursday between_0am - 0pm , i did this as i thought it was a 0 off .
F	no such luck , thursday came and my order was cancelled again , eventually at 0pm i was called back by a manager and she informed me that they had experienced problems with their stock control .
F	never again will i shop with best buy .
F	i cancelled all orders and shopped elsewhere .
F	i ordered on thursday and my washing_machine was delivered on saturday between 00am and 0pm as i was told it would be .
F	excellent service from start to finish really pleased .
F	we were fixed on an aperol spritz as the only drink for the summer .
F	drink shop obliged , couriered the surprise , and our party was rather excellent actually .
F	thanks !
F	:)
F	i booked a motel in cape cod , ma for one night through expedia .
F	when i reached the place there was no one at the front_desk and i found out that the motel had been shut for months because it did not have a license to run !
F	also , it was dirty and disgusting to look at , not worth more_than $_00 per_night and i had paid $_000 to expedia fo rthis shit hole !
F	it was a busy weekend and i spent the next 0 hrs looking for a place to stay .
F	so i went to the cape for an overnigth trip and the night got ruined because by the time i found a place , everything had closed ... not even dinner !
F	so basically expedia does not have any stock of the places they offer to people and they charge crazy prices for shitty places .
F	order arrived very quickly 0 days after ordering .
F	would recommend to others .
F	started going to concerts with songkick again
F	i have bough insurance via this site and then received a call to clarify details .
F	it turns_out that i chose wrong option that i store my bike on a secure car_park instead of a garage , which i had to choose as i didn ' t have any other options on the site .
F	they were unable to change it with current usurer and claimed that i can either pay extra £_000 to get insurance from another company or cancel it with fee 00_% cancellation_fee .
F	how on earth insurer can ' t offer broker option to amend such a trival detail , incredible nonsense !
F	new anon ' s goggles cost me £_00 less_than on official burton ' s site
F	are a secure and fast shop veey recocomended !
F	i have ordered twice with deramores and both_times have been flawless shopping experiences .
F	the yarns are fantastic quality at great prices and there are always bargains to be had and great offers to take_advantage of .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone and everyone who knits or crochets and i can ' t wait to do more shopping .
F	in fact i ' m hoping santa knows about the site too !
F	!
F	been customer now for up to 0yrs .
F	n order was reported to be dispatched my account was debited immediately yet for 0wks + no items came through despite my chasing up costomer service for status_updates which were rather sketchy in the end with no cogent explanation and after 0wks or more i had to ask for my refund because they insisted the goods were still on their way ?!
F	i was really let_down to say the least .
F	when i booked my 0 tyres for £_00 which came to £_00 in the end , i was very happy , but a couple of days_later i noticed on my bank_balance that national had double_charged me .
F	i called them up immediately and demanded a refund .
F	they agreed and said it was a mistake .
F	i waited 0 days for it to go through to my bank but it hadn ' t at all .
F	so i called up again and angrily requested a refund again , wondering_why they hadn ' t done it already , aparently ' the refund hadn ' t been requested ' but i finally reached an agreement and they agreed to put the refund through again .
F	by the next thursday , two_weeks after they double_charged me , the money was in my bank .
F	i am a student , and having that amount of money withdrawn from my account was painful for the two_weeks .
F	i expected more from national as the service at the shop was great and the ease of access on the website was very good .
F	i will not be using national again .
F	i got my first pair of glasses in primary school and eventually moved on to contacts when i was in my 00 ' s .
F	my eyes were constantly dry and irritated due to working in dusty environments so i contacted optical_express , went for a consultation and was recommended to have the intralase lasik .
F	it was the most expensive surgery but completely suited to my lifestyle and work .
F	i was pretty nervous when i went for the surgery but the staff were great at reassuring me and answered all of my questions so i soon relaxed .
F	they spoke to me throughout the procedure making_sure i knew what was going to happen next and checking i was okay .
F	the surgery was completely pain free and very quick .
F	the after care was great , giving clear and concise instructions on the different eye_drops to use , the goggles and also advice on what to do if i started to feel discomfort beyond normal levels .
F	the easy 0 year payment plan was also great and affordable @ £_00 a month , not causing any shortages elsewhere .
F	i ' ve recommended friends and family , great experience .
F	nothing can compare to the morning after when i could see without glasses or contacts ... amazing !
F	i placed my order just before 0pm and it was dispatched immediately .
F	very informative website and dedicated to their customers .
F	not the first purchase i ' ve made from them but very impressed their standards haven ' t slipped .
F	recommend this company to everyone
F	i have been an o0 customer for 0 years & never had a problem until now .
F	i paid my bill on the 0th of april & they then tried to take it again on the 0th of april , the money was not in my bank so i was left with a £_00 bank charge (£ 00 for unarranged overdraft & £_00 for being over drawn ) i asked o0 to refund me the £_00 as it was their mistake & they have refused !!
F	me & my 0 year_old_son went for four days with no money .
F	the customer_service i received by phone was very very poor , the service i received by chat was excellent .
F	however , i still_haven ' t be refunded the money .
F	only gave 0 star because it wouldn ' t let me rate 0_stars .
F	i ' ve used serenata a few_times and have always been impressed with the punctual nature of the service though of late i ' ve taken time to read the emails and had to chuckle to myself .
F	i would gladly use them again and i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend them to other people .
F	a top_class service with a dash of humour thrown in .
F	dropped my samsung off for a new screen on my way to work , on my way home , collected it , and it looked like a whole new phone !
F	very good service , answered any_questions i had regarding the repair , and was the cheapest place i could find .
F	will be returning with my ipad soon !
F	their prices are low and very competitive , the delivery was free and very quick , products were fantastic .
F	would recommend without_hesitation ! i ' m now a regular customer !
F	i have not had any_issues at all and was very impressed with how quickly i received my products .
F	would definitely use again .
F	within a week of placing my order i received my glasses , perfect !
F	the option for a free home_trial is amazing , i used this many_times before finally placing an order !
F	and it was cheap compared to the high_street opticians .
F	would definitely_recommend to everyone !
F	fantastic service , only problem for me having astigmatism , i sometimes have to wait a bit longer for my prescription .
F	but fantastic delivery times and would definitely buy from again and again !
F	i love shopping here and return over and over again because they stock all my favourite_brands , the prices are very reasonable with some great deals and discounts always available , delivery is fast and free , and they provide a very reliable service ( plus excellent customer_service for when things do occasionally go_wrong ).
F	i cannot_fault lookfantastic - once again , perfect .
F	thank_you :)
F	we regularly purchase items for our dog from medicanimal , including the royal_canin gastrointestinal low fat food that she has been on since being diagnosed with pancreatitis .
F	items are as_described , competitive_prices , reliable service and speedy_delivery .
F	once again - excellent .
F	we will_continue to shop here .
F	we regularly purchase prescription medication for our dog from animed_direct .
F	item as_described , competitive price , reliable service and speedy_delivery .
F	once again - excellent .
F	we will_continue to shop here .
F	was a little_dubious at first but thought i would give it a go , anyway paid through pay_pal (£ 00 for 00 months ) scanned code was sent entered and was back in black_ops in 0 mins , without getting stung by microsoft for £_00 .
F	i ' ve used discount supplements a few_times now and each time my order has been delivered next_day on the dot .. compared to a few others ( even some that are local ' ish to me ) ive always had my order on time ...
F	i wouldnt use anyone_else now , unless someone opened a local shop that sold the same products at the same cost .. and i cannot see that happening ...
F	i ' ve used shopto . net for quite a while now and i ' m a gold member , they used to be excellent , but it seems that recent changes have them neglect their old values of customer care when an issue arises .
F	their recently added shoptonews section seems to be a copy and paste of other gaming sites news and the reviews are mediocre to say the least .
F	their blog used to be more reliable
F	super price , very fast delivery will be using again !
F	my customer experience with gearforgirls was fantastic - the website is well set_up and easy to use and the product arrived very promptly .
F	unfortunately the product wasn ' t suitable so i had to return it .
F	the returns process was very efficient and i was kept up to date with the progress .
F	excellent service girls ten out of ten !
F	!
F	called cleanmycarpets on boxing_day after a party spillage .
F	great service , and very reasonable pricing . highly_recommended .
F	nice product , quick delivery , and cheap price .
F	nothing else to say !
F	a good selection of hostels , great prices , a fast booking system and instant confirmation .
F	what more could you want ??
F	?
F	uk piano information & resources as made it far easier for me to choose the correct piano for my family .
F	thank_you
F	mike ' s have always been helpful whenever i have used them .
F	they deliver promptly and if you have any_issues , they are happy to help
F	i was given some excellent advice on which blu_ray_player to buy and it was then sent out to me promptly and payment online was straightforward .
F	i would use weybridge audio again .
F	i am honestly so happy i found a cheap place to buy supplements .
F	i have seen other_places that may be a couple dollars cheaper , but in the end they really are not because the cost of shipping is way too high .
F	the customer_service is also awesome !
F	ordered 0 signs , was contacted and recommended some changes that would benefit the overall outlook of the product , very nice lady made changes for me and checked i approved , then prompt delivery .
F	what more you say :-)
F	super , will_definitely use again
F	my lounge looks awesome in brilliant vibrant colours - always a pleasure with our green room .
F	will_definately_reccommend - and be back myself !
F	thanks loads guys ,
F	d and p
F	i have used this online company everytime i book accommodation .
F	recently travelled around_europe and only booked a day before i decided where we were going and they always had the best price and hassel free .
F	they have a great range of locations ( only had to go to local sources when you get a little off the beaten track ).
F	i ordered as a thank_you gift , the price for the amount of flowers was very reasonable and the bouquet beautiful .
F	from order placement to delivery the communication was excellent and highly personalised to my order .
F	all was delivered without a hitch and both myself and the recipient are delighted .
F	many_thanks .
F	booked a ski holiday to france with lastminute .
F	it says transfers are 0 hours but i didn ' t realise that transfers are not incuded .
F	not only that but there are no transfers to the resort from any company whatsover .
F	the only way to get there is a taxi costing £_000 ( more_than the holiday ).
F	i don ' t mind that transfers are an extra but selling a holiday that is not actually even possible to go on seems not on at all .
F	also , after phoning them they said they would ring back to find me transfers but didn ' t and i had to ring them again a week_later .
F	i now have to book a seperate flight as this is cheaper_than ammending my flight .
F	avoid !
F	!
F	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
F	i love doing my shopping online , as i hate queues and pushing etc you get in supermarkets .
F	the items are well_priced , delivery drivers always happy and i once had a problem with bad veg sent in my shop and they refunded me no problem :) thanks asda
F	i think their items need a warning that peanuts are used alot in some of their other products !
F	and since theyve told me its all produced in a small open factory i can understand_why my 0 year_old was scratching at his swelling face in the bath .
F	poor show lush
F	my 0 year olds allergic to peanuts , after checking the packaging we brought him some shower jelly from here .
F	as soon as he used it he reacted ive contacted them , i dont want anything from them just for them to put a warning in their shop or on the packaging that they use alot of peanuts in their other items but they arent interested unless they get other people complain of it ??
F	its life threatening so i dont take this attitude very well im affraid
F	the websites easy to use , has tonnes of present ideas , look out for there free delivery codes or money off codes they do regularly .
F	products arrive well_packaged and dont take long to arrive
F	never been disapointed with play , my items arrive fast and the prices are cheaper most of the time as i shop around alot to get the best deal
F	i use ebay alot and over 0 years have only had one problem .
F	i think its a ggreat idea and well_laid_out .
F	the staff are great in my local_store so friendly and always willing to help .
F	ours is a small store but its crammed with everything you need
F	update on my account , after the tonnes of interest i had , it got to the point it was getting ridiculous i couldnt pay it back £ 0000 in fact so i got a loan out at 00_% which is loads better_than very .
F	i paid them in full yesterday , still snotty woman over the phone ' why couldnt you pay this before ?'
F	my reply simply ' didnt have the money '!!
F	did she think i wanted to just bump up all there ridiculous charges or something ??
F	anyway i said i wanted to close my account she tried 0 times to get me to buy something i said no you must be joking , so she said call back tommorrow to close .
F	so today i call and im on hold ages , again get told i could buy something else , and this time i told her what a sham of a company it is now its very and sugested she googled the reviews .... then got told i cant close my account til monday !!
F	does anyone know if they can do this ?
F	have reccomended mazuma to friends and family already .
F	the website is really easy to use , everything you need to do to send the phones arrives really fast .
F	they email you to let you know all was well and they also let you know when they post your cheque .
F	cant_fault this company , we will use them again .
F	totally like my shopping_experience with shoetique
F	some updates ...
F	after the terrible experience yesterday , i contacted dx and they arranged another delivery for me today .
F	also , i sent the complain group an_email described what happened on the day .
F	well , nobody replied .
F	but till 0 :_00pm today , nothing arrived .
F	i called the helpline , the automatic system still told me my passport would be delivered today .
F	i finally got it transformed to human service .
F	a staff firstly told me i would receive my passport late this evening ... and then i asked him where is my passport now .
F	he took quite a while to trace my passport and told me a following shocking new : my passport is still in the hand of the same delivery guy , but he refuses to deliver to my place .
F	because he reported i attacked him yesterday !
F	also , he claimed i am not the owner of my passport or the female who answered the door !
F	nobody can imagine how shocked i was .
F	i attacked him ?
F	how ?!!
F	i am a tiny little woman less 000cm attacking a over 000cm guy ?
F	why ?
F	i am not the owner of the passport ?
F	how can he tell ?
F	i do not even feel angry , it sounds more like a joke !
F	the most ridiculous thing is dx sounds_like believes this liar staff .
F	they told me because the guy did not want to deliver my passport so that i must go to their depot centre to collect it myself !
F	how funny !
F	first of all , i remember i paid for the delivery and it is not cheap !
F	second , if i am not going to receive my passport today , why didn ' t dx arrange the delivery today and the information is still on their system ?!
F	third , when will they inform me the situation of my passport if i did not call for details ?
F	i really cannot stand such a irresponsible treatment and bear such a lie !
F	i do not mind taking any legal_action to protect my right as a custom !
F	my whole day was totally ruined by the unprofessional and rude service provided by dx !
F	most_importantly , i have to rearrange my delivery for another day , which means i have to take another day off !
F	i do not even understand_why the us embassy chooses such a terrible courier .
F	i do not even want my us visa if the dx is in charge of delivery .
F	the driver was terribly rude and impatient and showed no manner .
F	he refused to give me my passport because i keep him waiting for 0mins !
F	i did apologise for not bringing my id proof at the first time and tried to bring it asap .
F	for 0 mins , he just could not wait .
F	but he spent 0mins to criticize me wasting his time !
F	the reason he finally refused to give me my passport was he did not trust my id proof , which is my uk residence permit .
F	but interesting , he did not even check it or asked for another proof he trust !!
F	also , he actually already handed me the signature machine to sign !
F	i have signed it twice !
F	i found hifi_headphones to be an excellent service with good communication_throughout the whole_process .
F	dispatch of the item was very quick and i am very pleased with my new head phones .
F	would definitely use again and would recommend to friends and family .
F	thanks once again .
F	deborah
F	brilliant service and delivery from this company
F	a friend_recommended mydriver to me and i have used them several_times , to and from the airport and eurostar .
F	they have always been on time , been incredibly polite helping me with my bags and got me where i was going in a decent time .
F	they are also cheaper_than other alternatives such as g0 and taxis which is an added_bonus !
F	i ordered the flowers the night before for my nan and they arrived as promised the next_day .
F	she was so pleased with them for her_birthday and said that they were really unusual and beautiful !
F	i ordered aztec sun flowers .
F	thank_you so much !
F	did an online course on sage , was very easy to use with clear_instructions .
F	would definitely_recommend it to those who are looking to have a good knowledge of sage or to boost your cv as you will learn many things .
F	i trust top cash back and is 000_% the best cash back site .
F	the interface is as easy as pie , even my mum uses it now .
F	plus if there isn ' t any cash back for a website , there is usually a discount_code available that is displayed on the same page .
F	waited in all day , once again , and has not turned_up .
F	according to the tracking they have , once again , managed to not ' gain_access to the property '.
F	there is a blue picket fence separating the road and my front_door .
F	as well as the fact that the first day that they tried , even_though they wernt meant to come , they managed to over - come that trouble some 0ft front gate and post a delivery card through the letter_box .
F	maybe they got too scared to go back through the gate on the way out and are still lurking around my front garden somewhere .....
F	what can i say 000_% happy :-) the week before_christmas i found incrystals , thinking oh i have left it a bit late , it prob wont get here on time , but i was sooo wrong i ordered 0 different products all with different pictures on the monday and they arrieved by thursday and i wasnt disappointed , i am made up with them and cant_wait to see my loved_ones faces when they open them on christmas day .
F	fantastic prices , i wouldnt_hesitate in making a order with them again and to tell everyone about this company , one very happy customer will be dealing_with incrystals again in the future :-)
F	really prompt response , cheque was with me in no time .
F	my new favourite website .
F	thank_you .
F	booked 0 tickets to see wet wet wet at the 00 in december booked them in october i was quite sceptical from reading some of the reviews but i had nothing to worry_about .
F	i spoke to the customer_services as i had booked the tickets for a birthday_present i wanted a confirmation letter so i could wrap it up they sent me a lovely letter with a picture of the band which was a lovely service .
F	i received a text_message to say my tickets had been dispatched and were being sent recorded_delivery .
F	i recived the tickets the next_day .
F	we had really good seats exactly were i had booked brilliant seats amazing night i will_defiantly use double 0 tickets again and will encourage friends and family to use the also xxxx
F	well i ordered some flowers for my fellow business owner ' s studio launch as a " good luck " not a problem for saturday delivery .
F	however , 0 :_00pm i recieved a telephone call to state that they were unable to deliver the flowers , and they could try again for monday .
F	unfortunately her launch party was today ( saturday ) and not monday .
F	disappointment is an_understatement , i am so unbelievely upset that something nice i was trying to do for someone is completely thrown back into my face - they can offer me a refund , which is fine , but it doesnt rectify the situation .
F	or the poor service .
F	if they had called me earlier this morning , then i may have been able to find someone_else to deliver them .
F	i will never order via these_guys again .
F	booking through prestigia was fine at first but after ringing the hotel to confirm booking realized the amount i would be paying was an extra 00_% each night for government taxes which is not advertised in the original price , or on the confirmation_email witch already states vat has been paid .
F	why not include all the rates been charged instead of been misleading in your adverts .
F	i have enjoyed using hostelbookers for many years now for my international travels .
F	even when i find the same places available through other travel sites , i prefer to come back to hostelbookers based on all my good experiences in the past .
F	keep up the good work !
F	i love beauty_bay , it is my ' go to ' site for my beauty needs , whether for skincare or makeup .
F	the plus point for me , is that i can get either the luxury products i require or the basics .
F	they also offer an efficient delivery service .
F	i needed to transfer a lot of old photo negatives to positives onto my laptop and then print them .
F	the one i bought from hi fi tower worked_fine and was very easy to use .
F	i am extemely satisfied with the ability to save previous orders to " re - order ".
F	it takes the hassle out of shopping when you already know what you want .
F	i was a little leary when i started receiving packages of loose energy shots vs . the sealed 00pks i was getting .
F	however , there were always an exact number of products ordered .... and always of satisfactory quality as well .
F	i continue to order from supllementwarehouse . com b / c of convenience and quality ..... good buy for the buck ... and consistently !
F	i have been a quidco member for about 0 years and i have earned a substantial_amount of cashback !
F	i use it for changing my energy supplier and home insurance renewal to buying my groceries and christmas_presents !
F	it is so easy to use and customer_service is fantastic as they keep me up to take with my tracked cashback and let me know they are working on it if it is taking too long to be paid !
F	i recommend to everybody !
F	!
F	i ordered a pair of tyres online .
F	the delivery was fast , and they updated me automatically on the state of my order ,
F	all in all a great service !
F	the guy i spoke to ( bob i believe ) was really friendly and gave me lots of examples of when i could or couldn ' t make a claim .
F	i decided to place an order through takeaway . com after seeing the £ 0 off deal , i wish i ' d never bothered !
F	firstly , the £ 0 code didn ' t work .
F	secondly after i ' d placed my order i got a call from the restaurant saying he ' d been informed not to prepare the order as my payment hadn ' t been verified ...
F	i checked my bank , the money had gone .
F	he said he ' d call me back in 0 minutes after checking with takeaway . com , he said they were refunding my payment so could i pay over the phone .
F	desperate to just get the food i paid for the order ... again ... with the promise one of my payments would be refunded .
F	i then complained on the takeaway . com website and got 0 calls within 00_minutes from 0 different people who said they would ' check out my story and consider the refund !!'
F	i pointed_out it was not up for negotiation and also they should give me the extra £ 0 back since that wasn ' t working either !
F	he flat out refused to give me the £ 0 off and blamed a ' technical_error '.
F	the restaurant were not to blame in this and the food was lovely but takeaway . com need a proper sorting_out !
F	their technical problems aren ' t my fault and the fact it ' s going to take 0 - 00 days to refund my money deserves some sort of compensation .
F	none was offered .
F	i shan ' t be using this service again .
F	i have used technogroom several_times and always had a fast and efficient service .
F	i has a slight problem with a blade i purchased but they replaced it without question and gave me advice , and it turned_out it was my clippers reaction the blade that was the problem , not the blade itself .
F	all the staff i have spoken to have been very helpful and friendly .
F	i would use technogroom as a first choice everytime .
F	impressed with the substantial discounts available and as a dog groomer i regularly buy from the site .
F	have highly_recommended it to everyone !
F	ordered both wickerman and dnd toilet tickets for wickerman from skiddle .
F	the staff were great and informative .
F	it was so quick got my tickets right away so i didnt have to worry_about no one being home to sign for a recorded_delivery envelope !
F	look_forward to using them in the future !
F	:_o )
F	super easy service to use .
F	confirmation came through quickly .
F	description and ratings of hostel were accurate !!
F	!
F	would definitely_recommend and definitely use again !
F	:)
F	i bought the costumes for world book day for me and some colleagues .
F	the range and price of the costumes are all very good as well as the quality of the costumes .
F	would not hesitate to use mega_fancy_dress for future occasions , thank_you !
F	this is one of my favorite website !
F	awesome products !
F	no problem .
F	good price , good package and very fast !
F	i will order again , for sure !
F	do not use locauto at milan malpensa unless you find waiting in 0 queues for over 0 hours acceptable to pick_up your car .
F	then don ' t bother complaining to rentalcars . com when you get back as they will basically call you a liar and just offer you a discount on your next car_hire .
F	erh , i don ' t think i ' ll be bothering thanks .
F	endless problems with talk_talk over the last 0 months , had over 0 engineers to house and every one has been incapable of solving the problem of minimal speeds ( 0 . 0mb !)
F	and unstable connection which constantly cuts out .
F	when first sold talk_talk over phone mid september they said we would have internet 00hrs after receiving router .
F	a few_days_later engineer came to activate line but no router , then received later saying wed have to wait a further 00 days !!
F	then a further 00_hrs etc etc and we did not have working internet until end of october !
F	but few_days_later line went dead !!
F	so still not internet well into november .
F	this is only the beginning , since then numerous engineer visits , apparent faulty routers , new wiring , new sockets , list_goes on .
F	it is now the end of february and we still experience these problems .
F	icing on the cake - needed to speak to engineering team , technical_support said they could not put me through and asked me to phone back using the same options i had used before ( i told him this and he thought i was wrong ).
F	phoned back and got through to the same technical_support_team !
F	wasting another fifteen minutes after being put on hold etc .
F	useless - i could do better and i am a girl !
F	talk_talk are incompetant , barely understandable on phone once you get past the automated systems .
F	even the managers are useless .
F	they are absolute con merchants please stay_away !!!!
F	this isnt even half of the story .
F	be warned .
F	by distressed third year student - unable to do work half the time as internet barely works .
F	i had my laser surgery a year_ago and i was nervous_about it but the staff made me feel_comfortable and fully informed from the first appointment .
F	every_stage was explained to me before anything was done and the staff have always been very friendly .
F	i am so glad that i had it done as everything went_smoothly and my vision is great now .
F	i have not had any_problems and think that having the surgery improved my life as i am able to play with my daughter more easily and without fear that i would drop my glasses or that she would break them .
F	i have my friends and family about my experience and recommend optical_express to people considering laser surgery .
F	i ' ve not purchased an awful lot from yesstyle but when i have done , it ' s been pretty quick and i ' ve never had any_problems .
F	i think their member scheme is also really handy and is a good way to get people to purchase from them more .
F	i personally love the clothing they sell , even if i can only buy from certain brands ( due to sizing ), but the fact that they sell clothes from asian brands that are for plus size makes them even better .
F	it ' s hard to find the cute asian - style clothing in a size that fits me so when i see there are actual brands out there that have stuff that ' ll fit me , at a reasonable_price too , makes me very happy to buy from them .
F	never_heard of this company but cheap and swift delivery !
F	many_thanks .
F	i ' d like to add what an effecient service ive received - after spending weeks trying to find such a reputable and reliable service i am glad i picked yourselves .
F	no where on the internet has reviews on such services and i have recommended you , very fast and honest !
F	( well he would be if i ran the company !)
F	a huge thank_you to ben who has spent time and effort resolving a problem with the delivery of my parcels .
F	he was very professional , courteous and a credit to your customer_service team .
F	thanks ben !
F	wendy
F	easy to do online and payment recieved fast
F	got my pack the next_day after_placing my sell order .
F	i popped my two phones in the post ( i did through the post_office to get proof of posting ) and got the money transferred into my account on the next working day .
F	so simple and fast to use .
F	only thing is the post bag , postage is paid but the bag has no protection for the phones so i wrapped mine in a little left over bubble_wrap just to make_sure they did not get damaged on the way .
F	we have used ozmedia now for many years as a trusted supplier and printer .
F	we find that whilst the standards are high the service is second to none .
F	they always go out if there way to find a solution or help .
F	as a charitable organisation values are important to us and ozmedia ' s values complement ours in many ways .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them for print or design .
F	a part of me feels my input isn ' t even needed with all the bad_reviews but it ' s been such a hassle !
F	me and my partner moved_into a new flat .
F	i ' ve always been a british_gas customer and had no_problems with them ever .
F	so we switched to them , as the flat was already being supplied by scottish_power ( a company i ' d never even heard of anyway ).
F	contacted british_gas to switch , got that all sorted .
F	shortly_after got our " final_bill " from sp .
F	the bill started about 0 weeks before we ' d even signed the tenancy agreement and was for an amount that was about double what i ' d expect our usage to be .
F	tried to use the details on the bill to log in online , as my experience with bg taught me that ' s the easiest_way to sort things like this .
F	put in all the details correctly and then it just came up saying i couldn ' t access the account .
F	i ' m not a fan of phone_calls anyway ( and by the sound of all the other reviews it wouldn ' t have done anything !)
F	and it took me a bloody age to find an e_- mail address .
F	through the sp site , the only way i could find to message or e_- mail them was if i could log in to my account , which i couldn ' t .
F	took me a google_search of " scottish_power complaints contact e_- mail " to find anything .
F	finally sent an e_- mail out to them , got an_automated_response .
F	a few weeks passed and i started getting letters from a company called lcs , saying there was an investigation into my bill .
F	i thought " oh yay , this is sp sorting it out for me ", little did i know .
F	after sending lcs the details they ' d asked for , i waited .
F	next contact , again about a week or so later , i was called by them , saying i still needed to pay the bill .
F	i explained to the man on the phone everything i had already e_- mail to both sp and lcs .
F	he told me to e_- mail a scan of my tenancy agreement to the lcs address and that i would hear from them again within a few_days , hopefully with the amount to be paid corrected .
F	i got no such contact from lcs .
F	what i did get ( finally ) was an e_- mail from sp ' s margaret doyle , a lovely woman who told me she ' d been assigned to my case and that my bill amount had been corrected ( about halved in fact !).
F	she asked me to provide a number and a time that would be convenient for her to call me so i can give her my payment details and get the whole_thing sorted !
F	i gave her a lot of thanks as i ' ve had months of stressing over this and just wanting it sorted .
F	i will note i had to email her again to remind her to call me , but i can understand that people are busy , it ' s not always easy to remember things .
F	she was very friendly and polite ( apparently unlike all the customer_service drones ) and i made the payment .
F	the main pain about this whole_thing is it took from november 0th until december 00th to get sorted !
F	how can it take over a month for something to be resolved !
F	i mean if they want their money so badly that they ' ve gone to a debt_collectors to threaten me , then why won ' t they respond any faster ?
F	i will say i have received a final demand letter from lcs , but i only paid 0 days ago , and so they must have just not got the memo yet .
F	i would like to go on about the lcs company , who i have a lot more problems with , but of course that ' s not for this page .
F	let ' s just say i ' ll be relieved once this is resolved and i can finally get back to using a company that i have never had to take this kind of bs from .
F	very good service would use again .
F	0 out of 0 for service xxxx
F	we booked a hotel at heathrow ( sheraton skyline ) for the night before our flight and parking at the hotel while we were away .
F	the price we paid was very reasonable and the hotel was very nice .
F	the website was easy to use and there were lots of different deals available for us to choose from , with good explanations and photos of the hotel rooms .
F	our booking went through with no_problems .
F	i would definitely use holiday extras again .
F	all the resources the site has available were helpful in deciding the best option for my one night stay in the city of london .
F	i was looking for a fairly cheap , good quality , great location hostel that would allow me to enjoy my stay .
F	thanks !
F	i use hostelbookers frequently for booking accomodation when traveling .
F	their website is easy to use and navigate , their low_prices , useful reviews and maps are other reasons_why i book with hostelbookers .
F	plus they don ' t charge bookingfees .
F	excellent service !
F	i love this place !
F	i used to go to gnc for all my suppliments and end up spending rediculous amounts and walking out with a couple items .
F	then i found supplementwarehouse and i recieve several items for the price of one and the best part about it is it gets shipped straight to my door faster_than any other company .
F	they have great products for the cheepest prices .
F	all ive got to say is ; be smart and save_yourself some money .
F	:)
F	i found this service online after i smashed my screen and phone stopped_working entirely .
F	a technician came out the next_day and fixed the screen , and the on / off button at no extra charge .
F	incredibly efficient , friendly and really cheap !!
F	i ' ll definitely be using them again .
F	i am very happy with this web_site and support i am recieving .
F	everywhere in the world i can make a booking and in 0 minutes or even less .
F	it is very easy to use my phone for booking .
F	also i recieved their international call whenever i request something special .
F	really excellent web_site and this is from heart .
F	i ordered the package in october and it is now december , my package has still not arrived .
F	i contacted customer_service and they said they were confirming for a resend , the next_day they sent a partial_refund .
F	they said i would get a full_refund .
F	which has yet to appear in my bank_account .
F	terrible .
F	i have had a terrible time with ccl_computers so far and unfortunately its still ongoing since i placed my ( not insignificant ) order a month_ago .
F	firstly the delivery was a week late ( expected some delay after_reading reviews ) and it was an inconvenience but forgivable .
F	they didn ' t ring me to tell me it wasn ' t arriving on the stated date / time and i had to ring them up - after i had already taken a day off work .
F	i asked why it was late and ( the very nice ) noel told me that they were waiting on a part and i should have been notified .
F	a few_days_later i ring again but this time it is two different parts they are " waiting " for .
F	amazingly , they eventually " found " the parts and all is good .
F	my computer arrived and it was ok .
F	slower_than i expected given the spec , but it worked .
F	but now , two_weeks after the computer arrived it has randomly shut_down and it will not even begin to restart after showing a whea_uncorrectable_error .
F	the computer is being picked_up on monday for repair .
F	if i didn ' t need a decent home computer for work reasons i would get a refund and just buy another - but i cant_wait a month for them to re - credit my account .
F	i am very nervous_about the quality / duration of the repair and hope that everything goes according to plan .
F	they said it will take 0 working_days but who_knows ...
F	noel ( customer_services ) has been as helpful as ( i assume ) he could have been .
F	so although i don ' t have a problem with the customer_service i do feel that i have a justified problem with the quality of product , the delivery time , the manufacturing and product testing .
F	i would not recommend ccl to others .
F	perhaps they are ok if you are just ordering a component ... but you can probably find it cheaper elsewhere .
F	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F	update
F	the repair took twice as long as they estimated and they re - delivered the computer to the billing rather_than delivery address ( on the other side of the country ) .
F	do not ring / get put through to their customer_service number
F	they always put you on hold for 00mins or so .
F	here is the email for customer_services if you need to contact them and don ' t fancy a surprise £_00 . 00 phone bill :
F	customerservice @ cclonline . com
F	think i ' ve spent about £_000 so far over last month - buy all my protein_powder , fibre powder and spirulina powder from bulk_powders now .
F	prices are really good and delivery always received within 0 days .
F	the print materials looked great , and i could take_advantage of a couple of special_offers to keep prices low ( but still with fsc - certified paper , which is important for us ).
F	matt was very helpful in getting jobs back on time to meet tight deadlines .
F	i would recommend printing . com cambridge to anyone_looking for an efficient and good quality service .
F	i browsed several sites getting quotes for recycling my macbook , and sell your laptop both offered the best price and had best ratings of all the sites .
F	i was a bit_nervous_about sending off my laptop but found the whole_process very simple and quick - they sent me the packaging within a couple of days , i took it to the post_office and a couple of days_later i received confirmation that they had received the laptop .
F	a few hours_later i had an_email_saying that they were sending me the money , and it was in my account the same day .
F	i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend this service to friends and family , and will_definitely use it in the future .
F	exactly as_described , paperwork , emails very informative - done exactly_what was said wil use again
F	perfect , and great offer price - really pleased
F	also delivery was alot quicker_than_expected
F	really looking_forward to michael_buble at the o0 .
F	ordered the seats ages_ago and received them in the post today - superb seats !
F	!
F	thank_you
F	clive
F	always excellent offers , food piping hot & friendly delivery drivers .
F	i have never used menkind before , in fact i had never_heard of them .
F	but while searching for that illusive gift for my brother that every high_street store had sold out of , i stumbled_upon it at menkind .
F	ordering quick & efficient , delivery was swift when paid for & i also had a package delivered under the free delivery option as well , which came well within the 0 days stated .
F	products where well_packed , which i have found to be a problem with other on - line stores , and came in perfect_condition .
F	i will be using menkind again , i have not found the products i bought cheaper anywhere on line .
F	fab website , it made comparing broadband packages really easy and has saved me loads !
F	definitely_recommend !
F	unfortunately my parcel went missing & after being investigated it could not be found .
F	philip marsh , executive service co - ordinator was very helpful and is very good at his job .
F	i signed_up for the 00 day free_trial through amazon_prime .
F	i never normally sign_up for these types of services but i had heard good things about love_film .
F	i decided not to continue with the trial before the 00 days were up and attempted to cancel my membership .
F	this proved to be very difficult .
F	there was no clear way of cancelling the subscription and in the end i had to google how to do it , whilst doing so i found an abundance of disgruntled_customers having the same issues and whole forums devoted to the topic .
F	i eventually found a way of doing it and pressed the appropriate button which said ' cancel instant prime post by membership '.
F	i didn ' t get an_email confirmation so i logged back into the account to check and sure enough it said i no_longer had a subscription .
F	0 months later i was checking my bank_statements and there was 0 charges for £ 0 . 00 for prime instant video for the last 0 months .
F	i called the customer_service call_centre which again i had to google to find the number as yet again it is not made clear anywhere on the website .
F	i was told by the advisor that although yes i had cancelled my postal service i had to cancelled my instant love_film streaming subscription , something which i never signed_up for and and something which was not made clear i even had on my account .
F	i was absolutely_furious that this company are clearly deceiving customers in this way .
F	i will never use this company again and hope that anyone reading this does not fall into the same trap .
F	with the price and speed as it is , i was worried the product wouldn ' t be of good quality but it is .
F	perfect for my exhibition , couldn ' t be_happier , and ordered another straight_away .
F	bought two of their herbal blend teas , both are lovely , exactly_what i was after , and at a great price with quick delivery also !
F	thank_you !
F	i ' ve been searching for a decent food supplier that will deliver in a timed slot ( rather_than at just some point , one day a week ).
F	well now i ' ve found tilia and couldn ' t be_happier - the food is amazing , the service even better .
F	and the amount of vegetables and salad i received in the seasonal boxes was much more_than i expected .
F	very excited that hunt is finally over !
F	thanks .
F	yesstyle is absolutely one of my favourite websites to shop at .
F	the first thing i do when i ' m feeling bored of my old clothes is look on yesstyle .
F	i even have it at my bookmarks bar because i surf it so often even if it is to be on top of new asian fashion .
F	the reason_why i use yesstyle so much is because , i love shopping in hong_kong , every time i shop there i get my hands full of bags and i have to put down all of them at a hotel just to go out and shop more but with yesstyle , i don ' t have to do all of that because it is all just on one website and the shipping is so fast that you don ' t even expect it .
F	what i especially love is how yesstyle always have a sale on no matter the season .
F	so if you ' re looking for some asian style , yesstyle has everything you ' ll ever need on it !
F	decent service and at a great price was pleased with it all .
F	collection and delivery was done in the timescales and the garage were really nice ,.
F	im just happy that i have found a brand that i feel i can trust so i will recommend to my friends and family .
F	will buy again !
F	thanks to david for his quick response and very helpful support .
F	left the conversation feeling 000_% clear on where to go and what to do .
F	i don ' t know where to begin with amazon .
F	let me just say , that it ' s my no0 choice on online buying .
F	i haven ' t been a member of pph community for long but i ' m loving their new service , hourlies .
F	it is very easy to post an hourlie there and start working .
F	actually i signed_up to post my hourlie and i ' m just getting started with sending proposals in jobs posted .
F	what i like the most is the option of pausing your hourlies when you have lots of work and re - enabling them when you are available .
F	kituout are very efficient and the quality of the products is great .
F	a quick turn_around and friendly service is provided , great prices and overall very happy customers !
F	highly_recommended !
F	georgous chocolate
F	not bad would reccomend tho
F	good but could of been better
F	i prefere i phone
F	delivery is amazing on time and well_packaged .
F	there website is well_structured and smart .
F	there shops and tidy and clothes and shoes are good prices for good quality clothing also there is a shop next to nothing and they sell old next produce for cheap really good .
F	highly_reccomend
F	i don ' t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
F	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your moneys_worth .
F	same story as everyone_else .
F	i called the contact number for them listed on this site ( different to their website ) and spoke to mike who has assured me that i will receive a refund within 0 - 0 banking days .
F	watch this space ....
F	i was a little_skeptical having been stung by online pc building sites before , but i cannot_fault the service and final result provided by cyberpower .
F	their sales_team were friendly , the pc was ready quickly and performs incredibly well .
F	i ' ve already_recommended them to all my friends looking for an upgrade !
F	excellent service , really helpful could tell they were doing everything they could to fix my laptop !
F	got it back within a day as good as new and at a really decent price !
F	thoroughly_recommend 0000rpm and wouldn ' t go anywhere_else if i need assistance again !
F	special thanks to ian for his help and advice !
F	fast delivery , comunicated really well great product .
F	the kids love it
F	love my new coat .
F	use it daily fast service great quality
F	fast service
F	buy quite a lot from there - it ' s quite refreshing to see a big retailer often offering discount_codes and free delivery .
F	i ' ve only ever returned one item which was painless so yes i would recommend !
F	wow .
F	bad bad bad_experience , didn ' t expect it from a popular retailer .
F	firstly they have overcharged my card from the orders i placed , they have taken a higher payment than the payment that i authorised and i have e_- mails to prove this - i ' ve been told this is illegal but anyway , i haven ' t even received the items that i ' ve been overcharged for , i ' ve e_- mailed twice - no reply , called , was on hold for 00_minutes and had other things to do so had to leave it , yet someone has loads of time to tweet me back to say to contact the customer_services - what ' s the point - maybe that person could actually spend some time replying rather_than being a jobs worth - we can all google the helpline number .
F	definitely won ' t be using again and judging from all the bad_reviews here a lot of other people won ' t either , h_& m clearly haven ' t grasped the online shopping world yet .
F	i ' m not really sure how or why people leave bad_reviews for free money ???
F	if you weren ' t part of the site you wouldn ' t get it anyway !
F	excellent website , i ' d recommend to all my friend and family - you ' ve got nothing to lose .
F	great !
F	got a lovely barbour coat with excellent service !
F	my friend and i bought costumes and hers was delivered with a massive rip in it !
F	as it was the day of the event she had to repair it , mine came looking nothing like the picture with accessories that would only fit a child .
F	it took us both several e_- mails and posting on their facebook to get a reply and even then the solutions weren ' t what i would deem as reasonable .
F	would stay well away in future , massive rip_off .
F	i have mine and my mum ' s contract with them , after a few_months , my phone started cutting off calls every few minutes as did my mums , they told me both phones must be faulty , so we both now have brand_new phones and still the same - so very expensive ' advice ' from o0 .
F	i have phoned / e_- mailed / live_chat with them and they have more or less just said ' oh well the coverage says ok in your town ' - not offered any sort of solution , it can be seen on my bill that phone_calls constantly cut_off .
F	friends of mine are having the same issue so it is definitely o0s issue .
F	as long as they have your money they don ' t care !!!
F	!
F	i wish i ' d never ordered !!!
F	next_day delivery took 0 days , 0 e_- mails later no reply , all the dresses had to be returned - some were faulty .
F	no response no refund .

F	00 june
F	hello pippa i believe i have received an_email from you before amongst the 00 something emails i have sent back and forth being told so many different things by your staff .
F	all i want to know is when on earth am i going to get money back ?
F	i ' ve been told 0 different things by your staff yet not one of them can confirm or give me a straight answer , is what you ' re doing even legal ???
F	advertising next_day delivery but never actually doing it and keeping peoples money ??
F	i want my refund through straight_away , is this why you don ' t provide a contact number ??!
F	!
F	i spent £_000 on a bodycon dress , wore it once and now its ripped everywhere !
F	wrote to customer_service and because i can ' t find my receipt ( despite it having french connection labels ) refused to do anything about it .. terrible !
F	!
F	further to the comment you just posted as a reply , if i had wanted budget tyres i would have purchased them but i ordered and paid for medium range , your company should have price matched the closest mid range tyre as it was your mistake yet you were not willing to do that .
F	instead you took my money , left me waiting an_hour at the fitting_centre , i booked time off work , used fuel getting there and back and got nothing .
F	i have my mot now that my car will not pass because your company couldn ' t deliver .
F	i have called and left my details at your complaints_department and had no call back and sent an e_- mail with no reply .
F	says a lot about customer_service .
F	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F	reply : the guy at the fitting_centre and the woman on the phone from your company told me that you did have an_alternative tyre in stock but you were not willing to price_match .
F	i ordered a bed , it was delivered in two days , fast delivery service , the bed is perfect , i am really pleased .
F	i have been shopping with northern_parrots for 00 years , i have always found them a very reliable , their service is second to none , i am pleased to deal with them :)

F	i think chemist_direct is a good online pharmacy , they have everything you might need , and some really great offers too :)
F	i bought a balloon ride for my husband from a company on groupon .
F	we were very excited about the prospect of going up for a ride .
F	over two years i tried booking and rebooking rides , always to be cancelled .
F	the balloon company said there was nothing they could do about the weather and that we could pay anohter 00 . 00 pounds to renew for another year .
F	after yet another year and still no ride i went back to groupon and asked them what they would do about it .
F	i explained that the balloon company would not even let us book a ride unless we had given them our voucher number which would automatically give the balloon company the money for our ride ... even with no ride !
F	since i had all the emails to prove our non_existent ride groupon refunded us the 000 . 00 without any hassle .
F	i was very impressed considering this was two years on .
F	so i cannot_fault them on their service .
F	the item i ordered was easily ordered with no_problems .
F	just had to answer a few routine questions and it was done .
F	the communication via_email was fantastic and i received my order very promptly .
F	fantastic service , definitely_recommend .
F	the website was very easy to work with and i was able to order without any_problems .
F	i received email_notifications keeping me informed of the progress of my order .

F	ordered 0 fairly basic rings over the christmas_period after seeing the advert on hitched .
F	the price was a fraction of that available on the high_street .
F	the rings arrived within a couple of days and were perfect .
F	beautifully_presented in lovely boxes and the insurance documents were an excellent addition .
F	recommend them to anyone .
F	if i ever have an_eternity_ring this is where i ' ll be sending him !
F	!
F	hostelbookers had the cheapest prices and is extremely easy to use .
F	i liked that you could enter in the days you need the room and it finds the availability for you .
F	would definitely_recommend to others .
F	my experience with next step beauty has been a good one .
F	everything you need to know is in the course and there is help available after you complete the course if needed .
F	the tutor i had for all 0 of the courses i completed was sarah and she was a brilliant tutor who answered any_questions we had and made the training fun but informative .
F	i now have complete nail technician , pedicure and spray tan under my belt and i ' m now a self_employed mobile beauty therapist .
F	was very disappointed by the flowers i received from my boyfriend through moon pig !
F	they arrived on time ( the only good part of this review ) but had petals falling_off , black / dead petals and some were squashed !
F	the day before i had got my boyfriend a £ 0 bunch of flowers as a bit of fun and they looked much_better_than the £_00 bunch !!!
F	even other people thought the £ 0 flowers were the moon pig ones !
F	my boyfriend felt ashamed even_though it wasn ’ t his fault and was as disgusted as me .
F	we ended_up driving to the local_supermarket ( local being 00 miles_away ) because he felt so bad about them arriving in the condition they were in and wanted to get me a proper bunch .
F	we have taken date and time stamped photos for proof and emailed a complaint and are waiting to hear back from moon pig .
F	the only thing we will except is a full_refund and will even send their pathetic flowers back as they are not as_described or fit for purpose !
F	i have never met a company more incompetent than bt !
F	they do not seem to be able to get anything right .
F	hate this company .
F	they never booked appointments and then i get a phone call with an engineer waiting at my door_step .
F	well congratulations genius !
F	nobody is home because your company neglected to actually book an_appointment .
F	0 month without any service .
F	the next battle is to explain to some incompetent idiot that they can ' t charge me if they have not been able to deliver any service !!!!!
F	useless .
F	it is companies like these that make the uk a bad place to live and work !
F	placed an order days in_advance !
F	was not delivered on time .
F	family now thinks i do not care and took some convincing that i did make plans for stuff to be delivered .
F	i am mortified that i had to make excuses for something i was prepared for !
F	their customer_service dept is horrible .
F	cant phone them , just this silly online thing .
F	it took me throwing my toys to get a delivery charge refund !
F	i will not recomend this company !
F	please go to interflora !
F	much_better !
F	i experienced fast service with no_problems at all , the process for ordering prescription drugs for my pet was made so easy .
F	i appreciated the communication via_email keeping up to date from receiving the order , it being_processed and dispatched - all of which was very quick !
F	i would readily recommend viovet to any pet owner .
F	i have saved over half the cost of the monthly prescription and i will_continue to use viovet .
F	great service and super_fast delivery .
F	just follow the instructions they provide and it should work .
F	if for any reason you don ' t want to restore the device ( like in my case ) and the provided instructions didn ' t work , don ' t panic , just do a little google_search and you will find many ways to achieve this .
F	after using a friends curling wand she recommended beautycow . com to purchase one , price was great , website was nice and simple , recieved my product the next morning and couldnt be_happier with it !
F	will be purchasing more from beautycow in the future !
F	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .
F	highly_recommend !!
F	!
F	i learned about a product from a close friend and i looked it up and say that you all had this item .
F	then i looked up the item other_places but your product was much cheaper .
F	like by 00 . 00 cheaper !!!!!
F	saving money for me is always a plus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	!
F	guys turned_up on time and did exactly as asked .
F	very kind and just got on with it .
F	my partner and some friends were at the other end and they were even quicker unloading .
F	took all the items to rooms specified .
F	no damage caused at all .
F	would recommend using anyvan and would highly_recommend the guys that came to us .
F	quality product , fast delivery :) will be using them again , thank_you .
F	first bedframe was broken , so i refused delivery .
F	a replacement was due to come on monday by 0pm .
F	didnt arrive . called cust_services but they were busy so i was put through to sales , they took my details , said someone from cust_services would call back .
F	i called them 0 times that day , apparently they were too busy going through emails from the weekend .
F	said i wanted to cancel but i couldnt do that til i got through to customer_services anyway !
F	called again on tuesday_morning , still busy .
F	asked for delivery company and ref no .
F	so i could call them myself - delivery company informed me that the headboard was broken so they didnt send it out !
F	cust_services finally got back to me , just apologised , like that would make a difference - i still dont have a bed !
F	if bedman called the delivery company instead of trying to get through to cust_services , it would have saved alot of time and hassle !
F	if you dont have enough staff , employ more - its simple .
F	the cust should ' t have to lose out because someone cant do their job !
F	i ' ve now lost 0 days wages and still dont have a bed !
F	i was told that no compensation is offered for loss of earnings which is " clearly_stated in our terms & conditions !"
F	save_yourself the hassle , go with someone_else !!
F	i wish i did .
F	i found e_- careers very easy to use , and with being_able to complete the training and assessments at a time that is convenient for you it really is ideal .
F	there was always somebody to contact if you were unsure of anything and this was very reassuring .
F	an excellent course , with excellent staff for support .... what more could you need ?
F	after buying 0 faulty / problematic pre_- owned htc desires from the cash_generator website i looked online for an_alternative place to buy from .
F	after a brief look on google i came_across the refurb_phone website and was pleased to find they did the same phone for a very reasonable_price but also with 0 months warrantee !
F	the phone arrived a couple of days_later imaculate and works a dream !
F	would certainly recommend !
F	fast delivery
F	low_prices
F	no problem with international shipping
F	will_definitely come back :)
F	i had a problem signing in from my mac , and there was this very helpful lady in customer_service that solved my problem in one second !
F	no wonder_why this company is great !
F	thank_you !
F	pleased with this order - the quality is great and the fragrance arrived really quickly .
F	the 00h free post is really handy , and better_than some of the other , similar_sites .
F	the whole service was great - really , really easy , i was very pleased with the amount of money i received for my phone and the bank_transfer was quick and completely hassle_free .
F	i would definitely_recommend anyone to use mazuma in future - i will !
F	thank_you .
F	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
F	when we got there ( it ' s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
F	when they ' d taken the order originally they hadn ' t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
F	it was far too small !
F	i ' m a o and it was j .
F	they initially offered to resize it there and then which we were not happy about .
F	we ' d have lost quality making it so much bigger .
F	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
F	i wasn ' t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
F	we had intended to order my fiance ' s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
F	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
F	mine from marlows just came in a box without even a cope of the receipt .
F	and mine was mich more_expensive .
F	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .
F	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i ' ll feel that twang of disappointment .
F	i love using moonpig !
F	its great for every occasion .
F	i have brought several cards from moonpig and they all look exsactly how i wanted them to , if not even better ... you can personalise cards which gives them a personal_touch :-)
F	just great !!
F	!
F	great store !
F	love everything in the shop !
F	!
F	i recently brought a travel system from mothercare instore .
F	i recieved a letter several months later saying that the car_seat cover wasn ' t safe and hadn ' t been sprayed with fire resistant solution , they said they would send me a new cover which would be safe .
F	0 months later and i havent recieved the seat cover and i bearly got an opology .
F	clothes are great but i wouldn ' t buy a travel system from them again as this has put me off .
F	they are rubbish at getting back to you and never stick to there word .
F	toys are good but i find a lot of products in store are very over priced compared to other stores like toy ' r ' us ...
F	ebayer is a fabulous company and a great way to sell your old stuff , i use it all the time !
F	fabulous company , greats deals and offers flexable payment options !
F	very happy with all of my purchases :-)
F	i ordered a lara croft tomb_raider costume from all fancy_dress after searching all over the web for one , the price was very reasonable and on sale from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 !!
F	i ' m not very good with computers so i phoned their order line and on the other end of the phone a very polite young_lady who helped_me put my order through with ease !
F	i then received my costume just 0 days after with just the standard £ 0 . 00 post service !
F	the costume was great quality and everyone at my party loved it too !
F	thanks all fancy_dress , will_definately use you again in the future !
F	sold my phone and within 0 days of sending it off i had a my cheque through my door .
F	recommended
F	my partner waited in between 0 and 0 today as delivery was expected between 0 and 0 .
F	he had to go to work at 0 and guess_what ?
F	no delivery .
F	i came home from work at 0 to find a crumpled up card through the door with absolutely no information on at all , just a card ref .
F	called the customer_service team , one guy was fairly helpful and gave me a depot to collect from .
F	tried the depot to see if item was actually there and number was unrecognised .
F	called back , spoke to ' senior ' member saffron who was very rude and unhelpful and would not discuss anything with me even_though the other guy already had .
F	we have now had to reschedule delivery for 0 days time as we both work and that is the next_day we are in all because the company would not keep to their word or speak to me even_though i have all the information required .
F	where is the parcel now ???
F	never use if you have a choice .
F	this is the second issue with them !
F	!
F	the service was quick and easy !
F	would definitely use again :)
F	also delivers to channel_islands in record time !
F	my delivery was in 0 parts , all collected from the supplier on the same day for next_day delivery .
F	unfortunately only 0 parts of the delivery arrived .
F	the other part has been lost for around a week now .
F	my experience was wholly unsatisfactory .
F	first of all , after receiving confirmation that i had paid in full which showed that i also requested for 0 additional drivers , when i arrived at the company – dollar rentacar - i was informed that i would have to pay for the two additional drivers as well as a full_tank of fuel as per their policy .
F	their excuse was that it is a risk when renting a car through a 0rd_party .
F	as it turns_out , i paid , with just one additional driver , i ended_up spending 000 usd over the price of other rental car agency hence being cheated by rentalcars . com and dollar rent - a - car .
F	this is completely_unacceptable and an abuse of our trust to falsely and advertise prices that were not accurate and hence making customers drastically pay more of a service that would have been cheaper elsewhere .
F	in addition to this , when i was renting a vehicle , i asked to be quoted in usd and then after i entered all my details and pressed submit , i was then informed that i would be charged in nok which is again unacceptable and was not made obvious during the check out process hence , whilst i was paying with a us credit_card , i was also charged the exchange_rate .
F	good laptop seller
F	i love it very much , good camera charger
F	i buy an apple laptop battery from world - batteries . co . uk , it is high_quality , i want to give all 0_stars
F	received the post wallet the next_day and received the cheque 0 days after i ' d posted it .
F	very impressed .
F	almost booked with one of hostelbookers rivals hostelworld , until i found out that hostelbookers was about 0 % cheaper .
F	the site is really easy to use .
F	thanks hostelworld !
F	from the first phone call i new that we had chosen the right place to buy my engagement_ring .
F	nothing was too much_trouble , from changing the ring size at the last_minute to the phone_calls from the team ensuring me that my ring would be with me by our specified date .
F	the service and quality of your products is 0nd to none and we will_definately be back !
F	!
F	fast delivery and cheaper games than anywhere_else fantasic ..........!
F	when i was ordered large items before , like - bed , matress and cooker and they was delivered by argos own van - delivery , was promt and fantastic , they call all times 0 hour before delivery , to let you know when they will arrive .
F	but when i ordered a dinning table , what is small item - they use yodel , and yodel did ' nt arrive in time stated 0am - 0pm for next_day delivery , they didn ' t arrive at all , they leave tracking_info , that item was out for delivery , but then returned to depot without explanation .
F	i call argos to find out what happening and they contacted yodel and yodel say , that item will be delivered tomorrow , but next_day , when i track , its says , that my dinning table is returned back to argos , because i refuse delivery !!!
F	what ???
F	how can i refuse , if yodel newer showed up ?
F	argos say that only option for me is - to buy table again , yes wright , but they will return money only in 0 days and i don ' t have extra 000_pounds - to buy again !
F	and table is in sale price , and when i get money back , table can be out of stock or sale can be ended .
F	great - now i ' m without money and without table .
F	thanks - yodel !!
F	!
F	argos is a good company , but layed down by rubish delivery companies , like yodell .
F	i have previously bad expierence with yodel , when buying from other shops , if i was knowing , that my table will be delivered by yodel , then i will never buy it !
F	becouse i was thinking , that it will be delivered by argos own delivery , what is great , but unfortunately , they deliver only bigger items by argos own delivery - that they say to me .
F	great website i ' m really impressed with it .
F	i have ordered from this company twice so far , all good !
F	products arrived very quickly and everything in order .
F	i like how they stock protein in smaller sizes as well as the standard 0kg bags .
F	the protein seems to be of a very high_quality too .
F	what a great company .
F	they have a very good range of products at reasonable prices , and have friendly customer_service , and what ' s more ....
F	they are reliable !
F	i know if i buy something from them it should arrive in the post the next_day .
F	:-)
F	i bot 0 games for smart byke , after payment received email item is not in stock and manufact .
F	is not going to suplay any more i can buy something else ?
F	i send emails i dont want something else i want my money beck , but guess_what .
F	no replays at all .
F	no metter how meny time you send them email , they just ignoring . i was in touch with my bank and i can start despute for charge beck after 00 days .
F	i advise to all who got scamed like me to file for chargebeck .
F	i love ilumi , i ' ve ordered from them a few_times now and they ' ve never got the order wrong once , everything has always tasted great and they occasionally do freebies too , amongst their other special_offers .
F	ilumi is actually saving us money as it feels_like having a takeaway but without the hefty price or hefty calories !
F	i ' m not allergic to gluten or anything but i do feel ' healthier ' when i ' ve been eating these meals .
F	there is a good selection of different meals to choose from and at the moment they are introducing various new types of cuisine .
F	0_stars from me !
F	bought a few items from this website , some were sent in wrong sizes , one item smelt of fish and others were poor quality so i sent the whole lot back for a refund .
F	they refunded me except for one item which they are accusing me of keeping !
F	i am trying to claim through paypal and will also be involving trading_standards .
F	quite obvious they are pulling a fast one to recoup their postage_costs !
F	transaction_id :_0000000
F	i am still_waiting for my beyonce tickets for munich in 00 days .
F	we booked our tickets in march , 0 month time to send them and we still dont have them .
F	i have to fly from england to germany and wont be able to print out the tickets 0 hour before .
F	i really dont want to fly to germany for nothing .
F	so please send me my tickets !
F	all we do in the waiting time is thinking whether we will get our tickets and whether they will be invalid .
F	i will_definitely never use viagogo again
F	i travel alot and often put my junk in storage for several months at a time .
F	compared with traditional self storage westore offered :
F	boxes to throw my stuff in
F	convenient pick - up
F	safe secure storage off - site
F	cheap too
F	no more worrying_about how to get to an industrial estate to pick_up my things on returning to the uk .
F	westore return the things i need when i want them .
F	couldn ' t recommend enough .
F	having traded in my old_mobile phone using their comparison table of recyclers , i ' m now using their search facility ahead of any buying decision - i love how easy the site is to use and how it looks .
F	i bought a incrystal block for my parents anniversary and was really pleased with the result , the delivery was super_quick and end product very special .
F	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
F	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
F	ordering was very easy , and customer_service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn ' t a problem .
F	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
F	on realising that the item wasn ' t suitable , i had to send back .
F	my only issue is the cost of returns .
F	it cost me nearly £ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
F	i didnt have to send it this way but for peace of mind , i think most people would send it recorded .
F	anyway , you do not get re - imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
F	which is a shame .
F	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
F	i decided to use collect_+ for the first time after trying to sell a few items to pay for expensive vets bills .
F	i used the standard two day delivery service and it was not overly clear to up the insurance value on the item ( my fault completely , assuming the claim was accepted )
F	i sent the parcel on 0st_july and the parcel was collected the next_day all smooth and clear , the parcel arrives at the national hub at 00 . 00 and that was the last transaction date .
F	i spend over an_hour on the phone to admin yesterday trying to track this lost parcel , how can a parcel get lost when it was packaged that no one would open it or see in it .
F	although i cannot see it it was taken to another depot the next_day at 0 . 00am , this doesn ' t show up on my transaction details and only came to light this morning after numerous checking !!!
F	!
F	i thankfully have a very patient ebay buyer which i am going to have to refund and be out of pocket because one of collect +' s light fingered staff on night shift .
F	sadly the packet was small and light weight enough to make it obvious that it was a mobile phone .
F	what a complete_joke , i can claim and if i win i will get £_00 back which means a refund to the ebayer of £_000 , ebay fees of £ 0 , collect_plus fee of £ 0 total out of pocket and having to find = £_000
F	thank_you very much no i am even more out of pocket !
F	i will never use your service again , i have sent 000 ' s of parcels through royal_mail standard non signed for and all arrived perfectly !!
F	!
F	avoid like the plague and recent feed_back seems that this is happening more_than it should !
F	very angry customer who is severely out of pocket now and struggling to find funds for vets !
F	!
F	thank_you for your fabulous service and customer care , not !
F	i think you should be searching harder for this item !!!
F	!
F	my boyfriend and i were browsing for an engagement_ring and we found diamond dealers direct .
F	we had the pleasure of being seen by a lovely gentleman , oliver .
F	he sat down with us and asked all the right questions and was not pushy at all .
F	he brought out enough samples to give us plenty of options but without overwhelming us .
F	his knowledge of diamonds and rings was outstanding and he was very friendly and professional .
F	after trying on many shapes and sizes we settled on a 0 . 0crt sophia and i couldn ' t be_happier and we were very surprised at how reasonable the prices were .
F	in fact we were so pleased with the all_round service and the options oliver gave us , we even found and ordered the wedding_bands the same day .
F	i cannot wait to show them off .
F	thank_you very much for making this , what could have been a very stressful and expensive event an easy , effortless one .
F	thank_you diamond dealers direct and thank_you oliver .
F	product always available at amazing prices !
F	very surprised that the quality was so great considering the price and i am notoriously hard to please !
F	efficient , good customer_service and quick responses if any_problems occur .
F	i use this site at lease every two_weeks :_o )
F	the clothes are shoddily made .
F	i bought a few things from there about 0 months_ago and everything has dropped to bits .
F	a dress that tore at the seam was sent back the next_day and i have only just received my refund , of which was £ 0 less_than what i paid for the dress as they took off the cost of delivery !
F	what a cheek since it took them 0 weeks to do the refund in the first place .
F	i sent an_email_saying i would go to trading_standards if they didn ' t give me my refund and i would never use the site again and to add_insult to injury they replied apologising and offered me 00_%_off my next shop .
F	blind ?
F	no , stupid ?
F	probably not , terrible customer_service ?
F	absolutely !
F	avoid like the plague !
F	i was very very pleased from gadget_panda .
F	i was a bit_worried_about sending my gadget of as i have never done anything like this before and they was brilliant they sent me a email when they recived the item and they kept me posted on what was happping .
F	the money was in my paypal after the second day of them receving the gadget .
F	they gave me the same amount as what they said from the beginning with no emails trying to knock the prise down .
F	i would defiantly use gadget_panda again and would recomend to anyone .
F	thank_you very much gadget_panda a pleasure to deal with .
F	a ********
F	easy experience and trustworthy
F	such a great service from lisa harkness .
F	she came up with loads of choices for our chosen destination and took all of our requests into_consideration , going that extra_mile to make_sure we got everything we wanted , and there were no grumbles when when we were constantly changing our minds on the details ( and being a group of 0 , that was quite a lot !!).
F	i will_definately be using holidays_please ( and lisa in particular ) for all my holiday needs in the future .
F	i was soo tired travelef from poland to uk and there is no place to sleep
F	always use hotstel bookers for travelling
F	very quick and easy and cheap
F	thanks guys
F	my father linked me to this website after i expressed my distress about the difficulties of finding accommodation .
F	i loved the map_feature as well as having access to user reviews .
F	this website truly removed the stresses of booking my holiday accommodation !
F	i ' ve been using this company since last_year september .
F	i ' ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
F	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
F	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
F	i did not get a response .
F	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has been completed ... why didn ' t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
F	why didn ' t i get response to the email sent ?
F	it ' s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
F	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
F	i ' ll look for a similar company to do my images from now on , i don ' t want to be a bother .
F	i got a message from my neighbour telling_me he has my parcel from amazon at his house .
F	i was surprised and confused for two reasons .
F	0 ) i did not receive any sort of card or note telling_me that my parcel has been left with my neighbour .
F	0 ) though i was expecting many parcels during the week , i wasn ' t expecting anything from amazon .
F	i come to find out that one of the companies i was expecting the parcel from , used amazon logistics to deliver .
F	i told my neighbour that i didn ' t receive any card that my parcel was left with him .
F	my neighbour told me that he found my parcel sitting outside my house in the rain .
F	he took it inside his house to look after it for me .
F	i was so angry about this , luckily my good neighbour got to it before a thief did .
F	my car , my neighbours bike and even my bin ( yes my bin can !)
F	has all been stolen from outside our property .
F	this parcel contained a gift for someone !
F	if it was stolen , there wouldn ' t have been any proof that this parcel had been delivered .
F	i was so angry , i looked all over the box to find out which courier was responsible .
F	unsurprisingly there was no courier name or logo anywhere .
F	i think delivery driver thought they would be untraceable because of this .
F	so i called amazon & gave them the barcode number on the box .
F	i found out it was their own - amazon logistics .
F	i ' ve had bad_experiences with other delivery companies but none of them have ever left my parcel ( s ) outside out in the open .
F	i ' ll definitely avoid amazon logistics
F	i paid for an express service to send my package to the usa - delivery 0 - 0 days .
F	how about it never arrived till 0 days_later ... if i had put all my trust into dhl and never tracked the package online ... the package will never have been delivered .
F	this is because my package was held up in customs , they required further information and stated online someone will contact me ....
F	i received no contact whatsoever .
F	when i called dhl , they told me the description was not descriptive enough .
F	this was the fault of the dhl employee who processed my package .
F	i took the items to the service point un - wrapped and un - packaged .
F	the dhl employee held the items in his bare hand and saw them with his own eyes , his even asked me the description and i gave him a description .
F	i told him ' beaded gloves , accessories '....
F	the dhl employee typed on the waybill ' accessories '.
F	now the dhl claims department has just contact me and told me i am not able to get a full or partial_refund as it was held up in customs and not with dhl .
F	well the reason_why it was held up in customs is because of you dhl !
F	your employee should know better and put in a more detailed description .
F	i don ' t work for dhl .
F	can you imagine the lady for claims said that i should of put down the material , size ect of the beads !!!
F	!
F	how am i meant to know that for goodness sake ?
F	when i was at your service point the dhl employee did not ask me for these further details ... dhl is so wrong for that .
F	there is no such thing as the dhl money back guarantee ...
F	lies they will look for any excuse not to reimburse customers and they will not accept_responsibility .
F	from now on ...
F	i will stick to sending my products worldwide via post_office ' s international signed for ...
F	it ' s half the price of dhl anyway .
F	i will also tell the international businesses and customers i deal with not to send me back anything using dhl .
F	they keep you waiting till kingdom come , when the package ( s ) finally do arrive the packaging has been destroyed .
F	every packaged i have had delivered by hermes has had damaged packaging .
F	they lie and claim they came when they have not , i always check the online tracking regularly .
F	apparently , the delivery people of these independent delivery companies ( hermes , yodel , dpd ect ) are paid every time they are sent out to deliver - whether or not the package was delivered !
F	so they lie a lot that they ' attempted to delivery ' just to get paid extra .
F	they used to quietly slip those ' sorry we missed you ' ' delivery attempted ' cards through the letterbox and run away .
F	i guess customers started catching them , cause now i ' ve noticed they rarely leave those cards but instead they use their online tracking_system to tell customers they tried to deliver but no one was in .
F	you only ever receive those cards if they genuinely did try to deliver and no one was indoors to receive .
F	i am avoiding hermes from now on and any companies that choose to use them as their courier .
F	warning please do not use viator .
F	i used them to book 0 tickets to a thames river cruise for my mothers 00th_birthday on the 00th of may to find that the company do not and have not run cruises on thursdays .
F	when speaking to them on the phone on the day , they blamed a communication breakdown , between them and the company , to which i was told they have never run cruises on thursdays in all the years they have used them , which is irrelevant if you are selling something , it is up to you to make_sure you actually have a product to sell .
F	the upset and hurt you have caused and also time and money taken off work and also to get to london , is something we will not get back .
F	this also happened to two other families on the same day , a family with a child for a half term treat and a family of 0 from france .
F	you certainly gave her a birthday to remember , thanks !
F	if you have unfortunately booked anything with viator , please confirm with the company that actually run what ever you have booked , before you waste time and money going there .
F	i have demanded a full_refund , as i do not want to rebook , as if i had wanted to go on a different day i would have booked a different day !
F	i have been promised a full_refund , but will wait to see if this happens .
F	i have emailed and await a response from viator , but will be looking to reporting this further .
F	please_please do not use this company .
F	sally slack is one of the most caring and considerate lady , mother and photographer i ' ve ever met .
F	i ' ve had in total , 0 sessions with her with my beautiful son , newborn , 0st cake smash and his 0nd birthday where he had a chocolate piñata .
F	he aboustly loves his photo taken but sally makes him so happy , she ' s not ' scary ' at all .
F	she worked around my child even when he was uncomterable with the flash , she soon made his concentrate on something else , she has loads of different equipment to make the children busy and happy .
F	for example cars , chairs and musical instruments .
F	she was always very flexible with the time of day because we wanted to work around my son having a nap .
F	she so easy to get hold off and always for my sons newborn shoot , he got to wear loads of different hats and lay in all different positions with cute backgrounds which made then photos very cute and professional .
F	they were amazing !!
F	i didn ' t know what to expect for my sons 0st birthday cake smash !
F	but again sally was very welcoming and he had so much fun again the same for his 0nd birthday !
F	the quality of the photos were brilliant aswel for a good price !
F	sally is so easy to work around and the variety of photo shoots she does is amazing .
F	i would serious recommend sally slack to any parents that want beautiful warm professional memories of their child !
F	great service , both via their amazon store and from the website directly .
F	good range of rug designs , fast delivery , responsive customer_service and good value for money .
F	i ' m very pleased with my orders and would definitely buy from them again .
F	i ' m going on two business trips and know nothing about the cities , but the layout of this website made it really easy to go over other visitors ' reviews and choose a place in a safe part of town that will work for me .
F	there ' s no confusing layout or options , it ' s all straightforward !
F	the members of the staff are very helpful , amazing people ! they really care about the quality of your prints always ready to help with any_questions .
F	special thanks to david for helping me with my prints .
F	wide_range of products , always good prices .
F	good returns_policy and i can pay with paypal .
F	just take a look for yourself
F	i have worked in retail over 00 years and i have to say this is the best customer_service i have ever received !!!!
F	from the moment i was buying my product to the aftercare the staff are more_than happy to help and very very well trained in their field !!!!
F	i can ' t recommend this store enough !
F	fantastic !!!
F	0 * plus !!!!!!!
F	!
F	i ordered a set of cartridges for our work pc ' s arrived very quickly .. an overal brilliant service .. never had any_problems when placing an order or receiving goods .
F	i ordered an item over a week_ago and as i had not arrived yet i sent them an_email last_night just to ask if the item had been dispatched yet .
F	today i got an_email_saying the item was discontinued and that my order had now been cancelled .
F	it took them a week to tell me the item was discontinued !!!
F	and only after i had contacted them about it …
F	i can ’ t help but think this is a scam to hold onto customer ’_s money for a while .
F	they say on the email it will take a few_days for the refund .
F	not happy at all !!
F	!
F	it ' s a great way to get_rid of dvd ' s and cd ' s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
F	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
F	speedy service and lush products !
F	:-)
F	hostelbookers provides the best experience for booking hostels throughout the world .
F	with helpful guides and accessible reviews i was able to make the right hostel decisions and even save money .
F	will use always
F	one stop shopping since you ' re able to write in competitor ' s prices and get an even cheaper price on this site !
F	i always use hostel_bookers when backpacking and it ' s a great resource to find the hostel you need , being_able to choose the parameters that suit you .
F	transactions process quickly and you receive the confirmation_email within_seconds , it ' s a very efficient system .
F	i always buy my concert tickets from double0tickets , always get great seats and the tickets always arrive quickly
F	where to begin with this site ?
F	i joined tombola when it first started , and i loved it !!!
F	of course i did - i was winning left right and centre for about 00 months .
F	i would play every night , and i would win a full house in the red room literally every night - not to mention endless line and 0 line wins .
F	then the wins slowed_down a little , i thought this was due to having an unlucky streak - and soon i was going to the deposit limit of £_000 every_single week with only an odd line win here and there .
F	i have always maxed , and still end up waiting on 0 number for literally every line 0 line , full house .
F	i stopped playing for 0 months , as i realised that the hobby was becoming an addiction and i didn ' t want to go down that route .
F	when i returned to the site after 0 months ... low and behold ... won the first game i played !
F	for weeks after that i was winning and again another successful few_months .
F	soon the £_000 a week limit was getting reached on a weekly_basis , and the repeat winners , was just not worth the cash .
F	i play maybe once every few_months and still see those same names !
F	no matter what day , time , - within_seconds of joining a room their name pops up !
F	the cm ' s are rude , patronising and the way they allow the " groupies " to join in is what i can only describe as bullying .
F	when you are spending £_000 a week you are entitled to vent your frustration when for the 000th time that day you ' ve missed yet another house , yet another jp ...
F	the repeat winners situation on this site is the worst i have seen , and i have no_idea how they are able to get away with it .
F	i once played 00 games of cinco in a row ( that ' s â £_000 ) and with only thirty nine players or less for most of that few hours i played i waited on 0 for about 00_% of the games , missed the 00k jp 0 times and saw 0 winners win approximately 0 + times each within that time_frame - one of which won 0 games in a row .
F	tombola knows most of its loyal_customers feel this way , and they don ' t care - the reason they don ' t care is because for every one of us that leaves - they get 000 more to replace us with their ads and voucher_codes .
F	if you ask me the site has become too big for its boots and the quality of service has massively slipped .
F	my view is - what goes up must come back down , and i certainly won ' t be there to bring it back up .
F	make of this site as you will , but i write this review as a genuine bingo lover , and one who has no problem with losing when its fair .
F	heist is a con too !
F	never won sod all on it
F	if your lucky_enough to win ... dont withdraw , you wont win again for years !
F	tombola please dont insult me with your generic response ...
F	your site is fixed and thats that !
F	having seen online mixed_reviews of jagerstore . co . uk i was a little_apprehensive_about going to them to buy my boots - but they were so well_priced i decided to anyway .
F	i was very pleased that i did - they phoned me when they didn ' t have my size in stock and asked if i wanted a different size ( i did ) and were very thorough with their emails about when the boots would be in stock .
F	i was very happy with their service and will be using them again .
F	lovely selection of glasses that are cheaper_than the high_street and effortlessly stylish to boot !
F	brilliant quick service :)
F	as a production assistant currently working in tv , but hoping to transition into script development , i found this course both relevant and insightful .
F	the course was well_structured and delivered in an informal and friendly atmosphere , making the seemingly intense day manageable .
F	the small class size gave an intimate learning environment , which allowed for safe space to openly discuss ideas , and opinions on the course materials we reviewed .
F	i feel the information and understanding i ’ ve gained is absolutely invaluable .
F	not only am i now looking at screen plays and my own work with fresh eyes , i ’ ve come away with an up to date list of contacts to gain actual work in the industry , and a few contacts from my fellow course members .
F	i decided to enquire_about mazuma , after i accidentally caused a bleed in my phone due to dropping it .
F	i hadn ' t owned my phone for very long and was gutted at what happened .
F	my phone was valued at £ 0 . 00 by mazuma in it ' s current condition .
F	and had it not been broken and still in working order would have only been valued at a mere £ 0 . 00 !
F	not recommended as devices are valued far too poorly , unless you are not really concerned at the amount offered for your phone , and would just at_least like to recieve ' something ' for it , however little .
F	i have used these_guys a few_times now and each time i am blown_away !
F	products are awesome and deliver is fast .
F	will be using them again and again !
F	!
F	i would highly_recommend drinkstuff , the product i purchase was fantastic , along with the price and to top it all off the delivery was very fast .
F	so i am one happy customer .
F	will be using them again !
F	:)
F	i was very happy with the service from mazuma .
F	i intially went to envirophone and despite only having the hanset only a month brand_new they tried to claim it had some damage and cut their offer by half !
F	i was absoloutely appalled .
F	i requested it back and sent it off to mazuma instead .. they had it the next_day and i had the full payment in my account that day !
F	no_qualms , no questions :), just a good honest service .
F	i first used glasses_direct for a simple back up pair of glasses which lasted me a few_years , then got told i ' d be better off wearing my glasses more as contact_lenses don ' t let in much oxygen to the eyes ( i ' m realllllllllllly blind !!!!)
F	that ' s when i decided to order a nice pair of glasses .
F	brilliant value for money , would cost me at_least £_000 for one pair after thinning lenses at my opticians .
F	can get two_pairs thinned for less_than that with glasses_direct :)
F	only ordering more now as the pair i wore to work got chucked across the playground and scratched :(... old lady glasses string should stop that happening this time .
F	have recommended to all glasses wearers i know !
F	having never used this site to order contact_lenses , i wasn ' t sure if i would receive my order as quickly as it states , but i ordered on a thursday_evening with estimated_delivery the following_monday - tuesday .
F	i actually received it on the saturday before then so was really pleasantly_surprised .
F	will_definitely use this site again .
F	i was very pleased with service provided by mazuma_mobile . so quick money straight on my account very pleased .
F	i found that this website was totally awesome as it offer affordable price to find the hotel .
F	plus , it was so easy to find the hotel that has fully specific criteria that i wanted .
F	the map provided just make everything easy .
F	i can plan the trip by comparing the distance between the hotel and the landmark of the places that i wanted to visit .
F	seriously , it did help a lot !
F	i will use this website again to find the hotel of the place that i plan to visit to be honest .
F	i have used the other website to find the hotel but this one is the best i have ever found !
F	just by looking at the map , you can see the distance from the hotel to airport or train_station easily .
F	it also give the suggestion of the best place to visit together with the distance details and yeah !
F	it just like you can the world from this website .
F	i could say that this website is the eyes of the world indeed !
F	:_d
F	this is an excellent company , i ' ve bought a bag and shoes from them , both cheaper_than elsewhere and delivered within a day ; brilliant !
F	!
F	love love love all the products .
F	they really have worked miracles for me .
F	my skin is now healthy and pure .
F	the soaps do not really smell appealing but still nourish the skin beautifully .
F	to be honest i probably won ' t buy the soaps again unless they become more perfumed with essential oils in future .
F	thank - you , thank - you , thank - you
F	" absolutely fantastic items and lovely service .
F	fast delivery .
F	thankyou .
F	my matress is very happy now !
F	;-)"
F	ordered phone on the 00th_june , money came out of my bank on the 00th , its now the 00th_june and the item has not even been dispatched .
F	part way through i wanted to cancel but they said they would make it a priority , they also said that as it hadn ' t been posted or packed or even taken off the shelf , it would not cause further delay to me to change the colour of the phone to one that states 00 in stock , hoping this would help .
F	this appears not to be the case , the order status has started again from the beginning !
F	' your acceptance of our order has been confirmed ' ??
F	yes and paid for weeks_ago !!
F	customer_services give you the same line about high_demand for product , logistics problem etc etc wish i ' d looked for reviews before purchasing - i recommend you never use this company
F	i ' d seen a pair of glasses i liked in a shop but i couldn ' t find them online as i ' d searched many sites for them , it appeared they were the latest release .
F	designer_glasses boutique appeared to have the most_recent designs so i called their number , it was answered straight_away by emma who told me she would call the designer and try and obtain the glasses .
F	she soon rang me back to advise me they were available and had been added to the website and sent me the link .
F	i ordered the glasses and within good time they had arrived .
F	excellent friendly service , no_hassles , good price , will_definately use them next time and i have already_recommended to friends and family .
F	thank_you
F	i booked flights to travel to orlando with them as they were the cheapest around by about £_000 .
F	i booked on 00st_march_0000 .
F	i received a confirmation_email and all was fine until i got a call on 00th_march_0000 from a representative of the company to tell me that unfortunately when i booked my flights at 00pm on 00st_march_0000 , the price had changed at midnight ( 0 hour after i booked ) and as a result i would have to pay £_000 more .
F	i asked why i had to pay more as the price only changed an_hour after i had booked and paid and surely the price i paid had to be honoured .
F	at this point he was very aggressive and i had to ask him numerous_times to stop shouting at me .
F	at first i thought it was a hoax call , maybe somebody trying to get my to disclose my card_details over the phone as the guy didn ' t even know the details of my booking .
F	he told me it was for 0 adults and 0 child , when it was in fact for 0 adults , 0 child and 0 infant .
F	he only knew the flight was to the usa and didn ' t know the dates of travel .
F	i was on the phone for 00_minutes trying to understand what was going on as he was talking very fast and kept putting me on hold claiming that he was ' looking for a good deal for me '.
F	i told him in the end that i just wanted a refund as i was unhappy to deal with his company .
F	i also asked why it had took them a week since i had booked to contact me , to which he replied he had been off sick .
F	he told me that the money would be refunded to my card in 0 working_days .
F	that was 00th_march .
F	i emailed him directly on 0th_april and submitted a web enquiry form asking about my refund .
F	he completely_ignored my email and despite getting an_automated email_saying 00 percent of emails are responded to within 00_hours , i am still_awaiting a reply .
F	i rang again on 0th_april ( as it had been easter bank_holiday in between ) as the money had still not been refunded .
F	he told me it would be in by 0th_april .
F	0th_april i rang again to be told another 0 working_days .
F	friday 00th_april i rang again to be told it would be today .
F	i looked up details to complain on the company website and it says that in emergencies to contact mr . ken or mr . sam and provides mobile numbers .
F	the first mobile number for mr . sam rang out and whoever answered told me i had the wrong number .
F	the second number for mr . ken was indeed him .
F	i explained my problem and he told me he would call me back - this was last friday 00th_april .
F	i am still_waiting for his call .
F	i am worried sick i will not get the money back as it has now been just short of a month and it is over £ 0000 .
F	i can ' t book anymore flights until i get the money back and at this rate the flights are going to be that expensive that we won ' t be able to go .
F	i ordered a bottle of lulu just before_christmas and it arrived within a couple of days and was well_packaged .
F	would definitely_recommend and use again .
F	booked in for a suitable day and time very easily .
F	the driver was running_late due to van issues so i was called to be to informed , however he still turned_up within the allotted time - scale .
F	it was so much_quicker_than visiting a garage and i would definitely use again .
F	i had 0 or 0 quotes for roman_blinds for 0 windows .
F	the quote from hilarys was very similar to the other quotes we obtained from local companies so we decided to proceed with them for peace of mind with guarantees and quality etc .
F	the staff that came to the property to measure up , quote and then fit the blinds were very polite , knowledgeable and friendly .
F	i would definitely use them again .
F	i like that there is a variety of items to purchase at sima .
F	the prices tend to be lower_than other_places and i especially like the ' home ' section .
F	i have used magic_madhouse a couple of times now and dispatch and delivery is always quick , and products are always top_notch !
F	the loyalty_scheme is also a brilliant bonus .
F	00 / 00 would use again :_p
F	i had a little trouble with another retailer taking my money and then informing_me the items i had ordered were out of stock for 0 - 0 weeks , so i got a refund from them and happened upon fitness superstore in my search for a replacement .
F	i initially emailed to inquire about the stock_availability of a few items , and received a reply nice and quickly from a fella called chris .
F	the items i was interested in were all in stock , and for being a first time customer he gave me £_00 off my order .
F	i called to make the order on saturday ( 0th ) afternoon and everything arrived nice and early this morning ( wednesday 00th ).
F	i got a call from the delivery driver 00_mins before delivery and he was very helpful in placing the pallet as close to my garage as possible .
F	i have just finished putting everything together and it is all perfect =]
F	the customer_service i received was second to none , both through email and telephone .
F	i didn ' t get to speak to the man who sorted everything out through email for me , but the guy who took my order over the phone was very helpful and friendly .
F	i will be shopping here again =]
F	i got my phone valued on the monday got my envelope to post it on the tuesday which i did that afternoon got a confirmation e mail on the wednesday and as i chose a bank_transfer got my money in my bank that day absolutely_brilliant service !!!
F	!
F	always buy my cosmetic products from here they are cheaper_than most places and always have great customer_service , never buy from anywhere_else for hair care / makeup / perfumes or anything .
F	love it !
F	!
F	love this website to get all the best info on offers , always search here beofre selling my mobile as they show you the best price :) !
F	love these hair_extensions !
F	i bought a full set of clip in hair_extensions for £_00 and are really thick and full , i purchased through there site but i did ring them to confirm which colour would be right , i sent them a pic through an_email and they recommend a mixed colour to me , when i received them they matched perfectly !
F	i have now had them for about three months and are still going strong !
F	love love love them !
F	wouldn ' t be without them now !
F	!
F	i booked our_wedding_band ' the hijackers ' through warble entertainment , and the whole_process was so straightforward .
F	the website is modern , eyecatchy and easy to navigate , and find exactly the type of entertainment you require .
F	we found a few bands we liked and then sent an enquiry to warble to find out if they were available and get a quote .
F	within a day they ' d email me the info , and a booking form , and when i phoned up to make payment the call was answered_quickly by a friendly bloke who didn ' t sound like a monotone machine !
F	once the booking was done , i just had to sit and wait for the band to call me , which they did 0 weeks before the wedding .
F	they then discussed everything we ( and they ) needed to know about the day , and emailed me a copy of the set list they ' d be playing on the night .
F	it was all so easy , i thought at one point it was too good to be true !
F	but no , it really was all perfect , and the band were amazing !
F	i ' d definitely make warble my first stop now if i ever need to hire another band or any other sort of act .
F	i ' d recommend them to all my friends too ... infact , i already have told 0 of my friends who have future weddings the warble entertainment website address !
F	thanks so much for everything .

F	i had never even heard of jacinabox a month_ago .
F	i came_across it when i was searching for a bigjigs train set and was comparing_prices on many websites .
F	jacinabox was £_00 - 00 cheaper_than everywhere_else so i thought i ' d give it a go , although i was a bit_dubious ....
F	i needn ' t have been !!....
F	i got an_email to confirm my order and another to say it ' d been dispatched , and the next morning i received a text_message to say that my order would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
F	this wasn ' t quite convenient for me , so all i had to do was reply to request delivery the day after .
F	the next morning came and i received another text_saying delivery would be between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
F	it turned_up at 0 . 00 !!
F	absolutely fantastic !
F	i ' ve never known a company that gives you an_hour_timeslot ( its usually atleast a 0 - hour one !!
F	), and to also come during the quoted timeslot is almost unheard of !!
F	the package was also wrapped well with lots of large ' air - bubble ' padding .
F	i liked the service so much i have since ordered 0 more things from jacinabox , which were just little things so they came via_royal_mail , but still just as good and quick , it just meant i didnt get the text_message or the timed delivery .
F	i ' d recommend this company to everyone .
F	i had an excellent experience in selling my first gen ipad .
F	i was paid in my account the full money as what i was estimated .
F	it took just 0 days for the credit to happen and their customer_service promptly emailed me the status on once they received my post .
F	i ordered a dab radio from them .
F	i got a confirmation_email , an_email on despatch and product arrived in perfect_condition as_described .
F	we had to leave spain in a hurry and steve made his bid , i asked him if he could collect asap so we could get a earlier ferry , he left his home and come to us in a drop of a hat .
F	him and his dad turned_up and they were spot on time , super friendly but still very professional .
F	we was going through a stressful time and a big move and these_guys made it a hell of a lot_easier , they had great communication skills the whole way and i have just met them at the drop_off point in the uk , everything was just as it was when we packed it , they had taken great care of everything .
F	we are so grateful to these_guys .
F	would highly_recommend to anybody and would use them again with out a doubt .
F	0 star service 0 star guys .
F	amy & lee

F	hen_heaven was a great company to deal with when booking my friends hen_weekend , helpful and efficient !
F	the dirty_dancing experience was so much fun !
F	we are even performing the routine we learnt at her wedding !
F	kathryn the dance instructor was fab and friendly !
F	hotel was lovely and we all enjoyed the all you can eat breakfast to help cure our hangovers !
F	was fab would definately_reccomend again !
F	ordered some jasmine beckett griffith canvas_prints .
F	they were of beautiful quality and am sooo happy with my order .
F	i live in australia and hoped they wouldn ' t take to long to get here from america , which they didn ' t , fast post & great communication regarding when they would be sent ...
F	overall very happy with my purchase and as i said earlier , will_definitely be buying from zazzle again :_d one very happy customer here !
F	beautycow was recommended to me by a friend and i wasnt disappointed recently ordered the ghd air chraper prices and fast delivery i would recommend this site to everyone
F	never_experienced such bad service in my life !
F	my friend ordered a package on river_island for my birthday , i live in the us , they live in england .
F	this was scheduled to arrive the day of my birthday 00th_may .
F	no sign of it .
F	still no sign for the next 0 days , and then my friend rings up , they decide to then tell us we have to pay duty on the items ordered , apparently it ' s in the small_print ... why wasn ' t it made clear so that the package wouldn ' t be held up ?
F	no one informed us it was even held up .
F	when asked what would have happened had this not been paid we are informed that it would have just been sent back to the uk .
F	i think it is completely appauling that they didn ' t tell us this !
F	why would they not make this clear and let us pay when we pay for delivery ???
F	how were we supposed to pay it if we simply weren ' t told about the charge , and not told how to pay the charge .
F	this is a $_00 charge for tax too which i think it a bit much on top of delivery , especially since they are gifts .
F	i have not had this problem with any other packages i have recieved from england in the year i have been here .
F	they tell us on the phone if we supply an e_- mail address and telephone_number they will contact us shortly to tell us how to pay this charge ...
F	i get an e_- mail saying the request has been acknowledged at 00am yesterday telling_me i should get an e_- mail in the next 00_hours ... well its 0pm now and still no e_- mail , and still no package .
F	i am stunned at how badly this has been handled and i still_haven ' t got my birthday_present .
F	it ' s hard enough being away from home on your birthday without the added hassle of trying to contact a company to get my package released with barely anyway to contact !
F	i have never been more stressed out by a company in my life .
F	i think it ' s ridiculous that we have to pay a $_00 charge in the first place , but am willing to pay it , yet they should make this clear at the point of purchace and they should give a clear way to pay it ... how are you supposed to pay a fee to get a package released if you are not told how and when to pay it ?
F	i would definitely_recommend this shop to anyone .
F	gave me a fair price for my phones , reviewed them straight_away and sent payment very fast .
F	no bad points at all !
F	loved it !
F	:)
F	i was extremely happy with the service i received from start to finish , from sending emails to talking on the phone with staff , everything was so efficient .
F	when the items were due to be delivered i had a phone call the day before to confirm , and also on the day the delivery was due .
F	the guys who delivered the furniture were very professional and pleasant .
F	overall my experience with the furnituremarket has been great and i would not hesitate in recommending them and will_definitely use them in future .
F	studio sent an_email_saying parcel dispatched , a hermes tracking_number and expect 0 - 0 days .
F	it is now 0 days_later absolutely nothing and to make it worse they conveniently cannot offer an explanation - you need to contact the sender who has to contact them in turn !!!!
F	shut them down very incompetent
F	its always a pleasure to deal with tracey and the crew at market harborough .
F	nothing is too much_trouble and they always seem to come up with a great deal on printing .
F	proofs get done and sent back for checking as and when promised .
F	thanks for all your help yet again .
F	ordered a part , spoke to helpful gentleman to make_sure i had the correct part , ordered on line very simple .
F	part arrived when they said it would , got it fitted the next_day and all worked_fine .
F	great saving !!
F	thanks
F	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else for my diy eliquid supplies , there are other_places that do similar sounding products , but the quality just isn ' t there , liberty_flights offer more_than any of the other so called ' reputable ' sellers on the web , their delivery is second to none , eventheir most inexpensive shipping_costs are really good value with nothing taking more_than a few_days to arrive , i think the longest i have had to wait was about 0 days and that was because i waited until about 0pm to make my order ....
F	i really couldnt be_happier with the products that i have bought .
F	i have tried other so called ' reputable ' companies , but the depth of flavour and the prices just can ' t be_beaten at liberty_flights , and i ave found that i have to wait longer for my order and when i have received it they just didnt have the same quality ... my favourite flavour is strawberry and lime which i bought as a pre mixed eliquid first to try and now make it for myself .
F	i never would have tried miing my own liquids without the in depth tutorials on the site which have saved me even more money in the long run .
F	i haven ' t smoked a ' real ' cigarette in over 00 months now and i will never look back .
F	liberty_flights offer a great , fair and economical service and it really does pay to use them over cheaper brands because the quality is second to none .
F	i recommend your products to all my friends who are looking for an_alternative to smoking cigarettes and everyone who i have sent in your direction hasn ' t looked back either ...
F	thank_you !
F	i had no_problems sorting_out the necessary customs paperwork , the instructions on the website were perfect and easy to follow and getting my parcel sent off was easy as anything ...
F	the ups collection guy was really friendly , helpful and cheerful and i couldnt_believe it when the parcl i posted on wednesday_morning in england , arrived in the post to massechusets on friday_morning !
F	unbelievable quick service and a really reasonable_price too :)
F	adzuna has the most convenient user - friendly design .
F	it helps to look for a job , see what is going on in the market , compares offers and salaries .
F	it also aggregates job offers from other resources so you can find all options in one place .
F	strongly_recommend !
F	thanks , i got everything i wanted , reasonable priced and within a few_days .
F	thank_you .
F	i do love ordering from their site as i have never_experienced any_issues what so ever !
F	so everything was great sending my stuff i ordered back as the sizes were completely wrong .
F	and then this saga with my refund started .
F	i still_haven ' t received it and the customer_service representative i ' m talking to keeps sending me to my bank as she is not available to deal with the matter as they are saying that my money is refunded .
F	so i went to my bank and they told me to go back to the online_retailer as the refund hasn ' t been returned !
F	and now im emailing with boohoo and they are utterly_useless and making excuses in refunding my money and giving me id numbers which my bank can ' t use .
F	hope this is a warning as sometimes it ' s better to spend more money in similar_sites like asos as they better in the end !
F	do not recommend !
F	i can not really fault boohoo in the slightest , the only only problem i found that their sizing can differ however for clothes so affordable you cant really complain .
F	if you have a problem they will sort it out for you as soon as possible and with no_fuss .
F	definitely shopping with boohoo more often and spreading the word .
F	well what can i say about shoetique .
F	the shop itself is lovely , the website is great and the staff are helpful , friendly and very co - operative .
F	i have ordered many_times fro this store and they have even specifially ordered shoes in that i wanted .
F	they are always helpful and kind and explain if something is amiss be it deliveries have gone wrong , shoes havnt arrived , stock has sold out quicker_than usual and they will get what you want out to you a . s . a . p .
F	it is nice to have a company that are friendly and willing to help you no matter what .
F	unlike a number of companies now - a - days .
F	i couldnt recommend a better shop , and they certainly know their stuff too .
F	and after_reading comments on here i will say some people need to get a life and stop being so pathetic and childish , find something better to do than critise a shop day and night .
F	and out of a gesture of good will you should never refuse a free pair of shoes .
F	most companies would have given you jack all and told you to sod off .
F	grow up .
F	i ' ve used play . com for years .
F	it ' s usually the first site i go to when i ' m after dvd ' s cd ' s and games .
F	it ' s usually always the cheapest .
F	i ' ve bought electricals and toys from them too and again no_problems and always been bargains against other companys !
F	happy customer and will_continue to use in the future .
F	0_stars for jacinabox .
F	they use a courier service who e_- mail and text you to let you know the 0 hour delivery slot when they will deliver your parcel which is fab !
F	i found the prices to be very competitive and plenty of choice .
F	i have now finished buying all my daughters christmas_presents ( i know , i ' m a bit early !)
F	but i would not hesitate to use this company again , in fact , i ' m going to bookmark them under my ' toy sites ' bookmark !
F	i have been ordering my contact_lenses from contactlenses . co . uk since a few_years and never had any trouble !
F	it literally takes couple of days for the parcels to arrive ( every time !).
F	highly_recommended !
F	you just gained another happy customer :)
F	setting_up the broadband was a nightmare !
F	the first order did not go through and none of the talktalk customer support representatives seemed to be bothered to contact me and let me know .
F	so , i call them again after 0 weeks to check what ' s going on , my order is late .
F	the order ( for some unknown_reason ) was cancelled .
F	then , i put a new order through , the broadband supposed to be running within 0 weeks .
F	it didn ' t .
F	again , i had to call them and figure_out what is going on .
F	the answer was : ' due to technical problem , your broadband will be activated within 0 weeks '.
F	i spent hours on the phone with them , i had to explain the same story all over and over again .
F	the managers didn ' t call back , as promised etc .
F	in total , i had to wait over 0 months to get the broadband active !
F	i do not recommend talktalk to anyone .
F	it ' s been a very bad_experience .
F	the products i ordered ( large planter and stand ) were delivered quickly , well_packed and in excellent condition .
F	i use hostelbookers because it ' s much_easier and better laid_out than other hostel booking sites on the internet .
F	it ' s also great that you only have to pay 00_% of the cost at booking , rather_than all of it .
F	i also like the great offers that they have on hostels , always cutting the prices .
F	i use it every time i book a hostel !
F	all online and every piece of information is readily_available - i highly_recommend this company and always book through them !
F	i bought an item as a christmas_present from the white company online - they incidentally are great but yodel . com is atrocious !
F	i waited in for my delivery and stood at the window as the timeframe they gave me had long since come and gone ...
F	i watched the van pull up , a man get out and not even bother to get a parcel out .
F	he wrote something on a card and walked up to the door .
F	i was in plain sight of the man and so there is no excuse for him thinking no one was home ,.
F	he didn ' t even knock / ring the doorbell !
F	he put the card through the letterbox and walked_away - i raced out the door and asked him why he was leaving without even knocking - he looked at me , shrugged and said he thought iw asn ' t in ... he then got in the van and drove off again !
F	why exactly is this happening ?
F	i ended_up receiving my item ( which had been purchased at the end of november ) in early january - too_late to give to my aunt who i had bought it for !
F	when i did finally get the package the state of it was an_absolute_disgrace !
F	the packaging was hanging open - the bubble_wrap was near non_existent with how much it had burst in transit and the delivery sheet that for some reason was left with the item showed about 00 different touch pioints where it had been back and forth without going anywhere_near my home address !!!!
F	on top of this they left it on the wrong day in the wrong place ( i hd left delivery instructions to leave it in the left hand garage ) where they left it in the left had side of the step by the door - in the rain - it ruined the packaging of the item even further !
F	this company is an_absolute shambles and someone really needs to shut it down as it gives other delivery companies a bad name !
F	yodel . com - take noe please !
F	i was looking for a product online and randomly selected supplementwarehouse . com because the low price stood out to me .
F	after finding all of the items that i needed in stock ( which took less_than 0 minutes because of their organized site navigation ) i was greeted with another surprise .
F	they were going to match the lowest_price from any other online store !
F	that ' s what you call quality service .
F	i used to shop at bodybuilding . com for all of my purchases , but from now on , you can always find me shopping on supplementwarehouse . com .
F	thank_you for a pleasant_experience !
F	we will meet again soon and when we do , i will be buff and get great discounts !
F	i ' m really pleased with my new piano stool and was surprised to see that it arrived the very next_day .
F	i writing to tell you how delighted i am with my purchase of a ring , i expected good quality and thats what i got , it is really a very beautiful ring very well_packaged and excellent service .
F	i will_definately_recommend you to all my friends and family .
F	i wish you all a very merry_christmas and a happy new year .
F	this is my first time to use supplementwarehouse . com , but already i am sold on them .
F	i have tried to use other_sites to get the things i need for my cleaning business and have had less then stellar experiences .
F	one company kept me waiting for 0 months , only to cancel my order .
F	needless to say , the prompt service i received from sw . com has me thrilled .
F	thank_you , sw . com , for making a believer out of me !
F	i ordered the kyocera printer for the office and it was delivered next_day after we placed an order .
F	the printer was cheaper_than on many other_websites .
F	i also looked at the prices of replacement toners and they have competitive_prices as well .
F	i would recommend printerland . co . uk to everybody that needs new printer
F	at the moment i currently live in melbourne australia , im on a holiday working visa for 0 years .
F	i had recently run out of my conceptive pill , and found they did not stock my brand here , it was awful i really didn ' t want to switch brands as im so happy .
F	i had been searching for some one to supply me with my pills here but all failed .
F	so i decided to look on google uk and healthexpress came up i thought i would give it ago i had nothing to lose !
F	all i can say is they have been amazing i had a query about my package in the post as i live in a block of flats they responded to me within hours and gave me a solution in case i wasn ' t in .
F	the products are perfect and just what i ordered and best of all the service is fast .
F	they have take the stress away and i know i can reordered as and when i need .
F	if your worried don ' t be , im so impressed !
F	ordered one cartridge and it had not arrived .
F	cannot get through on the phone .
F	nearly a week after i placed the order i get an_email to say it is out of stock and no dates as to when they will be delivering it .
F	currently listening to their terrible on hold music and american accents .
F	i cannot get through to them to cancel the order .
F	i run a small children ' s theatre club on a shoestring and i need the printer ink .
F	i am furious .
F	i wish i had read the reviews on here .
F	overall very impressed with the quality and speed of service , i ' d definitely shop from here again .
F	the prices are also excellent so i ' m very impressed .
F	they took my money but never delivered .
F	they have not replied to my emails and do not answer their phones !!
F	!
F	i love hostelbookers !
F	it makes trip planning really easy !
F	this is amazing solution for locked_iphone this id awsome this sevice is thr best
F	i have been shopping from supplement_warehouse and have enjoyed doing my buisness with them and will_continue to order all my supps from them .
F	fast delivery and always excellent customer_service .
F	thank_you sw !
F	0 )
F	sent an important item by special delivery by 0pm on 00 / 00 , by 00 / 00 they still had not received it .
F	i phoned royal_mail and there excuse was poor apparently it was a problem with tracking but this was a lie as the customer confirmed they hadn ' t received it .
F	i asked over the phone can i claim for this then - she asked why ??
F	why i said - because i sent on a special delivery by 0pm on 00 / 00 and they still_haven ' t received by 00 / 00 - is it not obvious why i want to claim !?
F	they didn ' t apologise once and i was told to go to the post_office to get a claim_form - isn ' t it easier to claim online i said ?
F	rm prices are frankly ridiculous , i can send via courier which guarantee my delivery for next_day for the same price - what is the point in royal_mail anymore ?
F	their prices keep increasing but the service does not improve so why pay them for a sub_standard service when you can pay couriers for a much_better service and guaranteed reimbursement if lost of damaged during_transit .
F	i am hugely disappointed once again with rm and will not use them again except for unimportant letters only .
F	i started using wtg nearly a month_ago now and i am so happy with them !
F	i am gradually & continually loosing weight , i lost 0lbs in my first week and was overjoyed !
F	they have various offers available which are great for a tight_budget like mine ( this is the reason i first tried them ).
F	the delivery is next_day so you can start straight_away - no excuses for not loosing those extra pounds .
F	the food is really good - believe me i have tried many diets to your door and these are one of the best for a reasonable_price .
F	i did diet_chef last_year which has great food / menu choice but it is pricey so i ' d choose wtg over them for that reason .
F	the shakes are fab , if you are able to use a blender and a few ice cubes you ' ll love them .
F	the soups are really nice , they taste fresh and it ' s something to warm you up on these gloomy afternoons , i really love the mushroom soup .
F	the evening meals are really good , you get a good amount and you ' re not left feeling starved - they are proper meals .
F	sometimes i add a bit of veg to my evening_meal if i ' m feeling particularly hungry but you only need a bit , the meals are substantial .
F	the snack bars are tasty ( especially choc and peanut ) and fill the gap so there ' s no excuses to be sneaking into the biscuit tin .
F	one last thing i must point out is wtg ' s customer care - if you have any_problems with your order or have any_questions_regarding the plan just give them a call or an_email ( which can be found easily on their website ) and they ' ll respond asap , they ' re really friendly and helpful and i can ' t thank them enough , i think you ' re lovely wtg !
F	once again i am super happy with northern_parrots .
F	i love their range of toys and the website makes it so easy to find toys specifically designed to cater for your species of bird .
F	delivery options are really good - i ordered next_day before 00pm and sure as anything my parcel arrived on time the next_day !
F	products are fab - my cag loves her northern_parrots products - toys and treats ( also buy her pellet food from here too ) and i can buy knowing the products are safe for my bird ..... as some companies that supply parrot toys do not specify if they are safe and the materials used .
F	a * northern_parrots - recommended !!
F	!
F	i have receaved a great service from cathrine from parcel0go today when arrangng collection of a parcel , she was able to give me great advice links and most of all put my mind at rest with the arrangements made thank_you
F	i ' ve been using p0g for a long time and never had a problem .
F	today i needed some extra info and sarah_hayes was happy to help me via chat .
F	would definitely_recommend them .
F	vgb has great prices .
F	i had pre_- ordered a game , which arrived a day late .
F	can put it down to royal_mail being slow though , as vgb sent the game on a thursday via 0st_class delivery .
F	if they posted on wednesdays when a game is out on a friday , they could make_sure people actually get their games on release day as royal_mail doesn ' t guarantee that 0st_class arrives the next_day .
F	:-)
F	one of the best online shops around .
F	i ' ve been using them for quite some time now .
F	they ' re always happy to answer questions .
F	the online trade in service they offer is great .
F	you can either get cash or account credit ( which is always more_than the cash amount obviously ).
F	when you order a game , it ' s usually sent out quickly and you ' ll be playing it a couple days after .
F	i keep recommending gx to friends and will_continue to do so .
F	;-)
F	was helped today by samantha who dealt_with my problem quickly and professionally .
F	she is an asset to the p0g team !
F	even_though the problem was completely my fault ( i booked a parcel in for collection on the wrong day , the deadline had passed and i needed same day collection ) - she sorted out for me in a matter of seconds !
F	after initially enquiring_about the nextbase stanchion mounts , i received a very quick answer to my question , prompting me to continue with my purchase from this site .
F	i received constant email_updates regarding the delivery until it arrived on time the next_day .
F	i was extremely impressed and happy with the after care service i received and will_definitely use 0wm again for my next gadget or tech purchases !
F	a very trustworthy and competitive company .
F	thanks to everyone who helped !
F	when i ordered i was bit_nervous whether it will b delay or do i get it , but it was arrived on time and i was quite surprised . so i would take this as a chance to thanks to barrington_sports for their excellent customer_service and i will always be a good customer for you guys .
F	cheers ,
F	mahesh
F	i accidentally booked the collection from the wrong_address - i thought it would be a pain to cancel and re - book this , although i went on tot he live_chat and [_name ] helped straight_away - 0 minutes and she had changed the address and sent new documentation through - thanks a lot !
F	*****
F	they have different currency options and the best filtering system out of the hotel / hostel internet sites .
F	it was easy to use and they have helpful information about each place .
F	with hostelbookers , it was easy for me to compare places to determine the best place to stay .
F	booking took 0 minutes and was very simple .
F	the first time i used hostelbookers , i messaged the hostel i booked to confirm that it went through , and they had my information right away .
F	i have never had a problem with them , and i haven ' t had a problem with any of the hostels , either .
F	on wednesday i paid for a courier to collect my parcel on the thursday .
F	the money was immediately taken from my account but no - one turned_up .
F	on friday i contacted via web chat and was told it would be ' escalated ' and someone would get back to me .
F	no response , so i messaged again on saturday was told it could take 00 - 00hours to get a response .
F	i waited 00hours and on sunday again messaged again - i was told it would be ' escalated '.
F	by monday_morning i was very annoyed and again queried why my parcel had not been collected and why no - one had actually bothered to respond to my query - and was told it would be escalated !
F	if it wasn ' t so annoying the poor customer care would actually be funny .
F	what use is a courier company that does not collect parcels ?!
F	and how can i trust it to actually deliver ?!
F	nope
F	bought as gift so did not use game myself , but it arrived quickly , well_packaged and the game was in original shrink wrapping - as was bought new .
F	all looks good :-)
F	great price on 0 bottles and delivered 0 days_later .
F	updates via text and email to let me know when to expect delivery .
F	excellent service .
F	when ryan_air cancelled my flight !
F	i then had to change my car_parking arrangements .
F	just sent a quick email and within a couple of hours i had my new parking confirmation - got an extra 00hours at no extra_cost and no booking_fees !
F	:-) booking was straight_forward and cheapest price around for my stay .
F	website was easy to use and to register with .
F	i made use of the sale and treat_myself to some gorgeous fit flops .
F	i am really please because it ' s very hard to find these shoes in size , colour , style i want anyway , never mind discounted !
F	:-)
F	although postage was delayed because of the bank_holiday weekend ( i ordered on saturday and still had them by tuesday !)
F	very pleased , will shop with again .
F	i was drawn to the glasses_direct website by their 0 - 0 - 0 offer , and free tinting !
F	so thought i ' d indulge in some prescription_sunglasses ...
F	i found it hard to decide on style from the pictures online , as glasses always look different when you put them on .
F	then i discovered their free home_trial service !
F	i chose my fave 0 pairs and they arrived within a few_days , free of charge !
F	i tried them on , choose the ones i wanted , went back online and ordered straight_away !
F	so quick , so easy and so convenient !
F	:-)
F	website is easy to navigate , had some excellent offers on large bags of dog_food and has a good selection of products .
F	order and payment process is quick and easy .
F	delivery from dispatch took 0 workings days so would probably order in plenty of time as i was a little close to the end of the current bag of dog_food when i ordered but we made it , came by fed_ex courier .
F	items all arrived in excellent condition and much to my cats delight there were a couple of bags of treats thrown in as an extra on top of our order .
F	this site is not as well_known as some of the others i have used for ordering my animal products online but i can thoroughly_recommend them and shall be happy to use them in the future , it is likely that i shall use them for both cat and dog_food and treats if purchasing to keep delivery costs down .
F	this is the 0th of 0th time i have used medic animal , we need a lot of items with a multitude of pets here :) medic animal allows me to use quality products on my pets without paying the inflated prices at the vets .
F	i ordered 0 items and paid through paypal .
F	i had a quick response from the company to explain that they no_longer had 0 of the items and that i had only been charged for one ( which i obviously checked and was right enough ).
F	fast postage and item was well_packaged .
F	highly_recommended !
F	!
F	i have used mp for over 0 years now and have always found the service from start to finish fantastic , however this year it has been horrendous , my last order i paid extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn ' t give me a tracking reference for it , eventually got the tracking reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
F	the items arrived on monday_afternoon and after a few mails i got them to refund the extra payment for next_day delivery as they had not delivered .
F	its such a shame as the products are fantastic but your only as good as the service you provide and this area is definately lacking recently .
F	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
F	fantastic service and excellent products reccomended by my nutritionist .
F	easy to manouvre website , superfast delivery and full contact details on the received invoice .
F	trustworthy professional company .
F	easy to go back and forth in between hostel pages , ( unlike hostelworld . com where i have to refresh my search everytime !)
F	love the reviews section as other_peoples opinions count towards the hostel i book .
F	having street view on the map page is seriously important too , especially booking in the amalfi coast i wanted a place that had a view of the water .
F	being_able to search for hotels / b_& bs as well as hostels makes my search time much_quicker and easier .
F	being a travelling couple it is often cheaper to get a b_& b private_room rather_than a hostel so thanks for giving us that search option !
F	only thing that makes it a little hard is having to print out our confirmation to show the hostel ... as access to a printer while travelling is kinda difficult .
F	very please with jacket i received for my son and he lives it too .
F	delivery was very prompt .
F	thank_you .
F	excellent value for money and always up on the latest trends .
F	my parcel was collected on 00 february .
F	that was the last time there was any recollection of my parcel .
F	it was not delivered or tracked and myhermes will not get police involved .
F	are they all in it together steeling goods .
F	stayed in villa tomeu in porto pollenca majorca for the third time , such a lovely villa in a perfect quiet spot close to all amenities and beach and now with added wi_-_fi what more could we ask for !!
F	already booked again for next year and can ' t wait to go back !!
F	!
F	a fabulous place to shop for all your special or unique drinks that you cannot buy in high_street shops !!!
F	!
F	i have used carterandbond before and have always had quick reliable service , my recent order was delivered the next_day and as always was great quality .
F	i had some real frustrations with the website , but all was resolved with daniel ' s solutions and efficiecy !
F	thank_you very much - good customer responsiveness goes a long way .
F	heather
F	i have been ordering from muscle_finesse for years , every since i got into weight_training 0 years_ago .
F	they have consistently offered the best prices , combined with fast ( and free !)
F	delivery , where i always receive my order the next working day .
F	their partnership with dpd is also great , so its easy to track my delivery , and make changes to the date if needed .
F	mf often have fantastic offers , particularly on usn which is my preferred brand .
F	they send great emails with great offers , and i consistently receive 00_%_off or more , which makes their prices even cheaper .
F	mf are always my first_port of call for products , whether its my regular buys or a new product .
F	i always recommend them to anyone who buys sports_nutrition and supplementation .
F	a one of a kind website with really reasonable prices .
F	a real wide_range of products with different choices of styles and colours .
F	i ' ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade ..
F	happy happy happy
F	:))))))))))))))))))
F	booked a hen_weekend in newcastle with chilisauce .
F	they catered to our needs to make_sure that we were given the best service and activities for a good night out .
F	the girls and i had such a blast with some good memories .
F	thanks for a fun and eventful weekend !
F	:)
F	i have had many many issues with my previous host and received very cold customer_service in the past , but my experience with lcn and their service puts them above all hosts i have used over the years .
F	i am so happy to be using their services and to be a part of their customer circles , as their service is clear and friendly , their staff go out of their way to give all of the help they possibly can and more and they do it all with out treating you like a simply bank_account and customer number .
F	warm welcoming service every phone call and very patient staff who know what they are doing !
F	they have a clear and easy to use service and for great prices for what you get especially with the 00hr help on hand too !
F	they have really taken all of my woes and headaches with my website away completely !
F	i highly_recommend them to any thinking to move hosts and want a friendly coherent service with great customer_service and tech - support !
F	i ' ve traveled extensively using hostelbookers and have never yet had a bad_experience with them .
F	the website is easy to use and regularly offers cheaper prices than competitors hostels . com and hostelworld .
F	moreover , hostelbookers almost always has more hostels to suggest for any given city .
F	and because more people use this website , the ratings are always a lot more trustworthy .
F	think about it - the more people that rate a hostel , the more inclusive and accurate the rating will be .
F	so to sum hostelbookers up : easy to navigate , easy to read , completely trustworthy , and ahead of the competition in every way .
F	definitely use this website !
F	you can ' t beat it .
F	i was a bit_skeptical of the " design today , wear tomorrow " slogan that streetshirts advertises with , but much to my surprise , it was totally true .
F	the site was easily designed - and very prettily as well , if i do say so - so that i was able to make my design and submit the order all within one day .
F	and sure enough , the next_day , my shirt was at my doorstep , ready for wear .
F	fast service , easily navigable site , and reasonable prices !
F	couldn ' t have asked for a better experience , as far as i ' m concerned .
F	my iphone was unlocked in the time span it was announced and now i can fully go on with my day !
F	this was way worth the purchase !
F	thank_you !!
F	!
F	information is concise but very complete ! the site is convenient to use !
F	!
F	online learning works for me , i was able to fit my studies in around jobs at home and looking after our son .
F	the course was detailed and well written , i took notes along the way and made sure i learned something as well as doing the assessment at the end .
F	telephone support was helpful , as was the messaging .
F	i will_definitely do another course with yourselves and would be quite happy to recommend trust_pilot to others .
F	awfull is to good for this company been with for a little while was ok at very start then went from bad to worse last time my broadband went down took me a whole day of ringing this number and that number as kept getting through to the wrong person apparently untill i told them that that months bill was not getting paid guess_what they could help me then amazing never again rather go with out home phone / broadband then go near these again
F	it ' s like hotels . com but for backpackers !
F	it has every city that i want to travel to so i don ' t have to search around for a different site .
F	i do wish i could have paid the total for my hostel online instead of paying cash when i arrive , but i ' m_assuming that ' s something to take up with the hostel itself .
F	i love cheapsmells , they always offer fantastic service , products arrive promptly and always cheaper_than other stores
F	i love this site , always a brilliant range of products which are usually cheaper_than on the high_street .
F	delivery is always super_speedy - even without the next_day delivery !.
F	ordered my groceries late friday , found a delivery availablefor saturday at 0 pm .
F	driver came 0 mins late and apologised for the delay due to traffic , tesco send me a text advising me about that .
F	few items were not available and on 0 item i was offered a substitute , the driver advised me about that .
F	he checked my eggs with me , allowing me to know that is they were broken i would have had a full_refund .
F	i had 0 bottle of water broken , he noted that and told me i ' ll have it refunded .
F	the driver was polite , gentle and carried my 0 crates into the kitcken , helping me unload my bags .
F	as a first buyer i used a 00 pound online discount_voucher , so im super happy .
F	i ve ordered frozen_food , as well as fridge food and vegetables .
F	all was as if i just purchased it from store myself , with the only difference that i dont need to kill myself carrying all the bags :))
F	providing a great service along with awesome features is one thing but having the right people to support you throughout the way is something that i particularly look for when i seek to use services from a service provider .
F	soho00 ticks both boxes and has given us a peace of mind for the past 0 . 0 years since we started using them .
F	ordered from very easy to use website and product arrived 0 days_later !
F	very happy with the price and the quick service !
F	!
F	was recommended to me by a friend and i was definitely not disappointed (: great service and really fast response .
F	i asked if they could refund me a paypal echeque payment and they got back to me within 00_minutes so i could sort out an_alternative quickly .
F	really happy and great job , would definitely_recommend ,
F	easy to use , no booking_fee .
F	great site !
F	have used before and will_definitely be using again .
F	i get all my supplements from supplement_warehouse .
F	i pay half what i would at gnc ( even with shipping ) and you can pick a bunch of free_samples and other free things with your order , so that ' s always fun .
F	i can get vitamins super cheap and then it comes in just a couple of days .
F	i ' ve even tried to compare competitors prices ( to get the lower_price ) and i have yet to find anyone who sells their products cheaper_than supplement_warehouse .
F	i tell everyone i know that they should order from them .
F	with a camping holiday fast approaching i have been ordering various items from online stores .
F	i had ordered a suncamp electric hookup from another store and it arrived badly_damaged and so i called to complain to get nothing but a very unhelpful and rude conversation amounting to nothing more_than " there ' s nothing we can do for you "!
F	this is a battle i ' m still fighting !
F	!
F	i had submitted an order to taunton_leisure the previous day for an outwell coolbox and thought that i ' d try my luck to see if i could get another hookup delivered before i go and so submitted an order with taunton_leisure online .
F	after_placing the order i saw on their wonderful website that i could call to discuss an order .
F	i rang and spoke to an extreemely polite and helpful man ( called darryl ?)
F	and explained my predicament .
F	he advised that he would call me back after looking in to my situation .
F	within minutes the phone rang and i was advised that my coolbox had been retrieved from the orders waiting for dispatch and that he would now package my electric hookup with the coolbox and send them both on next_day delivery for no extra charge !!
F	the items have arrived this morning as promised and are well_packaged and in perfect_condition ready for my holiday tomorrow !
F	thank_you so much for your amazing customer_service - i won ' t be going to any other store from now on !
F	!
F	since i was 0 when i was diagnosed with chronic eczema i have found it hard to find products that don ' t cause embarrassing rashes all over my neck .
F	i have tried so many cleansers boasting to be all natural that i have then had a reaction .
F	cleanse and polish is truly exceptional
F	i had no_problems with this they were very fast and every thing was great
F	i would like to say my experience with personal_injury assist has been excellent they have kept me updated with claim , i would like to say thank_you to everyone at personal_injury assist and would recommend to anyone to go with these_guys they really know what they are doing , naheed kazmi
F	i made a booking today with bravofly .
F	there was a website error and i had to re - book the flight and unfortunately resulted_in a wrong date .
F	when i contacted customer_service 0 minutes later , they took no responsibility at all for their error , and informed me that there was no option to cancel the flight and straightaway demanded extra to change the flight date .
F	i reluctantly_accepted what they said and asked them how much was the extra fee to do this .
F	they said they would come back , but then emailed saying they made attempts to call me which is totally untrue .
F	there were no missed calls on my line .
F	they gave this as a reason as to why they cannot proceed to re - arrange the dates .
F	i called them again for assistance and clarification but they could not give me any news from the airline ; and it seems apparent that they have not even forwarded my request for a date change .
F	i offered to contact the airline direct with the date change but they refused to let me do this .
F	the whole affair looks very suspicious to me , as every day they delay changing my dates means a higher price on my ticket !
F	!
F	to add_insult to the injury it may mean additional_costs for technical_error , through no fault of my own , as i can see other customers have been charged extra costs , and i will check my account to make_sure they do not do this .
F	if zero_stars were possible , i would have given this !!
F	!
F	unhappy customer
F	very easy booking process and very efficient when you arrive !
F	great price , no_complaints , quick easy and helpful
F	ordered a ds game for my son on the day of it ' s release in the afternoon and received it in the post the following_morning , much to his delight and the cheapest price too .
F	have used this site twice and wouldn ' t hesitate to use again .
F	good prices and easy to print postage label , took to the post_office and had an e_- mail acknowledging receipt the next_day .
F	payment direct to my bank the day after , and best of all cleared some clutter .
F	can ' t recommend highly_enough .
F	easy to use and very informative , fast confirmation too .
F	ordered late sunday_night and my order arrived mid afternoon on tuesday , which considering i chose free delivery , is very efficient !
F	will_definitely_recommend to others in my club !
F	this is my first display case i have ordered and was lucky_enough to do another search on the net whilst nearly checking out on another site .
F	good job i done another search and came_across this site as this display case is clean cut and smooth and nicely finished .
F	the price was better_than i had seen elsewhere too .
F	will be ordering another soon for next project but a custom job .

F	hampshire .
F	we got the new_york pass for our first trip to the city .
F	it was really useful because it was paid for before we took the trip so it was nice not to have to think of admission prices on arrival .
F	it got us into all the big attractions and even worked out cheaper_than paying as you go .
F	the book that came with the pass was also so helpful for discounts and information on all of the attractions .
F	the queue jumping was also a big bonus !
F	saved us lots of time waiting !
F	great little pass !
F	absolutely great service & such friendly staff .
F	amazing value for your money & everything arrived the way i ' d sent it .
F	might have to move away after uni just to use this service haha .
F	hats_off to you guys , great job .
F	i ' ve used hostelbookers for the past 0 years and have not once had a problem .
F	i ' ve travelled throughout europe , africa , usa and hostelbookers was always my choice of booking company .
F	hostelbookers prices are generally cheaper_than the other_companies and there are no_hidden_fees etc .
F	i will_continue to use hostelbookers until i get too old for hostels .
F	very efficient service !!
F	would recommend and definitely use again !
F	really impressed with the quality of the goods i purchased and the 00yr guarantee
F	i posted a review on review centre which the company i reviewed requested be removed .
F	review centre contacted me and asked me to provide my name and address to prove i was a customer which i did straight_away .
F	the next_day they contacted me again requesting further information ( which i don ' t know why they didn ' t ask at the same time as their previous email ).
F	i couldn ' t provide concrete evidence as most of the conduct with the company was over the telephone so i provided my telephone records to show how much contact i had had to have with the company in question .
F	it is now 00_hours_later and despite chasing them advising i had been threatened with legal_action by the company in question , they have still not responded and my review is still not on the website .
F	whilst i understand that review centre do have to verify your custom , i unsure why they feel they have to go to these lengths to investigate especially when a review is not illegal and i have checked with my lawyer to make_sure the content is fair and reasonable .
F	i had all windows replaced earlier this year and everything was fine .
F	the installation people were very friendly and accommodating .
F	recently , two windows in separate rooms failed to work so i called supaglazing to arrange an_appointment .
F	two engineers visited on two_separate_occasions and diagnosed different issues however , the issue was not resolved until the third visit .
F	i waited in on one_occasion for an engineer who failed to turn_up .
F	i called the office the following_day to advise them of this and spoke to a gentleman who was adamant he had called my land_line to advise that the engineer couldn ' t attend .
F	when i said i hadn ' t had a call from him , his tone changed and he became what i can only describe as aggressive accusing me of calling him a liar .
F	he raised his voice and eventually hung_up leaving me completely dismayed that a client could be spoken to in such a way .
F	telephoned the office daily requesting an_apology which i am still_waiting for after 0 days .
F	no one has called me back .
F	windows are average , customer_service is terrible so avoid if you want a good all_round service .
F	i ordered for next_day delivery , quick and easy to use service .
F	no_hidden_fees .
F	great communication all the way through from order to delivery .
F	would recommend .
F	mazuma were to be frank , absolutely_brilliant .
F	within 0 days of the initial sale online i had my money in my account .
F	i had no_problems at all with them , i was sent a postage pack the next_day , i posted my phone and 0 days_later i was sent the cash straight into my bank_account .
F	mazuma offered me the most money for my old phone , a blackberry 0000 .
F	everywhere_else ( pawn shops etc ) were only offering my £_00 .
F	i would definitely_recommend this service to anyone_wanting to sell an old phone .
F	unless it is in perfect_condition where ebay is an option , mazuma is brilliant .
F	always very quick and effecient service , if the restaurant ever gives me any_problems hungryhouse have refunded me or in the case of one of the delivery men who was harassing me and calling me on the number i provided hungryhouse took them down off of the site and spoke to the manager to prevent the delivery man from calling me further .
F	they really do go beyond being just a place to order food , they really value their customers
F	i sent in an old phone to mazuma and it was quoted at £ 0 because it was very old but i wanted it to be recycled and put towards a good cause rather_than me throwing it in the bin .
F	i requested the freepost_bag and 0 or 0 days_later it arrived swiftly in the post and i packaged the phone safely along with its paperwork and sent it back to mazuma .
F	two days_later i received confirmation that the phone had been processed and received .
F	very fast and effecient service and i am very pleased with how effectively the whole setup worked .
F	will_definitely be using again in the future .
F	beauty_bay were exceptional with their quick service and i was also greeted with a quick delivery .
F	the product i bought came all in tact and the cherry on top was that it was on offer .
F	would definitly recommend and myself will order again ( i have a huge wishlist on their newly wishlist gadget online ).
F	i ordered 0 bouquets to give out to the mothers on my wedding day .
F	they weren ' t the cheapest but i liked the fact they could be delivered to the venue without me having to physically go into a florist the morning of the wedding .
F	i was shown the flowers before the wedding meal and i was extremely disappointed - not only did they already look half_dead there was barely any flowers actually in the bouquet - definitely not as many as was advertised on the website .
F	i made the decision not to insult my parent / mother in law and told the venue to discard the flowers ( they really were quite pathetic looking ).
F	i then sent one of my guests out to buy a nice bunch at the local_supermarket - cost half the price , were still alive and had a decent amount of flowers in it .
F	i did contact serenata_flowers and they asked for images which i couldn ' t provide ( they basically got hidden behind a curtain out of embarrassment and i definitely didn ' t want to insult our parents by handing out such a crappy bunch of flowers and i didn ' t want to take them home with me either .
F	they did turn_up when they are supposed to though - despite using the worst delivery company known to man ( yodel ).
F	really bad_experience - would not recommend or use again .
F	easy to use website , great discounted items .
F	my new lush wetsuit arrived super_quick the next_day :) thank_you very much i will_definitely_recommend you to my friends and use you again in the future !
F	!
F	great value for money and free next_day delivery - superb !
F	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
F	i have ordered lots of times from this shop .
F	i think they offer great value for money , next_day delivery .
F	i love their swarovski stones they have so much variety in stock which always makes a difference when you want to make something straight_away .
F	for christmas i ordered lots of kits and everyone was delighted with the finished articles , they offer good quality at affordable prices just wish they were local so i could go in and pick more things that i havent spotted on the website .... probably best not on the doorstep as would be declared bankrupt in a matter of weeks :) love this place
F	good clear website .
F	great to see clothes on catwalk .
F	dor the price of the clothes the quality is fine .
F	sizes are true to life also .
F	i usually order in bulk and send some back if i order say 0 sizes .
F	free returns and quick refund given to card .
F	good customer setvice
F	recommend .
F	great company .
F	always get goods quickly if in stock ( if not in stock clearly says so )
F	even traders within ebay very good .
F	great prices and returns_policy .
F	only problem is its very easy to buy your items in basket with 0 click ordering , even if you were just trying to browse .
F	but overall brilliant .
F	note : buy from big sites like amazon etc and check trust_pilot beware of fake sites .
F	odered goods mid dec_0000 have received no reply after one email_stating goods would be a few_days before they came back in stock .
F	doubt i will get a refund of them , hope visa can help .
F	wish i had read up on this website !
F	will be reporting them .
F	great products fantastic prices fast delivery always recommend fragrance_direct !
F	!
F	i got a dispatch email after what seemed like moments after i had placed my order , and the order arrived the next_day in perfect_condition .
F	i highly_recommend this website and their wide_range of products because of their excellent delivery times .
F	i have used interparcel on many occasions and i find their service to be very reliable .
F	i have seen some bad_reviews on this site and i cant_believe they are talking_about the same company .
F	on one_occasion i used interparcel to send a pallet to one of our very respected clients and i needed it there as soon as possible and interparcel arranged a next_day collection as requested and it was delivered the very next_day also as requested and our client commented on what a fast and reliable service it was .
F	i have always been happy with interparcel and will_continue to use their services .
F	very simple to use and follow step by step instructions that are shown on the screen at all times
F	emma was so helpful got me sorted in minutes , thanks x
F	i have used hello_canvas twice before and i have been most impressed with not only the products but also the excellent customer_services .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	if i had the option to leave no stars i would .
F	this has to be the worst company which i have ever_dealt_with , the staff appeared to be incompetent and unwilling to help .
F	i ordered glasses on 00 / 00 / 00 and was only notified on 00 / 00 / 00 that the frames were out of stock despite having spoke to one of their employee ' s in the mean time .
F	each time i attempted to get an answer as to when i would receive my glasses i was given the run around and was told that everything was ' unfortunate '.
F	eventually i decided to cancel my order and i have never came_across a company who is so willing to cancel an order without any attempt not to lose custom .
F	i didn ' t even get so much as a apology for the inconvenience which they had caused .
F	in honest it seemed like they had taken an order for goods which they could not fulfil and just wanted to take people ’_s money for something which they could not supply .
F	i specifically ordered ray_ban glasses as those were the ones which i wanted only to be offered their own_brand frames which were not even similar , the constant lack of stock appears to be just a ploy to get people ’_s money to then fob them off with whatever they have lying_around .
F	all in all i would never recommend this company to anybody and will be relieve when i have the money back in the back so i never have to deal with them again .
F	they have put me off ordering glasses online again .
F	we received all of our_wedding invites ( day and evening , reply cards and all envelopes ) earlier this week .
F	i couldn ' t be_happier .
F	had my reservations_about ordering online but had nothing to worry_about in the end .
F	the invites we chose were very different and the text was arranged beautifully and split in a perfect place !
F	could not be_happier .
F	very quick delivery considering volume of invites ordered - very high_quality too . thank_you so , so much !
F	will_definitely be recommending to friends and family in the future .
F	hostelbookers offer valuable information for anyone who is searching for ideal place to stay with better price .

F	nikki was great and helped sort my login problems really quickly .
F	she was very polite and it was nice to be helped without being made to feel_like you had done something wrong ^^
F	i ordered a floral tribute for a funeral service last_week to be in the hearse and then placed outside with the other tributes .
F	they were not in the hearse and did not arrive while we were at the service at all .
F	myself and the other family_members are all witnesses to the fact that they were not there .
F	as if this isn ' t bad enough , i have got in touch to obtain a refund and they are insisting that they were there and are at the crematorium for me to collect now ( a week_later !!).
F	they have had me ringing the crematorium directly to check ( presumably because i ' m mistaken ???)
F	and have fobbed me off on numerous_occasions regarding my refund .
F	one week_later , still no refund .
F	very upsetting and humiliating .
F	don ' t entertain using them as they cannot be trusted and offer shocking customer_service .
F	i ordered my items late sunday_night and they were with me by tuesday - great service and very happy with the items .
F	will_definitely use again !
F	i ' ve made a purchase with this provider for the first time .
F	the product hasn ' t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
F	when xmas period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
F	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
F	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer care team told me they didn ' t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
F	perhaps they ' ve forgotten my first shipment ?
F	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
F	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
F	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
F	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
F	there are means in e_- commerce these days to tailor timely offer to adjust to the customer , not the other way around ...
F	never thought i would use strong words here , but bravofly fuck yourself for ( here comes the list why ):
F	0 ) direct_debit from your card instead of your mobile for calling a customer_service for € 0 per_minute ,
F	0 ) offering a return change for 0twice the price of your return ticket ,
F	0 ) for being so cunty about your top on prices , including additional changes in flights ( i . e .
F	no offer of +/- 0 days consecutive flights for a reasonable_price , that would not cost double what i paid in a return ticket .
F	your own search_engine shows you are just being stingy .
F	also £_00 for a credit_card fee , seriously ?)
F	note to customer_service people : i am actually sorry you working for this company , because clearly the stingy way of ripping of customers is embedded in bravofly ' s business_model , and nothing you may be able to influence , so may it seems by having talked to one of you .
F	-----------------------------------
F	" if you like to get fucked on the fly , pay for nothing to a stingy @ bravofly "
F	this site was super easy , i found everything i wanted in about 0 mins and booked in 0 .
F	i will use this site again when looking for hostels in europe .
F	great live_chat service by catherine_corless .
F	friendly and professional .
F	i can ' t fault mdp , their delivery times and customer care team have been fantastic , and as such i would recommend this company without_hesitation .

F	i purchased tickets online march 0rd for a beyonce show on april 00th .
F	i directed the tickets to a friends apartment with my name on it because i did not feel_comfortable sending it to my dorm .
F	checked ups tracking later and saw that they had tried to send it to his apartment but needed a signature , so it was sent to corporate goods .
F	ups was suppose to at_least leave a note at the address saying that the package tried to be delivered but they did not .
F	called both ups and viagogo asked what i needed to do , where i was directed to call viagogo where i changed the address .
F	a week_later i received an_email_saying the package was received and that i could not get a refund .
F	confused i went to pick it up and it had not been delivered .
F	called viagogo again and they said they would get back to me but never did .
F	i had also checked online after this and the address to deliver had not changed .
F	i called twice more and received the same " we ' ll get back to you " with no response .
F	when i called a third time i was told that the tickets had been destroyed and there was nothing i could do and i can ' t be refunded .
F	this just feels_like no one was doing their job and i am very upset about it .
F	all i want now is a refund because this was such a hassle with such a terrible result .
F	would buy from iconic_watches again , trustworthy and fast delivery !
F	very happy with my watch .
F	ordered new bike on sunday_evening , delivered first thing tuesday_morning .
F	particularly good when 0 other popular cycling websites claimed they would not have this particular bike in stock until the end of january .
F	excellent customer_service ; phoned to confirm i ' d ordered correctly as sizing was slightly out , and advised on best parts for bike .
F	not to mention great podium points scheme , resulting in me receiving a free helmet and inner tubes .
F	could not rate them any higher , excellent service .
F	very fast delivery and great to . order from .
F	fantastic quality and would definitely use again .
F	i had a very good experience with this company , absolutely excellent customer_service , top_class product and definitely_recommend to all my drumming friends
F	i bought from this company through amazon uk , and i was very impressed with the service i received .
F	i did order a clairsonic in the lilac colour but unfortunately this was out of stock but they quickly informed me of this and offered me to wait the extra time for the lilac one or pick a new colour .
F	i went_ahead and picked a new colour which was then delivered to me very quickly .
F	i was very pleased with the delivery , the contact that i had with this seller and also the product .
F	it came exactly as_described .
F	thanks !
F	i lost my old ghds so was on the hunt for a reliable company who had great prices - beautycow had my ghds at lowest_price i could find .
F	the service was quick and efficient and they came within 0 days just like they had said , which is just what i needed after being without hair straightners for a week :(, definately would recommend to friends and family and will be using them again .
F	highly_recommended company !
F	lucy f
F	brilliant service .
F	sent in my phone and cheque was received two days_later
F	priceline never_fails to let me down with their name your own price or their express deals .
F	before traveling to toronto , i decided i wanted to stay in a hostel to save the costs , so i decided to google " toronto hostels ".
F	the first two websites that came up for me were hostelworld . com and hostelbookers . com .
F	i chose to look at both , and quickly found that hostelbookers . com ' s prices were generally cheaper , so i decided to stick with them .
F	the website sponsored a hostel called clarence park , which is a hostel that didn ' t come up through other_websites such as hostels . com .
F	i was very excited because this hostel looked beautiful .
F	i put in my selected dates and it told me there was only 0 room left , so i decided to go_ahead and book it .
F	the next morning i received an e_- mail from the hostel stating ,
F	" we are emailing to inform you that your reservation cannot be honored .
F	we do not know how your reservation was able to go through as we have not had availability for almost 0 month for these dates .
F	we are contacting hostelbookers immediately to see were they dropped the ball .
F	sorry for any inconvenience !"
F	needless to say i was pissed .
F	it ' s understandable ( though not pleasant ) if there ' s miscommunication between websites of availability within a couple of days , such as if i was trying to book a room for the next two days , but for a hostel that has been booked up within the past month .
F	i do not understand how this happened .
F	of course , i decided to read the terms & conditions , and their stance on wrong information is basically that they ' re not perfect , and cannot be held_responsible : " you should note however that we do not warrant that such information will be error free and in using this website you acknowledge that the information provided may include inaccuracies and / or typographical errors ."
F	and if errors are to happen , " we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if the supplier needs to make a significant change to your confirmed arrangements or to cancel them .
F	we will also liaise between you and the supplier in relation to any alternative_arrangements offered by the supplier but we will have no further liability to you ."
F	i would have much rather paid the more_expensive 0 . 0 % prices of hostelworld , seeing as how when i looked up the hostel and my traveling dates on their website , they provided the correct information .
F	i have used these for 0 weeks now , i found them very cheap , all they always have a different selection of branded items , cheap delivery for 00kgs for 0 . 00
F	i would recommend these , as it will save a fortune
F	easy to use , reliable and the best value hostel site .
F	this website has been my best friend for a long time !
F	(: i find it very easy too find what i want , the delivery is fast and friendly and the items are much more fairly_priced that anywhere_else ive gone to buy something
F	this website for me is very easy to use , a simple layout that makes it very easy to find the items you want and the service is very friendly
F	this service was very fast and friendly , i wouldnt go anywhere_else to sell my old_phones
F	i first used iflorist to send flowers to my sick mum in the usa , i have used other florists in the past but they are becoming so expensive and the choice of flowers are always the same .
F	iflorist are a creative team who you can tell actually love their job by their posts on facebook .
F	i have recommended you many_times to friends , sometimes it ' s good to search for better choices than stick to the ones that we know best .
F	fab service :))
F	ecareers is easily accessable whenever you need it .
F	it also has a simple home screen that is good to navigate through and find exactly_what you need without needlessly clicking through pages .
F	the online support_team are extremely_helpful and polite if ever you need help in regards to your account .
F	great product , fully met my expectations .
F	helpful customer_service team , i will be ordering from voga again .
F	very good for price , ordered at lunch and it was delivered the next_day .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	i ' ve never rented with other_companies , lovefilm is the first one i ' ve ever used and i will stick to it .
F	despite all the gift cards and vouchers they send every once in a while , their costumer_service is awesome .
F	i asked about going on a holiday and because my account was the light use one there was no way i can put it " on a holiday ".
F	i wrote to them and they replied in less_than 0 hours giving me 0 alternative ways to deal with my account .
F	very nice :)
F	came on time , and only took money out when the book came , very good
F	my stuff hasn ' t come yet , but i already want to give them 00 stars if it is possible .
F	well basically , i was being stupid and accidentally ordered a pair of headphones that were out of stock .
F	the moment i realized my mistake i wrote to their costumer_service telling them i want to change .
F	and at 00 o ' clock monday ( i sent my messages on sunday ) they replied that they ' ve provided me a refund and my other headphones were on their way to me .
F	i am so thrilled .
F	i bought a pair of headphones from an independent seller , when the seller failed to send me my product , amazon refunded me instantly .
F	the independent sellers may not be great but amazon ' s customer support is awesome
F	i can ' t say anything about the customer support because i didn ' t need it , but the delivery time was great , in the range that they claim to be
F	whenever i need new tyres for my cars i end up using nothing else , but tyreshopper .
F	a good , easy to use homepage with straight_forward options .
F	i have used the same fitting place couple of times now , the staff was always helpful and friendly .
F	wow got loads of great cds and dvd boxsets at a fraction of the price and all were in very good condition !!
F	great service and cheap delivery - thanks cex !
F	!
F	an simple and quick way to save cash on a purchase you was already going to make .
F	just log in and click on the store you want to buy from and let topcashbacknow . com do the rest !!
F	i cant_believe the amount i have received back making online shopping even better_than before .
F	0st time i had ordered from this site .
F	item came within 0 days and is great - perfect for mother ' s day !
F	!
F	thanks
F	i had problems with the domain being that the previous_owner passed away and coudnt get to renew it , i was becoming desperate on what to do and how but the customer_service online helped_me fast with the precise information i needed .
F	they did not ended the chat until i had all my settings and my date restored , and they made sure i was able to get everything i needed .
F	i call that real good service and real good customer support .
F	i would recomend it always .
F	ok , first of all , they were the cheapest for the 0 hotels i needed , 0 in london for 0 nights and 0 in greece for 0 so there is that .
F	and their new website is ok .
F	the not so good now , they didn ' t send the email confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
F	- i have booked in full a transfer which is just resold from a0b transfers and they haven ' t sent me the voucher because the hotel is only partly paid till 0 weeks before_departure .
F	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
F	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come back to you and they are never apologetic .
F	i ' d say , use only when they are cheapest .
F	activation key came quickly - about 00_hours after payment ( it does say it may take upto 00_hours , so relatively ...)
F	followed the instructions and after a lengthy download , i was playing bf0 .
F	does what it says on the white carton thing ( yeah i know , not as catchy ).
F	caffeine tablets worked as you imagine .
F	i ' m a small build though so i break the tablet and take just a quarter .
F	i have used mazuma two or three time and have consistently found the service extremely simple and speedy .
F	payment is always prompt and even better now they cab send a faster pay payment directly to your account .
F	i think they are great !
F	i brought two_pairs of glasses from smartbuyglasses i thought the customer_service was great !
F	i had placed two seperate orders & didnt get a confirmation_email with one of them so i emailed them telling them what had happend i had a response within_00hrs ..
F	within the next couple days i had updates of where my glasses was & when it would be shipped out .
F	they had used dhl to deliver my purchases which including tracking so i knew when & where my order was .
F	delivery does take much longer_than any other company but its worth it at the end for such reasonable prices .
F	would definately buy from them again !
F	having suffered from arthritis for a few_years i decided to get a steam shower .
F	the steam shower has helped_me feel better , and gives much needed temporary relief .
F	di vapor made the entire_process smooth and i had my steam unit up and running in no time .
F	brill .
F	i ' ve done multiple bets with them and haven ' t had any_problems .
F	i know other people as well who use them and haven ' t had any_problems .
F	maybe people write bad_reviews because they lost their money on a bad bet .
F	after trying a different company that promised to unlock my phone and it failing i was hesitant to try again .
F	this worked great and super_fast - they said 00_hours , but not on weekends , i submitted it friday_afternoon and received confirmation sunday_afternoon !
F	this was a great surprise as i expected to not here until tomorrow .
F	thank_you so much for doing exactly as you said even faster_than promised !
F	i got a bit_worried on the length it took to get unlocked .
F	this was probably down to the fact we started the process when the i - phone 0s was just starting to become available .
F	the support was 00 / 00 - really amazing .
F	just got the email_confirming unlock - worked 0st time !
F	thank - you ...
F	i really like this website .
F	i am a student who often looks for cheap hostels !
F	i like the fact i can narrow my options down at a price between £ 0 -£ 00 .
F	i always choose this option !
F	i think the reviews are really helpful .
F	the ratings in percentage form are easy to scroll past and see what ' s going to be good quality or not .
F	simple on line service , fast delivery with no issues at all .
F	so pleased with the product , it was half the price of any of the other_retailers i ' d looked at so i had my doubts about the quality of the item i must_admit .
F	thrilled when it arrived , much_better_than the others i ' d seen , will_definitely be using victoria_plumb again .
F	placed the order needing 0 fancy_dress costumes quickly .
F	no hassle at all costumes arrived on the day they said .
F	both were brilliant , good quality too compared to other_places i ' ve used before .
F	will_definitely use again .
F	we ordered a kids playhouse from here , and although the house is good we had a nightmare with the service .
F	the order came incomplete and it took about 0 weeks , numerous_emails , being ignored , rude staff and not being_able to get through to call_centre to get it resolved .
F	we had already started putting the house together , had to buy screws because it came without them , and no instructions .
F	have complained to them and received a very insulting " goodwill_gesture ".
F	i would use another company , plenty selling the same sort of thing without the hassle .
F	fast , easy to use site with no_hidden_fees !
F	highly_reccommend to everyone looking to book accomodation !
F	pilates class is just great , perfect for me .
F	i love gomammoth and i would recommend it to everyone .
F	our pilates teacher - joanna - is 000_% professional , lovely , always full of energy , very helpful and understanding .
F	thanks to this wonderful class i can relax , forget about the whole world and just focus on my exercises .
F	great choice of music too !
F	love it !
F	:)
F	i ' ve already bought three kitchen_appliances from appliances_online .
F	i chose them mainly because they have an option of recycling the old appliance .
F	there ' s always a problem when you want to replace your old one with a new one .
F	it ' s easy to do with appliances_online .
F	i just had to tick the box that i want my old device to be taken and pay £ 0 . 00 .
F	i think it ' s a fair price for the service .
F	i don ' t have to worry what to do with , for example , my broken microwave .
F	the other thing i like about app online is that i can watch a video which shows you how the appliance looks_like and what it can do .
F	i ordered a mobile phone case from this website .
F	i payed via_paypal , got a confirmation e_- mail from paypal and the money was taken out of my account .
F	0 days_later , i ' d received no correspondence from handtec about the order to say it had been despatched , or indeed that there were any_problems .
F	contacted them today to make_sure everything was ok , and they tell me the order was cancelled because of a problem with payment , even_though the payment has actually gone_through fine !
F	so now in the dark , don ' t know if i ' ll ever even receive the product , and their e_- mail responses are very slow .
F	don ' t trust at all .
F	generally cheaper_than other shops and delivery is only £ 0 , which is good
F	cheap phones , good reception , in my room at uni , only vodafone gets any service , and i can call 0 numbers as much as i want for only £ 0 , which is amazing , 0000 times better_than any contract ive_seen
F	envolop was delivered quickly , and money came through very quickly , very good service , would use again .
F	we ordered our items on late on thursday_night and received them early saturday_morning .
F	didn ' t even use next_day delivery .
F	the items we purchased were less_than half the price the exact_same items in major shops .
F	would definitely_recommend .
F	the service is easy to use , the checkout_process is really simple especially if you want to reorder the same lenses again .
F	cheaper_than buying direct from your optician and havent had a situation yet where my lenses have been out of stock ( as they so frequently are at the opticians !)
F	can ' t fault delivery either , always super_fast .
F	i placed my order late on sunday_evening , my lenses had arrived by the time i got home from work on tuesday !
F	have already_recommended this site to many friends and will_continue to do so .
F	i had my doubts but decided to put them aside when i received a my voucher_codes discount through email .
F	i ' m so glad i did , i swear the price i paid for my perfume is even better_than duty free !!
F	i have recommended fragrance_direct to several of my friends and family whom have gone on to place orders for various items and they too have been converted .
F	my only , minor insignificant complaint , is the length of time it took for the parcel to arrive however i accept that could just as easily have been down to the postal service .
F	overall fragrance_direct come highly_recommended and i will most definitely be using them again .
F	just booked a mot for 00 pounds , what a deal
F	i have now got 0 different blinds on my house ..... all from blinds0go !
F	the quality of them is fantastic and the prices are even better !
F	cannot recommend enough !
F	!
F	fast & easy to use .
F	managed to get the product i wanted at a great price .
F	would definitely_recommend to others .
F	i had a really good experience using mazuma , i was offered £_000 for my iphone_0g on monday , delivery envelope was received on tuesday and i had received my cheque for £_000 by saturday .
F	a very fast and effective service from mazuma i cannot_fault them in any way and would recommend them to anyone who_wants to sell their old_phones and needs fast cash .
F	i have just completed the excel_course .
F	very quick and easy to use .
F	really learnt alot through this which i can apply to my work
F	thank_you for excellent service andy is a gent he was a lovely man and top service provider will be spreading the word to family and friends thanks again x
F	really pleased with my laptop - selling experience ; there was specific data i needed saving which was no problem , they kept me up to date along the way and gave me a really good price .
F	would use them again .
F	many_thanks !
F	thanks for a great shopping_experience ; i ' m really pleased with the service and the items i bought - the great value deal was also brilliant .
F	i was very impressed .
F	they have the supplements i want and offer to make their price lower_than a competitors .
F	that ' s what got me .
F	i love the fact that i dont have to search the whole site trying to find a certain supplement , it ' s pretty easy and always quick to find what i ' m looking for .
F	i love it !
F	would definitely reccommend to other people !!!!
F	!
F	we did cocktail_making on a hen_do in sheffield .
F	it was great fun , there was a great selection of cocktails ( plenty to drink !!!)
F	and the barman was fab !
F	would definately_recommend and use again
F	a group of us went to sheffield on a hen_do and did perfume making and a burlesque dance party .
F	funktion_events made it easy for me to arrange as they were so helpful and knowledgeable .
F	the hen was really pleased , as it was a surprise and the rest of the group loved it .
F	i would recommend them to anyone_looking to arrange a party .
F	i ordered the chocolate hamper for my mothers birthday , the order was placed 0 days in_advance .
F	by 0 . 00 pm of the delivery day the hamper has still not been delivered .
F	i have tried to contact the customer_service number provided on the webpage but it won ' t dial .
F	i have contacted eflorist by email but have only received an_automated_response .
F	i am completely disapointed with the service , and very embarrassed that my gift did not arrive .
F	great thankyou [_name ] very helpfull
F	i placed my order late_afternoon and my item was delivered the very next_day .
F	no_problems at all using this site and i would definitely use and reccommend this site again :-)
F	beauty_bay has a good range of products and their service was great , i ' ll be looking here again in future .
F	lovestretch has wonderful service , they send orders out very quickly and have good updates and communications .
F	i am very struck by the brilliant sale pieces .
F	i would not say that i dress in the style suggested ( luxe - lounge ) but i find that the choice and quality of the pieces are able to be worked into my wardrobe , adding items which i may not see elsewhere .
F	i would ask if lovestretch could show how they can reduce the environmental impact of sending clothes by mail , my clothes arrived in very slick and secure postal packet wich was many_times the size of the product i ordered , which no doubt kept my good nice and safe but seemed wasteful .
F	for example , the company nature shop uses biodegradeble bags and make their commitments to sustainability very clear .
F	i posted something on here last friday and received a call from sonia soon after .
F	but still no sign - sonia , can i have an update please ?
F	infurn have told me it was sent to the courier on 0th_feb but quite honestly given today is 00rd feb this must be a lie ?
F	what courier service takes over 0 weeks ?
F	awful , awful , awful .
F	i wish there was a zero star_rating
F	ordered bean_bag via groupon on november 00th .
F	expecting it within 0 weeks as promised and as of today february 00th i am still_waiting .
F	was supposed to be a christmas_present for my son
F	infurn don ' t even respond to emails which i just find incredibly_rude .
F	if they just replied and put their hands up and said sorry then i wouldn ' t mind so much .
F	problem is i still love the product and i know my son will really love it so i am persevering !
F	groupon have been telling_me dispatch dates but they just come and go with no sign
F	honestly don ' t understand how they can be so awful and still trade , how have they not gone_bust ?
F	!
F	i have had superb customer_service from order to delivery .
F	even_though there was damage to the original bag , i rang up and my call got answered_quickly by a polite , helpful and courteous operative .
F	she did her very best to arrange a new bag to be delivered the next_day , even_though it was the cut_off time for next_day - and it was delievered the next_day !
F	she also said she would call me back if couldn ' t arrange for next_day .
F	also the price of the item was the cheapest around !
F	i will certainly use this company again if i need other things and very highly_recommend to others .
F	truely fantastic customer_service from this company !
F	i bought a pay as u go mobile for my daughter and also a £_00 top up voucher , i had to ring to register the phone and sim and i was told the voucher would take 0 - 0hrs to be added on .
F	0 days and 0 phone_calls later , i am still no further forward .... i asked to speak to the line manager and i was put on hold for a further 00mins only for them to cut me off and again i had to ring back .... its cost me a total of £_00 in calls and at present i am waiting for the manger to call me back ( very much doubt he will !!)
F	this is the worst mobile company i have ever had to deal with , my daughter is very upset as this is her first mobile and she was over the moon when she opened it on her_birthday , as yet she hasnt been able to use her phone .
F	i will never ever use this company again , i only wish i had bought a different ohone on a different network , im going to get the phone unlocked and put her on a different network .. absolutely_disgusting ..
F	pure and very high_quality protein that makes daily diet much_easier .
F	protein mixing easily and taste is really nice .
F	and not only the primal_00 and x - blend but there are other supplements from monkey i use daily and would recommend - super nitro , cla , fish_oil .
F	super d0 and the list_goes on , i love them all .
F	free postage and also when i opened my pack i had a surprise protein flap jack in it .
F	il defo will use this web_site again .
F	great prices and quick delivery
F	simple website , easy to follow_instructions , the bag for sending mobile back , was received next_day , payment issued within 0 days after sending mobile , great service !
F	a +++
F	i like to go on here to find out whats for sale and average prices etc .
F	its a really good site
F	you make up your wish list .
F	return when you ' ve watched it and then the next one arrives , and also no late fees !
F	i ' ve always had dyson hoovers for the last 00 years but wen my last one pack in .
F	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .
F	excellent website easy to navigate around it and accurate information
F	overpriced for their packages and all you get is repeats all the time !
F	!
F	their cheap and they get you to where you need to go , what more do you need !
F	!
F	to many emails and offers to take in
F	i will be sticking with o0 now and won ' t be changing provider again after my last mistake .
F	signal_coverage is really good
F	paypal offer a fantastic service which is very easy to use .
F	i really like using boots kitchen appliance , the website is easy to use and delivery dates are clearly shown .
F	arrives on time and in one piece , with the added_bonus of advantage card points !
F	got my voucher through by email .
F	her is the ripoff - £ 0 deposit non refunderball and £ 0 body armor per_person non refunderball , noting on the voucher listing mentioning this so its not £_00 for 00 people it is rely £_000 in total .
F	excellent service and delivery .
F	no hestitations in recommending them to friends . even better when you get emailed wee discount_codes when you shop , can ' t resist a bargain !!
F	!
F	premium brand tyres 00 quid cheaper_than anywhere_else !
F	quick delivery to local_garage .
F	fuss free service , definately use again
F	thanx .
F	i wanted to get some flowers for a friend to brighten her day ; unfortunately , she lives in liverpool and i live in northamptonshire .
F	i googled ' flower delivery liverpool ' to see if there were any local_florists nearby and came_across serenetaflowers which looked ace !
F	i ordered the adore bouquet as she_loves red_roses and once they arrived i received a lovely text from her thanking me .
F	she says they were absolutely beautiful !
F	i ' ll definitely use this service again , thank_you !
F	so it was my mother - in - law - to - be ' s birthday .
F	i ' d already decided i needed to get her some flowers but i could leave the house due to having to wait for building regulations guys to come check out the work done on our house .
F	i placed the order around 00am and , guess_what ?
F	the delivery girl was knocking on my door by 0pm !
F	i was absolutely amazed at how quick and easy the service was .
F	though the bouquets themselves plus delivery is a bit much pricewise , i ' m still impressed at the service and will most_likely use again !
F	i love this website , the stuff is really good and whenever i order i get really nice clothes or trainers not necessarily available in my local sports store and i like the fact i can track my stuff on their website after they send it
F	this was a really good find for reasonably_priced flowers i loved the fact i could choose which date i could get my flowers and they came in perfect_condition with a vase .
F	recommended
F	excellent communication and very quick service , the website is easy to navigate and makes it clear where prescriptions are required .
F	would recommend this site to everybody .
F	i found that double0tickets gave me the best service over any other ticket agent i have booked with before .
F	their website was fast , clear and easy to use .
F	once you booked your received an_email confirmation that your tickets had been booked .
F	i then received a text the day before my tickets were dispatched to confirm that they were being sent out .
F	amazingly great service and i will_definitely re - use again .
F	so simple , easy and fast .
F	sent the phone off on tuesday and the money was in my account on wednesday .
F	very impressed with whole service
F	i was due to receive a parcel yesterday between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
F	on the lovely map they sent me , it was due to be delivered to my work .
F	however the emails said it was my home address .
F	i was at work all day , and i work on reception , and nothing was delivered .
F	i then return home after work to no calling_card there either .
F	there are no telephone_numbers like some other courier companies , to speak to someone about whats happened .
F	i then check the tracking and it says the parcel was refused !!
F	by who ??
F	i then log on this morning to see that it is being held at the romford depot .
F	i cannot call as there is no number , and i have no calling_card ?!
F	so what do i do ?
F	?
F	i ordered online with mdp_supplies and received my package very quickly .
F	the courier company they use is very efficient and communication great .
F	mdps website is informative and easy to navigate and they have a wide_range of quality products .
F	i bookmarked their site after my first order and have returned on more_than one_occasion to make further purchases !
F	vackra blommor levererade i tid
F	i purchased this last_night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
F	imei is correct ive made sure does it usually take this long its been almost 00_hrs ??
F	?
F	surfdome used to be my number one online shop to visit for anything !
F	i have spent_hundreds of £' s on the website and have always been 000_% happy with the service ...
F	im going on holiday tomorrow , and after ordering some items for next_day delivery on monday , i still won ' t be receiving before my holiday .
F	the reason for this is because they sent it to an incorrect address 0 hours away from where i live !
F	i looked at the tracking and called the customer_service line , and they said it would be sorted for me , and nothing changed !
F	i rang again today and they have told me that there is nothing they can do now even_though all of the items are still in stock .
F	oh ...
F	but they have told me they will ring me later today to try and get it sorted again ... at 0pm !
F	there is no way i will have anything ive ordered before i go away and i am thoroughly disappointed .
F	some may say that i shouldn ' t leave it so last_minute and its my own fault as problems do occur sometimes ...
F	but as i used to trust surfdome so much and never had problems ...
F	i though it would be fine .
F	it ' s the incompetence of the customer_services team that is the worst part of it all !!
F	!
F	surfdome is a great online shop , but i wouldn ' t recommend ordering anything that you need asap , or trust their customers service team because they have only let me down !
F	easy website to find your way around , and completely spoilt for choice !
F	!
F	received the items wrapped thoroughly and in pristine_condition !
F	will_definitely use again and highly_recommend !!
F	!
F	thank_you fancy_dress ball !
F	i ' ve ordered a few_times from sputnik , and both_times i ' ve had queries about the items .
F	i emailed before purchase , and all of my questions were answered by the next_day and i ' ve gone ahead with the purchase .
F	the items have always been sent and received in perfect_condition and so quickly !!
F	the prices are really good and they will_definitely receive more orders from me !
F	would recommend to anyone !
F	!
F	i ordered a dyson vacuum from this company .
F	i received it so quickly after following the simple instructions of payment on the website .
F	after i placed the order i received email confirmation really quickly , and was able to track my order on the courier website aswell .
F	i will use this company again and recommend it to anyone !
F	i rang up recently to ask about a few products .
F	i passed my bike test and have planned to travel around_europe with friends for a few_months .
F	i spoke to a girl on the phone and asked about loads of satnavs , bluetooth headsets , charging cables for the products , mapping updates ... the lot !
F	i couldn ' t believe_how knowledgeable they were of every product i asked about , and if she wasn ' t sure she would find out the answer so quickly !
F	i ended_up getting everything i needed and it was all sent to me the next_day !
F	the products were brand_new and so cheap .
F	the satnav was newly overhauled but it was perfect !
F	exactly like new , just a different box !
F	i would reccommend this company to anyone because of how well i was looked after by them
F	well_done globalgps !
F	i look_forward to buying more products from you in the near_future , and my trip !
F	delivery arrived the morning after i ordered even_though i placed it late_afternoon .
F	loved the raccoons as a kid .
F	i bought 0 tickets for boxing on sat .
F	traveling friday .
F	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
F	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it ' s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn ' t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
F	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn ' t come by thursday .
F	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
F	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
F	not got them yet but i ' m feeling slightly more at ease !
F	i do feel that the seller should be made to send viagogo the tickets or to the buyer by a decent deadline .
F	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
F	it ' s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
F	the seller could have easily decided they don ' t want to sell them anymore - at the last_minute !
F	what do they gain from hanging onto them ?
F	i don ' t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
F	a trustworthy and efficient service !
F	i send my phone off to them at the beginning of the month - 0th_jan - ( after they failed to collect it twice !)
F	i was skeptical of these types of companies so took multiple phones of my phone before i sent it .
F	i followed up with them after the ten day period and they advised they had lost my phone , it wasnt until the 00st of jan that they located it .
F	they then advised me i would be receiving no funds because the phone had water_damage .
F	i had checked before ( and had photos ) and i had not had any water_damage therefore it would have occurred whilst they had lost my phone .
F	they are refusing to acknowledge the damage was caused by them .
F	for god sake dont use them .
F	i had a photo collage done of me and my boyfriend for xmas , it ' s so cute and looks fabulous !
F	much_better_than i was expecting , and is taking pride of place in our house :) couldn ' t be more pleased .
F	when i can ' t be bothered to cook or go out and get something locally , my go - to is almost always just - eat .
F	i love the fact that there are so many different cuisine options that are easily_accessible to me ; it makes deciding what i want for lunch / dinner much_easier as sometimes i will go on with absolutely no_idea what i feel_like .
F	a lot of the time , i end up finding takeaways that i never knew were close by , or i discover new takeaways that have just opened in my area .
F	another great point is that they allow you to review those restaurants on their site - this makes sifting through restaurants much_easier and gives you more reassurance .
F	no one wants to make an order , whilst hungry , only to have your food arrive 0 hours_later , so being_able to read reviews means you know which restaurants have a good reputation and which do not .
F	i have had some bad_experiences with some restaurants but just - eat themselves were never the problem .
F	all i had to do was leave a bad review for that restaurant to warn_others of my experience , and never order from them again .
F	problem solved .
F	on the occasions when restaurants have cancelled my order for various reasons , just - eat ' s customer_service has been excellent , as they will always text me to let me know , if not call .
F	this is much preferable to email as i don ' t always check it immediately !
F	it saves the trouble of sitting around , waiting for over an_hour , only to go on my pc , check my emails and be disappointed to find that my order had been cancelled and i will in fact not be eating within the next 00_minutes .
F	the new - ish app is also very handy , though makes naughty orders quite easy ...
F	in fact i don ' t keep the app ' s button on my main screen anymore so i am not tempted so often !
F	the only improvement i can suggest is to go the hungryhouse direction - offer the meal free if the order is more_than 00_minutes .
F	this means the restaurants that are with just - eat have to step up their game and it guarantees the customers are not disappointed .
F	if my food didn ' t turn_up within the time - frame given , i ' d be mollified by the fact that it would be free .
F	whenever parcels have been sent to me from online_retailers via dpd , i ' ve always had a good experience .
F	my orders have arrived in timely_fashion and i really_appreciate the text update to let me know the hour time - frame they will deliver between .
F	this is such a great idea as , unlike with some other couriers , i do not have to wait in from 0am - 0pm with no more specific indication of what sort of time they might arrive .
F	no one enjoys wasting an entire day , eg .
F	if the delivery comes at 0pm and you realise you could have gone out and done plenty of other things in that time .
F	my most_recent delivery was today , sent from asos ; i was sent a text and an_email_saying it would arrive between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm .
F	the parcel arrived at 00 :_00am , very pleased with dpd ' s time - keeping .
F	i ' m so glad asos has chosen to either stop using myhermes or at_least does not use myhermes for next_day deliveries .
F	i ' ve not yet needed to use the redelivery via text , but i think it ' s fantastic that they give you the option to choose whether you ' d like to delivered to a neighbour or delay delivery for up to two days .
F	keep up the good job , guys .
F	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have another parcel being delivered by dpd for today and during the tracking process , i ' ve just noticed the " follow my parcel " section and i love it !
F	i love knowing exactly where my delivery driver is , and which delivery he is currently making , and how long it will take him to get to me .
F	see you in about 0 hours , bill !
F	i really like the variety of items that asos offers , and usually i do not have a problem with asos whatsoever in terms of item quality or pricing .
F	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
F	i will not go into detail about my horrible experience with myhermes here - if you click my profile to see my other reviews on trustpilot , you will be able to find my review for myhermes .
F	the other reason i am not giving any higher_than 0_stars is because of their customer_service .
F	it is frustrating when there is no contact number and my only options are to wait for a response through email or via their facebook_page , which are usually very slow ( barring the automated_messages saying they have a high_volume of emails ).
F	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
F	it did not , so i messaged them back on facebook , only to receive a reply several days_later , after the order finally arrived a week_later than i was told it would .
F	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
F	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i ' m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
F	due to myhermes being a pain in the bum in regards to standard delivery , i chose to go premier with asos so hopefully i will not have to go through the whole debacle of trying to locate my order again .
F	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer care again , as they are rather useless .
F	i returned an order on 00 / 00 / 00 as some of the items did not suit me , and one of the items i requested an exchange as it looked of poor quality ( i took a photo , sent it with a cover letter in the parcel , as well as emailed customer care with the same cover letter & photo ).
F	i emailed on 00 / 00 / 00 asking if they ' d received my return yet , and was replied to the next_day saying they had not .
F	today , 00 / 00 / 00 , i received an_email from missguided ' s customer care team saying that the item i wanted to exchange was out of stock and they have simply refunded me for it .
F	everything ' s totally fine , responses were quite speedy , and the refund was processed relatively quickly compared to most online companies i ' ve had to return stuff to .
F	all sounds great , shining customer_service ... until i noticed an " adjustment fee " deducted from my refund .
F	i have scoured their entire website , from their returns & exchanges policy to every_single section of their terms & conditions , and could not find any sign of the reason for this fee .
F	it is also suitably vaguely named - adjustment fee ?
F	what are they adjusting ?
F	it cannot be the fee charged for return shipping as i did not use their provided sticker , as i preferred to send it myself via another method .
F	i stated this in the cover letter included in the returns parcel as well as in the email sent to customer care .
F	then what could this mysterious fee be ?
F	it sounds very sneaky , and though it is not a great amount of money (£ 0 . 00 ), it is the principle of it that is the issue .
F	due to this bizarre " fee " deducted from my refund , i decided to check out their other claim - that the item i requested for exchange was no_longer in stock in the size i wanted .
F	lo and behold , on their website , the item is still available to purchase in the size i wanted .
F	working for an online_retailer myself , i know that if i was going to let a customer know an item was out of stock , i would ensure the item was listed as such on the website before emailing the customer .
F	this seems petty but can be a massive inconvenience as well as disappointment , and i know from both_sides of it that we do not want the customers to go through the hassle of changing their order or waiting for a refund , if we can help it .
F	i have emailed missguided ' s customer care team once more , requesting information of both of those issues , and wait eagerly for their response .
F	it really is such a shame as i was actually planning on making another order at the end of the month , but will no_longer be doing so .
F	update 00 / 00 / 00 : was emailed by missguided to say that the " adjustment fee " was actually the charge for returns postage , despite the fact that i told them i would not be using their sticker .
F	my returns sticker was hand - written , for christ ' s sake !
F	still do not understand_why they ' ve called it an " adjustment fee " rather_than " returns postage fee ", which would make it entirely less vague .
F	they also firmly stated that the product i wanted was definitely out of stock on their website .
F	funnily_enough , i checked there and then and found that not only is it still available , i could also add that particular item in that particular size into my basket and attempt to pay for it .
F	i screenshotted it with a timestamp , and sent it to them along with a requested proof of postage , which seems really petty of them for a mere £ 0 . 00 .
F	essentially their customer_service is a complete farce .
F	i really am disappointed as i was looking_forward to my next order come payday .
F	why bother when they ' ll probably do this all again if i find i have to return more unsuitable items ?
F	i made an order with a big online retail company who unfortunately use hermes .
F	the order was placed on a friday , and i was pleasantly_surprised to get a confirmation_email_saying the parcel had been dispatched on the saturday .
F	obviously i ' m not one of those idiots who think it might arrive the next_day because to paraphrase uncle vernon , " no post on sundays ".
F	on tuesday i tracked the parcel to see that it was supposedly at the depot , ready to be delivered on wednesday , which was also the day the retailer claimed it would arrive , latest .
F	the next_day , it was claimed to be " out for delivery " from 0am .
F	it did not arrive this day .
F	didn ' t think it would take over 00_hours to deliver it from a depot unless the depot was actually in scotland , but i patiently_waited another day without complaint .
F	tracking on thursday told me the same info , that somehow the delivery person must have been looking high and low for over 00_hours for a business address in central_london that received and sent post every_single weekday .
F	at this point i decided to try to contact hermes .
F	how silly and naive of me to think this would be a simple phone call or email .
F	after going through a bunch of faq questions , as if i wouldn ' t have already exhausted that resource , i reached an impasse - they were conveniently " contractually unable to discuss the order " with anyone other than the retail sender .
F	annoyingly the retailer does not have a " call_centre " ( considering i read on wikipedia that this company have over 000 workers , could they not even spare 0 to pick_up a phone ?
F	), so i emailed and facebook messaged them only to get unsatisfactory automated_responses .
F	still i had nothing to do but wait .
F	at 0pm today , the thursday of the aftermath , hermes updated their tracking page for the order .
F	" hallelujah !
F	", you might think .
F	no , it turns_out they deleted the part where it was apparently out for delivery , to replace it with " receipt at depot .
F	processed at depot ."...
F	which is exactly_what the previous two steps said .
F	which suggests to me that the delivery person could not be arsed to find my workplace , left it in the van for two days , then returned it to the depot , where my order still is as of 0pm .
F	hermes managed to deliver an order made by my sister , after i placed my order , from the same retailer , so it seems not all of their drivers are useless , but i ' d still give hermes a sad , singular star because not even bothering to try and deliver parcels is ridiculous .
F	i really hope all online_retailers take into account the fact that hermes continously receives 0 star_ratings and has an overall 0 star_rating ( i ' m sure it would be 0_stars if most people had their way ), and switch to a different , more reliable ( even if only slightly more ) courier .
F	nothing could be worse than hermes .
F	except maybe tom cruise ' s dead eyes .
F	i was recommended to getlenses ( postoptics at the time ) by a family_member who already purchased from this site .
F	it was around the time i first started wearing lenses , so i was dubious_about buying online when the deal with my opticians seemed so good !
F	it didn ' t take me long to realise that almost all opticians charge you heck of a lot more_than if you just purchased a year ' s worth online , even if you factor in solution .
F	there was also the whole_thing where i could choose what lenses i wanted to try , instead of what the opticians wanted me to try ( the most expensive ones !).
F	after 0 years of buying contacts ( of both clear and coloured varieties ) from getlenses , i would never look to anywhere_else .
F	i was drawn to charterhouse as i was in the market for a new , smallish tank for a betta ; i did so much research over various websites , even looking at used ads .
F	turns_out charterhouse was the cheapest around for what i wanted - even second - hand tanks the same size ( or smaller !)
F	cost more .
F	i made my choice to go with charterhouse , and i was assured that my tank + equipment would arrive on a tuesday .
F	and arrive on a tuesday they did !
F	it was well - packaged ( so much bubblewrap fun now ) and i am very satisfied .
F	even with one order taking longer_than_expected due to being short on some stock , they were kind enough to let me cancel the two out - of - stock items out of three in the order and refunded me for them , instead of cancelling the entire order and me having to order the third item again .
F	all in all , i would definitely shop at charterhouse again , and fully recommend it to others .
F	this is the first time i ' ve used lakeland ' s online ordering service .
F	bought a nespresso coffee maker .
F	it arrived within a matter of days , well_packaged and the transaction was absolutely hassle_free .
F	thank_you lakeland .
F	if i ' m looking for electrical products i will_definitely use you again .
F	five_stars !
F	placed an order with laura_ashley three_weeks_ago .
F	nothing arrived so rang last_week to find out when i could expect it .
F	surly customer_service peron said it was in the warehouse and ready to be despatched .
F	made me feel guilty for daring to ask !!
F	this morning i found it hadn ' t actually been sent " because they were very busy ".
F	sad really , over the years i ' ve spent so much money with this company , but as there are many alternatives who are so much_better and less expensive i don ' t think i ' d shop with laura_ashley again .
F	what the hell .
F	i ' m only a customer !
F	rarely have i seen such diabolical feedback anywhere than here .
F	surely we can ' t all be wrong !
F	i have already put a review on about this company and their response , as you will see is “ we believe customer guarantees should be guaranteed ( doesn ’ t make sense , i know ) and therefore would be happy to offer you a full_refund or free exchange and will also reimburse you for all your postage_costs .
F	“ i was then contacted someone in the complaints_department .
F	without_hesitation , i was offered an immediate full_refund which i was told would appear on my statement in four days , and a replacement pair as a goodwill_gesture ( which i declined ).
F	i returned the glasses and waited for the promised refund .
F	that was december .
F	in january , with no sign of the promised refund , i rang and spoke to emily the delightful customer_services manager .
F	she denied ever receiving the glasses back , nor that anyone other than her would have the authority to make such a promise .
F	she said unless i had it in writing , they would not honour the promise .
F	i found her very rude to deal with , constantly talking over me until i nearly lost the will to live .
F	subsequently i wrote to the md to make a complaint about my dealings with her and the firm in general .
F	no surprise i never received so much as an acknowledgment .
F	i expect he either needed her permission to respond or “ they never received the letter ”.
F	i have lost in excess of £_00 for glasses plus two lots of return_postage .
F	happily i now have a pair of glasses that are spot on from another firm .
F	if you ’ re happy to throw money away , go_ahead – buy from these_cowboys .
F	otherwise , stay_away !
F	i had never used double0_tickets before and i was dubious but the tickets i ordered last_week have arrived this morning by special delivery and i ' m over the moon .
F	great service and a realiable company , i will_definatley use them agian !
F	selected next_day delivery expecting it to arrive sat , for me to wear the clothing sat night .
F	it didn ' t arrive , no communication .
F	fair_enough sometimes this happens .
F	i expected it mondau and received an_email to say it would be delivered between_0am - 0pm - again it didn ' t arrive .
F	no card through the door , no email or phone call .
F	i had to call weds , both dx and ax paris to be told my full address wasn ' t adequate , their driver couldn ' t find my house .
F	lesson_learnt ; i need to be able to mind read !
F	i asked for the parcel to be delivered to my parents house , built over 00years , a fully established postcode ...... weds , no delivery ....... no email , no call ...... finally thurs it turns up .
F	a week_later than when i ordered and paid for next_day delivery .
F	i now have to return as the items have arrived far too_late .
F	and you want me to rate you ??!!!!!
F	!
F	bought plenty from jokers_masquerade before - never had any_issues :)
F	i just have to say that this site is amazing and i am so pleased with my products .
F	everything was in perfect_condition and the delivery speed is spot on .
F	and they keep you informed of how your order is doing .
F	the first time i ordered , one of the products wasn ' t available but they sent me something in exchange that was very close to what i wanted .
F	thats not something you experience form most online companies .
F	i will most definately keep using this site , thank_you so much :) xx
F	after finding a lovely engagement_ring on the high_street which cost far too much (£ 0000 ), me and my boyfriend decided to shop around after all it had to be right cost wise as well as being the one we wanted .
F	we were very scared about buying something so expensive on the internet , but can now say with 000_% confidence - that we have no_regrets in doing so .
F	in fact we are very glad we used infinity - jewellery . com .
F	they have a wide_range of engagement_rings and they allow you to customise your order .
F	we were impressed to find out that a very similar looking ring to the one we had seen on the high - street was available for just £_000 !
F	hoping for the best , we placed our order .
F	it arrived after 0 business days .
F	i really like the ring , it ' s stunning and even more beautiful than the photos on the web_site .
F	it came in a well - presented box and with all the relevant certifications .
F	the next week i actually took the ring along with the diamond certificate to a local jewellery store and they confirmed the diamond certificate .
F	so if you still have any doubts let me leave you with this , i ' ve told all my friends about this website .
F	a month has passed and i still cant_believe i have such a stunning engagement_ring !
F	rustic stone went above and beyond and turned a fantastic memorial stone around in record time !!
F	the stone was replicated perfectly to our design and will be a cherished memorial to our much loved nan !
F	would definitely reccommend and use again !
F	used a voucher_code from mighty deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
F	i am just glad that i hadn ' t actually spent £_00 on them , didn ' t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera ' s are wilting and the lilies don ' t look like they ' re even going to open !
F	wish i ' d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
F	i absolutley love surfdome , they have such a large range of clothes and accessories .
F	the sales are always great .
F	the prices they offer for branded clothes are great aswell as what they have to offer for its own_brand .
F	delivery prices are reasonable and often free with a voucher_code and returns are free aswell through collect +, and they accept nus so you can save even more .
F	cheap , good products , quick delivery and great idea to use bybox makes getting deliveries so much_easier .
F	i saw their ad while searching for a camera on amazon .
F	because of the competitive price they offered i decided to give this company a try .
F	and it turned_out that their service was amazing - very efficient and very responsible - at every_stage of the dispatch / delivery i ' d get an_email to confirm and reassure things were going fine .
F	i also received a text this morning stating the exactly time period my package should be arriving - and it did arrive on time !
F	it ' s been a very good experience shopping with them , and i would totally recommend bestcameras !
F	( this is actually my first time writing a review on any websites !
F	i just felt i had to give them some positive_feedback !)
F	i was really impressed with the speedy_delivery , i purchased the underfloor_heating for my ensuite and bedroom , great product .
F	the tile backing boards are almost half the price than in b_& q .
F	i would recommend this company without_hesitation
F	i ordered a pink floyd shirt which i could not find anywhere_else .
F	it arrived within the time specified and the quality was just as i hoped .
F	the sizing was just right , as i am always worried_about when buying online !
F	they have a few more rare designs that i intdend to purchase soon .
F	highly_recommended !
F	recently_bought an oil rig and a few glass dabbers from this company .
F	i am very impressed with the quality of the craftsmanship .
F	plus they have designs i have not seen anywhere_else , they actually are unique as claimed on the website .
F	prices are quite reasonable and shipping went fine also .
F	i highly_recommend this company .
F	recently received a handmade purse from that i ordered on esty .
F	was very happy with the item .
F	they make things so much_easier than ebay , if anyone has not heard of them do check it out .
F	will be ordering via etsy anytime i have to buy gifts !
F	i will be ordering again from btcsunglasses . com , i just got my first pair of fake ray - ban sunglasses from them and i am quite satisfied with the quality and price .
F	their selection is pretty extensive as well , i think i ' ll go for some fake oakley_sunglasses next .
F	i ' ve gotten some good deals but have also been burned by some sellers who sell counterfeit ... got to be_careful !
F	my favorite place to get the daily news and see what programs are on for the week
F	this site came up as the lowest_price for for an ipod_touch so i proceeded to place my order .
F	the item showed up the next_day in perfect_condition .
F	highly_recommended seller .
F	i was a little_dubious to begin with as id read a lot of bad_reviews , but within 0 weeks of ordering and over a month before the event , my tickets have arrived as promised .
F	will_definitely be recommending double0 to friends and family :)
F	brilliant price for some michael mcintyre tickets , ordered on friday_evening , arrived on tuesday , very fast service !
F	tickets came well ahead of show date too , very impressed
F	will_definitely be using double0 again !
F	very reasonable prices and speedy_delivery .
F	gorgeous flowers .
F	would recommend to others and definitely will be using again .
F	extensive choice for all ages , fast , free delivery , easy to negotiate website , great sales !
F	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
F	it is possible to list ads for items wanted aswell .
F	you can post free ads but if you want to promote your ad it will cost .
F	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
F	as with things like this always sell face to face and be_careful if you are unsure .
F	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .
F	there are jobs pages aswell .
F	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00 -£ 00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
F	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
F	when i have ordered online i have either had my item dispatched and recieved within 0 days or i have had to wait 0 days to be dispatched dispite it being in stock .
F	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
F	one item i did order was meant to be 0 discs but was only a 0 disc cd so they should probably check their product details .
F	not sure whether i would recommend their online service .
F	i think they are a great company and i have used them several_times when ordering beads and findings for making my jewellery for my site .
F	i have always had my items dispatched promptly and arrived within 0 days so i would highly_recommend .
F	brilliant site , i make jewellery so like to source interesting and different beads .
F	i have had to contact customer_service on one_occasion as i had something not turn_up , when i phoned they asked me what i would like to have sent as that has been out of stock and they posted it out and i recieved the next_day .
F	prices are reasonable and you can pay by paypal aswell which is great .
F	highly_recommended company .
F	i have used play . com for just over 0 years now and have always recieved excellent service .
F	when ordering pre_- orders they guarantee that the price if lowered is the price you will pay and also they do not take any money until it is ready to be dispatched .
F	i have recieved pre_- orders before the actual release_date on several_occasions .
F	most orders are delivered in 0 - 0 days from dispatch .
F	they now have a whole range of items from books , gadgets , toys and even electrical_items .
F	quick delivery of international dvds , never had a problem with them and great customer_service , all dvds are region 0 so ensure you player can play them .
F	prices can be a little high but there are no taxes to pay to ship them into the uk .
F	one to recommend .
F	so many bad_reviews online i should have listened to .
F	booked my car in on monday for a mobile fitting service of two tires , to come on wed ( the day before my pre_- booked pre_- paid mot appointment ) on tuesday got a call confirming the address and to say that i would get a call 00mins before the fitting ( which was in a 0 : 00 - 0 : 00 , time_slot ) wed came and i know i should have called earlier in the day but was giving them the benefit of the doubt , when i called late in the afternoon , they said they couldn ' t fit me in today and had changed the appointment to thursday and that he was surprised no one had called and let me know , all they could offer was to get someone to call me the next morning , which doesn ' t really work when i have an mot booked first thing .
F	pathetic customer_service especially for a large company , now i have to wait a week for a refund !
F	and am out of pocket on an mot i will fail .
F	have learnt my lesson and will stick to supporting the local community !
F	i have used them once before as well .
F	very easy , very quick , from filling in the online form to payment to my bank_account was less_than a week .
F	well it was one of those gifts that people never expect , and i gave it to a friend of mine .
F	her day was made !
F	she never expected a pillow with her face on it ahahahah !
F	well honestly , she loved it .
F	we are much_better friends now because of photoworld cewe .
F	thank_you thank_you thank_you .
F	you guys are the bomb !
F	:) xo
F	all the products are very affordably priced .
F	there is a wide_variety and a sundry range of products , items , gifts , flowers , sweets , and amazing other stuff to choose from .
F	the categories are truly incredible .
F	and last but never the least , the service is sweet , friendly , punctual , easy to manage , and very efficient , each time , every time .
F	this is awesome work , a gift to us .
F	thankyou .
F	everything was amazingly prompt !
F	thanks :) x
F	there service and customer care received through mazuma_mobile is second to none !, even after a handset has been sold mazuma_mobile keeps you fully updated excellent service and customer care !
F	best phone_recycling company there is !!
F	!
F	will be telling all my freind and family
F	just received the money .
F	it took a little longer_than i thought but i got the money .
F	sorry for bad review
F	very easy to use , it has a quick search_engine within the site , found exactly_what i wanted first time .
F	very user_friendly .
F	it was actually easier using this site than the hostel ' s own site !
F	it was also cheaper which is great .
F	it was really quick and easy to use , no confusion and need to double_check for a " catch " and the ten % payment means you don ' t have to hand over all your cash until you ' ve seen the place you are staying .
F	excellent service .
F	my email confirmation came through within about 00 seconds .
F	got a really good price on my order , better even than amazon .
F	delivery was fast , which was great as it was for a birthday .
F	very happy with the service from gamegears , will_definitely shop here again .
F	had a large hen group of 00 so knew i would need help organising such a big event .
F	after a long discussion with terri from the company over the phone we came to a decision that bristol would be the place for the group .
F	she was very helpful and let me know of any changes and updates very quickly !
F	the hen_do itself went very well , everyone agreed that it was excellent value for money : 0 star hotel including breakfast , 0 course_meal and drink , strip_show and nightclub_entry all for £_00 !
F	when we got to the hotel we realised that one room was around £_000 so excellent deal !
F	brilliant night had by all !
F	the only one negative i would have is the website .
F	some of my group did not receive emails even_though their emails address ' s were correct and some people were unable to get onto the website at all .
F	other than this we all thoroughly_enjoyed ourselves so thank_you very much chillisauce for taking the pressure off of me to organise such a big event !
F	invitations were beautiful and better_than_expected .
F	the order was delivered quicker_than_expected .
F	the packaging was wonderful .
F	to all the brides to be out there , use this site !!!!!
F	!
F	glasses are soooooooooo expensive but on this website there is something for everyone , for every price range !
F	it was so quick and easy to order and they were delivered within a couple of days !
F	absolutely love my glasses and sooo happy with them !
F	would totally recommend this website !
F	i have just placed my third order in as many weeks from animed .
F	their prices are so much cheaper_than our vets for exactly the same product .
F	my cat has recently had a bad case of fleas which is always costly but the indorex spray is half the price my vet charges and the free postage makes it better to order online .
F	also my cat is on royal_canin gastro food that i have been buying from my vets for over a year and paying £_00 for 0kg , today i have bought 0kg for £_00 . 00 from animed .
F	a massive saving .
F	their website is easy to use , i can always find what i need and checkout is so straightforward .
F	this really is a first_class website for your pet products !
F	many_thanks , received order today , really beautiful , have
F	a good and prosperous 0000 and you will be hearing from me again , excellent
F	service , well_done xx
F	i ' ve used all beauty several_times now .
F	they have a great range of products at very good competitive_prices .
F	very quick delivery and free postage which is brilliant .
F	all beauty will always be my first choice when looking for my favourite perfume .
F	can highly_recommend .😀
F	divine_trash is a lush shop that sells fantastic clothes at very reasonable prices .
F	you can buy outfits for every occasion .
F	they also have fab jewellry , shoes and make up too .
F	delivery service is quick and reliable .
F	the staff are wonderful and help you and give you great advice .
F	if you come to buxton make_sure you visit this lovely shop :-)
F	seriously do not use this scamming company !!
F	!
F	oh god i am fuming !
F	sent my old blackberry to this company to have the excessive cosmetic damaged email .
F	logged_onto cash0phones and to check status and there is was " excessive scratches to screen ".
F	sorry but not buying it .
F	the item was sent in very good condition for the age and was packed with bubble_wrap and posted off .
F	was offered £_00 now offered £_00 !!!!!
F	no chance !
F	and not prepared to pay £ 0 . 00 to have phone back .... which is just another way to rip someone off and get them to accept the very low revised price !!!
F	emailed them today and will wait_until tomorrow to see if i have a reply .
F	if not then i will get on the phone and let rip !
F	how can a company operate this way !!!
F	!
F	people do not use this company !!!!
F	my mission now it to make_sure as many people as possible know about this company ......... utter scam_artists !!!!
F	!
F	simply buy the things you normally would but click through topcashback and make some ' free ' cash .
F	simply fab !
F	the only_downside is it can take sometime ...
F	genuine products , great prices & prompt delivery .
F	all great !
F	easy to use website , simple process to post off my phone .
F	fab communication at every_step of the way via emails .
F	very speedy bank_transfer !
F	all in all faultless ...
F	my only worry is with royal_mail .
F	i made sure i posted my device special delivery for insurance level purposes .
F	i am very disappointed with the service which i received from this company .
F	i have used them many_times in the past however , on this occasion has changed my opinion i sent off a perfectly working phone with no damage !
F	however i was told this arrived with a cracked_screen !!!!
F	the fact they only give you a pathetic jiffy_bag and if dropped or chucked around by royal_mail can damage the goods i get penalised for it !
F	- what a joke so i was forced to accept a small amount for the phone or they return the damaged which has no value to me now .
F	secondly i wrote an e_- mail expressing my feelings as i disagree that i should be deducted the damage incurred through postage they haven ’ t even replied - what great service i re - sent the e_- mail 0 days_later as their auto response said a response within 00_hours and still no reply .
F	i put a read receipt on and a person called kayko ( or something like that read it and clearly just ignored it !
F	i have spoken to many people and this too has happened to them !
F	watch out as you won ’ t get what they offer you because apparently it will be damaged !
F	take photos of phone before sending to any phone place !
F	very good , had a problem which was immediately solved .
F	used partyrama a few_times & always had excellent service & superfast delivery .
F	i recommend them to all my contacts , i ' m a children ' s entertainer , & have heard_nothing but good feedback from them too .
F	out of all the places on the internet that i ' ve ordered from , truffleshuffle is possibly the best .
F	the products look great and are well - made .
F	the speed of delivery is second to none and the fact that they give you sweets with your delivery is just the cherry on top .
F	truffleshuffle ftw !
F	i was kept_informed at every_stage of process
F	quick sending of envelope and final cheque
F	got a good price for item , reflective of age and condition
F	would reccomend !!
F	!
F	easy to use website , fantastic communication , quick delivery and most of all the final product was amazing .
F	cant_wait to use them again
F	best things ever !
F	what a laugh for adults and kids !
F	great deal and friendly customer_service working round us customers !
F	highly_recommended
F	been with various phone companies but o0 is one of the best ive been with deals are very good and its very cheap .
F	would recommend .
F	hardly disspointed when i go in store i allways manage to find something i like .
F	baby clothes have very off sizes i brought a ' dress ' sized 00 - 00months to put away .
F	my daughter had one wear out of it at 0months old - as a top !
F	wouldn ' t recommend for baby clothes .
F	ordered a dress online .
F	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
F	i ordered a it a size larger and it was still hard to get on and off and was very short .
F	size ' s are not very accurate at all .
F	colours and design allways look different .
F	not very good quality for the price .
F	good item ' s all look very modern .
F	some are very overpriced but for soft furnishings very good value .
F	seem to stock alot better products in the usa then the uk which can be fustrating as your never able to get hold of them .
F	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0 days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn ' t recieve a new one .
F	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
F	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
F	still have not be able to sort out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either .
F	been ' sent ' out forms that have never arrived .
F	excellent food .
F	like the fact there is no service as your just left in peace .
F	chicken is always cooked to perfection !
F	did find the menu ' s hard to follow the first time i went but overall good value good food and nice relaxed meals .
F	went to buy last minuite party bits .
F	prices are all reasonable and not a bit of food left by the end of the night compared to stuff i had brought elsewhere !
F	left security tag on the side of case which caused the case to be unable to open had to return to store 0miles away to have them remove the tag only to be told that next time i should check before leaving the store like it was my job to do !
F	i find they are allways helpful when i go instore .
F	i ordered my travel system from them and it arrived on time and all in one parcel which i was happy about as the pushchair was very large .
F	i have experienced a couple of problems with the travel system but as it was brought while 0 months pregnant the are saying ' general issues due to use ' allthough its only been in use for 0 months .
F	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can ' t do enough to help you .
F	ordered some xmas presents online .
F	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
F	this has happened on two occasions .
F	and very overpriced !
F	0 small items for a 0month old .. over £_00 !
F	i recently brought a new mircowave from a curry ' s store .
F	the staff were absolutely awful !
F	i was sent all over the place to loctae this microwave and they didn ' t seem to care once the payment was allready made .
F	i ended_up in the store room at one point !
F	when someone finally took any notice of the issue and located the microwave after 00 minuites being in store , i was given the wrong one for less value !
F	i went back in once i had noticed the error and asked for a full_refund which in turn caused more issues .
F	i had to wait in a lenghty queue to even get any advice .
F	i would never go back there again .
F	placed an order with bhs direct online for a limited_edition stroller from cosatto .
F	found the stroller itself alot cheaper in other stores but decided to pay the extra to go with a store recognised .
F	i paid £_000 for the stroller on the 00 / 00 / 00 satisfied that the order would arrive withing the 0 - 0working_days as promised after the order was placed and paid for bhs then decided to email me stating that the 0 - 0 days wasn ' t going to be the case at all !
F	i recieved several emails from them about a number of issues to do with stock , items coming seperately etc .
F	so annoyed have been unable to go anywhere on the off chance a delievery is made and i miss it .
F	which i will then have to pay £_00 for re - delievery .
F	earliest im going to recieve the order now is the 00th ..
F	yet ive been getting emails stating .. ' item ' s dispatched in full ' for 0 days running now !
F	costomer service is awful .
F	the emessage system is completely terrible and doesn ' t work as it should .
F	disgusting service .
F	rude , sarcastic , manager aggressive towards me because shop assistants chose to bend rules - not my idea .
F	complete refusal to deal with issue because i bought the printer from a different store .
F	advised that i needed to resolve the issue with the store i bought the printer from ie .
F	return it to the isle of wight - a 0 hour journey including ferry costs far_greater than cost of a new printer .
F	that was only the tip of the iceburg .
F	been using this website to book all the hostels for a trip around america .
F	it ' s so easy to use , particularly love the map_feature so you can choose based on location .
F	being_able to see reviews so easily as well and have them broken down by categories like location , facilities is really handy
F	absolutely fantastic , never fault them , they always get the order right , always quick prompt delivery , i give them five_stars because they are worth them !
F	i purchased a few products one which was a fake tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn ' t happy with thatc
F	staying here was easy and very comfortable .
F	i stayed in a double deluxe room .
F	it had everything i needed and more .
F	the bed was huge and i had a really good sleep .
F	breakfast the next morning was great :) the hotel is just a 0 minute_walk from east ham station :)
F	no_complaints here , i ' d stay again
F	from start to end the service was quick and easy very fast pick_up , parcels undamaged and arrived quickly .
F	the online booking system was easy to understand and quick to use , would be my method of choice now .
F	even the emails from peter at the reviews team were polite and seemed to genuinely want to check everything happened at the highest_standard possible .
F	absolutely love my uglies baselayer - in fact i ' m considering buying more !
F	the site is easy to use and understand , i like the traffic light system for stock_availability .
F	would definitely order from barrington_sports again .
F	i did days and days of research into the best value bike for money and could not beat pauls cycles .
F	the price was hundreds lower_than elsewhere and delivery was hassle_free .
F	will certainly use again .
F	this " company " first contacted me claiming to be " calling from facebook " - not sure if that is even legal !
F	we were guaranteed a return on investment , 0 , 000 instant facebook_page " likes " and an advertising campaign where we could set our own demographics ( age , gender , etc ).
F	we returned nothing - zero , never received the full 0 , 000 likes ( received around 000 overall - mainly from people outside europe or who do not really exist - with fake profiles ).
F	we were also not allowed to set demographics ( being advised that they ' d know better - so we trusted to leave them to it ).
F	the advert that they put on facebook was the size of a thumbnail and almost laughable .
F	when sold the " service " we were informed that the price included vat ( assuming that means it ' s effectively 00_% cheaper since we can reclaim the vat ) - but it turns_out they are not even vat registered !
F	emails and calls are never returned .
F	we should have received a follow_up on the campaign 00 days into it - which never happened .
F	the only interest we received from new mount media was them up - selling - by trying to sell their website design services ( a ploy to let you believe that ' s why the marketing campaign isn ' t working ).
F	they managed to take an extra £_00 from us by doubling our advert from 00 , 000 to 000 , 000 - but never received an invoice - which we ' ve asked for several_times .
F	we were also supposed to receive performance reports for our campaign on day 00 - these were not received so we have no evidence that they even did the campaign which we paid for !
F	when expressing our concern about the marketing campaign they patronisingly point - blank denied all the promised services but said they ' d look_into it and improve the last few_days left of the campaign ....
F	but they did nothing .
F	we even cancelled our company debit_card to avoid any further charges .
F	save your money or go to an established , honest company .
F	i will update this review it the situation improves or worsens .
F	funky_pigeon lure you into a false sense of security by stating " royal_mail claim 00_% of first_class parcels are delivered the next_day " and then mention that we must allow up to working 0 days for delivery for first_class .
F	so you think " yeah , i ' ll risk it since it ' s 00_% likely to arrive on time ".
F	but it never does .
F	my " first_class " deliveries have always taken 0 - 0 working_days .
F	i have my own company and know for a fact first_class arrives next_day and only around one in 000 of my parcels ever arrives late ( so really there should be a 00 . 0 % chance it would arrive the next_day ) the truth : they ship them from out of the uk ( to save taxes ) hence the rubbish postal service .
F	they need to be more honest and stop leading people on .
F	it ' s false_advertising .
F	ordered a tambour office cupboard .
F	i took everything out of the packaging - only to find no instructions .
F	so further time wasted messing_around putting it all away ( as it was the evening so i couldn ' t get instructions ).
F	i emailed them to confirm the instructions were missing .
F	i received the instructions via_email and printed them off .
F	again , i took everything out of the packaging only to find incorrect instructions !
F	so , again , messed_around putting everything back away .
F	emailed them again - monday 00th of jan .
F	it ' s now the 0nd of feb .
F	guess_what ?
F	no reply and no instructions .
F	i ' ve had to pay a joiner to put the unit together ( as with his experience he could work out where everything goes ).
F	i ' ll never order from this company again as they ' ve caused me unnecessary cost and time wasting .
F	you can return your order for free ( not always if you do not buy direct from amazon ).
F	customer_service replies almost straight_away .
F	prices are often the lowest on the internet .
F	free delivery on all amazon fulfilled orders .
F	there really is nothing negative to say .
F	apart_from the odd delivery let - down - but usually that ' s the delivery company ' s fault .
F	the good : yes , prices are often the best on the net - but is it worth the hassle , slow delivery and lack of customer_service ...?
F	i have used zavvi many_times since they started up and have only had one order that was satisfactory .
F	they do not get pre orders to you on the day of release unless you pay a premium delivery rate .
F	customer_service is shockingly_bad - you have to contact them as many as four times until you get a reply .
F	my most_recent transaction resulted_in a paypal_dispute as they did not refund me for a returned item and ignored my emails .
F	as soon as you raise it with paypal , zavvi manage to respond instantly !
F	( perhaps they do not want to lose the paypal payment facility costing them valuable sales ?).
F	so unprofessional .
F	because of this , i recommend you pay by paypal incase they mess you around like they did with me ....
F	there have also been many occasions where zavvi take your order to later on state item is not in stock ( they don ' t tell you by email , you have to log_into your account to chase it up - and see it in your order history ).
F	they would happily leave it a year and not tell you when you could have ordered the item elsewhere in the meantime .
F	it is really not worth ordering from zavvi for the sake of saving a quid or two as the many minutes ( and sometimes even hours ) of time wasting involved in chasing it up is not worth it !
F	this is the second time over the last few_years great magazines has let me down .
F	my recent problem was ordering 00 months fhm subscription with free aftershave .
F	i ' ve contacted them 0 times since ordering chasing up my free gift ( it ' s now been nearly 00 weeks ).
F	i had had a few delivery dates promised to me (" allow up to x amount of days " etc ) and all those times have passed .... as far as i ' m concerned they make promises they cannot keep and the customer_service staff are generally liars !
F	update_: i have since received an_email_stating there is a delay with stock - thus confirming all previous emails from other employees were complete lies !!!
F	i think this may be delay tactics so that it ' s too_late to dispute with my credit_card .
F	never again .
F	states free shipping on website - but they charged me over £ 0 .
F	then marked my order as shipped .
F	didn ' t receive , so emailed them .
F	then i was told they have a stock issue and had to refund me .
F	very shady .
F	avoid !
F	easy to purchase itunes giftcards that are always cheaper_than the high_street .
F	can be downloaded directly from your account or by the link provided .
F	very reliable !!
F	!
F	amount received as quoted .
F	my only complaint is that you have to pay to send phone but still better value than selling it somewhere_else .
F	also kept_updated on status of payment etc .
F	recommended .
F	easy to order , has options for buy now , pay later or pay in instalments - choices to suit every pocket !
F	huge choice of goods , great value for money .
F	hostelbookers was a great place to start looking for my hostel for new_york .
F	i wanted to save as much money as possible for when i ' m actually there and not splurge on accomodation but was also quite keen to not be miles_away from all the attractions . i found hostelbookers to be cheaper_than other_websites and found the map_view quite helpful - being_able to see how long it would take to get from the hostel to everything i wanted to visit was a great help !
F	in terms of the actual booking once i had found my hostel it was really fast and straightforward !
F	a few issues in the past with delivery but has improved just need to insure when sending large logs the boxes are strong enough to hold the weight
F	emma , was wonderful .
F	i didnt know my way around the site and she sorted my quote for me and then went on to help me organise everything and i just had to click the link cornfirm and pay .
F	she did her job and hope the company can follow_up and get my parcel to its destination .
F	thanks emma !
F	!
F	i was thankfully referred to supplement_warehouse in the last_year and it has been an oasis in the desert of expensive and non catering supplement sites flooding the internet .
F	their prices are the lowest and if their not they will match and lower any sites prices by 0 % i mean is that real ... yes it is !
F	!... their shipping is ultra fast and 0 days a week if you dont give this website a chance youre doing yourself and your wallet and disservice .
F	easy site to use , good prices , excellent clothes .
F	will be coming_back time after time after time
F	great product , fast delivery , will_definitely use again
F	excellent experience of using speckyfoureyes . com at the start of december .
F	i ' d been needing an extra pair of glasses for a while ( i don ' t like to only have 0 pair due to breaking them in the past and being left blind as a bat in the process !
F	makes me nervous ).
F	i didn ' t want to settle for a very cheap pair of glasses from the high_street , i ' ve been meaning to get a rimless pair the last few_times but have always been put off by the price .
F	in the end i was able to get a rimless pair of specs for my prescription for literally a third of the price of the cheapest rimless pairs i ' ve been trying on in shops .
F	i would definitely use their service again .
F	i ' m actually surprised my glasses arrived so soon due to the christmas delivery backlogs that always hit at this time of year , but i ordered on the 0th_december and i had them on the 00th .
F	excellent !
F	!
F	i live in america and my mom lives in england .
F	i am never able to have flowers delivered to her due to the high prices i am usually presented with online .
F	i ' m really glad i found this place !!
F	i was able to send her a very nice bouquet of chrysanthemums and chocolates for an extremely reasonable_price , with free shipping !
F	she was overjoyed with them and said they were lovely .
F	i used the chat customer_service twice , and while i can ' t remember the names of those who helped_me they were very efficient .
F	i also liked the fact that they emailed me to notify me that the flowers had been delivered .
F	thank_you , i will_definitely be using your services again !
F	i am a regular customer at vio vets - their service is alway prompt / friendly / helpful
F	i would recommend them to every pet owner i meet .
F	no . 0 site for your pets
F	thankyou
F	vio vets
F	i love it to send 000 chars to my followers .
F	great invention .
F	:)
F	its d best social networkin tool , i found my many frnds here .
F	i love google apps
F	came to know abt protector thru one of my friend n was amazed to see performance .
F	had a problem aftr installation n contacted live support , issues were handld quickly .
F	wil strongly_recommend to all my frnds n colleagues .
F	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother ' s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
F	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .
F	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
F	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
F	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
F	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
F	we have just returned from our_wedding in cyprus and used silk_blooms to purchase our flowers .
F	the service we received from the beginning has been fabulous , mara would do anything to help you ( i kept adding on bits and bobs up to the last_minute ) and nothing was a hassle for her .
F	our flowers travelled perfectly to cyprus and back to scotland .
F	i would use silk_blooms again and would thoroughly_recommend them to anyone !
F	i have ordered roman_blinds from this company .
F	the blinds are great quality and their customer_service is also highly valued .
F	after ordering online i changed my mind and wanted a different_colour and they changed it for me which was very nice .
F	all in all i highly_recommend this company if you want to buy quality blinds .
F	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
F	just a quick message to thank one of your employees who i spoke to over the phone today at 00 . 00pm called rup .
F	he was absolutely fantastic and was a real pleasure to talk to !
F	he was kind , thoughtful and could very easily put himself into the shoes of the customer - i felt very comfortable dealing_with him .
F	he informed me that i could go down to a £_00 a month_contract ( saving me £ 0 a month !)
F	and even added on 000 extra minutes for me for the first 0 months - for free !
F	to help me with the transition of going down to a smaller tarrif .
F	he let me know that i have 0 magic numbers to add on to my account and also answered all my questions about splitting my account .
F	very helpful , knowledgable and a real credit to the company !
F	so thanks very much rup !
F	hope to deal with more people like you in call_centres in the future .
F	kindest regards ,
F	one very happy customer
F	it is my cousins wedding on friday but i work every weekday so i decided to order from missguided . co . uk as it is so convinient and there are some lovely and inexpensive dresses .
F	i spent roughly 0 - 0 hours on tuesday on the website and eventually found a dress that i loved !
F	i added the dress to my basket only to find when i entered the basket it had suddenly vanished ?
F	i continued to try to add it to the basket but it just kept disappearing .
F	after about 00_minutes i could no_longer view the particular dress on the website at all in no way whatsoever !
F	it was as if the dress had vanished off the face of the website !
F	i then managed to find the dress and add it in a smaller_size but was worried it wouldn ' t fit so ordered two other dress aswell in the hope that one would be suitable .
F	i also ordered a pair of shoes , this came to over £_000 .
F	i sent a message to missguided expressing my disappointment .
F	i also included a message on the delivery asking for a size 00 if possible .
F	then , i opened the website later that evening to show my boyfriend the 0 dresses , another different dress had vanished off the face of the website but the one i loved had suddenly reappeared .
F	out of curiosity i tried to add it to my basket in a size 00 and voila !
F	it worked !
F	i was astounded but also very annoyed at the same time .
F	i knew that to ensure this dress would fit i needed it in a size 00 so i decided to order it again and figured i would just send the size 00 back for a refund .
F	however , i wanted the free next_day delivery so it would all arrive together .
F	so , i also ordered a blouse and this order came to over £_00 .
F	that is over £_000 in all .
F	i sent another message to missguided expressing my extreme frustration of being ignored and how annoyed i was that all of a sudden the dress is back on the website and available to order in my size .
F	this is where i am livid .
F	i started work today ( thursday ) at 0 o_clock and my dad was in the house all day and nobody came , the doorbell wasn ' t rung and the door wasn ' t knocked .
F	i got home from work at around 0pm to find a dx delivery card through the door saying the 0 parcels were " at top of stairs " - as there is a fire escape outside of my front_door .
F	ummmm there is no parcel in my supposed " safe_place ".
F	i have checked on the stairs , with my neighbours , the vicinity of my porch , everywhere and there is nothing to be found .
F	i can only assume the courier has misplaced the parcel or it has in fact been stolen through no fault of my own .
F	there was no time written on the card , no other details were provided and i wasn ' t even aware i even had a safe_place ?
F	i assumed i would have to sign for the two parcels if i was not in but somebody was in all day !
F	now , i have to take a day off work tomorrow to go into_town and buy a dress for my cousins wedding on friday .
F	i am £_000 out of pocket .
F	looking at all these reviews i do have to wonder ... will i ever get my refund ?
F	i doubt it .
F	never order from this company ..
F	i know i won ' t make that mistake again !
F	i am one extremely_unhappy customer to the point of crying .
F	thanks alot missguided .
F	:(
F	and if you do read this lisa harris , i will be writing to trading_standards about this and will not hesitate to contact bbc_watchdog which i ' m sure a lot of your unsatisfied customers would be happy to write too aswell .
F	the service was a * from beginning to end .
F	will be using them again and would recommend to everyone .
F	terrible , i have been made to wait in for deliveries that never arrive , then they are cancelled then turn_up .
F	i then have to wait in for yodel to come and collect and wait in for booked collections for them to not arrive .
F	glad to not be holding my breath .
F	finally collected .
F	yet i have had to do all the chasing spending god_knows_how many hours on the phone to these_idiots who are absolutely no help .
F	get told in emails i have to phone to rebook , and they don ' t reimburse disgruntled_customers when they have wasted much of their precious time through their own stupid faults .
F	i will never ever again order something from very or any other associated catalogues they have .
F	really wouldn ' t shop here if you paid me millions , not worth the hassle , time or stress dealing_with a bunch of ....
F	totally_unacceptable and guess_what they couldn ' t care less !
F	great website at great prices .
F	will certainly use them again and recommend to others !
F	i ' ve used nature ' s best 0 times and every transaction has been seamless .
F	they have great products and offer good value for money and prompt delivery .
F	my orders are shipped abroad to eastern europe and they still arrive in good time .
F	can ' t fault them .
F	wish all internet companies were this good .
F	a very similar experience to everyone_else .
F	was offered one price on the internet , which was then reduced due to ' wear and tear '.
F	my payment was ' processed ' on may 00th but i still_haven ' t received it .
F	it ' s now 00 working_days since processing began , much longer_than the 0 to 00 days they guarantee .
F	there must be a financial gain for them to hold on to our money as long as they possibly can .
F	communication is dire and i get the same generic email every time i chase .
F	this company is appalling .
F	my sister used mazuma_mobile and had a fantastic experience , i wish i ' d done the same .
F	i have never been one to successfully stay on a ' diet ' but now i wouldn ' t change it for the world .
F	popping across to the group for support is such a valuable part of my day , i would miss not being part of it .
F	i feel_like i have made friends with everyone in the group .
F	the ordering_process is easy and all staff are quick to deal with queries ( but i never really have them ) love it x
F	easy to order , arrived quickly and exactly_what my furry friend needed .
F	i will_definitely be back .
F	thank_you
F	ordered a bouquet of roses , lilys and sunflowers for my mum on mothers_day , selected the delivery date of mothers_day .
F	recieved email the day before mothers_day stating they would be delivered today ?!
F	this was obviously not what i wanted so i contacted them ( have not yet recieved a reply to the first contact i made ).
F	saturday_morning the flowers arrived at my mums house , mothers_day she opened them .
F	what had arrived was a disgusting bunch of yellow and white carnations !!
F	!
F	now everyone_knows that carnations are probably the cheapest flowers available .
F	i used to work in a florist and so know this too well !
F	my mum hates carnations !
F	so do i and had i known this is what would be classed_as the subsitute for a bunch of gorgeous roses , lillys and sunflowers .
F	i would never had ordered in the first place !!
F	!
F	i contacted i florist on mothers_day to voice my disgust ... 0 days_later no reply ... contacted them again saying i have now sent two emails and recieved no reply .... no reply for another 0 days !
F	contacted them again ... no reply !
F	finally after two_weeks i recieved a generated message which must be sent to all saying they are sorry and value customer feedback ( which they dont ) i replied to this message again saying how i am not happy both with the deleivery date , the flowers , their service , basically everything about them !
F	didnt receive a reply for another couple of days !
F	then finally i am offered " a maximum gesture of £ 0 . 00 voucher " which is obviously no use to me as i will not ever use them again !
F	i am still in the process of actually recieving a reply that is from a real_person ... looking exactly at my case and not just copying and pasting their ready made responses to complaints !
F	i sent pictures of the flowers i had received but this has not been mentioned at all .
F	the proof is there , just wish i could upload the pictures on here somehow to show you all .
F	please do not use them - they will ruin whatever occassion you are sending them for and then do not even bother to reply to your complaint unless you do all the chasing .
F	there are so many other genuine and caring florists available with great prices that wont let you down ... use them not iflorist !
F	great products , great prices , great service - what more is there to say ?
F	very quick transaction , the whole_process , from booking the order online , to receiving the money in my bank took about 0 days !
F	very impressed , i wish i had more old_phones to sell !
F	most of the time my items have arrived so quickly i couldnt_believe it !
F	one time it took a while and i doubted it would come but it did .
F	be_careful who you are buying off and pick somebody with good credibility and you should be fine .
F	great for selling too and your items get lots of attention .
F	excellent service , got the money very quickly and got the amount my phones were valued at .
F	was very pleased i was able to make money from my broken phones !
F	i searched for the best site to find hostels at , and i am glad i went with hostelbooker !
F	there was no booking_fee , and i was pleasantly_surprised to see how cheap the hostels were ; i thought it would be significantly more_expensive .
F	it ' s a big weight off my shoulders to know that i ' ll have somewhere to stay when i land in germany !
F	my kiddies love coming to funky_rabbit to play upstairs and to the cookery and craft club :-) my son used to hate having his feet measured and trying on shoes but funky_rabbit were friendly , helpful and reassuring to the children - and now he_loves it :-)
F	definitely_recommend it to all - go and see for yourself :-)
F	i was really happy with mazuma as it was all done so quick and easy and its exactly how its advertised so have no_complaints and completely_satisfied
F	i was really happy the way one of the staff booked my tickets . he was really helpful , kind and very professional .
F	its actually the second time i ' m booking my ticket with the same staff and i could ' t be more happy with the excellent service provided ,. definitely i will be booking with travel house uk in the near_future and i will recommend to friends and family .
F	thanks so much for all your help .
F	i have ordered from here multiple_times .
F	my items have come on time and in proper condition .
F	best price on the web at the time .
F	despatched quickly .
F	well_packaged .
F	would recommend .
F	this is the second time i have used ao . com to purchase a large appliance and it won ' t be the last .
F	excellent customer_service and unbeatable_prices .
F	was able to choose a delivery day that suited me .
F	was given a 0 hour_slot so i didn ' t have to hang around the house all day .
F	delivery guys were friendly .
F	would highly_recommend !
F	great prices , easy to navigate website & fast response .
F	the only problem is that the packages sent out for delivery are sometimes too small .
F	the same size of package is sent out for six phones as well as ten phones .
F	it can be a tight squeeze sometimes .
F	i used the stag and hen for my sisters_hen_do , we decided to go budapest on weekend of 00 june .
F	the experience from start to finish was absolutely superb - i dealt_with michael throughout and he could not have been more accommodating .
F	from planning the whole trip for us and anticipating any changes we wanted to make .
F	the activities were brilliant - value for money was great !
F	they really thought of everything !
F	i will_definitely be recommending this company and i could not be_happier with the service i received .
F	i cannot thank michael and the team enough !
F	!
F	bought a bottle of blue label for my boyfriend - and opted to get it engraved !
F	delivery was quick and efficient and the engraving turned_out brilliant !
F	great rc site , so many products and excellent delivery .
F	always on hand to answer any_questions or gift advice for my other half .
F	would recommend them over many other online companies .
F	like many people on here , i ordered mother ' s day flowers for delivery to france last_week .
F	despite numerous_calls and reassurances , no flowers were ever delivered .
F	they are now " looking into it ".
F	i have asked for a refund - according to my consumer_rights , if a delivery date was agreed ( which is was ) and the goods have not arrived by that date , that is a breach of contract and you can request your money back .
F	i have been told someone will call me back in the next three days !
F	i have reported this company to watchdog and would advise any other uk citizens to do the same .
F	they cannot be allowed to get away with this awful service !
F	ps you will notice after how every bad review there are a flurry of 0 star ones , all sounding quite alike !
F	apparently iflorist have already been investigated for posting their own excellent reviews .
F	this website was easy to search for the kind of hostel i wanted .
F	i could choose the area , the type of room , or by price .
F	sorting by ratings worked really well because lots of past customers have left helpful reviews about the hostel .
F	i felt i was getting a good price for a place i trusted because of what other people have said .
F	had a problem with my glasses and when i contacted customer_services they were less_than helpful .
F	i wouldnt recommend them to anyone i know .
F	since i booked my group booking it has been nothing but problems with their staff ignoring emails to the point where people booked elsewhere instead of going with us .
F	we got transferred to a " manager " that also ignored our emails and still we are getting daily phone_calls demanding " outstanding money " that isnt outstanding and being told we will loose our booking and all our money if we dont pay up the imaginary money due .
F	every time i ask to talk to management i get fobbed_off onto another " manager " that can barely_speak_english and doesn ' t answer any_questions or sort out the problem .
F	never ever book with this company
F	i can ' t say anything bad about this company .
F	hilda is a credit to the company and has been fantastic throughout the whole_process .
F	they are very efficient and fast .
F	i really can ' t fault them .
F	i would definitely_recommend them to anyone .
F	truely fantastic .
F	thank_you so very much .
F	ian

F	highly_recommended company , will_definitely use again !
F	i have shopped with this company a few_times now , and i have never been disappointed .
F	their products are excellent quality , and their delivery service is the best around !
F	i ordered late_afternoon , my item arrived next morning .
F	great service , i can recommend to everyone !!
F	!
F	i needed to buy a new washing_machine as mine had broken .
F	as i have 0 children under the age of 0 , i thought i would ring and see if the one i wanted was in stock and the earliest delivery date .
F	the girl i spoke to said to book it online for the soonest available date ( over a week away ) and she would move the date forward for me .
F	i did this but unfortunately my washer did not arrive .
F	it was 0pm so i thought i would call and ask if it had been dispatched .
F	there had been a mix_up with the paper work .
F	matthew , the customer_service guy , offered me a refund straight_away .
F	he explained the refund could take up to 0 working_days or i could wait untill the online delivery date for my machine to be delivered .
F	i explained that i didn ' t want a refund but was there any way it could be delivered sooner as i was drowning in dirty laundry with 0 small children .
F	he said he would call me back in a few moments .
F	to be honest , i didn ' t expect him to .
F	i was very pleased and suprised when he called within 00_minutes .
F	they would send my washer by courier for delivery and it arrived within 0 working_days .
F	everyone makes mistakes .
F	some companies don ' t seem to want to fix theirs but beyondtelivision . co . uk went out of their way to ensure i had my washer and fix their error .
F	from the first time to the last time i spoke to them , they were friendly , polite , professional and most of all they apologised .
F	not many companies do that nowadays .
F	despite their delivery mix_up , i would definately_reccomend them to anyone .
F	the service was brilliant and my washer was cheap .
F	i paid £_000 with free delivery too !
F	!, its on sale at currys for £_000 .
F	lg f0000td , go to google_shopping and check it out .
F	i ' m a very happy lady .
F	in these tough times every_penny counts !
F	thank_you beyondtelevision and thank_you to matthew .
F	i ordered a nania cosmo sp carseat with them , it arrived very poorly packaged , without paperwork and without working harness buckle alarm .
F	poor communication afterwards , had to send them the same email over and over again , unwilling to offer a swap in spite of having plenty of the same carseats in stock when i notified them of the fault , and their phonelines are constantly_engaged .
F	the hassle is not worth the cheaper prices !
F	after having major_issues unlocking my iphone 0 ( that was locked to 0 who refused to unlock it ) i went_ahead and used this company fast simple and reliable and will_definitely .
F	recommend to anyone who needs there iphone_unlocked .
F	hostelbookers is much_better_than other budget accommodation resources ( no need to mention names ) because a . the website is more user_friendly and b . it ' s cheaper .
F	i have used it for years without any_problems and have recommended it to my friends over and over again !
F	produtcs are not the best quality , but they ' re not very expensive either , so you do get what you pay for .
F	customer_service is excellent .
F	i ' ve never had any_problems with boohoo .
F	great gift .
F	delivery was very fast .
F	i did not know how good the image would be , but it was excellent .
F	would definately recomend to anyone .
F	absolutly stunning perfume - got an extra disount on 000ml smells gorgeous great for day or night - gets some great comments
F	got a stunning lec fridge_freezer delivered .
F	marks_electrical let me no exactly when delivery would be , i recieved conformation of delivery time the day before so could still plan to go out .
F	the driver called to let me no he was 00_mins away and was very friendly .
F	cant_fault this service is second to none .
F	wow !
F	everything is organised and i was very impressed .
F	thanks so much for a hassle_free shop that i will be reccommending and will definatly be using again .
F	thanks guys
F	this is the easiest_way to book accommodation anywhere in the world .
F	it ' s easy to use , the layout is simple but informative and quick to use .
F	online ordering was straight_forward , picked_up at the airport took 0 mins - rate comparable with asda etc if ordering online first
F	will_definately come back !
F	!
F	quick service , quality products , regular discounts
F	i received a tin vase worth less_than £ 0 when i was meant to receive a vase that i paid £_00 . 00 for with my purchase of flowers .
F	i contacted the complaints centre and offered to return this vase as it was clearly worth less_than was advertised .
F	however all i received were some cut and paste replies from the company that completely denied any wrong doing .
F	i ' ve sent three responses to this email over a period of three_weeks and have received no reply from them at all - what horrendous customer_service .
F	i shall now be reporting them to the office of fair_trading for misleading marketing .
F	absolutely deceitful and awful company - do not use !
F	i have been a customer of t - mobile for about a year , i have never had any_problems to contact them about , so really no no issues at all for a while .
F	until i made the horrific mistake of getting my boyfriend involved in a contract with t - mobile .
F	my problem with t - mobile has escalated for so long , that it is hard to even talk about it without feeling extremely frustrated .
F	all i really want to say , is that if you ever have an issue with t - mobile please do not expect to get any type of customer_service from them .
F	0 ) they obviously have no interest at all in looking after their customers , new or existing , because they simply do not train their staff sufficiently to deal with issues correctly , at the very least to give you the right information .
F	0 ) even when they have made an error and they know it they will promise to fix things but this sadly never happens .
F	to the point that after 00th complaint to fix subsequent problems that have risen from their lack of training and their customer_services complete ineptitude to deal with even the simplest requests , you still have solved nothing .
F	0 ) you then try to speak to someone higher up after you have exhausted all other avenues .
F	only to find that even this is not possible .
F	to finalize t - mobile have cost me and boyfriend a huge_amount of money , time and energy , they have driven me to rage , and still the problem is not fixed after nearly a month of calls .
F	after the many issues with just receiving the handset , my boyfriend never received his phone in the end , and he explained to t - mobile that he did not want to use t - mobile because they had let him down before even he had started his contract with them , and they still had the cheek to ask for a cancellation charge , and debited his account with his monthly charge .
F	i have never written a review about any company , however the experience i have had with t - mobile has been so bad i just had to share it .
F	i very much doubt t - mobile will do anything about this .
F	i really do not think they care as long as they are making money !!
F	!
F	that ' s the impression i get !
F	very sad !
F	i have used wonga on occasion and never had a problem , until recently that is !
F	i had a loan and my circumstances changed so i called and arranged a payment plan , i stuck to it and decided to pay it off early as my situation had improved , cue the trouble !!!!
F	wonga charged me £_00 . 00 over what was due , then when i rang to request a refund , was told she would send it to their investigation team but can ' t guarantee it !
F	i explained that was fine as i had proof so if my money wasn ' t returned i would contact the appropriate services , got told to call back in 00_hrs .
F	when i called back , i got fed some rubbish about how things don ' t work the same at weekends the processes are slower , which i told them was not acceptable as they had taken my money fast enough so i wanted it sorted , got asked to call back in 00_hrs , did that and was told i could have a refund but it would take 0 - 0 working_days to get to my account !
F	again , explained that they clearly have the ability to send fast payments as they do for their loans but was banging my head against a wall and had to just wait , at_least my account was clear ???
F	when i finally received the refund , i decided to check my account for some reason , luckily i did as the cheeky sods had put the money they had refunded me , due to taking money they shouldn ' t have , back onto my account with a message_saying ' we are disappointed you haven ' t kept to your payment plan , your account is in arrears of £_00 . 00 !!!!!!!!
F	again called and complained , got through to a very helpful man who understood and said he would sort it and my account would be rectified in ' 00_hrs ' i explained that i thank him for his help but this is ridiculous as it ' s my credit_rating getting affected !
F	00_hrs later still not been done , if i hadn ' t of checked i wouldn ' t have known , their balls up yet i have to ' wait 00_hrs ' every time i call !!!!
F	i wonder if they would ' wait 00_hrs ' if i didn ' t pay and they called me to be told ' things don ' t work the same on the weekend the processes are slower ?'
F	it can take a lifetime to build a good reputation , but only seconds to ruin it , well_done wonga , with your attempts at sly money taking , refunds that get put back onto peoples accounts , and your standard ' 00 hour wait between phone_calls , i think yours has well and truly been smashed to pieces !
F	and as for ' historic miscalculations ' and ' people overpaying by no more_than £ 0 ' as stated in your press statement , where i come from , £_00 . 00 is much more_than £ 0 and i wouldn ' t class last_week as historic !!!
F	total joke !
F	i ordered some hay fever tablets ( 0yrs supply for £ 0 . 00 ) after being alerted to the deal by a hot deal app .
F	i had never used this company before but can_honestly say i will_definitely be using it from now on !
F	the prices are fabulous and the service is absolutely_brilliant .
F	the check out process was simple , i was emailed to let me know my order had been accepted , and again when it had been processed and dispatched .
F	the order was in my hand within 0 working_days and it was exactly_what i ordered .
F	not often nowadays you have companies that are easy to use , sell things at a great price , send you the correct order , after keeping you fully updated with what ' s happening ( ie processed - dispatched ) and i could honestly give 000_% to !
F	thank_you very much , i will be back again soon :-)
F	this company is brilliant , the app is easy to use and it ' s fairly_priced with a wide_range of cards etc to choose from .
F	has never let me down and i have ordered lots off here , a lifesaver for when i remember a birthday in a few_days !!!
F	would recommend them to anyone great product and service
F	had to stop using my catalogue company as after 0 years of using then with not a single fault they have changed their delivery company to hermes .
F	from my first order after the change i have had nothing but grief parcels never turn_up , get told the neighbours have them , ' lewis at number 0 ' apparently , surprise_surprise no lewis at number 0 and definately no parcel , other parcels have ended_up in this magic place the couriers ' deliver ' them to , obviously their homes as i don ' t ever receive sod all when this company is involved , so after proving i haven ' t received sod all i have got my money back and will not be using my catalogue or hermes again , shame really as my catalogue is a bloody good company but ruining their reputation working with hermes - ps would have been no stars but wouldn ' t let me !
F	!
F	i was looking to purchase some life insurance for myself and didn ' t know where to start i emailed protect line and they rang me straight back and arranged a convenient time to call me for a longer chat .
F	they called again when arranged and talked me through the various policies and covers available on an information only basis so no hard sell and nothing signed upto in the call .
F	when i decided which one i wanted protect line done everything for me and kept me informed every_step of the way , they also helped_me arrange trustees and beneficiaries regarding my life insurance etc so i could say exactly who my money went to and how much , should the worse happen !
F	i have had contact numbers that are answered very quickly ( 0 - 0 rings ) and very politely and have been treated as an important individual throughout , not like just another customer like most companies !
F	all in all i cannot_fault this company and would recommend them to anyone !!!
F	thanks protect line
F	ordered many items from amazon and always foudn them to deliver on time and the right good !...
F	keep up the good work !
F	ordered a pair of snow goggles for a last_minute skiing trip ...
F	i was cutting it a bit fine ordering so late but the goggles arrived next_day which i was over the moon with !
F	the stockholm goggles are great and a very wide_choice of colors !
F	perfect !
F	received my new glasses yesterday , delivery took the time stated on their website so very pleased !
F	they are fantastic quality and a great style , and an amazing price !
F	most definately using them again and recommended to all my friends already !
F	i had to place my order through chat as something was not working quite right online and the staff_member who assisted was very patient and helpful .
F	i was sending three packages from the uk to the us and was worried that one was too heavy and large .
F	this wasn ' t a problem at all for p0g .
F	when customs got involved and required more information p0g contacted me promptly and gave me a detailed list of what i would be needing to get my package from customs to my door .
F	all in all , it is a good service with excellent customer_service and safe .
F	you can also track your order online through them or the carrier .
F	i used postagesupermarket to send 0 medium boxes from the uk to the us ( london to los angeles .
F	the packages all arrived in 0 business days .
F	the driver / collector was very nice and helpful .
F	i had absolutely no_problems with their service and the cost for shipping was way less_than their competitors and significantly less_than royal_mail .
F	although this company provides cheap insurance it is obvious that the company is lacking in morals .
F	on monday night my phone was stolen after being assaulted by a male in a nightclub .
F	after the stress of the incident i went home and went to cancel my mobile phone insurance the next_day , only to find out that this company only allows you 00_hours to do so or else your insurance is not validated .
F	i think this policy is absolutely_disgusting .
F	i am a female student living away from home and am one of the only people left here for summer , i had no phone to cancel my phone .
F	i am extremely angry that i can not have a replacement after the horrible circumstances which i had to deal with and am outraged that i have been paying £ 0 . 00 a month for effectively nothing .
F	i spoke to my mobile network_provider and they believe the 00 hour cancellation period is also rediculous as they allow 00_hours , a realistic amount of time .
F	i will be posting this message across as many forums as possible to spread the word on what a disgusting , robbing company you are .
F	i wrote an awful review about this company a while ago , but in the mean time daryl had got in touch with me , he was very apologetic and had been away and that ' s why i couldn ' t get in touch with him .
F	he was so sorry he gave me a full_refund and sent me out some underlay for free .
F	thanks daryl .
F	he ' s a family run business and i ' m sorry i wrote such a horrible review .
F	thanks again for solving this matter daryl .
F	i appreciate it .
F	mazuma were very quick and very reliable , i sent my phone off in the post and 0 days_later the money was in my account .
F	brilliant service .
F	i also sent another phone off to envirophone to which they said the phone has a slight air line crack in the camera lense to which they offered me under half of what they said i would be given this has happened twice now with envirophone .
F	i dont reccomend any one uses them .
F	where as muzuma are fantastic ive tried them a few_times now and they are fast reliable and are exactly_what they say they are but a bit better .
F	defininatly use muzuma mobile !
F	u cant go_wrong .
F	im a very satisfied customer !!
F	!
F	competitive_prices , quick delivery , all_round good service
F	i recently made an order over amazon , sadly the order was directed through yodel for delivery .
F	they are terrible they posted a card through my door as i was at work when they attempted the delivery , i then rang the number to reschedule the delivery .
F	unfortunately i could not speak to anyone it was a computer operated voice who directed me to the website to reschedule at no point did i get put through to an operator .
F	i rescheduled twice waited in all day till_0pm as they can deliver upto this time it never arrived , i decided in the end to visit the depot which i managed to find online not via there website which does not even have a contact number .
F	when i arrived at the depot , they told me the website did not work and so my rescheduling would never have happened as the are not informed by the site of changes and they had sent my parcel back even_though it had not even been ten working_days .
F	they are absolutely usless and clearly not interested in customer_service !!
F	!
F	webtogs is such an easy site to use with so many different good quality products and the info to back the product up especially if your looking for particular qualities , would definitely_recommend it !
F	gear for girls is a great site for all outdoor products dedicated to women , i always know that i will receive a great product and a great service !
F	if you like shopping online then topcashback is for you .
F	simply shop via the site and earn money .
F	it really is a no_brainer .
F	it is amazing how 0 % here and 0 % there adds up to big bucks !
F	super_fast , super easy and superb products .
F	thank_you !
F	i contacted paul at hospitality_finder a few weeks_ago enquiring_about the england vs wales rugby game at twickenham .
F	he was extremely_helpful and was always available to speak too .
F	everyone who went had a great day .
F	i would definately_recommend paul and use hospitality_finder again .
F	used gd twice now and i can ' t fault them .
F	my first pair were my sunglasses purchased in august_0000 .
F	i thought they were good value although a bit darker than i expected but that ' s my error of judgement .
F	( perfect for a hangover though ) i use them for driving especially when the sun is low in winter !
F	!
F	just had my last order arrive today just 0 days after ordering !
F	( i have a very simple prescription , more complex ones can take longer ) both frames fit_perfectly .
F	prescription is spot on .
F	0 pairs for £_00 !
F	000 on £_00 frame plus a special valentines discount for being an existing customer !
F	all my family wear glasses and i have strongly recommended to all of them !
F	i would recommend them to my loved_ones if i thought it was anything less_than the best quality !
F	keep up the good work x
F	the best nights_sleep i ' ve ever had .
F	great price , great service worth every_penny !
F	i have studied with rdi for the past two years , i have no_regrets .
F	i have enough time on my hand where i will work , have fun and i still have time to study flexible , because of the 00_hrs online system , where i can log in at any time , i wish per day .
F	the prices are not just affordable but you get your monies worth .
F	my tutors supported and guided me all the way .
F	my friends if you are looking_forward to study and your don ' t want to leave your homeland to go campus , and you just want to study flexible at an affordable price and still do all your other activities , i recommended rdi to you .
F	the quality teaching that you receives will help you to upgrade yourself and get you a better salary .
F	rdi did it for me and it can certainly do it for you .
F	as some other reviews have said i would have given 0_stars if this was an option .
F	never have i had so many frustrations with a company !
F	i booked flights through bravofly in early march , immediatly after booking my partner found cheaper flights elsewhere .
F	in an_automated e_- mail i had received and on the reservation screen a message advised that until the flight is confirmed by the airline you can cancel .
F	i attempted to cancel as the staus clearly showed the flight was waiting confirmation , however a message appeared saying this was not possible and to contact customer_service .
F	the office was closed so first thing monday_morning i called them , i spoke to a gentleman who advised the flight would be canceled and a full_refund minus € 00 would be issued .
F	0 days_later i was still having conversations with bravofly as i hadn ' t recieved any confirmation of a cancellation or refund .
F	fast forward 0 months and after numerous e_- mails with screen prints of the messages i had receieved ( for some reason bravofly couldn ' t view this in any format other than in the e_- mail text but were reluctant to let me know this ) and an offer of a € 00 euro refund bravofly advised today that it was due to a technical_error i was unable to cancel and offering me a full_refund in the form of a voucher to use on thier website .
F	why do they think i will ever use thier company again !!
F	i requested the money be put into my account instead but for some reason yet to be explained for the refund to go into my bank_account it will only be €_000 .
F	i declined thier offer and they have now gone back on everything they have said and have advised i shouldn ' t have been able to cancel anyway and they do not have to give a full_refund ( unless i want it as a voucher ).
F	this company is so frustrating , they have no commitment to thier customers and constantly contradict themselves !
F	i work in a customer_service call_centre myself so i know how difficult situations like this can be however they have admitted it is thier fault , therefore why can i not have all my money back !
F	?
F	to some this situation may not sound that frustrating but please take my word for it , if you use this company be prepared to be disappointed , frustrated and unfairly compenasated .
F	after being recommended by my brother , i bought my reading_festival 0000 tickets online with double 0 tickets at a cheaper_than face_value price .
F	double 0 tickets provide a quick delivery service and saved me a lot of money !
F	!
F	lauren
F	can certainly recommend this service .
F	when we arrived in istanbul the driver was there holding up a sign with our name on and we paid for this journey when we arrived at our hotel .
F	were picked_up again 0 days_later , on time , and paid for this part of the journey on arrival at the airport .
F	reasonably_priced and would definitely_recommend .
F	nice clean taxis and friendly drivers .
F	love the price_match / reduction feature , and the freebies you can get at the end of your order !
F	!
F	i regularly book_hostels using hostelbookers . com , they tend to have an excellent selection of establishments to choose from and the search refinements bar allows me to narrow_down the possibilities to a handful that meet my requirements .
F	the website claims that the iphone 0 , locked to att , can be unlocked in 0 hours .
F	however , it is unlocked in 0 hours after they receive payment .. but by the time payment clears , you could have been waiting one or two days .
F	however , the end_result is amazing !
F	absolutely_brilliant company had a problem with a buyer cancelling at the last_minute i spoke to katie who was very very helpful and sorted it out for me by cancelling my order and refunding into my prepay account would recommend using this company :-)
F	very easy to use , no booking_fee needed , and fast confirmation of booking !
F	i will recommend hostelbookers to my friends for sure .
F	good value for money , very quick and hassle_free service .
F	i would defiantly recommend mazumamobile to a friend .
F	booking a hostel on hostelbookers . com was very easy .
F	and it ' s cheaper_than , for example , hostel . com and hostelworld . com !
F	sooooooo pleased with my new house sign .
F	jeremy was extremely_helpful with the design , it came in good time and looks great !!!!
F	surprised at the size and quality , have had compliments and only got it yesterday !!!
F	thank_you !
F	!
F	brilliant company - excellent produce , arrived on time , packaging is amazing so everything arrives in top quality .
F	lovely people to deal with !
F	can ' t say too many nice things about this company !
F	!
F	great value for money , excellent service and i have a very happy 0 year_old !
F	!
F	my step - mum had lots of furniture she needed to get_rid of and we were happy to have it .
F	but with busy lifestyles and a limited time - frame we didn ' t have the time to hire a van and collect it ourselves so we used_shiply .
F	what a great idea !
F	get your stuff moved by people who are ' going there anyway '.
F	it was very easy and smooth ; would definitely_recommend it to anyone !
F	my order was dealt_with within a couple of hours of being placed online .
F	a couple of hours_later i was informed of the delivery details by email .
F	the next_day , on the day of delivery , i could track the parcel to a one hour delivery slot online .
F	the parcel arrived within that time_slot .
F	very pleased with the service .
F	i ' m often reluctant to order electrical_items online but with a one year item guarantee and delivery service like this , i ' d recommend gogodigital and use them again .
F	ive used lastminute . com numerous_times as i alway get a great bargain .
F	ive booked twice for short stays in scotland and everytime they have came up trumps .
F	both holidays have more_than fulfilled my expectations , from the easy of booking to the information supplied .
F	i have now used mazumamobile twice and have enjoyed both experiences as they are fast and efficient , i have had no_problems what so ever .
F	i would highly_recommend the service they provide .
F	like many on this site i chose autoeurope for a trip to pisa , italy recently and was very dissapointed with the hidden_costs which ended_up doubling the cost of my initial rental .
F	to make_matters worse the customer_service from their pisa supplier goldcar was horrific , we were fiercely given the option of paying up for the extras or leaving without a car at 0pm at night .
F	i paid the extra costs , thinking i would appeal to autoeurope once back in the uk .
F	only to be highly dissapointed again by a ' you should have read your contract ' response that took three_weeks to arrive .
F	yes sure , i should have sat down and read through with a fine tooth comb - and will next time - but surely there has to an element of customer_service , and an ethical if not legal obligation to be upfront about costs ?
F	i would avoid autoeurope , there are a number of rental car companies out there who value their customers , make_sure you choose them !
F	i ordered my prescription_glasses with the understanding that i could expect delivery within 0 - 00 working_days .
F	it ' s now been 00 working_days and counting .....
F	ordered a named necklace for my daughter as a birthday pressie .
F	filled in shipping address , gave payment details .
F	money was taken frm my acc .
F	0 weeks_later i was sent an_email asking for shipping address !!!
F	this didnt fill me with confidence .
F	so i replied and asked why this mistake had happened .
F	a few_days_later i was sent an_email_saying necklace had been posted to a man who id never_heard of and an address id never_heard of .
F	once again i contacted them .
F	this time i just asked for a refund ...
F	almost 0 months later im still_waiting .
F	i did get an_email_saying they refunded on the 0rd feb .
F	strange cause i have an_email on the 0nd saying they had posted the necklace that day to mystery man ....
F	this company in my opinion is fake .
F	they took my money and i have nothing to show for it .
F	left mess on the answering_machine n they havent got back to me either .
F	have now logged a fraud claim with my bank !!!
F	!
F	my advice dont use this company !!!
F	!
F	we have used the site multiple_times to book_hostels as we travel through thailand and vietnam .

F	great customer_service and a great price .
F	would definitely use again
F	it was really easy to find tickets to see bruno mars in concert and i was confident that i was safe to buy from seatwave .
F	the tickets arrived within a week of my ordering which was almost 0months ahead of the concert .
F	the concert was amazing so i ' m really pleased that despite not getting tickets when they were released seatwave meant i could still go .
F	i registered on saturday , by the monday the envelope and details for posting arrived .
F	i popped the phone back in the post as instructed and within_00hrs the money was being paid to my bank directly .
F	super !
F	from the initial correspondence with iconic_watches , ( liz & charlotte ), with regards to my omega_seamaster arriving a few_days_later , they were both so easy to do business with at iconic , extreamly helpfull , professional and polite , as and when i would look to purchase another quality watch , i would 000 percent contact iconic .
F	" thank_you "
F	kind_regards ,

F	i have been browsing the river_island website over the past few_days , and have been very impressed with the wide_range of clothes online .
F	they have a " style for less " section for women ' s clothing , which is a fantastic idea , and full of affordable items .
F	i highly_recommend anyone serious about fashion , takes a look at this fabulous online store .
F	next are one of my favourite retail_stores in the uk , offering a wide_variety of clothes as well as a mixed array of bargains .
F	reebok are by_far the best trainers i have ever used , i dont like the width of a lot of traininer as they dont fit correctly .
F	my best and most liked pizza company ever .
F	vodafone are my favourite mobile phone network ,
F	great resources for movies , this is probably the best one stock online location for knowledge relating to movies and much more .
F	the bbc is one of the finest tv channels in the uk .
F	by_far one of my favourite online clothes stores .
F	best broadband in the uk , by_far .
F	i love buying and browsing play . com as they offer the latest products and gadgets .
F	twitter is my favourite all time social tool .

F	maplin host an array of computer gadgets , highly_recommend them to everyone .
F	i just got a phonecall from my frail , upset grandma after she received a valentine ' s rose from me a day too_late , which was headless with dying leaves .
F	she didn ' t want to tell me about it and had been wrestling with her conscience before calling , leaving her very stressed and confused .
F	the customer_service assistant i finally got through to on the phone was very kind and apologetic , and offered a refund at once , but this really shouldn ' t have happened in the first place .
F	terrible experience .
F	the item we ordered was cheaper_than any other website we looked at and seems just as good quality .
F	we received updates from the helpful customer_services team regarding delivery and were really pleased with our purchase .
F	we were expecting the drawer unit in green just because of the image but it doesn ' t really matter as the black is lovely and we think we actually prefer it .
F	my only negative , which wouldn ' t effect me purchasing here again , was the strange attitude of the delivery men ( actually more the older man ).
F	they weren ' t too pleased that i wanted the item upstairs and of course i understand it was heavy but i paid for the service which said delivery to any room with 0 men .
F	i don ' t think they loved that i wanted to check the item first too ... but the delivery note says to sign off on this so obviously i wanted to check before signing .
F	to be fair they did their job , just with a little attitude , but i guess it was a large item for them .
F	overall a great piece of furniture at a great price .
F	the price was the cheapest about and the service was excellent .
F	chris the technician arrived within the 0 hour time_slot given .
F	he was very professional and efficient and had changed 0 tyres in about 00_mins whilst taking care , unlike garages i have been to in the past that have scratched my alloys .
F	thanks chris and tyresonthedrive . com i will be recommending you and using you myself again .
F	i booked return tickets to vietnam with carton leisure and initially they were fine , the e_- ticket arrived straight_away .
F	however , during my trip they changed my return_journey due to a cancellation which required a change of airports and seriously inconvenienced my journey .
F	my partner was on the same itinerary with alternative airlines who sorted his flight out no problem .
F	carlton however , demanded £_000 to replace my original fights and were rude about it too .
F	in the end i just bought an additional ticket from ba for only £_00 - half what carlton wanted to alter the trip ..
F	all in all a company best avoided .
F	!
F	i ' ve used supplement_warehouse many many_times in the past .
F	the prices are great , their blow out sales / clearances are ridiculous , and who doesn ' t love getting free_merchandise and free supplements ?
F	i get a new shaker_bottle every time i order .
F	also , orders ship quickly .
F	have always had a great experience .
F	thanks !

F	milton , ma
F	have had a few orders from this site in the past but my dad always just added what i needed or wanted to the bottom of his order but i did one myself yesturday and it arrived this morning !
F	very very pleased !
F	i am left handed and i got a left handed pen for 00p !
F	a fine liner for 00p !
F	and a pencil for 00p !
F	and refill leads for 00p !
F	very very happy_bunny !
F	i am starting collage next week and needed everything i ordered quickly ( i did leave it a bit late ) and they didn ' t disapoint !
F	i love how when i go to order something like the green staedtler pencil i ordered , it tells you what lead comes in it and the lead that goes with it was at the bottom of the page !
F	they do the same for pens .
F	makes life so much_easier !
F	you don ' t have to hunt for refills for other pens you just find the pen and it ' s at the bottom of the page !
F	overall a lovely , easy to use , cheap and interesting website with first_class customer_service and post !
F	i originally used hello_canvas through an offer , but have come back time and time again and always really impressed with the quality of the print , service and delivery .
F	the team communicate with you promptly if you send in a question / enquiry .
F	delivery timing is easy to track and accurate and the end product is always to a high_standard .
F	i ' d highly_recommend them to anyone and will certainly be ordering again through hello_canvas !
F	rubbish , had 0 everyone of them broke some way or other , slow , constantly freezing , hardly_ever have software updates - if i could give it less_than one star i defiantly would !
F	i ' ve been with them for four years now so there for i will have a lot of complaints , for starters the only reason_why i ' ve stayed with them is because of the hassle of changing my company , i ' ve had about 0 phones with o0 each time they ' ve broke , especially blackberrys , i will_defiantly be changing this year as its a complete_waste of time and money , oh_yeah and upgrades are wank .
F	i bought 0 jeniffer lopez tickets for the o0 concert just a week before the concert at a very good price .
F	the seats were really good , my husband was really pleased as it was a present for his forthcoming birthday !

F	i needed a gaming_pc , but with all the ever - changing technology and the confusing mess of different opinions and recommendations out there from gamers and retailers alike , i wasn ' t sure where to turn .
F	someone recommended the w0f website and i decided to give them a try .
F	the website is extremely customer friendly and takes care to explain what each component is and how it would affect your build .
F	customer_service is unmatched .
F	they are endlessly helpful over the phone and respond quickly to emails .
F	after_placing an order you are emailed updates of its status throughout the whole_process .
F	i have had two pcs from them now and both are incredible .
F	fast , powerful , quiet and above all they last .
F	despite my oldest pc being several years old now , it still performs perfectly .
F	this is a professional , efficient and extremely reliable company .
F	building your own pc is a personal thing and these_guys realise that .
F	they tailor everything to suit the needs of the customer .
F	highly_recommend them .
F	i was trying to complain_about some flowers that i received yesterday from my son and his wife from serenata .
F	they arrived with yellow leaves and looking quite dead looking and very sad .
F	my daughter has made several_attempts to e_- mail photos and it keeps being rejected .
F	not impressed !
F	the link to reply with a photo has no way on the page to respond with a photo making a complaint impossible by seranata the comapny itself .
F	it ' s very frustrating and costly trying to send photos by an i - phone ....
F	i have found this company to be awful and in all my attempts to email a photo of the flowers has been rejected ... a complete_waste of my friday_evening trying to sort this out ... dont use this company
F	cheap and fast , but great quality .... what more can you wish for !
F	orders costume and had next_day .
F	very fast costume good too .
F	orange customer_services is decent .
F	you don ' t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
F	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
F	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
F	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more_than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
F	my friends are staggered that i pay over £_00 pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn ' t all that either ( which i ' m stuck with for 00 mths !
F	).
F	the delivery for boohoo has been great ( ordered twice ).
F	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
F	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
F	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
F	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
F	this means i won ' t be ordering items form here often .
F	i discovered asos a few_years_ago and i have loved it ever since .
F	i made a big order on tuesday and received everything ( except one item ) in the correct_size on the friday .
F	i ordered a size 00 and after not being_able to fit my head in the hole i realised it was way too small but couldn ' t understand .
F	for some strange reason someone wrote a " 0 " inf front of the " 0 " so it looked like a size 00 even_though it was just a 0 !
F	i contacted their customer_service through twitter and though it did take a day or two to talk to them ( they ' re very busy ) they informed me that i can return it and that they would send me the correct_size for next_day delivery free of charge .
F	i also sent a skirt back for a refund and a pair of pants for an exchange and the money was refunded and my pants exchanged .
F	so in terms of the customer_service they are competent and the clothes are of high_quality .
F	they are more_expensive than other online shops but i don ' t mind as the clothes are made in this country instead of using sweatshops .
F	great variety , the best pricing , and amazing customer_service .
F	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn ' t arrive .
F	it wasn ' t a problem with the courier either ; i checked the bp website and they said it still hadn ' t dispatched more_than 00_hours_later even_though it ' s supposed to be guaranteed same day dispatch .
F	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you ' ve been told .
F	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
F	i just wish they would expand their range a bit .
F	some nitrite - free beef jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
F	avoid the scammers making counterfeit dangerous goods .
F	avoid !
F	we ordered some light fittings from there , they were described as dangerous by a qualified electrician .
F	don ' t believe all the fake_reviews , notice how every positive review has bad grammar , mentions how the products were real ?
F	don ' t you think that ' s odd ?
F	i completed the sage beginners course with this company .
F	the course was easy to use and i learnt a lot .
F	if i had any_problems throughout the course there was always an adviser on instant chat who would help .
F	the customer_service was fantastic .
F	i have had a really good experience with this company and would defiantly use them again !
F	thank_you !
F	katie brookes
F	the website was quick and easy to use , the main thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .
F	i found the customer_service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave me false information about when i would receive the tickets .
F	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
F	saying this , i have finally got my tickets today in special delivery but any later then i would have been unable to go to the concert which i payed just under £_000 for .
F	i bought a pair from their cheap deal section , not name brand , came in 0 days with my prescription .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	my expectations were surpassed in every_single aspect .
F	when ordering with oak_furniture land for the first time on their website i must_say i was a little_bit_dubious , without seeing the furniture first hand .
F	i needn ' t have been , i received a promptly telephone call from their delivery guys , giving me 0 weeks notice for the delivery so i could make arrangements to be in to accept it .
F	on the delivery day again i received a call from the delivery guys 00_mins before .
F	when they arrived they were more_than accommodating and made sure that all of the furntiure went exactly where it was meant to go .
F	on inspecting the furniture ( and believe me we inspected it !!)
F	it is perfect .
F	exactly_what we were looking for .
F	we will not hesitate to tell everyone about the amazing experience we had from oak .
F	thank_you !
F	this was a perfect buy - taking the next step up from a baby car_seat pushchair .
F	the fact that the product was highly reduced due to it been a reworked model was great - the product arrived very quickly and apart_from the odd marks that was expected for a reworked item the pushchair was in fantastic condition .
F	the updates provided by the seller was great also .
F	all_round happy customer !
F	!
F	quick_turnaround time from sending phone to receiving payment .
F	0st_class company !!
F	fully recommended
F	no_problems arriving or leaving - happy knowing my car was left in a secure inside carpark and not open to the elements !
F	should i go on holiday in the future i will be sure to book the same carpark without_hesitation .
F	thank_you
F	i will never book a flight with this company in my life .
F	horrible booking system , you can ´ t access to your booking and the costumer_service is awful .
F	the people working with the phone , they don_´ t know english and are rude and unprofessional .
F	good luck if you have booked a flight with them
F	order my ticket almost over a month_ago , spent £_000 on two tickets , this is a korean band that ive loved for ages , this is the first and only time they will be doing a concert in london !

F	!.
F	transaction_id :_0000000
F	please get this sorted viagogo asap
F	me and my partner made our first order from the sh website and was especially pleased with the speedy_delivery !
F	we ordered it on the friday before bank_holiday and it arrived to us on the saturday !
F	now if thats not speedy i dont know what is .....
F	the only problem we had was with royal_mail !!
F	they couldnt fit it through the post box so gave us 0 hours to pick it up .. off we went to collect our parcel only to find out the posty had gone on the missing list lol ... soooo the fun started tuesday hehe ..
F	i normally go to shop to get my bits , which i must_say the girls there have the best customer facing skills you will ever find in a shop !!
F	they make you feel so at ease especially if its your first time shopping for sex toys !
F	well worth going down there and having a look around !!
F	!
F	i have only ever done 0 other review of a website because on the whole you dont generally receive a service from most websites that warrants any merit .
F	however i cannot_fault the service i have received from country_attire .
F	i have made 0 orders with them in the last_week , one of which i needed to change the postage for .
F	customer_service were more_than helpful .
F	they email you back instantly and nothing is too much_trouble .
F	the products are excellent , very reasonably_priced and fast delivery !
F	excellent !!!!
F	!
F	mazuma is so simple and fast to use .
F	the website is easy to navigate and everything can be done within one week .
F	there ' s barely any paper work ( apart_from the one that is sent to you with your freepost showing your order details ) and the forms online are straight_forward .
F	mazuma keeps you updated on a regular_basis and if for whatever you can ' t post out the mobiles as soon as you receive a free post you can ask for an extension , no questions_asked !
F	i ' ve just cashed my cheque .
F	waiting for payment now .
F	without a doubt , the best mobile buying company i know .
F	=)
F	i found it dissapointing that i could not get a sample on the internet before ordering .
F	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
F	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
F	then the second time i phoned because via e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
F	the only reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont be using the website again .
F	i ordered a wii_u bundle from here .. cheapest by a mile (£ 00 cheaper_than argos without the three extra games ) and ordered thursday_night arrived monday_morning free delivery .
F	very happy wirh the service so have used again for other games this week .
F	highly_recomended
F	i couldnt be_happier with the glasses i received .
F	perfect fit perfect perscription and speedy_delivery .
F	definatly going to use again and referred all my friends
F	they sold me a room on there site , 0 mins after i received a call saying they had to check if the room was free ( when booking a room i expect them to already have the rooms available ) it turns_out the room wasn ' t available but they had taken funds .
F	they refused to except this and kept informing_me that i needed to get the funds back from my bank .
F	i had already called my bank and they said the funds had definitely gone to them and that they needed to contact their bank to cancel the funds .
F	i tried to explain this to olotels but they refused to except any liability .
F	i am now £_000 down and am now calling trading_standards to help me with this matter .
F	i would advise you to not ever book with this company , it is not worth the hassle .
F	i love it !!!
F	thank_you .
F	i will_definitely tell people about your company .
F	keep it up .
F	always have the lowest_prices , delivery is really fast and customer_service is first rate .
F	never have any_problems with this web_site ; easy to use , simple and bright , search_function are fantastic and i always find something to suit my needs .
F	keep it up !
F	i had trouble with getting my voucher redeemed and my course started , i sent a message using the online help and within 00_mins the person helping me , erick , had sorted it for me .

F	will recommend them always .
F	top recyclers !!
F	!
F	i ' ve been looking everywhere for a particular pair of freshlook colour blend contacts for cosmetic wear , and the pharmacists i used to purchase them from closed_down :(.
F	so i did some research online and came_across feel good contact_lenses , and believe me it was my light at the end of the tunnel lol !.
F	not only did i find my contact_lenses but i found them so much cheaper , i was so pleased i purchased two ( not same colours ), the delivery was so super_fast and the quality is perfect plus the extra discount .
F	i highly_recommend purchasing from them with their unbeatable_prices and discounts not to mention their free delivery too .
F	overall i am very happy with my purchase
F	i purchased 0 superdry jacket last_year off bank fashion .
F	with their exchange option available i ordered 0 in a size bigger because they weren ' t stocking my size at the time and they had 00_% student_discount promotion .
F	i received the items within a week or so which was fantastic .
F	0 days_later i checked back to see if my size was in stock and it was , so i prepared the item to be sent back for an exchange , i packed everything and took it to a local_store to send back using collect_plus service .
F	now 0 - 0 weeks had passed no sign of any delivery from bank , i contacted customer_service i explained what had happened and the women took my collect_plus reference_number and checked status of my order .
F	she spoke to the internet sales_team and they told her they received an empty asos box under this order reference so they will not be taking action .
F	this was just absurd and i was furious i had lost £_00 and the item too .
F	now i contacted them on a few occasion to sort it out and each time the customer_service colleagues were very rude !!
F	they told me they had images of what they received and they can send them to me by email but i have to pay them for the images ( what a load of bull ).
F	after that they kept telling_me i need to seek independent advice as they cannot do anything about it .
F	later i was looking through my emails only to notice that i had payed with paypal ( voila ), i opened up a payap dispute - it was a lengthy process but i had all my proof , i only asked a refund for the item i had sent back for exchange , however paypal got me a full_refund of all the items i purchased from bank .
F	i am so pleased i used paypal , and i have been ever since for everything , you have so much more protection when shopping with paypal .
F	couldn ' t stress how easy this website is to navigate around .
F	sold almost 00_% of unwanted books and dvds , however it would be far better if they accepted more titles .
F	compared to other_sites such as fatbrain and zazzle they have very competitive_prices .
F	great communication - they keep you informed about each_step of the process
F	fast payment_methods - paypal payment_methods allows you to get your money quicker
F	brilliant website to help you get_rid of unwanted items and free up some room .
F	thanks webuybooks . com for your amazing service
F	first time planning my own trip ( and paying for it ) and hostelbookers made it easy , and didn ' t charge any ridiculous booking_fees .
F	super happy .
F	:)
F	i don ' t think i ' ve found a site yet which doesn ' t offer cashback via quidco , even if it ' s a few_quid back on a couple of new tops .
F	the best cashback deals are for changing provider for internet etc .
F	sometimes i ' ve had a delay in receiving the cashback but that ' s not quidco ' s fault , and as soon as you notify them they will pay you the money and get it back from the seller themselves .
F	i love quidco :_d
F	i ' ve been a member since july_0000 and have already got myself
F	" total confirmed & paid cashback £_000 . 00 "
F	just for logging_into quidco before ordering literally anything online .
F	i ordered my costume from friday 00th ( jason ) and love it .
F	the handbag is made of jason masks .
F	very good quality for the price .
F	it came about 0 days after i bought it which was good .
F	i would definitely order from allfancydress again .
F	i have already told all of my friends to get their halloween_costume from them !
F	absolutely love tpw .
F	value for money , delivery is so quick ( even with the economy one !)
F	and every product i ' ve received has been high_quality .
F	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
F	... but bald guy is so annoying lol
F	et très bon tarifs .
F	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
F	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
F	peu satisfaisant .
F	i ordered inflatable tropical items and i was really happy about them .
F	they were a fantastic addition to the party spirit .
F	brilliant !
F	:)
F	there are so many helpful reviews and it was so easy to use !
F	great website
F	i recently_purchased a beautiful bunch of sympathy flowers for a close friend who is in mourning .
F	as the property does not have a secure porch or external area , i requested that the flowers were left with a neighbour if there was no answer at the door .
F	unfortunately this request was completely_ignored and i received a text alert stating that the delivery had been made and the flowers left ' securely at the front of the property '.
F	i have no_idea where they were left but there is no accessible secure area at this property .
F	not to mention the fact that the weather was appalling on the day in question , with heavy rain and winds , meaning that the flowers would be in no state to be fit for delivery .
F	as it was , the flowers were never received , so i can only assume they were stolen or were delivered to the wrong_address .
F	upon_receipt of the text alert , i immediately tried to make contact with your company and found it extremely frustrating that there was no telephone_number available .
F	i therefore completed the ' contact us ' form and have received no correspondence since to give me any explanation or apology .
F	i wanted to book a holiday for me my husband and our 00th month old twins .
F	after searching lots of sites i found this one the easiest .
F	when i rang for a quote i spoke to charlie he was so helpful thought if everything .
F	the line was clear and i could understand all being said .
F	charlie made it easy arranging it all seperate but took it as a package holiday .
F	i would highly_recommend
F	i ordered 0 costumes for valentines the online service was easy to use :-) the delivery was speedy next_day well_done will certainly be using again ..
F	costumes was fantastic and was how described
F	out of all the websites i checked out supplement_warehouse had the best prices for the exact product elsewhere .. thank_you !
F	!
F	the service is amazing easy to use and the best part its eco - friendly :).
F	free courier service that comes on the day you are available , and i got an e_- mail saying the laptop had arrived and a second e_- mail confirming the payment status .
F	brilliant and simple to use website , fast delivery and really good quality product .... will_definitely use again and recommend to friends - don ' t need to go anywhere_else for these kinds of products now !
F	!
F	i looked on the website and submitted my phones , with in 0 days the bag arrived , once i ' d posted the phones i received my money he very next_day !
F	would highly_recommend !
F	i bought a wowcher voucher for a hotel stay , due to unforeseen_circumstances i no_longer need the voucher .
F	the very next_day after booking the voucher i wrote an_email to enquires , returns and customer_services explaining why i no_longer need this ...
F	a week and 0 days_later plus an additional 0 emails , i have still not received a response from anyone in wowcher , or my refund !
F	i am well within my 0 day return / cancellation period / duration .
F	yet they say someone will be in touch within 0 days ... lies
F	trying to call them is even harder .
F	i will never use this website again nor will i ever recommend their services to anyone in fact i ' m going to make_sure no one i know ever uses their site ... groupon are a lot more honest about the way they operate and are 000 times easier to communicate with .
F	and if within the next few_days i do not receive a refund and or a response from wowcher my lawyer will be in touch .
F	this course has helped in alot in my job which was the purpose , the system is easy to use and the staff are very helpful .
F	i would 000_% recommend this course .
F	thank_you very much .
F	my niece was over the moon , fantastic good value purchase with speedy_delivery .
F	would definitely buy again .
F	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
F	well i ordered the bunch called wow as iv ordered them before for a friend and they arrived looking exactly as the picture .
F	wow consistes of reds , pinks , purppless , green , yellow , orange roses .
F	instead yesterday my little sister got delivered a aldi quality bunch of flowers consisting of yellow flowers mainly , a white carnation and a couple of purple flowers .
F	awful colour match , awful substitutes not on the same value as the wow bunch at all iv requested a refund .
F	another time i ordered from eflorist was mothers_day , i ordered sea breeze as it had gorgeous lilys and blue flowers .
F	instantly when they arrived i was in shock , purple white and green weeds it appears is a suitable sustitute .
F	had to quickly get online and ordered a beautiful bunch from serenata_flowers which where delivered exactly as they looked ( beautiful ) and were alot cheaper .
F	eflorist said this was a suitable substitute .
F	im only guessing the site is a con , offering gorgeous flowers and sending weeds
F	disgusting vile service .
F	they still_havent got back to me .

F	after thinking i had received nothing today off my boyfriend , he rang and asked me if i ' d had a delivery .
F	i said no and assumed they would be next door .
F	after lot ' s of investigating we found them at number 0 - 00 houses out - on the doorstep !
F	they had been delivered at 00am , i finally got them at 0pm - pretty_much dead !
F	00 roses on valentines_day half_dead , especially after thinking he didn ' t care has left me and him upset !
F	he works away during the week which makes it feel worse !
F	i have tried_ringing them , i ' ve tried every number and each one just leaves a dead tone .
F	please add me to your trading_standards letter - i ' ll be only too happy to complain !
F	items as_described , well_packaged and delivered quickly .
F	will_definitely buy from again
F	me and my partner ordered a curtain pole , two end balls , curtain pull backs and a somerset bed_frame from laura_ashley .
F	we ordered online as it entitled us to extra discount for joining the site along with the bank_holiday discount .
F	the process took_forever to do , and several_attempts to complete .
F	we were given an approximate waiting time off 00 weeks wait for our bed_frame , apparently this was because it was being ' handmade ' especially for us .
F	we thought that 00 weeks was a very long wait bit considering the type of company it was we aggreed .
F	around about 0 - 0 weeks after out order we received our curtain balls which may i add were left outside our house for all to see ( even steal ).
F	when we opened them they were very damaged , immediately we took them back to the shop for an exchange .
F	when in store i got told that they couldn ' t exchange but had to send the current balls back so new ones could be sent ( another long wait for my order ).
F	around about 0 weeks_later finally our curtain pole turned_up along with curtain tie backs , surprise_surprise these were damaged to , scratches and dents in the pole and all the packaging dirty and ripped .
F	again i went back to the store , the manager on duty that afternoon did replace it for me , this box was still damaged but the product was not .
F	last but not least our bed was finally delivered 00 0 / 0 weeks after ordering !!!!
F	again the boxes were damaged , ripped and quite disgusting .
F	i briefly checked the products , i couldn ' t get them out of the box as they were very heavy and i needed my partner to help me .
F	i was assured by the delivery driver that all the pieces were there .
F	when putting the curtain pole and tie backs on we couldn ' t use the screws provided by laura_ashley as the moment any pressure was put onto the head of the screw it would disfigure it and you couldn ' t screw it in , we had to use our own screws , the pole again had our own screws in it and the metal was / is poor quality .
F	a few weeks_later my partner and i began to get_rid of the old furniture and start to build the new , all the parts seemed to be there but we noticed horrible black marks on either side of the bed frames , hot_water , fairy liquid , wd00 and sugar soap had no effect on these marks .
F	not impressed , considering the amount we paid for the bed_frame .
F	just to add more into the pot , when putting the frame together the ' pre drilled ' bolt holes were not pre drilled at all , the bolts would only go in about 0 / 0 way before jamming .
F	my partner had to go to a diy store to buy a tool that rethreaded the bolt hold ( cost of £_00 . 00 ) luckily the bed went together , but the quality of welding , metal and finish is something to be desired .
F	we are currently in the process of complaining_about out damaged / faulty products , can ' t wait to hear from ' customer_services '.
F	so in our opinion the best thing to do is to avoid laura_ashley products , its far to expensive , poor quality , lots of mis sold products and very disappointing .
F	from now on the only shop we will be using is john_lewis - maybe laura_ashley should take some hints from them ... they know the meaning of quality products , customer_satisfaction and service !
F	!
F	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
F	i had a girlfriend recommend this site for their prices .
F	i selected everything i was ordering for a birthday and got to the end and the shipping cost was over $_00 !?
F	because i spent the time adding things to my cart , i went through with it .
F	then it took 0 days to get a tracking_number , that did not show the product shipped for 0 days after that , then it took another 0 to receive !
F	?
F	00 - days for a shipping cost of $_00 + is ridiculous .
F	i was ordering for a birthday and the birthday was completely missed !
F	it should be expedited at that cost .
F	in the meantime , i have found another site goldentrainer . com that i found a discount_code online for 0 %_off my purchase + the shipping was only $_00 . 00 for the same exact order .
F	in the end , it cost me $_00 less .
F	their site is not as extensive , however , i received my order the next_day !
F	the service was quick and the website was easy to use .
F	brilliant that delivery is free over mother day weekend .... thank_you thank_you thank_you x
F	fabulous !!
F	i had a look through ' big stock image library to canvas ' i entered a few keywords for what i was looking for and the choice of images is incredible .

F	thank_you youframeit !
F	great ties for a very good price .
F	perfect colour for my wedding .
F	i couldn ' t find anywhere_else the right colour .
F	viovet saves me 000 ' s pounds every year in food and prescriptions for my cats .

F	it couldn ' t be better and i would strongly_recommend viovet to anyone .
F	i was really happy with the wall stickers we bought from dottyhippo .
F	they came promptly and were well_packaged .

F	they look great - thank_you !
F	the mama cocoon tops are both practical and gorgeous and the ones i ordered arrived really quickly .

F	lee provided an excellent service i would recommend him to anyone , he looked after my cat extremely well and she was in a large cage and had cat tray , water and food , and blankets .
F	he gave me lots of numbers to contact him on and he kept me up dated throughout the journey .
F	i was worried to pay some of the money up front but he did an excellent job and gained my trust 000_%.
F	i can not thank him enough really good guy ( thanks you guys ) lindsey x
F	i thought it too cheap but was same as i buy in dilliards , iam happy
F	the only time you get a prompt response from this company is when you make your order , spend your money and possibly update your order .
F	after that their customer_service is more or less non_existent .
F	no contact number , ubless you have ordered with them and even then they dont pick_up the phone .
F	i paid £_00 for flowers to be delivered in spain ( i live in england ) requested same day delivery .

F	very conservative and high_standard business attitude .
F	overall very pleased with services which has encouraged me to do business with them again in the future .
F	i have been looking for the ' right ' set of mugs for years , my husband wants them large , my mum likes thin ' elegant ' ones rather_than cheap chunky ones which make your tea cold and i wanted a nice matching set so i can lock myself away from my demanding family and enjoy my tea and biscuits .
F	love my dunoon nevis colourful animal mugs and using them to teach my toddler his animal noises whilst battling with the chocolate biscuits .
F	great service from temptation , helpful customer_services email , arrived_promptly and well wrapped with free delivery offers taken_advantage of .
F	recommended .
F	we went on a hen_do to berlin with 00 people where we had two events organised by chilli_sauce .
F	the first was a bar_crawl where we were supposed to be taken to 0 to 0 venues over 0 hours .
F	the first venue we went to was a fairly average bar where no area was reserved for us so we had to stand around for ages waiting for a table .
F	our_guide then_proceeded to smoke and chat to her friends for the next 0 hours .
F	she then took us to a club where we were able to get in on the guest_list but she then promptly left us there , 0 hours into our 0 hour bar_crawl .
F	this cost each person £_00 and didn ' t even include transport .
F	the second event they organised for us was 0 hours at a spa .
F	we were given tickets and told to find the spa ourselves .
F	on getting there we found out that the spa ticket cost € 00 . 00 per_person on the door but chilli_sauce charged us £_00 per head .
F	the spa was basically a public swimming_pool with some saunas and steam rooms and our £_00 didn ' t include any treatments or even towel hire that we had to fork_out another € 0 . 00 for .
F	it ' s outrageous that they charged more_than double the normal price for the spa for providing no service other than booking some tickets in_advance for us when we could have easily purchased them at the door .
F	i have had 0 canvas_prints from hello_canvas now and love them :-) such great quality .
F	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn ' t great .
F	i ' ve had a couple of orders with this company now & highly_recommend them , smooth straight_forward prescriptive & non prescriptive transactions & very informative when makeing equirys , i will_continue to use this company in the foreseeable_future as their was never any delays with my orders or postage they also offer discounts on future orders which appealed greatly many_thanks emma ;-)
F	i was very satisfied with how easy it was to search for items & extreamly pleased with how competitively_priced viovet is & even more impressed when my items were delivered very promptly thanks ;-)
F	i have ordered from here several_times now and yes have had a few bumps along the way , mainly in accordance with delivery timing issues but that is to be expected of a company that offers such a large region of service .
F	the items i have received are exactly as_described , fitting and incredibly beautiful , the prices are pretty reasonable to .
F	will shop here til the day i die :)

F	i ordered a phone with 00 in toshiba hd tv smart_tv .
F	obviously they did not tell me what exact model tv is , also image of tv was very small , you cant recognise it , so i googlet about toshiba 00 in smart_tv full_hd , and was very impressed what functions they have etc .. so i ordered mine , but tv what came is rubbbish |, cheap quality product that is designed to fool peoples and trick them into buying them as smart tvs .. what kinda smart_tv is it , if its even dont have a function to record programmes ?
F	there is no sign of it beeing smart_tv .
F	packaging is very basic , very small instruction .
F	i feel ashemed for my stupidity that i was tricked into buying this :(
F	i ordered a pair of the hunter adjustable wellies in black , and they arrived within 0 working_days . however , i changed my mind and decided that i wanted them in red - the returns process is really simple , i purchased the returns_label at a price of £ 0 . 00 , and you can set it up for ups to come and collect your parcel any day and between any hours e . g .
F	i did mine between 00am and 0pm on a monday , and they came around 00 . 00 .
F	easy wellies emailed me to say they had received and exchanged my order 0 days_later , and then i received my new wellies the next_day ( friday ).
F	i was very impressed with their service , and would definitely_recommend them and use them in the future .
F	:)
F	i ' ve had at_least 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs , every pair has been perfect .
F	the budget range is brilliant , and most pairs i ' ve had i ' ve worn everyday for a year plus .
F	iv had such a great experiance with this company .
F	i took up the sage 00 course and found it easy to work though and any_questions i had i was able to quickly speak with e_- careers and everyone was really helpful !

F	i hope to take up another course with them soon .

F	using supplement_warehouse for my nutritional_needs has allowed me to try several products that i would have never tried before .
F	with great sale and everyday prices , i can always afford what i need from month to month .
F	my products arrive within 00 - 00_hours so i never go a day without my supplements !
F	paypal have let me down very badly .
F	i am an adult webmaster so i build adult themed website designs .
F	although i am only a designer and selling templates paypal banner my account and said i was not eligible for it to be activated again !
F	even_though i have not directly done anything wrong i can never use paypal again and their command !
F	not impressed and not happy and im not the first to complain_about them .
F	really_enjoyed shopping around looking at all the colourful products - very girls and feminine .
F	says that they have handpicked their products and i don ' t doubt that .. they all look .. well .. delicious !
F	arousing !
F	quick delivery and was in plain packaging .
F	will buy from again , good prices .
F	i had a problem with my business_cards i ordered , they changed the font of the logo it was partially my fault and their fault .
F	after_speaking with customer_services they were very helpful and as a good will gesture they re printed all the business_cards for me .
F	i always use flyerzone for my printing and after this issue and how it was resolved , i will be using them again and again .
F	i ordered a netbook and a sleeve on the on the 00th_november_0000 by the 00 december i still_haven ’ t received it .
F	i login into the pixmamia site to see what ’_s happening .
F	under forwarding , the 0 products were there but with no date of dispatch .
F	it also said underneath forwarding “ products sold and delivered by pixmania ” mine was being delivered by royal_mail !
F	it also said in the email “ track your order ” this could not be done !
F	the customer_service is the poorest services i ’ ve had in a long time .
F	the fact it takes them 00_hours to respond to an_email that ’_s if they respond at all !
F	the phone conversations i ’ ve had nobody knows what ’_s happening , i was told a sworn statement would be sent by email to me it never was , i had to phone again the next_day to ask for it again to be sent .
F	it also needed to be signed my hand and posted back .
F	this was another few_days waiting .
F	all this time pixmania still had my money .
F	i understand that things go missing in the post all the time .
F	why is it that i ’ m doing all the chasing ?
F	i called again on the 00nd_december saying it been 0 working_days and i heard_nothing from you regarding the investigation .
F	i was told sorry about this i ’ ll send it to head_office for them to issue you a refund .
F	this should have been done straight_away not wait for me to call to find out what ’_s happening .
F	all the money i spent on phone_calls and my time wasted i would not advise_anyone to use them .
F	i would rather spend £_00 more and deal with a customer_service centre that knows what they ’ re talking_about and takes action .
F	i ’ m still_waiting for my money back now .
F	stay_away
F	i was looking to sell what i thought was the 0st generation ipod_touch i looked around and gadget_panda gave me the best price .
F	i sent it off and received a conformation email when they had received it the next_day they emailed me to give me a revised price only £ 0 less_than the original price as it had finger marks on it and was actually a 0nd generation ipod .
F	i accpted this offer and was sent a check which i recieved with in three days very very impressed kept in contact throughout and let me know what was going on .
F	would recomend to anyone and will be using again !
F	my partner and myself moved_house from a furnished to an unfurnished property and therefore needed a bed / mattress , dreams was the best price by_far and the delivery dates were great just a couple of nights on the floor - however it all went down_hill rapidly
F	the order was places a month_ago the delivery date has come and gone - and we found out in the middle of the day when the mattress was due to be delivered that it was out of stock and wouldn ' t be delivered for another 0 weeks .
F	absolutely no attempt was made to apologise , offer compensation and the fact that we are sleeping on the floor did not seem to matter to anyone .
F	i received a very rude phonecall to tell me all of this - but he couldn ' t rearrange delivery - i was left on hold for 00mins before the system cut out
F	im yet to receive anything and frankly i ' m appalled suffer from a slipped disc in my back and sleeping on the floor is not helping .
F	dreams you truly are the worst company i have ever_encountered and your customer_service is the lowest of the low - i will not be using this company ever again and neither will anyone i know
F	excellent service , quick postage , really good quality products , never had any_problems with the service everyone coments on my braclet - have now bought some for my friends .
F	my coat arrived quickly and the website is fantastic .
F	really good prices , will_definately buy from here again .
F	my daughter was thrilled when the package arrived and we went through all of the things and had a conversation on how to save water and why it was important to save water .
F	good quality items , very happy with them
F	had a great experiance hiring a car through this company , was amazing price for rental and would use them again in a heartbeat
F	my daughter loves these films and i wanted to get her the full box set for some time , i just couldn ' t pass up this offer , i will_continue to buy my dvd ' s and games from zavvi for a long time to come .
F	plus there ' s no where left on the high_street to buy from , so keep providing the discounts and i ' ll shop til i drop !
F	have supplied myself and my parents with legitimate ticket to many o0 concerts with good seats !
F	also provided a legitimate ticket to reading_festival , despite reservations_about buying from resellers due to horror_stories from a few friends , double 0 tickets are to be trusted to provided real festival tickets amongst others !
F	would certainly buy from them again , especially for events that our sold out , they are a good vendor to turn to .
F	i ' ve brought a few appliances and mattresses from buywise over the years and always had exceptional service .
F	if i ' m not sure quite what i want then they ' re there to offer sound_advice and are always competitive on price .
F	they are speedy to deliver and as they offer installation it ' s so easy .
F	it ' s great to know theres still retailers that know what they ' re talking_about .
F	the quality and price is amazing !
F	i just booked a hotel in london for my first trip to england .

F	ik woon in engeland en wou bloemen bestellen voor mijn zus in amsterdam : de dienst was perfekt en de bloemen waren top kwaliteit !
F	i am writing following several_attempts to solve a serious problem i have had following purchase of a phone and contract online .
F	my phone has not been delivered and yet i am still paying the monthly_fee .
F	i have tried the online " complaints system " a number of times to no_avail ( they just did not get back to me ), and calling customer_services was completely_useless .
F	it is now over a month since my phone was supposed to be delivered .
F	keep reading for the full details ...
F	i ordered a phone and contract online from three and dpd were the chosen courier .
F	my parcel was supposed to be delivered on the 00th of june .
F	i heard absolutely nothing that day , but the following_day a failed delivery slip was left - one day late is forgivable and probably better_than other_companies offering the same service .
F	i found the delivery card straight - forward , completed the section which said " leave in a safe_place " and left the slip outside my door the following_morning .
F	having previously heard good things about dpd , i did not hesitate to have the delivery man leave it outside the flat .
F	that evening , both the delivery slip and parcel were nowhere to be found , as it was late i decided to leave it until the next_day to call .
F	the next morning i found a new delivery slip , not in my flat or outside the door , but downstairs in the entrance hall to our set of flats .
F	it seems the delivery guy could not be bothered to come up to the flat .
F	i took this new delivery slip and completed the form online describing my " safe_place ".
F	the next_day ( four days after the supposed delivery day ) there was yet again no package .
F	after checking online , i realised that the package status was " delivered " and when i called up customer_services said there was nothing they could do until the following_monday when someone could talk to the driver .
F	i heard_nothing from dpd after that phone call .
F	i called three the same day to let them know the situation and they said they would also investigate with dpd and let me know within 00_hours .
F	00_hours_later i had still heard_nothing from either company , so i rang up three once again and the customer_service operator said exactly the same_thing as they had previously .
F	the next_day i received a call from three - as i has authorised dpd to leave the phone in my “ safe_place ” it was my fault the phone was missing .
F	three would not pay to send out a new phone and there was nothing they could do .
F	they did not offer any further help or advice , and did not even say how or when i could get my sim_card .
F	let me describe my " safe_place " - it ' s a box outside our front_door , on the top storey of a block of flats with a locked entrance .
F	there are only two flats on the top storey ( six flats in the whole building ), and in the three years my housemate has been at the property she has not once had an issue with a parcel going missing .
F	we have had countless parcels successfully delivered to us after being left outside our door , including boxes of wine and an ipod .
F	i have since checked with all my neighbours to see if they buzzed anyone in , accepted delivery or indeed saw a delivery man that friday , but have come up with nothing .
F	an area which is not accessible to the public was defined as safe on the dpd website when i arranged redelivery .
F	i am now stuck in a 00 - month_contract with no phone , and no way to claim back anything .
F	i feel that when i purchased my contract it was three ’_s promise to provide a phone , and seeing as i have not received a phone i feel i am within my rights to stop paying my contract , but i don ' t want to get into further trouble and don ' t know how it will affect my credit_rating .
F	spending more money on a new phone isn ' t an option for me now , which is why i chose the contract in the first place .
F	i also am completely unhappy that it is me having to go between three and dpd , spending countless time on customer_services trying to resolve the issue when it should be three who resolve it .
F	i have tried to contact dpd numerous_times ( and they have actually been helpful ) but they will not complete an investigation without three initiating the complaint .
F	in addition to this , the way that three has dealt_with my subsequent complaints is completely_unacceptable .
F	following my phone call with customer_services i made a complaint with the tracking_number online on the 00rd of june .
F	i received an_automated_reply on the 00th of june saying that the team were dealing_with it and would contact me “ in the next 00_hours ”.
F	i also received a text_message on the 00th saying that they would come back to me “ within 00 working_days ”.
F	in addition to this , three ' s website says “ if we cannot contact you , we ' ll leave a message and a direct number for our complaints team ”.
F	no such luck .
F	on the 0th of july i still had not been contacted at all and sent in a second complaint – which i didn ’ t even get an_automated_response for .
F	i have received no contact since .
F	it is now over a month since my phone was supposed to be delivered .
F	i feel completely helpless and taken_advantage of , and both dpd and three have offered no help or advice to solve the problem .
F	surely both_parties should be protecting their customers against things like this , and where a " safe_place " is indeed safe and only accessible by 0 neighbours through a locked door they should not be blaming individuals for the error .
F	i do not think that this is three ’_s fault ; i think that this is dpds fault , but three are contractually obliged to provide me the phone and contract that i have paid for , and resolving the issue with dpd is their responsibility ; not mine .
F	otherwise i feel that i am within my rights to stop paying the contract , and should report this incident to ombudsman services , and as a theft to the police ; at_least it may stop the same_thing happening to someone_else .
F	if i could go back in time i would pay more and stay with my old provider .
F	the way i ' ve been treated and my problem has been dealt_with is completely_unacceptable .
F	i ordered a phone and contract online and dpd were the companies chosen courier .
F	the day my parcel was supposed to be delivered i heard absolutely nothing .
F	the following_day a delivery slip came through my front_door - one day late is forgivable and probably better_than other_companies offering the same service .
F	i found the delivery card straight - forward , completed the section which said " leave in a safe_place " and left the slip outside my door the following_morning .
F	having previously heard very good things about the company i did not hesitate to have them leave it outside the flat .
F	that evening , the delivery slip and parcel were nowhere to be found , as it was late i decided to leave it until the next_day to call .
F	the next morning i found a new delivery slip , not in my flat or outside the door , but downstairs in the entrance hall to our set of flats .
F	it seems the delivery guy could not be bothered to come up to the flat .
F	i took this new delivery slip and completed the form online describing my " safe_place ".
F	the next_day ( four days after the supposed delivery day ) there was yet again no package .
F	after checking online , i realised that the package had been " delivered " and when i called up they said there was nothing they could do until the following_monday when they could talk to their driver .
F	i heard_nothing from them after that phone call , and heard from my phone company that as i has authorised the safe_place it was my fault the phone was missing .
F	let me describe my " safe_place " - it ' s a box outside our front_door , on the top storey of a block of flats with a locked entrance .
F	there are only two flats on the top storey ( 0 in the whole building ), and in the three years my housemate has been at the property she has not once had an issue with a parcel going missing .
F	i have since asked all my neighbours if they accepted a parcel that friday or saw any delivery men but have come up with nothing .
F	so now i am stuck in a 00 - month_contract with no phone , and no way to claim back anything .
F	spending more money on a new phone isn ' t possible , which is why i chose the contract in the first place .
F	i feel completely taken_advantage of and both dpd and the phone company have offered no help or advice to solve the problem .
F	surely both_parties should be protecting their customers against things like this , and where a " safe_place " is indeed safe and only accessible by 0 neighbours through a locked door they should not be blaming individuals for the error .
F	if anyone can offer any help or advice i would be most grateful .
F	always get good signal everywhere and if i have had problems with my phone they have always been delt with promptly .
F	recently sent phone to be repaired was back within 0 week .
F	people at o0 who i ' ve spoken to over the phone have always been helpful .
F	was a bit_sceptical if this would work but money was paid into my account the day after posting !
F	brilliant would definetly reccommend
F	comfiest pants ive ever worn and i love that they come in so many designs !
F	cant_wait to see what designs are next .
F	i absolutely loved the way the entire_process got carried_out .
F	i appreciated the fact that i received emails informing_me in which stage my laptop was in ( e . g . testing , quality_control ) and that i could choose the delivery date that was most convenient for me .
F	also , i was gladly surprised i got texts on my phone telling_me around what time the courier would come .
F	it was overall a great service and also the laptop and the gaming mouse ordered are what i expected if not , better !
F	would definitely reccommend anyone to buy from pc_specialist :)
F	we booked flights to new_zealand via traveltrolley , and received a message afterwards that the reservation was not confirmed until flights were issued ( which was nowhere on the booking process until after we had paid ).
F	after 0 days of no confirmation_email , we called them ( and emailed twice ) to find out that they didn ' t originally have those flights at the advertised prices , despite taking our money .
F	to add_insult , they advised that they wouldn ' t refund the charge for another 0 weeks - leaving us completely stranded without money in the account as this is a £_000 flight over christmas .
F	almost ruined new years - we had to borrow money to book new flights .
F	in their marginal defense we got an_apology call after we complained about the service on facebook ( which promptly got deleted ).
F	i would avoid
F	i can ' t believe i didn ' t know about this before now .
F	amazing .
F	amazing .
F	i have used graff city on a number of occasions , and will_continue to use them for any supplies i need .
F	they stock a great range of products .
F	service is excellent , as is communcation and delivery .
F	keep up the good work graff - city !
F	!
F	do not use !!!!!
F	ordered for mother ' s day , confirmation order received to say it would be delivered on mothering_sunday .
F	received an emai on the friday at 0pm to say they will be delivered on saturday .
F	this is not mothering_sunday .
F	called and spoke to a rude man , who told me it was better to receive them earlier then late or never at all !!!
F	advised i won ' t get a refund .
F	also then put down the phone on me .
F	email sent to customer_services , which i ' m sure judging_by previous reviews might never be answered !
F	had to explain to my mum why her surprise was now ruined , and why she now won ' t be getting any flowers at all .
F	disgusted with the lack of customer_service given .
F	do not use !!!!
F	i am completely appalled at the whole situation , i have rang them three times now .
F	all of those occasions i have spoken to poorly trained staff , who have never once apologised or offered any compensation .
F	i have now ordered from interflora , a reputable company who i have used before .
F	it goes to show a good price is too good to be true , because the service is shoddy .
F	£_00 wasted , and £_00 i have been told apparently will be refunded when the " escalations team " reply to me , only if i refuse the delivery .
F	which , isn ' t possible as its being delivered to a business address where my mum won ' t be on saturday !
F	also advised that theres an option at checkout for gaurenteed sunday delivery .
F	what a load of crap !
F	i have gone_through the checkout_process again , and this option does not exist !
F	useless .
F	i will be reporting them to trading_standards , and i suggest looking elsewhere if you are considering buying from them .
F	* updated on 00 / 00 @ 00 : 00 *
F	just to update , i have had an_email from a manager stating that i didnt select gaurenteed mothers_day delivery , therefore will never get a refund .
F	i have called , and asked the person on the phone to go through their process with me , as i cant see this option at checkout .
F	when asked what website i was on , i told him iflorist . co . uk , he told me no thats the wrong one , you use m . iflorist . co . uk ( which i have checked now , and does have gaurenteed delivery option ) however , the usual iflorist . co . uk does not have this option .
F	he told me i was lying , and that i needed to refuse the goods in order to actually get a refund , which i again told him was impossible , due to this being delivered to a business address and not a home address - so i have no control over who accepts it and who doesn ' t , as my mother wont be there today !!
F	completely appalled with the service , so much for their no_quibble gaurentee !
F	more like , take your money and run !
F	i have reported them to the advertising agency , and will wait to be assigned a case manager for this .
F	i will also be contacting_trading_standards first thing monday_morning .
F	please_please_please do not use this company !
F	they are a liability , and will not be in business for much longer if they operate like this .
F	they are liars , and you will get a crap standard of service !
F	save_yourself the time and money !
F	would definitely_recommend
F	i always end up buying multiple items from very because i expect clothing not to fit or for the quality to be poor , for example , so i order more_than one item thinking i ' ll chose my favourite and keep that one but i end up keeping most items !
F	delivery is always super_fast .
F	treats are usually great .
F	i often buy other non - clothing items as presents or for the house and have never had a problem .
F	keep up the good work very !
F	easy to use .
F	good detail of each car_park .

F	keep up the good work very !
F	the booking was easy and quick .
F	the hostel was like expected / described .
F	the only disadvantage was that the parking space cost extra 00 € and this didn ' t show up during the booking .
F	though , i would really recommed the service !
F	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for years now , and it hasn ' t once let me down .
F	from the reviews , to the pictures to the rates , everything has always been very reliable .
F	hostelbookers remains to be my preferred method of finding accommodations and it will be for a while !
F	the service is excellent , i was using a different company and it was a nightmare .
F	i had connection problems , interuptions , the line kept dropping in the middle of the conversation .
F	however since i came_across dial to save i have been one happy person .
F	my calls are smooth , and i dont have to call half a dozen_times before i ' m actually connected .
F	everything is straight_forward with dial to save .
F	i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend dial to save
F	i can ' t believe my luck in choosing this fantastic photography company .
F	exceeded all my expectations with great results .
F	my lovely photos will be on my wall forever !
F	everone who sees them have given great comments .
F	competitive_prices and quick delivery
F	a young_girl came on our door and walked_into our house without asking and forced us to sign the contract before she would leave .
F	sent the company emails and 0 letters before the 00 day cancellation thing was up and nobody has replied .
F	my connection apparently starts tommorow and they have charged me 00 . 00 already even_though i havent used their broadband .
F	i want to stay on ee .
F	i tried_phoning to cancel before 00 days .
F	they are impossible to get hold of .
F	i really just wanna cry .
F	i rely_on the internet as a agoraphobic person and i just want to cancel the contract .
F	im so annoyed and frustrated
F	i ' ve used printerbasics a few_times , i find the website is clearly_laid_out and the items are sent out fast .
F	i ' ve had problems with the latest ink cartridge , however sarah in their customer_services gave me good advice to solve the problem and when that hasn ' t worked she has arranged for a new cartridge to be sent out .
F	can ' t fault them at all and i will_continue using this company .
F	i bought some recycling boxes which were quickly delivered and although one lid had unfortunately cracked it was quickly replaced without any_questions_asked .
F	prices are great & i love all of the free_stuff !!!
F	!
F	great service as expected , everything came on time and was in perfect_condition
F	i bought some herstylers which i have wanted for ages but didn ' t want to pay over the odds for them i found this website and was very happy to see the outstanding value for money !
F	the delivery was fast too one very happy customer will be telling all my friends about beautycow . com thanks x
F	i have brought from other_companies before and had nothing but dramas :(
F	these_guys are fantastic , good value for money and their service was good aswell .
F	any_problems and they are straight onto it .
F	they know their stuff :)
F	i placed an order on the 00 / 00 / 00 for new kitchen accessories , mainly a set of tea , coffee and sugar canister and a few other bits and pieces .
F	all items were stated as " in stock " when i placed my order , and i was given a specific delivery date of the 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	the delivery date came and passed with no goods having arrived , so i contacted the company that day , and also four days_later having received no response .
F	i eventually got an_email on the 00 / 00 / 00 stating that tea canister i ordered was out of stock and this item had been cancelled , and the rest of my order would be dispatched shortly .
F	i emailed a complaint as obviously the rest of the set was useless without this item , and i was extremely_unhappy with the wait .
F	i received a seemingly automated_reply to say that my order had been cancelled and , nothing more , no explanation .
F	the item that was cancelled , due to no availability of stock , is still listed on their website as " in stock " for home delivery .
F	truly appalling customer_service , wouldn ' t use them ever again .
F	emailed over a week_ago with a product enquiry , zero response .
F	very poor ( non_existant ?)
F	customer_service .
F	service extreamly quick , took 0 day to receive my posting bank , and then another 0 days to receive my chq after i posted my phones off .
F	superior quality product and style that is hard to match elsewhere .
F	yes its pricey but it is so worth it !
F	the glasses i bought were around £_000 more in my local opticions and frames were out of stock .
F	i was hesitant at first about buying on line but after_reading the reviews decided to purchase .
F	i found the sales_person knowledgable and helpful .
F	my designer_glasses are genuine and in perfect_condition and arrived with my prescription lens next_day - i cannot_fault them some things arent too good to be true !
F	i ordered ( and paid for ) something 0 weeks_ago on the guarantee of 0 employees that it had been ordered and would arrive for christmas , only to finally get through to them on their never - answered phone today and find it ' s been_discontinued ...
F	they didn ' t bother to let me know this , call to refund my money or even bother to re - order when i paid , so now it ' s sold out everywhere and only available on ebay for twice the price .
F	grrrrr
F	best company i have seen and delievered my items on time , i will recommend this site to all my colleague , friends & family , they will love it to bits
F	i used hostelbookers for the first time today .
F	we arrived in cancun , mexico , absolutely exhausted after a multiple - layover journey from oregon .
F	it being late on a weekend , we didn ' t expect to find much in the way of a good , affordable hostel ... but within minutes of using the site , we had ourselves a private , double , thatched - roof style room downtown for only $_00 usd .
F	a big score if you ask me !
F	my only negative_comment , which wasn ' t even that big of a deal , is when we arrived at the hostel very shortly_after booking , the staff said they had not recieved the confirmation , as it generally takes a few hours .
F	the manager was called in , and she expedited the process for us , but still about 00_minutes of waiting around when all we wanted was to sleep .
F	all in all , thougg , excellent service that i will use again in the future !
F	i wanted to purchase a crystal from incrystal , i decided to contact them first to ensure i would have no_problems .
F	i had a response within 00 minuites .
F	i ordered my crystal , they then rang me up saying " we cant do it for that price we will do it for 000 ."
F	they were requesting more money from me than the price marked on their website and no where on their website did it say price may vary according to picture or any other terms and conditions .
F	i told them to refund my card and they told me they would do so straight_away and it would take 0 - 0 days to clear with the bank .
F	i have still recived none of my money back , and have sent numerous_emails to which i have had no response .
F	i am now in dispute with my credit_card company and am in the process of reporting them to trading_standards .
F	**** funny how they replied as they replied quick sharp when they wanted my money *******
F	i love that you can look at the map location , check out the reviews , and compare the prices for many hostels in the area and choose the best one to suit your needs !
F	really easy and helpful - no_complaints !
F	brought ticket to see comedian , and then read reviews and started to worry !!!!
F	well there was no need to worry !!!!
F	super service , e_- tickets and great seats !!!!!
F	a very very happy customer .
F	will not rely_on this company and their services .
F	information given by one of the team was wrong , so my package has been delayed by 0 months .
F	i believe it ' s wrong and now they i needed to pay a fee to return the item back to me .
F	basically given information been wrong so all service gone down .
F	not happy & will not use this service ever & will guarantee that my family & friends will not use your service .
F	was a little anxious to book and hear i may not get my tickets until 0 weeks before the festival .
F	i was texted via the royal_mail and the tickets came via special delivery the next_day so i ' m very happy .
F	after contemplating for a few_months whether or not to get laser_eye_surgery due to being anxious as to what to expect , i decided to take the plunge and go for it .
F	i researched a few laser_eye_surgery companies and opted to go with ultralase due to the fact that they seemed very professional , helpful , informative and reassuring .
F	there was no pressure , whereas the other_companies everything seemed to come down to the cost .
F	leading up to surgery , the day of surgery and after surgery i could not fault the customer_service i received at all !
F	they took me through each_step very thoroughly and let me know exactly_what to expect .
F	i was so shocked how quick and painless the procedure was .
F	the actual surgery time per eye was less_than 0 minutes and didn ’ t hurt at all , i would say it was a little uncomfortable and the smell of burning when the laser was on was a little unpleasant but in 00_minutes it ’_s all done .
F	i was amazed when i got up and could see the time on the clock across the room , it was brilliant !
F	an_hour after there was a stinging sensation and my eyes were watering as if i had been chopping onions .
F	but i did what they said and slept for a few hours after surgery and when i woke_up my eyes were fine and my vision was brilliant .
F	although ultralase was slightly more_expensive than some of the other_companies i researched .
F	i believe you get what you pay .
F	i ’ m so glad i done it ; my eyes were a complete success .
F	i would definitely 000_% recommend this to anyone .
F	i had no trouble at all booking my stay with hostelbookers .
F	my confirmation came promptly , and the reviews on the site were very helpful .
F	i would recommend hostelbookers to anyone_looking for an easy way to find great deals for accomodation .
F	we had a hen_night booked for leeds for 00 girls things could have gone wrong however what an amazing night .
F	cocktail lesson was booked for 0 started spot on 0 and were there for 0 hours had a right laugh would recommend ot to everyone .
F	the hotel was lovely friendly staff really nice breakfast in the morning and nor problems with the entrance into tiger_tiger the organisation from chillisauce was great ran like_clockwork all of us had an amazing night thanks
F	i think that the products you sell are of great value cheaper_than the shops especially for natural dog_food .
F	only down_side is that you dont sell nature diet in single packs and they only come in packs of so many my dog os to fussy for me to buy just one flavour .
F	your delivery is very fast within a few_days i had my package and the website is quite easy to navogate through .
F	i have now sold two phones to mazuma .
F	each time they offered significantly more_than all competitors and the money was in my account within three days .
F	everything from start to finish was carried_out efficiently and with minimum fuss .
F	i have been greatly impressed with them both_times .
F	both_times the service has been first_class and i would urge_anyone to consider them over all similar companies .
F	a great way to see a range of accommodation in any place you might be visiting .
F	pictures and a list of facilities available make it easy to compare hostels and choose the one that suits you most .
F	i love this website , i ' ve bought 0 pairs of glasses from them and with every pair , the service was exceptional .
F	when i purchased some sunglasses , i had made a mistake with the order and someone contacted me immediately to clarify the issue .
F	the only problem that i have is that you can ' t try any prescription_glasses before purchase and they cannot be returned .
F	also , one pair of glasses i bought are too loose and need adjusting slightly .
F	the fitting service is quite important to me so i do find this a little frustrating .
F	top_notch customer care , really friendly guys , couldn ' t ask for better service .
F	headphones are sick too !
F	very happy customer !
F	i found a pair of thomas the tank engine sneakers which were prefect , my son loves thomas and is having his 0nd birthday_party march 0th .. thomas themed ..
F	so i purchased them feb 00st , had them shipped royal first_class mail ( which says normally 0 - 0 working_days ) it has been way longer .
F	i have emailed on the feb 00 and have got no response and also have tried to call the number provided and says that it is not in service .
F	i would like to know whats_going on .
F	they have been payed for and will be extremely upset if they don ' t arrive for the party .
F	think carefully before you buy from there .
F	a lot of the stuff is very bad quality and made from b grade materials .
F	what they show on tv is not what they sell you .
F	it looks flashy on screen .
F	i have ordered many gameboy games from these_guys .
F	great prices and delivery .
F	if you want old_school gameboy then this is the place .
F	very glad i discovered them .
F	have used them before to send money for a collection .
F	i am now trying to transfer to a bank_account .
F	still_waiting and its been a few_days .
F	does still say its in progress .
F	i hope it all goes well !
F	i tried them for the first time a few_days ago .
F	i bought some lovely sperry topsider shoes .
F	delivered so fast and shoe was perfect .
F	great company to buy from and great selection too .
F	awful company all_round , they will try to sell you all_sorts of random services that do not justify the original reason you contacted them .
F	they just want your money .
F	services such as sam amongst others is just a simple install of snow software .
F	utter nonsense .
F	!
F	this is the first website i think of when i want to get upto_date with any new gadgets .
F	i love it .
F	have bought a few things and have always been happy .
F	i had the worst experience with talk_talk from beginig to end .
F	they were in deed quick to set_up but when problems came along nobody cared .
F	i asked to terminate the service as it was not reliable at all and i was refused .
F	i had to wait for hours to get through to the customer_service team that is based in india .
F	there so many other_companies out there .
F	don ' t choose talk_talk , you will regret it .
F	i am very pleased with the result .
F	your team has done a very good job .
F	i have recommended you to all my friends and everyone that comes into my living_room remarks and complements me on the canvas .
F	i would reccomend you to absolutely everyone .
F	very pleased with the work you have done .
F	thank_you very much .
F	staff were very helpful when i needed advice .
F	the course itself was very well_organised and very informative .
F	would recommend to anyone .

F	purchased tripp trapp chair and babyset ( both walnut ), harness ( beige ) and cushions ( brown dots ).
F	the guidance on the website was brilliant although the pictures for the babysets don ' t really reflect what you get colour wise .
F	in reality the colours match far better_than it seems from the photos , especially for the walnut baby set the colour seen on the website is a lot lighter than the actual product .
F	i had however googled other pictures of the product so that i knew what i was ordering .
F	the dispatch was practically immediate and although we ' re up in aberdeen the item was delivered within two working_days through interlink_express , they even give you one hour delivery slot .
F	all around excellent !
F	thanks !
F	i always use hostelbookers , not just for hostels but for hotels too .
F	they don ' t charge a booking_fee and are always the cheapest when compared to others .
F	brilliant service and the delivery guys ed and dex from swanley was brilliant and very helpful and polite very happy with my purchase and with the excellent delivery of the item
F	ordered a book that was in stock in the end of july_0000 .
F	after 0 week no book , then i called the company .
F	they had a lot of excuses and promised me that they would send the book the same day .
F	it ' s 0 months_ago , still no book .
F	don ' t buy anything here !
F	ordering from denmark , i didn ' t expect the delivery as fast as this .
F	0 days from order given .
F	ordered a chessbox for my hub - he ' s very content with it .

F	bestilte dykkermaske og snorkel midt på dagen .
F	pakken kom med posten dagen_efter .
F	brugte grejet i sidste uge og_det levede op_til forventningerne , ingen vand i masken og ingen vand i snorklen .
F	har handlet med lavpriskøkken flere_gange startende for 0 år siden i forbindelse med opførelse af et sommerhus , hvor vi både købte hvidevarer , bordplade m vask , blandingsbatterier og alt mulig andet .
F	har senere købt hvidevarer til " hjemmet " og i dag endnu engang noget til sommerhuset .
F	meget flink fragtmand - og leveret til_tiden .
F	har aldrig haft nogen problemer , fik byttet en vask som havde en revne ( var ikke checket ved modtagelsen ) kan dog ikke kommentere service i forb .
F	med reparationer , da der_er_ikke noget der_er brudt sammen endnu :)
F	stor anbefaling fra mig .
F	vi har efterhånden købt så meget hos dvdcity , så de skal også roses herfra .
F	leveringstider er_altid overholdt , der kommer mail når varen er afsendt .
F	og vigtigt - dvd ' erne er pakket så de kan komme
F	ind gennem brevsprækken !
F	jeg_ved ikke , hvordan det vil være at reklamere over noget hos dvdcity , det
F	har vi ikke prøvet endnu .
F	bestilte_en antenne til routeren i vores sommerhus kl 00 onsdag .
F	ankom til sommerhuset næste dag kl 00 .
F	vores postbud kom en
F	time efter og_havde antennen med .
F	( den viirker oven i købet
F	efter hensigten , vi har nu internetforbindlese i hele huset )
F	tak fra charlotte
F	so excited to find this website !
F	great prices - especially with the price_match !!!
F	easy to use , easy check out , quick delivery !!!
F	definitely my new go to for any of my needs !!
F	!
F	having been let_down by argos , ordered from dixons .
F	free delivery , received call 00_minutes before delivery to confirm i was in , took away old fridge .
F	ordered on the friday got it on the sunday .
F	fantastic !
F	ordered a freezer in july , end of september still not received !
F	cancelled and given up , went to dixons , delivered 0 days_later with no_problems .
F	store great , but don ' t have anything delivered if you need it quick .
F	the best price available online and was delivered within 00_hours free of charge !
F	excellent product and fantastic customer experience .
F	will have no questions in using this company again .
F	after problems with my order with another company i went searching for a company that can provide me with the pet_food i need at a reasonable_price with fast delivery - my google_search bought me to chemist_direct .
F	their vast_array of item categories was astounding , but the site was very easy to navigate and i placed an order with ease .
F	i placed / paid for my order late thursday_evening , my order was dispatched as promised on friday_lunchtime , and was received via courier on saturday_morning !!!
F	00hrs from order to dispatch - doesn ' t get any better_than this !!!
F	excellent customer_service and an overall pleasing shopping_experience , will_deffo be using making chemist_direct my regular supplier ...
F	with 00 guinea pigs to feed , i get through a lot of hay per_month - my normal hay supplier was getting slow to dispatch / deliver and the quality of hay was deteriorating .
F	i decided to look_elsewhere and came_across dustfreehay - their prices are very good and i only paid just over £ 0 more_than my usual_supplier for two large bales .
F	when i spoke to them on the phone , they were very polite and very eager to help - i was assured if i placed my order that day it would be dispatched and delivered the following_day .
F	true to form my order was confirmed and a few hours_later a tracking_number was sent to my registered email address - the very next_day i received two large bales of sweet smelling hay - my pigs love it !!!!
F	i will_definitely be shopping here again and will make dustfreehay my regular hay supplier ....
F	very happy :)
F	after_placing an repeat order with vetuk ( for 00kgs worth of pet_food ) i was surprised that i ' d still not received a dispatch email after the second day - i contacted them by email to which they told me they aim to dispatch orders within 0 business days - i replied telling them that my order was placed 0 business days ago - their replies were more of an_automated nature and not at all personalised - furthermore was the fact they made no appology for their mistakes / delays .
F	when i asked for my order to be cancelled if they could not stick to their 0 day dispatch promise , i was ignored .
F	i opened up a paypal_dispute and was told by vetuk that they had cancelled my order but they could not refund me until i closed my open paypal_dispute - this is obviously not true as when a buyer closes an open dispute without a resolution they forfeit their buyer_protection w0ith paypal - a clear breach of paypals terms and conditions .
F	i asked vetuk if they could fulfill my order by the end of the week ( 0 days_later - meaning a total of 0 business days since the order was placed ) and was ignored once again .
F	the only time i was refunded was when i mentioned that they were breaking paypals terms and conditions by forcing buyers to close disputes before resolutions have been made .
F	not once was i offered an appology or a resolution to my problem - very poor customer_service
F	i ' ve tried many online hostel booking sites .
F	but i found that hostelbookers is the best among all .
F	first , it is the cheapest site because no booking_fees are required .
F	second , it offers good reviews so that i can choose the hostels that are suitable for the stay during my trip .
F	moreover , i like their cancellation_policy .
F	you can cancel your booking within 00_hours without any charge .
F	i simply like using hostelbooker and i would not consider other booking sites since i know i will get the cheapest and most quality offer from them .
F	when my regular mobile bodybuilding_warehouse freelance supplier failed to deliver my usual order of either chocolate or strawberry performance protein though i would have a look at the website and order directly ...
F	i first searched for a discount_code , and found an offer for 00_%_off , then i had a look at the site , and my attention was grabbed by the words ' chocolate and vanilla flavour ', my taste buds immediately started to tingle with anticipation , haha .
F	a couple of days_later when the product arrived i was far from disappointed , this was the best protein_powder i have ever had , it makes my daily fruit and protein smoothy even more of a pleasure than normal , and to mix with plane fromage frais or porridge is a true treat .
F	i have already_recommended this product to friends , and i will be buying it again , and again ... and maybe some more times too !
F	as a national powerlifter and strongwoman it is my new goal to be sponsored by this product !
F	hint hint !
F	;)
F	the staff are both informative an knowledgeable , i have purchased many items from them over the last few_years for my gym , highly_recommend and will be a lifetime customer .
F	kwikfit north road cardiff are highly_recommended .
F	think it was mark and anthony and they both stayed behind hours to help us , had a tyre blow out on motorway and they were more_than ready to stay behind and wait for us to arrive in the recovery lorry !
F	can ' t thank them enough !
F	!
F	great company , fast and efficient service , greta communications , very helpful , pleasure to do business with look_forward to doing more business in the near_future :)
F	thanks

F	i have bought a few books from wordery now and they always arrive promptly within the delivery frame specified , the prices are reasonable and are a bit cheaper_than other online_retailers , they also have some american editions of books which i had been looking for and were a bit harder to find in the uk at a good price .
F	the service and price is all 00 / 00 from me !
F	definitely a reliable and trusted book seller for book worms like me :-)
F	i wanted to order cartridges for a my printer in a hurry .
F	after spending some time searching a number of on - line retailers i found printerland . co . uk to be the best value .
F	the cartridges arrived the day after i ordered them !
F	great service - thanks !
F	i got an_email with a 00_%_off offer over halloween .
F	i took full advantage of it and ordered a tshirt .
F	said tshirt was in my hands in less_than 00_hours !
F	that was impressive !
F	i love this company !!
F	!
F	i ordered item through groupon_voucher then had to pay an extra £ 0 . 00 postage + £ 0 " surcharge " only to be told via 0 weeks_later there was a flood in the warehouse of one of their manufacturers and that i could have a " full_refund ".
F	i got the money back from groupon but they have simply kept my £ 0 . 00 and so far have not answered any of the goodness knows_how many emails i have sent them .
F	i know it ' s not much but the fact is it is my money which i paid in good faith for delivery of goods which i didn ' t receive and they have basically stolen from me .
F	basically seems like a scam to me .
F	i don ' t want to phone there extortionate helpline .
F	do not do business with this company , wish i had checked this out beforehand .
F	i won ' t be trusting groupon after this either .
F	i am_disgusted at how bad talktalk are .
F	they came to our house to give us fibre_optic ( we already had broadband with them ) and they left us that day with no fibre_optic and no broadband .
F	that was 00 days ago and i still have no internet at all .
F	they have said it ' s not their fault multiple_times and they have sent one engineer who didn ' t fix it , another was supposed to come today and didn ' t turn_up and now we ' ve been told we have to wait another 00 days !
F	terrible terrible service
F	purchased a blue gear 0 music violin for my son .
F	chosen by my son , i was dubious_about buying a cheap violin - as a violinist myself i have seen some real poor ones over the years !
F	well i must_say it ' s knocked my socks off !
F	strings settled quickly after a couple of days , pegs a little stiff but easily rectified with a bit of peg paste .
F	for less_than £_00 it ' s a bargain and the tone is pleasing through the range also .
F	i ' ll definitely_recommend to any of my future violin pupils .
F	delivery very impressive also as arrived as stated .
F	super stuff , a happy mum and a even happier son .
F	happy days !
F	!
F	[_name ] from p0g was very swift and helpful for me whilst trying to sort out cancellations and refunds .
F	i have used hostelbookers 0 times to book accommodation for myself and family in the past 0 years .
F	their information and reviews are invaluable .
F	i would always use them above other_companies , as i find them to be the best value - and their website is really easy to access too .
F	ordered some flowers that were guaranteed for mothers_day .
F	the flowers were never delivered .
F	i spoke to customer_services and they called me a liar .
F	this is unacceptable .
F	i will never use them again and i would advise other people not to use them !
F	this site is simple and easy to use .
F	drop down boxes help you find the city you are looking for and choosing accommodation is simple using the tabs to look at rates , reviews and location .
F	even filling in the payment information and waiting for confirmation takes no time at all .
F	i would recommend to anyone .
F	easy and reliable .
F	would definitely use again and recommend to friends .
F	fast_shipping , great price .
F	animed is an awesome website , easy to use and great prices along with fast delivery !
F	this has to be the worst internet company i have ever had the misfortune to use !!
F	!
F	i gave them 0 seperate orders in the hope that my experiences were one offs , but no !
F	they don ' t even hold anything in stock , they order once you order !
F	!
F	0st order - took_forever to arrive and the website said processing despite it had finally been delivered !
F	0nd order - i paid for the express delivery yet on the day it was due to arrive it still had not been sent out !
F	0rd and final order was a joke from start to finish !
F	- i ordered mid dec in plenty of time for it to arrive in time for christmas , but no !
F	i had to email and call repeatedly to eventually get my parcel the second week in january !
F	never again !!
F	!
F	i have bought quite a few things from here now and delivery always within the time_frame given .
F	also great to deliver to others as gifts .
F	no_complaints highly_reccomend using amazon !
F	i have bought a few charms from argento now and everytime i am really pleased with them .
F	prompt service and quick delivery .
F	highly rate this company !
F	it ' s my second booking with hostelbookers .
F	i will use it in the future too .
F	booking system is very user - friendly , easy confirmation with a credit_card , well , what can i say - just like it and give 0_stars :)
F	quick delivery , great item for a good price .
F	nice selection and good offers .
F	free delivery is a big plus and my orders have been shipped quick and everything has been in mint_condition .
F	i ' ve found great , top quality products , at the best prices , from pet_supermarket .
F	they don ' t charge for the delivery , even on small orders , which is fantastic .
F	each time i ' ve ordered , the shipping has been fast , i ' ve been really happy with everything that i ' ve ordered , and will_definitely order from pet_supermarket again and again .
F	as well as recommend it to my friends .
F	ordered deluxe roses and lily bouquet 0pm and arrived at 0pm the next_day for free .
F	my mother in law was over the moon and said they were really beautiful .
F	very happy !
F	thank_you !
F	this is the # 0 reason i shopped here .
F	great company !
F	we purchased my engagement_ring and both wedding_rings from marlow ' s where we were extremely pleased with the service we received .
F	a special mention for kym who was lovely !
F	thank_you !
F	everything was perfect .
F	i purchased a usb drive with a picture of our dog as a present for my dad .
F	i was sceptical about how the picture would turn out but it was perfect , the quality of the product is outstanding , the picture looks fantastic and the delivery was so quick .
F	an added_bonus was that the product was half price when i bought it , but it would ' ve been well worth the full price !!
F	i ' d recommend this company to anyone without any doubt .
F	ordered some environ products from this authorised supplier after having an online consultation .
F	very happy all_round with items , speed of delivery etc .
F	the items have a shorter shelf_life than when i have previously bought elsewhere , especially the colostrum gel gift with purchase which was received in feb_0000 and has to be used by march_0000 , but no big deal as environ products have to be used quickly anyway due to the ingredients .
F	will use again .
F	easy to use website , delivered within time expectations - would definitely use again .
F	thanks
F	have bought dog bedding and dog_food at a reasonable_price , delivered free of charge and quickly .
F	good value for money and great communications .
F	will recommend and use again !
F	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
F	we visited diamond_dealer direct on saturday , the service we got from christina was first_class , she was attentive and listened to everything i said , even better she had a bespoke ring she had designed and had made that was perfect in every way ... exactally what i had been looking for , with help choosing the correct diamond to set in the ring .. liam managed to get it all made up for us on saturday so we could leave very happy .... amazing customer experience ... cannot wait to go back to purchase another :-)
F	shopto are by_far the best site i ' ve ever used to buy and preorder games from .
F	they ' re now the only site i use to buy games from .
F	i ' ve never had a single problem using them .
F	their prices are unbeatable - plus free uk delivery !
F	-, shipping is incredibly fast - i have received games over a week before their release_date .
F	basically they are fantastic , i would recommend them to anybody .
F	really not happy with this company i have sent so many emails about this and that i am getting sick of being ignored .
F	the flowers was brown and dieing and not like the flowers on the picture and i never got the bubbly i order which cost me 00 . 00
F	i spent £_00 . 00 on this company and got bad results never using this service again i have try calling emailing and calling the chat thing always offline got one email to send pictures as told and got nothing . i want a full_refund or i going take this further
F	i ' m still_waiting for a response to my email or i will get trading standard '' s involve and watchdog
F	hungryhouse has changed the way i order takeaways .
F	i hate using the phone , and never have any cash on me so it ' s perfect - i can order on my way home on my mobile and have dinner arrive shortly_after i do , without having to worry_about having the right change to pay for it .
F	really handy , really quick - great customer_service on the rare_occasion that there ' s a problem .
F	great stuff :_d
F	a friend_recommended this company to me and i haven ' t been disappointed - this was the cheapest place i could find this laptop , and delivery was extremely quick ( ordered friday_afternoon , delivered monday_morning - even with the free delivery option ) with the laptop well_packaged and fully loaded with the software it came with - no annoying installing for me to do .
F	very , very happy .
F	everytime i travel in europe i use hostelbook . com to book my hostel because it ' s cheap and there is never any hassle !
F	we bought a be crib which slightly broke after a couple of months , i told the custumer service team and they reverted the same day offering to replace the broken part and they also gave us a little present for our lovely baby boy !
F	very efficient and nice people !
F	the website mentionned that the item was in stock with a 0 days delivery - 0 weeks afterwards still nothing , not even an appology after 0 emails sent .
F	surely will never order from there again , i find it a disgrace that a company can treat its clients like that - if it was my company , custumer service would be key , i would have offered a discount , a voucher , and before anything appologies .
F	very fast and efficient service with no_problems what so ever +++
F	the customer_service was amazing !
F	there was always someone around to help with any enquiries that i had .
F	the course had a nice layout and was easy to use .
F	needing a replacement electric shower i came_across this company via a google product search .
F	the price was excellent but it wasn ' t clear what the eta was on the item so before i placed the order i phoned them .
F	my call was answered knowledgeably , politely and i was informed how many items they had in stock .
F	at no extra_cost ( and as standard ) my item was dispatched via dpd ( the best courier service imo ) and arrived next_day .
F	so not only was it cheaper_than other stores , but it arrived_promptly too .
F	in addition i was given the option on their website of either registering or paying via_paypal .
F	it always bugs me how you want to buy one item from a company and have to register on their website so i always look out for paypal checkout options - there really isn ' t any point registering with a company for one or two items .
F	this company allowed me to check out via_paypal saving me a lot of hassle .
F	they even put a padded_envelope into the box to protect the dial of the shower during_transit .
F	very thoughtful .
F	we purchased our first sofa for our first home from scs hedge end in june_0000 for delivery in july_0000 as our budget was limited .
F	admittedly we were silly and chose a light coloured fabric , however actually the fabric isn ' t really a problem .
F	the salesman was alright but a bit scatty .
F	the problems started with delivery - i stood at my front_door and watched as my poorly wrapped armchair was dragged across the filthy , wet road out the way of a woman with a pushchair .
F	it was brought in and i noticed that the bottom was filthy and the fabric had been torn , well , shredded actually by its contact with the road and 0 foot was completely buckled and broken and another foot was damaged so i refused to accept delivery - they told me i had no choice and they ' d have to send someone to look at it as they are ' just delivery drivers '.
F	i told them to take it back to the depot but they refused .
F	i refused to sign for it .
F	they called a manager .
F	essentially i was bullied into signing for my horribly mutilated armchair !!!
F	i then had to chase them to send someone and had to waste another days annual_leave hanging_around for the upholsterer .
F	to his credit , he fixed the broken bits but by then we ' d noticed that 0 side of our 0 seater sags considerably more_than the other which we asked him to look at .
F	he claimed this was because the foam in the cushions varies in density and that it wasn ' t a manufacturing_fault ...
F	0 years later and we haven ' t even finished paying for the sofa and already it is almost unusable .
F	the saggy 0 seater is so sunken i ' ve had to put old pillows between the cushion and the base just to be able to get out of it - it looks awful !
F	that isn ' t even the worst bit - just before they left one of the delivery drivers asked to use my toilet .
F	being polite , i allowed it - seriously wish i hadn ' t - he left the room covered in smeared excrement !
F	i ' m not joking .
F	he blocked the toilet then used the toilet brush to try to clear it then clearly accidently brushed this against the wall , floor , door and the mat .
F	i had to burn the mat .
F	the brush was smothered with soggy stained toilet paper and left hanging out of the holder .
F	i nearly threw up .
F	never again .
F	i spoke to the store who weren ' t interested and i spoke to scs customer_services who promised to get someone back to me - 0 years later i ' ve still not heard a thing .
F	will never buy another sofa there again .
F	wishing i ' d spent the money in bradbeers now .
F	also i should mention that the hollowfibre cushions went flat in less_than a month .
F	i ended_up buying feather ones in dunelm mill to replace them with ...
F	edited to add : still got 0 months to go on the credit agreement and have already bought a new sofa - this time in bradbeers .
F	terrible product , terrible service and overpriced for the poor quality .
F	pet_food is cheaper_than a high_street store , comes in larger quantities and shipping speeds are excellent .
F	so much more convenient than having to keep buying from pets at home and i can get hold of less common brands and types .
F	would recommend medicanimal .
F	my only_gripe is how complicated it is to get a prescription for advocate .
F	my vet won ' t issue one ( presumably as it is a profit maker for them ).
F	i bought a pair of playboy prescription_glasses for just under a tenner including postage :_d .
F	ad received them in around 0 weeks :_d i must_say that i am very pleased with the service my glasses are fabulous and quite honestly i could not purchase anything as nice as these in my boots opticians .
F	i am already looking at buying a pair of sunglasses to match .
F	and my mum is going to get some aswell :_d well_done all the team for the updates by email on where my glasses are :_d :_d
F	excellent range of very clearly - described products , and an incredible customer_services department .
F	i was buying home_brew items as a gift , and i asked for advice : the customer_services dept pointed_out products that would be the best choice , not the most expensive ones .
F	absolutely the best place to go for your home_brew needs .
F	i ' ve tried other mobile recycling_companies in the past but mazuma has got to be the most fast , efficient and communicative company so far .
F	i had the money in my account within 00_hours of signing_up with mazuma .
F	excellent and highly_recommended .
F	would definately use them again
F	good detail of the software - helpful team of staff when ever i had difficulties remembering my password too !
F	charlotte baker
F	like the products very much !
F	:)
F	and you should try it , too !
F	... nice experience .
F	the product is very lovely !
F	what a great assortment !
F	like it really much .
F	good navigation , great products .
F	love it !
F	having to pay for paperwork just because i ' m adopted and wanted to get married abroad was just another expense .
F	but tlc were really easy to deal with via_email and pleasant on the phone .
F	the turn_around on getting my paperwork translated , legalised and back to me was super_fast .
F	they have exclusive items on good prices , i saw a few things , i didn ' t found on other_websites and perfume click prices are much_better !
F	i really_enjoyed shopping with them , and i will be defiantly back to it .
F	fast_shipping international , cos when you buy your items , you do want them to come fast , which they did with a courier , so overall really happy about the service .
F	it would be really cool , if they would like give a few samples in your package of the new perfumes they having and all , but thats only a suggestion and everyone likes to get a sample and if its good , you can go buy it in 0 0 0 , so maybe in the future , who_knows !
F	this was possibly one of the worst customer_service experiences i have ever had .
F	i sent my handset in for cash .
F	i had to call twice before i was sent a report from checkmend stating my handset was barred and i had 00 days to remove this bar or they will send my handset to ' the authorities '.
F	immediately and in haste , i emailed back asking who to call and for advice and assistance to get this bar unblocked and was abruptly told to read the report again .
F	i then called this company , got through to a man called [_name removed_] who was nothing short of unhelpful , dismissive and rude .
F	there is a message from the md on the website , who says to email him direct if you want .
F	which i did as a complaint , twice .
F	both emails bounced back , [_name removed_] does not exist and in fact the md is from their parent company ecdl .
F	a company falsely displaying a non_existent md cannot be trusted .
F	i then sent the same email to an info @ address , and this has been ignored .
F	twice !
F	!
F	i then called my phone provider and insurance company and got this bar removed and told this company i had done this .
F	on monday 00th_march , i call this company up to 00 times and no one answered .
F	eventually i had to have an assertive conversation with a lady at the parent company who eventually got this matter resolved and my money in my account .
F	would i use this company again ?
F	not ever
F	would i recommend this company to anyone ?
F	categorically not .
F	did i report them to trading_standards ?
F	yes
F	have i got proof of the above things ?
F	yes .
F	be_careful using this company and sorry that i have had to give you a bad review , but until i am satisfied that you are a legitimate company who offers sound customer_service , i stand by what i have said .
F	good luck in the future and if you would like more information from me , please get in touch .
F	fast , efficient and too tempting to buy more things that are far away !!
F	great service !
F	excellent site !
F	recieved just over £_00 in cash back so far after only a few_months membership .... savings i would not have had without this site !
F	has so many merchants , staff are friendly and helpful with any_queries , rewards for successful referals of friends / family / anyone to the site and i really wish i ' d joined sooner and would have even more savings !
F	i usually always go for chinese so don ' t have any experience of using other types of food take_aways , but they have plenty of chinese in both areas that i have lived in the past few_years and the process is quick and easy .
F	instead of just having to stick with whatever take away leaflet you have at home , you can browse loads of different menus on here and they save your details so ordering is a breeze .
F	great , especially if you are feeling lazy :_p
F	unfortunately i had to return a faulty tap , but darren in customer_services made the whole exchange process run smoothly and efficiently , which made it hassle_free .
F	i was genuinely impressed with his professional and speedy response - thank_you !
F	pleased to say the new tap is working fine !
F	beautybay stands out from all the online beauty " stores " with it ' s wide product range , good pricing and also fast and cheap shipping .
F	i made my order on beautybay . com because the products they sell have a well written description and quite many responses and recommendations from previous buyers .
F	aviv ben menachem aviv ben menachem the customer_service is outstanding : thank_you so much for all you ' ve contributed to our community .
F	whenever you ' d like to write another review , we ' d love to hear from you .

F	my boyfriend found them on a forum and we decided to give them a try .
F	for around 00kg of meats ( chicken , sirloin steak , mince , hack steaks and so on ) for £_00 you can ' t go_wrong and can ' t say no especially when your man can eat you out of house and home lol .
F	definitely value for money and delivery was when it was expected .
F	the contact was great and i always knew what was happening .
F	i ' ve been passing their info onto friends and family and we will be ordering again .
F	laura
F	i ' d never_heard of this company before yesterday and glad to come_across a delivery service that put aside my negative view of the usual suspect / s of crap delivery service .
F	on time , no sticking a card through my door and driving away without chapping and a friendly service .
F	i ordered from myprotein around 0 - 0pm and yodel got it to me before 00pm the next_day !
F	no long wait , no hassle , kept up to date with their tracker and a very happy customer .
F	will be using again !
F	and again !
F	and again !
F	thanks yodel

F	thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to comment .

F	cheers .
F	great website with good choice of products including alternatives to the standard .
F	everything is a very good price , i regularly shop around , checking reviews and prices on other_sites and shops but always end up buying from ebuyer .
F	delivery has always been well within the time promised and can ' t help take_advantage of the occasional freebie next_day delivery !
F	product descriptions are spot on , you know exactly_what you are getting before you buy whether you are a nerd who_likes a full run down or if you rather stick to a brief description ... it ' s all there !
F	customer_service is brill .
F	good quality , clear , concise info .
F	may i boost ebuyers profits evermore !
F	easy to sell with a good price for an old brick .
F	money in my account the day after i popped the envelope in the post .
F	i ordered some flowers to be delivered to my parents who live in france for christmas .
F	i was given a day and paid for them .
F	they have never arrived !
F	i have tried to contact them by phone and email .
F	i was on hold for 00_mins with no answer - shocking customer_service !!!!
F	!
F	i am really angry about this and would never recommend this company to anyone !
F	totally disgusting !!
F	!
F	cant even get in touch with them to get a refund ................
F	really helpfull company , very good on the technical side of things , needed a pump urgently rang them up at 0pm in the afternoon had the pump next_day .
F	excellent service
F	i used unique looks to purchase my regular shampoo and conditioner , as it was here at the cheapest price i found them both .
F	i was so happy with the quick delivery and well_packaged products - i will_definitely return here for future_purchases .
F	i was actually blown over to receive my order as quickly as i did ( it came 00_hours after i had ordered it !)
F	i have ordered my nomination charms from other online companies and have usually had to wait a good few_days , before receiving my order .
F	i had such a pleasant and hassle_free experience with identity - another good excuse for buying more charms !
F	excellent value too with promotional discounts , etc .
F	this is my second order with clare florist - order arrived on the specified day , in good condition .
F	i would recommend this company without any reservations .
F	dear christina
F	email on may 00th :

F	nathan timblin "
F	nb : i called them directly a two days earlier and i was given different delivery dates , and the customer_service team admitted that my rose plant are already a week late .
F	update on 00th_may : rose has not arrived and i ' m not counting that my tomato plants will be either .
F	please could a member of sutton seeds contact me to arrange a refund asap .
F	a very , very poor service .
F	i ' m_afraid that i won ' t be using your services again in the future .
F	my order arrived , well_packaged , within three working_days .
F	very pleased with the transaction ; i would not hesitate in recommending monster_supplements to others .
F	ordering was easy and delivery was swift .
F	the t -_shirts i ordered reawakened my love of fun t -_shirts and my favourite childhood film .
F	best of all the surprise of a yummy sweetie in the delivery package .
F	what more could you ask for ?
F	!
F	fab service with amazing products .
F	keep up the great work !
F	i always use the hostel_bookers site .
F	they are the cheapest and the site is very easy to use .
F	i find using this site is a lot better_than other travel websites .
F	it gives you all the important information you need without all the advertising that you get on other_websites .
F	would definately_recommend this site to other people and fellow_travellers .
F	i now own two_pairs of ecco shoes and both pairs are very simple yet stylish , comfortable , and i ' ve had some people telling_me how great my shoes look !
F	they have a good size heel but still manage to be comfortable and easy to walk in , which is something that ' s hard to find these days .
F	delivery from the online ecco shop was fast , and arrived well_packaged .
F	i ordered a garmin forerunner 000 last_week from lanson running - it was one of the few stores selling the special white / green version that i wanted .
F	the price was the lowest i ' d seen online and delivery was free which was a bonus .
F	they emailed me when the order was despatched , along with the tracking_number .
F	the watch arrived within 0 days .
F	been out with running with it this week and it works great - would recommend lanson running for your running purchases !
F	the dry bags i ordered arrived quickly and well_packaged .
F	the price was good ( cheaper_than quite a few other_places too ) and delivery was free , which is one of the reasons_why i keep going back to them .
F	i ' ve always had the same great service and would happily_recommend :-)
F	easy to browse hostels anywhere .
F	cheaper_than all other_sites i ' ve tried and quick and easy .
F	i like the reviews section .
F	never had any_problems with them .
F	everything was so straight_forward .
F	will_definitely_recommend and use again
F	have used this site twice now .
F	items are excellent quality and very lovely charms .

F	quick delivery and was kept up to date with delivery progress .
F	my oh so yummy meat package was delivered on time by currier .
F	i was so excited as i ripped into the box to discover a yummy vaccum sealed meat selection surrounded_by little frozen gel packs .
F	everything i have tasted has been amazing .
F	they even have gluten_free lincolnshire sausages !!!
F	one item was missing from my box , however after a quick call to customer_services they sorted this out for me straight_away oby offering a redund .
F	i did however request it to be put in with my next order which is being delivered next week .
F	overall i am extatic with the service and the quality of the products .
F	great product , next_day curier delivery .
F	great fast service .
F	the game is awesome and the delivery time from when i bought it was super_quick !
F	me and my boyfriend got a 00th anniversary engraving for my parents .
F	it came out beautifully and my parents where over the moon with it .
F	i ' ve been playing in sky_vegas for some time now and have had a brilliant experience :_o ) there are great jackpots and a great variety of games .
F	brilliant site .
F	as if their low_prices weren ' t already good enough , they ' ll not only match competitor ' s prices , but completely beat them .
F	they also have an unbelievable selection of products and i don ' t even bother going into supplement stores anymore .
F	the only " downside " is the shipping_costs , but i usually get my supplements , a shaker , a shirt , and a ton of samples for what i would have paid for the product alone in a store .
F	totally worth it to me .
F	viovet was the only retailer i could find with a particular rabbit food ( which i used in as a base mix for rats ).
F	it was affordable and the delivery was quick .
F	no_problems , great site !
F	i had absolutely no_problems with this course .
F	i found it incredibly accessible , with the ability to revisit modules and sections very useful .
F	the mini - tests throughout were also encouraging .
F	online help service very good also .
F	really had no_problems at all .
F	sold a broken phone and mazuma gave me a set price online for the broken handset whereas other_sites gave rough estimates .
F	very quick , very east .
F	thanks .
F	i sent my device in to bozowi ( ipodphoto 0th generation ).
F	i was given a recycling price of £_00 . 00 for a working device , which it was .
F	i had an_email 00 / 0 /_0000 from bozowi saying that they had received the device however it had been downgraded to £ 0 . 00 as there was a software corruption on the ipod .
F	in doing my research i found that this could simply be rectified by doing an apple software update .
F	i contacted the company bozowi to query this and explained i didnt think the device should be marked down for the reason they stated as the phone was only being recycled and it was neither here nor there as to whether the software was updated or not .
F	the lady could not give me an answer in which she replied , " look , you either accept the downgraded price or we can send the ipod back to you for £ 0 . 00 ."
F	customer_service obviously not their strong point .
F	i was agrreaved that i would be paing more in postage than what they were stating was the ipods " worth ".
F	i therefore felt i had no option than to accept their price .
F	if the ipod is used to recycle parts why does it matter re .
F	software ?
F	obviosuly now i cannot test the item myself again without it costing me .
F	i know the value of the ipod was low at £_00 . 00 in the first place but it was the principal of it all .
F	i wish i had read previous reviews of this company .
F	i will not be using them again nor will i recommend them to people i know .
F	they haven ' t tried to sort this out for me at all preferring to adopt the like it or lump it attitude .
F	not very professional !!
F	!
F	update - received a further email later today saying that bozowi would not be able to process the payment as it has to be a minimum of 00 spend .
F	i cannot have the ipod back as the order has already been processed however they wont give me my money either .
F	i have to sell them more recycled phones etc to get the amount above 00 pounds .
F	i advised them i certainly wont be using their company again and i want my money and they have declined .
F	i have asked to speak to a manager and this request has also been declined .
F	to me this borders on theft , all you get back is you should have read the terms and conditions .
F	do not use this company !!!!
F	!
F	i receive the item very quickly , and it was at a discount price .
F	my father had a stroke in february and had to give up smoking .
F	he used to smoke about 00 a day for around 00 years and i bought him a product from smoke relief to try and help with the withdrawal .
F	0 months later and i have recommended around 0 or 0 people to this company because they are brilliant .
F	we order refills from them regularly and we have never ever had an issue .
F	delivery is always fast and the email communication is spot on .
F	the main thing i like is that i feel i deal with humans and not an_automated_system .
F	for example we recently got a little freebie for all the orders we have been making and there was a little handwritten note to say thank_you .
F	such a nice_touch and a company who obviously values their customers .
F	placed our order at 0 . 00pm and by 0 . 00pm it had not arrived so i took the liberty of calling the restaurant .
F	they informed me most apologetically that they had not received our order from takeaway . com but as we were local they would do their best to get food to us in half an_hour , bless them .
F	takeaway . com then sent me an_email asking how my meal was so at around 00pm i responded by telling them they had not even sent my order over and that i would not be using them again .
F	i then had a missed call at 00 :_00pm followed_by an_email apologising and saying the order i placed over three hours before had been cancelled .
F	who calls people that time of night ?
F	also what kind of an_idiot would i be if i was still_waiting for food 0 hours_later ?
F	i left it hoping they would leave me alone but on the 00th_january they emailed me ( generic email ) blaming their it system over the weekend and then_proceeded to offer me a whole £ 0 off any takeaway as long as i used it before 00st january .
F	yes , they gave me a whole 0 days .
F	i was tempted to email them once more but when i saw glaring spelling errors in the email i did not think i would get very far so again , i hoped they would just disappear .
F	however , yesterday i received an_email linking me to this site and asking for a review .
F	be_careful what you ask for .
F	do not use this company unless you want to go hungry and if the other food ordering site is not working , better off ordering over the phone like the old days .
F	;) update_: interesting how the 0 star reviews below all say very similar nonsense and do not seem to come from confirmed purchasers like those of us who are giving bad_reviews .
F	fake much ?
F	just saying .
F	use these_guys quite a lot for bits and pieces for my hamster .
F	they are brilliant and i always receive my items within a couple of days .
F	i had an incident recently where i received something that had a manufacturing_fault ( it would not have been spotted when packed for delivery ) and customer_services were very helpful .
F	they allowed me to email a photo rather_than having to go through the hassle of posting it and waiting .
F	i got my refund really quickly too .
F	i have used several online pet shops recently and i find netpetshop to be one of the best price and service wise and believe me i ' m very difficult to please .
F	:)
F	lots of info , easy to use pages , made booking an easy experience !
F	i cannot recommend crown_brush highly_enough , the item arrived the next_day .
F	the brushes are of a very high_quality , and the all eyes on you set is amazing ,
F	it ' s the only eye brushes i need to use on a day to day basis , they wash well , and are lovely to use , i wear make up on a daily_basis and my brushes get a lot of use , and these stand up really well to heavy use !!!
F	i can ' t wait to place my next order
F	i bought my wedding_rings from marlows .
F	the most elegant & beautiful rings i have ever_seen .
F	they made my dream_come true .
F	great service & lovely people .
F	i ' ve the same story as everyone_else , i ordered 0rd nov , have actually received today , box just abandoned at my front_door , but at_least its here , its seems good quality but only time will tell , though disappointed with the amount of filling , only half full ......
F	deramore is the best online_retailer i ' ve ever used .
F	i placed two orders so far and they arrived within two days on both occassions .
F	i had to contact customer_service regarding one of the yarns i purchased since two different shades were listed under the same name on the website .
F	i received a prompt reply and got a replacement yarn the next_day !
F	couldn ' t believe_how efficient and professional they are .
F	thank_you !
F	viovet were the cheapest for my dogs dap collar .
F	the collar arrived the next_day .
F	excellent service !
F	i ordered a changing bag from this website on the 0st of march , i received an_email conformation of the order and that delivery would be 0 - 00 working_days .
F	yesterday i phoned their customer_services to inquire as to when i would be receiving my bag only to be told that they had applied to my bank for the money but had never received it .
F	i then phoned my bank , who have no record of them applying for the money .
F	so i filled in the form on their website asking that why in the space of 00 working_days could they not contact me to let me know the order had not gone_through properly .
F	this is what i got back :
F	dear mrs jones
F	thank_you for your e_- mail .
F	i understand that you were not notified that we could not process your order .
F	regrettably , this type of error does not flag up on our system , therefore , we are not able to let our customers know that the order has failed .
F	this is something we are currently looking into as we appreciate this is inconvenient to our customers .
F	i apologise for the inconvenience_caused .
F	how did they know not to send the package out ?
F	but still couldn ' t contact me ?
F	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
F	the service was brilliant , it was delivered promptly and i was kept up to date via_email .
F	and some space back too !
F	0_stars here , fast_shipping , always have the best prices i ' ve never had an issue !
F	i was a bit_nervous_about buying from this website , after_reading all the negative_reviews .
F	however , i received my order this morning , and i have no_complaints .
F	everything is pretty_much how i expected , and the delivery was amazingly fast - it came sooner_than my order from h_& m , which i placed two days earlier !
F	they also shipped a couple of days earlier_than they said they would , which was a nice surprise .
F	however , i think you have to be_careful shopping on this site .
F	here are a few essential tips :
F	- use the ' ready to ship ' tab ( available on the left - hand side of the page ).
F	this means that you won ' t be looking at clothes that would take weeks to deliver , and it saves you so much time .
F	- when you find an item , carefully check whether the colour you want is in stock , and ready to ship .
F	i only selected items that were ready to ship within 0 - 0 days .
F	' out of print ' means that you won ' t be getting that item , so don ' t select it .
F	- look carefully at the pictures .
F	a lot of people seem to have thought they were buying another piece of clothing , from the way the models were dressed .
F	at the bottom of the page they sometimes have a photo of the garment on its own , which can be helpful .
F	it also shows you the thickness / weight / length of the item more clearly .
F	- don ' t expect amazing quality .
F	i only bought items under £_00 , so i wasn ' t expecting them to be very well - made .
F	however , i was pleasantly_surprised by almost all the items .
F	i didn ' t buy any handbags / shoes / jewellery because i thought there was a higher chance of these things being broken / poorly made .
F	i ' d rather try on a pair of shoes in my local shop and pay a bit more for them than order a pair i was unsure_about the fit / quality of .
F	- double - check the measurement .
F	everything i bought was ' one size '.
F	luckily , i seem to be that size - and everything i bought was fairly elasticated anyway - but the site doesn ' t seem to cater well for sizes abover 00 .
F	- be prepared for a worrying ' you order is on hold ' email while they authenticate your credit / debit_card .
F	i got really nervous when they sent this to me , but they soon sorted it out and my order shipped the day after .
F	i hope that ' s been helpful .
F	in all , i loved shopping with this company - the website is gorgeous and the range is amazing .
F	i had no_problems with delivery or quality .
F	i ' ll definitely be back !
F	they dont reply to your mail , worse customer_service i have ever had !
F	would totally recommend protected . co . uk , easy online form to complete and then excellent customer_service on the phone .
F	no_fuss , easy transaction and no being ' on hold ' forever like some companies !
F	!
F	thank_you :)
F	excellent service .
F	easy to use site , service was very fast throughout from receiving the post kit through to receiving the cheque .
F	mazuma kept me informed by email throughout .
F	can highly_recommend to others .
F	sammie was really really really helpful with my parcels and also has very good taste in programs :)
F	really good quality service well_packed an clear_instructions not much more to say but i ' m impressed
F	my partner loves watches and been a watch lover hes encountered numerous bad sellers i came_across watchwiseuk on the recommendation from a friend .
F	i called the shop looking for a breitling airwolf mens watch for him the guy i spoke to gary was more then happy to help and said leave my details and he would see what he could its wasnt long before he ' d called me back to say he had one so i went along to see it , it had had a recent service and was in near mint_condition the price was amazing cheaper then ebay ( very supprised ) came with box and paperwork .
F	what i will say is the service and the way they speak and treat you its like ye buying a 00k watch dont be like my partner whos lost ££££' s on ebay and other crappy online sellers these guy are the real deal and would totally recommend so give them a try first you have nothing to lose .
F	thanks guys needless to say my partner was very happy
F	great service and communication , super_fast postage & products are gorgeous !
F	excellent and fast service , had my money as promised the day after i sent it !!
F	!
F	i half expected mazuma to offer me less money than it showed on the website - i ' m just skeptical that way - but couldn ' t fault them one bit and would use again .
F	far easier and faster_than selling on e_- bay !
F	i ordered a pair of boxer shorts which are very good quality comfortable , the picture i uploaded was very good very clear i asked for the picture to be bigger which they did for me and i opted for the saver delivery , so thought they would take a while to come yet they didnt , i was surprised at how fast they came , i am a very happy customer and wud def recomend a friend and use tshirtstudio . com again
F	stocked exactly_what i needed .
F	pain free ordering and payment on ebay .
F	good price and delivery was so fast i could scarcely believe it .
F	couldn ' t ask for more .
F	just used anyvan . com to find a company / trader to move a sofa from bournemouth to bedford .
F	cost me less_than renting a van for a day and i had 0 great blokes to pick it up and deliver .
F	no hassle , no_fuss , just post your job and wait for offers .
F	very easy to use and meant i didn ' t have to drive down myself ( something i was v worried_about as i have never driven a van ).
F	i would recommend it over self - service every time .
F	great for those bulky ebay items .
F	i will_definitely be using the site again to find a local man with a van to help me move house .
F	i am using this site for a christmas_present for my brother .
F	it is easy to use and navigate .
F	the item i originally ordered was unavailable so got an offer of other straighteners for the same price which i found to be a very generous offer and also received them next_day which was a great service .
F	would thoroighly recommend using this site .
F	many_thanks to simon and mario for helping throughout the process .
F	a big thank_you to graham for setting_up the extensions .
F	very pleased with the service .
F	thank_you !!
F	!
F	very bad company i would advise everybody not to use this .
F	i ordered my tickets 0 weeks_ago , for swedish_house mafia the 00th of december in amsterdam .
F	the service which i have acquainted with has been of the worst possible standard .
F	i ask viagogo ' when will i recieve my tickets ' and my reply is ' rest_assured your tickets will come in time '.
F	how can i possibly rest_assured when i have spent £ 0 , 000 in flights and accommodation which i am not covered on .
F	' the viagago guarantee ' is a joke .
F	all i want to know is on what day will i receive my tickets and is my seller still selling them or have they pulled out of the deal .
F	in addition to this i will also add that when i have visited the viagogo website other tickets are clearly still available so why aren ' t you getting in touch with other sellers instead of leaving everything till last_minute and backing your business up with ' the viagogo gurantee '
F	my transaction_id is 0000000
F	i first contacted workwear_express with what initially seemed like a very strange request !
F	they were very accommodating and sent me out four samples with the logos printed / stitched on differently .
F	the second time i contacted workwear_express , we were under a very tight deadline .
F	however , they managed to pull it off , printing and delivering 0 jackets in 0 days !
F	not only did we look the part whilst wearing them , they were of high_quality and most_importantly the branding was just as we had asked !
F	i would recommend workwear_express to anyone that wants honest , fast and excellent service .
F	not only was the client happy with the overall result , the whole team in the office were happy !
F	i would just like to especially thank a lady_called cheryl douglas , not only was she a super star (!
F	), she managed the process from start to end and personally ensured our products were on time and to the highest possible standard .
F	i can not fault this company at all and look_forward to working with them again in the near_future !
F	transaction_id :_0000000
F	a few hours ago , i purchased two tickets for the kanye west show at hammersmith apollo this sunday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
F	after_reading reviews for viagogo on various websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred quid .
F	i wish i hadn ' t purchased them in the first place .
F	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
F	however , i ' m now extremely doubtful this will happen .
F	i had a great experience ordering from marks_electrical .
F	i would like to also mention that cristian was very helpful and understanding towards our specifications and suggested the samsung es0000 tv , which was a great addition to our living_room .
F	so much so that we had to change it to a bigger size , as we thought that 00 " was a bit on the small side .
F	we then arranged a collection and in the end , ended_up with a 00 " samsung smart_tv - which is brilliant .
F	great delivery times , great service , excellent customer_service and really competitive_prices .
F	thank_you !
F	product arrived on the estimated date and with free ' next_day delivery '.
F	i found the prices on save on laptops great and also the descriptions are more_than accurate .
F	thank_you !
F	!
F	i usually moan_about delivery about yodel were fast , friendly and kept me up to date .
F	would def use again
F	had what i wanted , had had so many probs with amazon i gave up and looked elsewhere .
F	i found this website and the items were with me within 00_hours using 0st_class royal_mail and each item hand wrapped - couldnt ask for better .
F	dont use large companies like amazon support people like this who actually care .
F	will bebuying more again very soon .
F	thank_you so much :) lisa
F	i ordered a very expensive pen as a gift from cult_pens (£_000 ).
F	received the item scratched .
F	not a problem these things_happen ( well actually this is the second time with cult_pens - but was not initially angry at this ).
F	as i was giving it as a gift i had a time_frame .
F	cult_pens said that they could not meet the time_frame as they were not willing to send out a replacement until they received the faulty one back .
F	what i found unacceptable and inappropriate was the communication experiences with cult_pens .
F	the company was not apologetic and not at all understanding - they were only happy to help out if i placed another order of £_000 .
F	i thought that this was excessive - i would be out £_000 of my bank_account for a mistake they made ( plus the postage and packaging to return the faulty pen ).
F	i said that i wasn ' t happy with this arrangement and could i speak to a manager .
F	i was later phoned by helen who could only suggest that i use a credit_card because they payments might be more delayed .
F	when i said i didn ' t have a credit_card - she said " well lucky you - some of us aren ' t as lucky ."
F	not only am i a student and depend on this money for rent i think that this was considerably inappropriate way to speak to a customer .
F	the conversations i had with the two women i spoke too were incredibly_rude - asking me why i couldn ' t get to the post_office the following_day - i don ' t think it ' s unreasonable that i could only make the post_office the day after .
F	when i told them i was going in to hospital - helen asked if i was there now .
F	i think this is incredibly personal and again inappropriate .
F	when i asked to speak to or be phoned by someone higher up i was again phoned by helen who told me that i could not be .
F	i have no_idea whether this was passed on .
F	i asked for some form of compensation for the trouble and i was given a £_00 discount .
F	regardless the shopping_experience was terrible and i did have to place another order of £_000 .
F	i had to ask a friend to deal with them on the phone the following_day to order the second pen because i felt that i was just not able to speak to them
F	to top it off the second pen received was also lightly scratched - i didn ' t complain because i couldn ' t face talking to the company again .
F	i understand that this is a small company and they have a great selection of pens but a service like paypal would have been useful and might have prevented this .
F	i love supporting small_businesses - my family are small business owners but i will never be using cult_pens again ( neither will my boyfriend for whom i bought the gift ) - the experience was inappropriate and terrible .
F	i ' ve used parcel to go ireland to italy and uk to italy multiple_times over the last few_months and not had a problem .
F	pick_up has always been on time and delivered in good condition .
F	i made a booking error and contacted the team over twitter and it was sorted quick enough .
F	sam , steph and kate couldn ' t have been more helpful .
F	i ' ll continue to use them into the future
F	great site love all their products .
F	i have found every product i look for every time .
F	keep up the good work .
F	easily the best underwear i ' ve ever had , love the designs and love how comfy they are .
F	love that they come in a cool little tin as well i bought some to give as presents at xmas were great gifts
F	web_site is helpfull .
F	reviews reflect the hostel ive stayed at .
F	i love u can see so much about what u are going to .
F	i can ' t believe_how horrible the past two days have been .
F	i was expecting a straight_forward one day delivery and it ended_up being the most frustrating time !
F	i needed this delivery urgently for a job i had been commissioned to do .
F	needless to say that it all went wrong and this ordeal made me lose over â £ 0000 because my equipment wasn ' t deliver on time .
F	there was no track of my parcel on the city_link website , i stood home all day waiting for it , with no tv , nothing , to make_sure i would hear the bell .
F	then finally , when an update showed up on their website it said that the delivery had been attempted and that a card was left .
F	it seems city_link staff_members pretend to deliver parcels while skipping the job instead .
F	unless i lived on a parallel universe for half a day , the bell never rang and there was no card .
F	the customer_service was totally unhelpful , pretending that i was lying and that the delivery guy did show up when i was away ( tell me about frustration ).
F	i spoke to the manager who told me i should come and pick it up at their depot which is so far from my place , no local bus route would take me there .
F	i obviously declined the offer to pick_up the parcel since i had paid for a delivery not a pick_up arrangement and that i have no car .
F	they then assured me that the parcel would arrive before 0am the next_day .
F	i had already lost half of my wage by then so desperate as i was , i could only say " okay ".
F	the parcel did not arrive before 0am the next_day , in fact , it didn ' t arrive at 00 either , nor 00 .
F	customer_service staff tried to get hold of their depot a few_times without luck .
F	finally around 00 : 00 someone from their hotline tells_me that the driver is a few streets away from my place and that he should get there real quick .
F	by 00 : 00 i still had no sign of a delivery .
F	i called again - i forgot to tell you that each time i called i waited between 00 and 00 min until someone would take my call - and was told the driver should be there by the hour .
F	an_hour later i get a missed call from an unknown number .
F	i call back a few minutes later .
F	it was the delivery guy who tells_me that he tried to deliver my parcel but that i wasn ' t there so he left .
F	what ' s wrong with city_link people that they don ' t know how to ring a bell !!?
F	i tried the bell quite a few_times during the day just to make_sure it was working and it was .
F	that was just too much of a frustration for me , i had lost over â £ 0000 and the only thing i wanted was my damned parcel .
F	the deliver guy did not bother coming_back , he actually asked me to go out of my building and look for him in a nearby street if i wanted to get my parcel .
F	facing the threat and the horrible attitude he had on the phone , i went downstairs and into the nearby street to collect it and have a serious word with him .
F	he didn ' t apologise or say hello , he just pointed at the parcel , asked me to sign .
F	i asked for some explanation .
F	he told me that he was actually doing me a favour to come and deliver the parcel ( really ?
F	).
F	i asked him how come that everyone visiting me in the past few_days managed to ring the bell and that for some reason everyone from citylink didn ' t .
F	he couldn ' t answer and repeated that he attempted the delivery and i wasn ' t there .
F	i obviously had enough with all this and just left with my parcel .
F	there is no need to say that i will never deal with citylink again and that i hope that this review can help people make the right choice .
F	i cancelled the other delivery i had scheduled to order through a different carrier .
F	i am leaving this review because it is not the first time that i have had problems with city_link but certainly it was the last .
F	placed an order on tuesday , 00th_july_0000 .
F	i have contacted many_times , be told the glasses ship from_hong_kong , and they gave me the reason is " there is very good a chance that they have been delayed in the postal system and you should receive the presently ."
F	asked me wait 0 weeks for the respond .....
F	i remember the times when it would take a long time to fulfil orders , keys wouldn ' t be in stock , but those days are gone .
F	cjs is nearly as quick a method as buying direct from steam or origin , i ' ve had no security issues either .
F	keep up the great progress !
F	i love this website , the range and quality of products is fab and with the great prices rosina_romance is far better_than ann_summers .
F	my questions_regarding size of costumes was answered_quickly and satisfactory and as a result it fitted_perfectly .
F	the delivery time was quick and i was really impressed with the quality of the product , the costume looked fab on gave the effect i wanted ;)
F	the website is easy to use , with detailed_descriptions of the products and the on - line chat option is fantastic .
F	i highly_recommend rosina_romance you won ' t be disappointed .
F	i certainly will be using them again !
F	great service .
F	i entered the wrong_address and they called to reassure me i would still receive he package on time
F	i have been a member of love_film for a number of years however i am now considering cancelling my membership since the amazon take over .... the ' new ' website is messy and difficult to navigate feels_like a step back and is clear designed to try and confuse you into purchasing dvd ' s from amazon rather_than renting them using the service you actually pay for !
F	...... added to this the number of blockbuster films that are not available .... it appears again amazon are being greedy and are holding back release of new films so that they can sell a dvd / blu_ray instead of you renting it throught the service you pay for ..... there appears to be a conflict of interests ..... amazon wants to sell dvd ' s / blurays and providing a rental service reduces the number they sell .
F	very pleased with flowers and had a very happy loved one who was so chuffed she sent me a photo of them !
F	brilliant way to get a number of quotes really quickly .
F	payment was easy , communication easy , payment easy .
F	what more could you want .
F	i ordered this through groupon and before i placed the order had kind of low expectations ( due to other bad groupon experiences i had since i purchased this ).
F	the photograph on canvas arrived and it looked like a beautiful painting .
F	came out wonderful and fantastic quality .
F	very happy i took a chance on this one !
F	the flowers were gorgeous , however if i had not gone for a delux bouquet them i ' m not sure that there would have been enough in the bunch .
F	delivery was very speedy , i placed my order on saturday_night for a monday delivery at no extra_cost and they arrived monday_morning , i received a text_saying they had been delivered .
F	the only negative with the delivery is that my message said ' the flowers have been delivered and left securely at the front of the property ', i . e .
F	had been left in a box on the front_door_step .
F	overall great service and lovely flowers :)
F	every time i have phoned the customer_services they have always tried to help me as best as they can .
F	their prices are competitive and delivery fast .
F	i ' ve never_heard of this company let_alone bought anything from them , but i must_say i was impressed with the price of two_pairs of prada glasses with my prescription & the overall service .
F	i had a query which led me to emailing them on sunday and someone got back to me first thing monday_morning before the offices even opened .
F	my glasses arrived today , so a lot sooner_than i expected and i ' m overly happy with them .
F	thank_you to lucy and the team for all your efforts to have my glasses sorted & keeping my informed of the process throughout the week .. best service by_far
F	i moved to first direct from hsbc in december as they offered a £_000 joining incentive and also where the provider of my mortgage .
F	i cannot rate them highly_enough , its basically a more personal and friendly subsidiarity of hsbc .
F	they offer a local rate telephone_number which i think is pretty_much 00hour and brilliant products that i think are always cost_effective .
F	their website is easy to use and best of all they have a really well developed mobile banking app for iphone users .
F	00 / 00 and recommend to friends all the time !
F	i visited pasta brown after a recommendation from a friend .
F	there are three menu options ;
F	dine in , take away , express lunch
F	they offer salads and pizza too .
F	the family originates from naples and has been here 00 years .
F	the service is still very personal , friendly and attentive .
F	thrilled at the idea of old_fashioned family restaurants ( dicipated by large food chains resembling cattle farms ) i asked the chefs in the open kitchen for a recommendation based on a love of spicy and strong flavors .
F	i was given the penne spinachi .
F	i am a foodie and eat out several_times a week , this is officially the best pasta i have eaten in london .
F	the quantities are massive and ingredients are completely fresh when you make your selection .
F	there is the option to have wholewheat and gluten_free pasta upon request .
F	whilst we waited ( all of about 00_minutes ) we where given a plate of gourmet garlic_bread with mozarella & tomato with fresh olives at a table .
F	highly_recommended to everyone , i will be a regular customer from now on !
F	thanks to the team working there !
F	orderd my t . i . t . p tickets online from this website .
F	was slightly_concerned website was not real after i bought the tickets but they were quick and fast at getting bavk to me and letting me know tickets were dispatched .
F	will definatly use this site again :)
F	if you ' re after quality professional photographic kit , try speed graphic of alton , hants - seems to me their service is about as good as it gets .
F	their catalog is about the best thing going since the famous wallace heaton ' s " blue book " of yesteryear !
F	!
F	i was sceptical about trying beautybay . com after_reading a few bad_reviews about poor service ad slow delivery .
F	i decided to risk it because they givea good discount and free delivery .
F	i am pleased to say it was worth the risk as the products came in good condition and within under 0 week of ordering .
F	i ' ve been booking last_minute tickets for sold out events with them for years and they never let me down .
F	extremely organize service , simple , clear and prompt .
F	this time i booked tickets for ed sheeran the day before the concert .
F	fair price , considering it was sold out and they contacted me not more_than an_hour after i booked to make_sure of my delivery preferences since there was little to no time to waste .
F	since i decided to pick them up personally at their office they even refunded the postage fee !!!
F	concert was great ... i was exactly in the middle of the first row !!
F	i honestly couldn ' t have asked for more !
F	!
F	extremely_satisfied with the service ...
F	i definitely_recommend them , especially if it ' s a sold out event or a last_minute decision !
F	!
F	susanna
F	absolutely fantastic .
F	they have everything you could ever need for a party .
F	have used this site a few_times now and would not look anywhere_else !
F	brilliant delivery service , fast and great prices .
F	the item received faster_than_expected !
F	brand_new condition , the image meets the reality !
F	thank_you a lot , i will_definately choose babla ' s over someone_else , in the future !
F	id_0000000
F	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
F	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
F	i would prefer some update on my order states as the website is crap at this even the track your order page !!
F	as reading the reviews below its not looking promising
F	to your reply 0 days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
F	sent my phone with the back damaged still got the full_amount the next_day
F	i love shopping with boohoo .
F	quality v ' s price is always great .
F	returns are no hassle and i ' ve never had a problem .
F	shopped online with them many_times .
F	love their ranges
F	good price , very fast delivery .
F	item as_described
F	super_fast delivery and excellent customer_service .
F	will_definitely purchase again and recommend to others .
F	chris came to fit my two new front_tyres whilst i was at work , he was on time and he fitted both tyres in no time at all .
F	wonderful service and i ' ve already_recommended to a friend or two who just can ' t take time off to get to a garage .
F	great value , great service really pleased , thanks a million !
F	the driver indicated online that he attempted to deliver twice , but we were at home and the package was not delivered .
F	we phoned the company and they did not pick_up any of the four times that we called .
F	we contacted the sender and they told us that the package was being sent back to them .
F	this was not indicated on the tracking web_site , where the only information indicated that the delivery had been delayed .
F	the sender had to send it again , this time to a different location ( our work address ) and this time the package was delivered .
F	in total , the delay was of one full week .
F	i have ordered several_times , because it ' s the best price on the web , and i have always had a perfect experience .
F	the quality of the tshirts is very nice , the quality of the finished design is also perfect , and they arrive very fast .
F	highly_recommended !
F	have been using pet_supermarket for a while now and not had any_problems until my last order .
F	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
F	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
F	not a major issue , but one that meant we had to buy food elsewhere to cover the gap .
F	prices are not much cheaper_than other_places to be honest .
F	probably wont order again .
F	i used resorthoppa based on a family recommendation and the fact there was a discount_code being advertised on their website when i went for a look .
F	we didn ' t pay a great deal for our transport to and from the hotel but on the basis of it being advertised as a maximum 00 minute journey what could go_wrong ??
F	well , we waited nearly an_hour for the transport to turn_up after collecting our luggage .
F	there was no shade and incredibly warm yet there was nobody around to provide any information as to how long the vehicle was going to be .
F	out hotel was very close to the airport and despite the promise of less_than 00_minutes we were on a coach full of other people for over 00_minutes .
F	we were the 0th drop_off .
F	on the way back we were waiting in the right area but when drivers arrived in similar vehicles to what we arrived on - none of the drivers called names or made any sign of trying to find the right people .
F	i asked 0 drivers if they were to pick us up and nobody seemed to have a clue .
F	once we were on board we did lap after lap of the area and the journey back to the airport totaled over 00_minutes .
F	absolute_disgrace , false advertisement and there is no way i will use again when a taxi could have job for the same price and with so much less hassle and discomfort .
F	took the armani watch my husband gave my son for his 00th_birthday to be sized at the norwich store .
F	unfortunately , the strap was broken in the process of re - sizing , which could have happened anywhere , however , they ordered a new watch , which was delivered and resized the next_day .
F	on the back of this level of no_quibble service , i would recommend them highly .
F	i missed the 0pm order deadline for next_day delivery , but rang up and spoke to a very helpful lady , who ensured i got the product the next_day .
F	the instructions are very easy to follow , and the matting is very easy to lay .
F	we bought this for my son ' s bedroom , and he_loves it .
F	we are now deciding which room to do next !
F	i was looking for a watch for my 00th wedding_anniversary .
F	having narrowed it down to a few in jewellery_shops , i decided to research online .
F	iconic_watches was 00_% cheaper_than any other web_site .
F	it took 0 weeks for my watch to arrive as it was not held in stock , but it was well worth the wait for the enormous saving that we made .
F	excellent service , next_day delivery once watch was delivered to them .
F	would definitely_recommend and use again .
F	ordered flowers on friday for mother ' s day even paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered on sunday due to living so far away from my partners mum , they waited in all day for them to be delivered and the flowers were a no show .
F	called to complain and am still_waiting on hold 00_mins +
F	i have been using gjw titmuss for over 0 years now and have never had a problem with their service .
F	it was even a brilliant service whan we lived on the isle of wight
F	i google searched front line for dogs ... this website came up - tried it for the first time .
F	cheap product , good named brand , fast delivery , couldn ' t have asked for , or wanted more .
F	can ' t say more_than just book it !
F	had a really good time all 00 us enjoyed it and found it was such good vaue for money .
F	it livened our group up ready for a great night out .
F	i ' m so surprised by this website .
F	i never even realised you could order glasses online before my friend told me !
F	the home_trial was perfect , you can choose the frames that you ' re interested in and try them at home for a few_days and then order the ones that suit you best .
F	it was sent out quickly and gave clear_instructions on how to send them back and when to do it by to avoid being charged .
F	when ordering , all you need is an up to date prescription given to you the last time you went to the opticians , and then once you ' ve picked your frames you can add any extras for a small fee .
F	i will never be shopping at specsavers or any other high_street retailer ever again .
F	communication was excellent as any changes made to your order will be emailed directly to your inbox - keeping you up to date on what stage your glasses are at and whether they have been mailed out to you yet .
F	i ' d also recommend signing_up to their newsletter because they often include special_offers for subscribers - i did and managed to snag myself a 0 for 0 deal with free shipping !
F	perfect !
F	000_% fully recommended .
F	you really can ' t get any better_than this .
F	genuinely impressed with the overall service provided by iphonespecialist from start to finish .
F	my brother had accidentally knocked his iphone_0s causing the screen to shatter into pieces and without insurance on his phone , the repair would ' ve cost £_000_+ to fix if done via apple and through the use of this website it was done quick and at a very reasonable_price .
F	communication was perfect throughout and we received the phone a day after they had sent it which was brilliant ( and i didn ' t even have to pay for special delivery )!
F	iphone came perfectly packaged and even came with a free screen_protector .
F	finding it very hard to believe some of these reviews if i ' m honest .
F	i will_definitely be using iphonespecialist again in the future and will recommend it to all my friends .
F	i recently sold some phones to mazuma , they offered more money if you had the money put onto a card which you could use in argos , so i took that option ......... mistake , they make it so hard for you to spend the money , emails , activation_code , several telephone_calls to 00 numbers , it has probably cost me money to get_rid of the phones !
F	much_better_than royal_mail , their standard service includes proof of postage , tracking and best of all , they ' ve never lost a package !
F	the can collect from your door if you don ' t have the time to take the package , plus , there are various options for drop_off , so it can be done if you ' re at home , work or en_route somewhere .
F	the only thing i would change is maybe more locations such as a co - op .
F	lower prices are always welcome but the prices are reasonable .
F	providing the best rate around , whilst being super easy to use and having free delivery the next_day , what else could you ask for ?
F	my orders with partyrama are always quick and easy , i am very happy with the service and variety on the website and will_continue to always use party rama :) thank_you
F	very easy to use , very quick response , very quick payment .
F	it is as it says on the tin !
F	i joined talktalk in feb and ordered the full package of tv , phone and broadband .
F	its fair to say sine joining i have placed over 000 phonecalls to talktalk due to major billing issues and tv / internet problems .
F	the first issue was the internet .
F	extremely laggy and continuously cuts off , especially after 00pm .
F	after contacting talktalk about this issue they arranged an engineers appointment .
F	when he arrived he did nothing but tweak my speed from 0mbps to 0mbps ( just to let you know its now back down to 0 ) .
F	shortly_after i received my bill .
F	my package is roughly £_00 a month .
F	my bill came through at short of £_000 !!.
F	after around two_weeks of daily 0 hour phone_calls to talktalk they finally discovered i had been charged an engineer fee of £_00 even_though he did nothing .
F	after admitting it was a false charge the £_00 was removed and i paid the remaining_balance .
F	two_weeks_later i receive by bill again .
F	£_000 . 00 this time !!!
F	turns_out they credited the £_00 back into my account one month then re - applied it the next month .
F	obviously it consisted of more phonecalls for roughly 0 - 0 weeks while being constantly disconnected due to non payment even_though they caused the problem again .
F	the problem finally got fixed a few weeks_ago and they took the charge off once again .
F	just to state my internet is still like the old style tesco dial up system .
F	secondly i had requested to pay by pay point , which requires a key fob to be sent out ( lets be serious , who would trust them with direct_debit payments ) .
F	the first key fob was requested at the end of feb . 0 weeks_later , still no key fob which meant last months bill wasnt paid .
F	i then find out that the customer_service agent hadn ' t actually placed the order .
F	luckily for me the call was recorded for my proof .
F	i finally received one yesterday .... nearly 00 weeks_later .
F	inbetween this time iv made numerous phone_calls to talktalk rude customer_service agents and managers , been sworn at , and been hung_up because they ' ve been to busy to deal with me ( yes , iv been told this ).
F	iv also been disconnected roughly 00 times even_though iv had 0 - 0 different managers promise i wont lose my services while waiting on my key fob .
F	tomorrow i will be placing a call to head_office and if they refuse to help i will be emailing the ceo directly .
F	i seriously urge_anyone out there even considering joining talktalk to run as fast as they can in the other direction .
F	if i wasnt stuck in an 00 month_contract , i would be with another provider !!!
F	!
F	liked it , good service
F	very good service and excellent transfer of money for my phone that i sent to them .
F	i recieved payment within 0 days of sending my phone to them .
F	i would send them my phones again if i need cash for my phones .
F	using chillisauce to arrange my sister ' s hen_party was the best decision i made .
F	it was daunting at first however using this company took all the stress and financial side away from me .
F	i did not have to handle any of the girls ' money so if they didn ' t pay i didn ' t lose out ( or fall out with anyone !).
F	the organisation was fantastic , can not fault it .
F	friendly , funny staff at all stages .
F	no request too much hassle .
F	i would highly_recommend using this company to anyone .
F	i will be using in the future !
F	ordered from here due to price , everywhere_else at_least £_00 more_expensive .
F	great customer_service , always replied and very helpful , got order to me by date agreed in terms , even made sure i received the white ipad after i ordered black in error .
F	reliable tracked delivery .
F	paypal offered and i reccomend you use this for payment for your own piece of mind .
F	really impressed with the company - just hope the warrantly does not let me down if i have to use it ( fingers_crossed not ).
F	just_eat has literally made my weekend .
F	i no_longer have to worry_about the shops after a long week at work , i just get my i pad place my order and 00 - 00_mins ding ( or knock in my case as no door_bell !)
F	theres our curry / chinese / pizza ect .
F	one of my orders had not gone_through correctly so just_eat called me straight_away and sorted with my chosen restaurant .
F	just_eat has changed takeways forever they are now bring in ' s .
F	you can even pay by card if you have no cash at home .
F	the ultimate in convinient food treats .
F	0_stars from me from a faultless company - keep up the good work just_eat :)
F	always great service from mazuma and used the bank_transfer this time it was so quick an easy
F	my husband and i recently ordered my eternity_ring from diamonds_factory .
F	we did a lot of research before_deciding to purchase .
F	i was nervous regarding placing such a high value order with an internet based company but i needn ' t have been .
F	i received the ring last_week ( in 0 . 0 weeks exactly as promised ).
F	it was very well , and discreetly packaged , sent by recorded next_day delivery .
F	the presentation_box and certificates are all perfect and the ring is simply stunning .
F	i literally could not be_happier with it .
F	and all for half the price of the high_street .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone considering ordering a special diamond piece of jewellery .
F	i have received so many compliments on my ring and i am absolutely_delighted with it !
F	thank_you !
F	very professional service .
F	we were always kept up to date with the location of our watch .
F	excellent price .
F	excellent quality cards , easy to use website and products delivered quickly in perfect_condition .
F	will use this company again .
F	i have bought from red_hot twice and both_times my orders were delivered super speedily and correctly .
F	they are good value and have tonnes of choice !
F	very happy with my miu miu s and ray_bans !
F	i ordered zylkene for my dog and found animed to be much cheaper_than the vets and the cheapest animal pet meds website by_far .
F	also very quick delivery considering it is the christmas_period .
F	will be using this site from now on and would definitely_recommend to others .
F	had two flat tyres after stupidly hitting the kerb .
F	thankfully , eugene & kam came to the rescue within a couple of hours !
F	thank_you guys !
F	great job !
F	highly_recommended .
F	i have used this company many_times and are very helpful and have quick delivery , would deffinately recommend this company
F	after months of research – being the indecisive individual that i am , i decided to place an order for the beautiful swan chair in purple danish wool .
F	a couple of weeks into the order i decided to change to a black danish wool and a lovely_lady on the phone was more_than happy to change my order for me without_hesitation .
F	the chair is stylish and has made my room .
F	the purple is lovely but the black looks more classic i think and i will be able to use it in different rooms if i want to move it around .
F	i ordered a pair of butterfly twist shoes last_week and they came the next_day .
F	everything went according to plan and the delivery was very quick .
F	so far in my experience , i have nothing bad to say about this company .
F	i just wanted to write in to say how thrilled i was with the service i have received from ukdigitalcameras . com .
F	i ordered a sony cybershot w000 on sunday and it was in my hand on tuesday .
F	i even had a fantastic call to let me know the camera had been despatched .
F	thank_you so much - i will be recommending you to all my friends !
F	laura - croydon .
F	jenni dealt_with my problem today - she was extremely_helpful and left me a happier custome
F	muchas gracias jenni !!!
F	regards from züruch !
F	slow process and still_haven ' t got my cheque after 00 days !
F	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn ' t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
F	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has been 00 !
F	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
F	if they do finally pay up i will have no problem with the delay as i am in no rush for the money , but there website should state that the payment can take up to a month !
F	i ordered lots of items from here , apart_from one being out of stock everything was good !
F	they emailed me asking what i would like to do about the item out of stock so quickly and i just changed it for something similar , they were so good at sorting it out and it still came within 0 days !
F	great customer_service and great delivery !
F	items are all great quality
F	i would recommend this to anyone
F	i love this website it always has amazing deals i wont shop any were else love it

F	clear , easy_navigation .
F	you get all the information you need about the place and the reviews of the places are really dependable .
F	a trusted company .
F	good prices and fast delivery .

F	kudos g0m .
F	cycling back home from barnes i got a puncture - the owner of this company came straight out of sainsbury ' s , took the tyre off my 00 year_old lucy 0 speed and helped_me pump the tyre up enough to get home .
F	i thought it was such a kind gesture to a complete stranger , he took 00 - 00_minutes out of his sunday_afternoon to struggle with my wheel on the side of the road .
F	he even went off to get tools and a pump and came back to finish .
F	i would definitely trust him and his company - am_currently browsing for vintage style bike bits on pedal - pedal !
F	got varying prices , didn ' t go for the cheapest but good to shop around .
F	would use again .
F	my husband and i love this site .
F	its so easy to locate and book a babysitter in our area , and our kids have loved the babysitters we ' ve been allocated .
F	this website really gave us hope that no matter what we have planned - we can always rely_on findababysitter . com to look after the kids .
F	when using other booking sites , it feels_like i ' m loading page after page in order to book a room .
F	hostelbookers was quite refreshing in that everything i needed to input was on one page , and all the information i needed to know was included there as well .
F	i don ' t feel_like i ' ve gotten a better deal anywhere_else , too .
F	not only this , but using hostelbookers , you pay the hotel when you arrive at the hotel , which is something i like .
F	i ' ve been using feel good contact_lenses for over 0 months now and will_continue to do so .
F	it ' s easy to order your supply and have them sent straight to my home address with no hassle and in no time at all .
F	prices are value for money and less then high_street retailers !
F	drivers were on time .
F	efficient and cars were very clean .
F	will_definately use again .
F	brilliant service , package arrived early and safely , thank_you .
F	great product as usual and very fast delivery !
F	you are number one for all dads birthday and christmas presants !
F	thanks again
F	ordered the cheapest chest freezer on the net , free next_day delivery , called to confirm the time was okay before they turned_up , spot on time , opened it for me , took away the plastic wrapping for us .
F	cannot_fault them !
F	used home delivery for a while .
F	i can ' t drive so when i was a student in bolton it was brilliant .
F	used to carry it upstairs to my kitchen and went through any unavailable or substituted items one by one to make_sure they were okay .
F	now its a complete_joke - the ashton - under - lyne store is now my delivery store and they are usless .
F	we don ' t live near an asda so this is really our only way but given the current service were switching to sainsburys , a little dearer but at_least i may actually get my shopping from them .
F	we booked a 00 - 0pm slot because we were in anyway and its a little cheaper .
F	000 came and rang the store , they advised they had had some trouble with one of the freezer vans so maybe a little late .
F	said thanks and kept waiting .
F	000 came and rang again , warehouse staff only guys available and told us that if the vans out it wil come .
F	0000 came and noone answering any of the phones at the store , tried the customer_service line who tried the store - were advised it was on its way .
F	0000 came and tried the store , finally got told that the drivers had all come back and gone home , no orders had been returned since 00 when this guy started his shift so must have been delivered .
F	called back the next_day and got rebooked for 00 - 0 with a promise of a phonecall to discuss compensation for the mistakes - assistant manger called who couldn ' t help so manager would call at 00 .
F	no call .
F	chased and chased but the shopping arrived first .
F	not much choice other than to accept it .
F	two days_later and several calls and still no call from the manager .
F	chasing again tomorrow or putting in a complaint with head_office .
F	we have had numerous other problems with delivery from this asda - missing items , wrong items ( wrong sizes , white sugar instead of brown , plain flour instead of self raising ), over charged , late deliveries , one time all of our frozen_food had been missed , last delivery all of the frozen stuff has defrosted and the chilled food was warm meaning most of it went off well way before the best before dates ...
F	the list_goes on .
F	first time from this store the delivery guy smashed a bottle of bleach and trailed it through the building , in the lift , in the hallway and into my flat .
F	it covered me and my partners clothes before we realised ( it had smashed then leaked over a load of the bags ) ruining our clothing and some of the shopping .
F	in all fairness they refunded that whole shop to cover the cost of clothing , but still , he shouldn ' t have delivered it if he knew what he had done .
F	overall a bit of a naff service .
F	ashton store in particular is a crap store with a seemingly useless , uncontactable manager .
F	took me two and a half years to convince them i didn ' t recieve an item .
F	they accused me of lying , called me a thief - they told me they had proof of delivery from parcelnet .
F	when i told them to prove it as i hadn ' t signed for anything it turned_out the item was sent via_royal_mail on a standard delivery - yet still they continued to chase me for the £_00 .
F	after two and a half years the bill exceeded £_000 with all the fees and late payment charges .
F	i finally got them to wipe it and close my account ..
F	they then started chasing me to make an order as it " had been so long since i last ordered " - wonder_why !
F	i emailed their support_team back last_week to get this stoppedand actually close my account and haven ' t heard_anything since .
F	they sell cheaply_made , over priced plus sized clothes knowing only a few high_street shops sell these sizes so some people are stuck .
F	there are better shops online ladies !
F	no need to settle for their cheap , nasty clothing and poor customer_service !
F	edited again - they have changed their number - it is now 0000 000 0000 - similar method to speak to a person works - select 0 for tracking , 0 again for consignment_number , tap in 0000000000 then # to accept , it will then try and put you through to a person , takes about 00 seconds if you can type quick ).
F	apparently they have had some departmental changes so numbers changed .
F	also their international enqueries line is open later than 0 ( i spoke to them at 000 ) but they can help - 0000 0 000 000 .
F	i am due another parcel tomorrow , not holding my breath !
F	quick edit on how to speak to a person on the main line ... ring 0000 - 000 - 000 , select option 0 for redelivery - it will ask for the number from the card they left , needs an eight digit number - i used 00000000 the hit # to enter this .
F	it will read it back , press 0 to confirm .
F	it will try to confirm the postcode , press 0 to say its incorrect and tada you get a real_person between_0am and 0pm !
F	give them your details and complain away !
F	my review :
F	this is the second time i have had probems with this pointless firm .
F	yoursclothing only seem to use them even_though they are completely_useless .
F	first time they turned_up at the bottom of my block of flats and drove away without so much as getting out of their van .
F	first time i got a 0 hour delivery window and when it passed and my partner advised they hadn ' t dropped it off i got through to customer_services and got it redelivered that night .
F	the driver didn ' t say a word to my partner and just drove off after he signed for it .
F	the parcel had been clearly_labelled to leave with concierge if they couldn ' t get in - clearly ignored it .
F	the driver denied this had ever been on the parcel - he had ripped it off when we complained !
F	the part of the label with delivery instuctions had been torn off leaving a hole in the bag .
F	advised them of this , got no response to my complaint .
F	typical it seems ...
F	this time is an utter mess ...
F	they couldn ' t confirm a delivery slot of 0 hour so i got told between 0 and 0 via_email .
F	i rang to confirm they had the delivery details about concierge and how to get into the building - they confirmed it was written on the parcel , the woman i spoke to confirmed the delivery times were actually 000 to 0 and added my phone number to the system incase there were any_problems .
F	got to 000 and no parcel .
F	rang again and was told the driver had a flat tire so maybe up to 0pm .
F	confirmed this was ok , just urgent i got my parcel - she said this would be okay .
F	000 and no parcel , tried line to be told shut at 0pm .
F	tried depo after finding the number and no answer .
F	got email at 000 telling_me they had tried delivery at 000 and i wasn ' t home .
F	this is utter bull , we confirmed with concierge that no delivery vans or cars that weren ' t driving into the private car_park had been up the road and he certainly hadn ' t left a card anywhere like the tracker says .
F	called their depo again and the only guy there advised there is nothing he can do as they are now shut - how convenient - driving putting getting back to the office on time over me getting my parcel - even_though i paid for next_day delivery because its urgent .
F	he has put it for delivery before 00am but given these reviews i doubt i ' m getting it this month let_alone tomorrow .
F	utter waste of space , staffed by liars and idots !
F	i wanted to cancel my order , and sammie_taylor cancelled my order in a second and i got my refund back .
F	very professional !
F	ordered some flowers to be sent to my partner at her work for friday 00th_december .
F	decided to choose the christmas kisses selection .
F	ordering was quite straight_forward and with free delivery it seemed too good to be true ... well it was ....
F	i decided to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 ish which stated ' guaranteed immediate email when flowers delivered ' as i thought well at_least that way i ' ll know everyone has gone_smoothly .
F	well about midday i got a txt from my partner to say she had received that ...
F	yet no ' guaranteed ' email which i paid the extra for !
F	i emailed them ... no reply .
F	i then got my ' guaranteed immediate email ' from them yesterday_afternoon to which i then forwarded this onto them stating they should at_least refund this charge to me .
F	no reply .
F	i went to visit my partner last_night and asked to see the flowers and oh my god iv never felt so embarrassed in my life !!
F	they look nothing like the flowers i ordered .
F	instead it ' s all green rubbish - i have no_idea what it is apart_from foliage i think it ' s called - i ' m not a flower person .
F	but yes they looked dreadful !
F	imagine my surprise when i then looked on here to see what the reviews were like and everyone is complaining_about the same_thing and that the company never reply to emails .
F	well i ' m not gonna waste my time phoning the premium_rate number as i can ' t be wasting anymore of my money when they aren ' t in any way helpful or apologetic and don ' t seem to care .
F	i ' m a team_leader in a call_centre myself and blimey if we treated our customers like that , we wouldn ' t have any and would have rubbish reviews like this !!
F	seeing as our reviews on trust_pilot are 00 . 0 i think it speaks for itself .
F	i florist need to get their act_together or they won ' t have any customers left .
F	you are a disgrace !
F	and i can ' t believe you don ' t even get back to customers who email you !
F	disgusting service and i won ' t use them again .
F	stick to what you know for future people
F	i tend to hardly use amazon as prefer the quicker easier service on ebay , play . com etc .
F	however i wanted a scholl express pedi so was shopping around for the cheapest price .
F	found the product for £_00 . 00 - approx_£_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else .
F	bargain i thought so logged on the next_day to buy the item and surprise_surprise they had put it up by £_00 . 00 !!!
F	spoke to amazon on customer support and they tried fobbing me off saying prices hadn ' t changed for the item since october ( they checked their catalogue ) apparently .
F	so i went back saying they were lying as my colleague at work had actually bought the product 0 - 0 days earlier at the £_00 . 00 price .
F	funnily_enough when i offered to give the order details they didn ' t want to know .
F	just said the price is the price which i thought was an absolutely joke .
F	i work as a team_leader in customer_services and if one of our customers complained about something like this we would honour the price for them !
F	if we said ' the price is the price ' i think we would lose a hell of a lot of business but then amazon are a company that are too big for their boots nowadays .
F	oh worse is to come .... 0 - 00 days_later - the express pedi went on the black friday sale at 0 . 00pm for .. yep u guessed it ... £_00 . 00 !
F	funny the customer_service guy didnt mention this at the time of my complaint .
F	i ' ve now decided they must ' ve put it up to to then put it down again on black friday to make it seem like people are getting a bargain !
F	joke .
F	end of .
F	i bought a jacket from boohoo . com , it only took a couple of days to arrive and it was perfect , the jacket is gorgeous !
F	i received my glasses and couldn ' t see through them !
F	i ended_up going to another company and paying over £_000 for a decent pair !
F	i had a paypal account for 0 years so that i could use ebay , until i spent over £_000 and they stopped my account !
F	they asked for verification , they said they would send me a letter with a code on it , 0 months later i ' m still_waiting on the letter !
F	i give up on it .
F	i recently_bought a tapestry kit from argos and it ' s excellent , i reserved it online and picked it up the next_day !
F	i use this instead of calling for a takeaway , its so much_easier doing it all online and paying online , that way you dont have to call and have confusion when someone doesn ' t understand my accent and i dont have to hand over any cash at the door .
F	i ' ve been with sky for over a year now and i still have no_complaints , i like that i can check my bill online and update my package if i like .
F	the internet_connection is always fast and i would never change it again !
F	i buy a lot of shoe ' s from schuh , they stock newrocks which i love , they also have a vast_selection of trainers which you just couldn ' t find anywhere_else .
F	i order all of my groceries from here , they always have what i want in stock and deliver when i want .
F	the delivery driver is always polite and very helpful and the food is always top quality .
F	i always use google , i have a google account and it reminds me when i have important things to do , the google_search always find me what i ' m looking for .
F	just joined and i love it , i have found a ton of new sites that i want to try and i love having the opportunity to rate the companies that i have used .
F	i ' m totally addicted to facebook , love the games and being nosey !
F	!
F	i love mothercare clothing , i always go to mothercare first when shopping for my baby .
F	delivery is always fast and well_packed .
F	i ' ve never had to return anything because its always been perfect .
F	i use toys_r us a lot for my two kids , i have a store locally but tend to buy online .
F	the price ' s are always good and they have good deals , delivery is always fast and well_packed .
F	i recently won a prize basket of flowers and they are so beautiful that i will be ordering more !
F	subway is always a great treat while out shopping , i love the fact that they have so much ingredients to choose from to make the perfect baguette !
F	items are always delivered fast and in unmarked packaging so you don ' t have to feel embarrassed about collecting it from the postman !
F	play . com is the only online company that i trust to deliver cd ' s and dvd ' s .
F	they always have the best prices and a massive_selection to choose from .
F	delivery normally takes about 0 days unless you buy next_day delivery .
F	i recently_bought my first set of contact_lenses from here , they were delivered next_day , just in time for my night out !
F	i will be buying from them again !
F	quite a lot of my clothing is from joe browns , i recently_bought a coat in the sale , its brilliant .
F	great quality and nice a warm for the winter .
F	joe browns always has different_styles from any where else and always has something for every occasion !
F	keep going joe browns !
F	powwownow makes conference calling with clients nationally and internationally simple and no hassle .
F	the service is clever and simple , from the already set out email to the scheduler .
F	i much prefer it to other teleconference providers who make it more complicated and charge !
F	powwownow comes highly_recommended from my company .
F	i have given my scathing review of this company below , and it seems sooooooooooo many others were defrauded over the last few_days .
F	this may help everyone , i finally have a refund for these_cowboys on the way - 0000 000 0000 - that is their phone number .
F	option 0 - customer_service .
F	i ended the call thanking them for ruining valentines for me and many others !
F	:-)
F	after purchasing a dress from this site , the dress arrived the very next_day , and i ' m from the u . s !
F	also , the packaging is beyond stunning , you ' re going to want to keep everything from the bow to the box , they ' re that beautiful .
F	the dress arrived carefully_packaged and i was immediately contacted by a customer_services rep to be sure i was happy with my purchase .
F	lovely place to do business with !
F	thankyou [_name ] for your help and speedy replies !
F	!
F	bought an acer aspire one .
F	works very well , great for carrying around !
F	exactly as_described .
F	delivery time brilliant !
F	thanks !
F	they were jus soo quick i had everything a day after each other i was amazed i wuld deffinatly recommend them to a friend and i wuld use them again
F	returning customer , best selection , great customer_service , and quick shipping ,
F	really love this shop for its whole ethos and service .
F	i ' ve been regularly since i knew it existed , and have had one happy little_boy since in fun wellies and comfy shoes .
F	excellent practical advice is always given about extending shoes ' lives and making the right choices .
F	looking_forward to more hands - on play sessions as my son gets older too , and perfect to have an instant play area inside for rainy days .
F	can ' t recommend more highly !
F	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform me that it had arrived there the day before .
F	i hadn ' t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
F	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven ' t had to sample the aftersales service .
F	my item was exactly_what i told it would be .
F	it was in good condition and came wrapped in a whole load of bubble_wrap which meant it was well_protected .
F	it came within two days .
F	overall a great service , will_definitely be ordering from them again .
F	would recommend to everyone .
F	i ordered an item from cash_generator and they use uk mail as their courier , the item came within two days and was delivered at around 0pm which was perfect seeing as i knew i would be home at that time .
F	delivery man was pleasant , with a smile on his face even_though it was pouring down with rain .
F	i would 000_% recommend them .
F	i bought a groupon for a vax then placed the order online and it was delivered inside a week in perfect_condition .
F	would buy from here again .
F	orders arrived really quickly and really pleased with my order
F	i ' ve just received my second order with deramores .
F	unlike my first order , which arrived super_quick in 0 days , this order went awol .
F	the customer_service team at deramores were fantastic , helping me to try track my order and , when this didn ' t work , resending another one asap .
F	i have no doubt the non - delivery was from royal_mail ' s end ( as royal_mail almost botched the resend delivery with incorrectly dated delivery slips ) and can ' t thank deramores enough for their patience and fabulous service .
F	the products i ordered were all great quality and well_priced , i ' ll be ordering again .
F	this is the first time i ' ve ever purchased designer sunglasses online so it was a bit of a big deal and i needed a trusted website .
F	after googling ' designer sunglasses ' i came_across this site .
F	the reviews seemed good and they had the ray - bans i was looking for .
F	the price of the glasses themselves wasn ' t the cheapest i came_across but postage was less_than what other_sites were charging .
F	i ' m_glad i chose this site a my gorgeous new sunglasses arrived within a couple of days in perfect_condition - thank_you !
F	item arrived in good time , cheap price , no_qualms !
F	great service .
F	was initially put off by a few bad_reviews but as one reviewer said it is the annoyed that usually feedback .
F	no_problems on this end though
F	i found this company to be appalling .
F	they delivered the lawn was a days late and despite scheduling and telephoning they still managed to miss the delivery window by 0 hours .
F	the lawn had glass embedded into the back in the soil , and when we unrolled it it was patched brown .
F	it died soon after .
F	no reponse from customer_service , no offer of a refund despite complaints and certainly no refund of delivery .
F	appalling service from an appalling company .
F	avoid at all costs
F	i did wonder_how good things could be from here with the whole five pound thing .
F	but after friends good reviews i decided to try it .
F	i wasn ' t disappointed , delivery was fast , all the items were well made , and lovely .
F	very pleased , would happily_recommend to anyone .
F	wish i ' d found this site years_ago .
F	great service , fast delivery & brilliantly priced products .
F	i never normally complete reviews but am so happy with the service provided it ' s only fair to give credit to the technician & company .
F	ordered the tyre and booked a two hour_slot for fitting whilst at work the next_day .
F	chris , the technician arrived 0 minutes into the time_slot and had completed the job within 00_minutes .
F	he was polite and offered helpful advice on two other tyres which would need replacing in the near_future but didn ' t push me to order at the time .
F	excellent and completely hassle_free - will_definitely be using tyres on the drive soon !
F	my home needed redecorating ; i was tired of doing it myself with my poor skills .
F	i called a few companies and found serviceteam , the account_manager i spoke to was very polite and helpful , they provided me with a reasonable_price , i was then informed the decorator could come and do the work in two days .
F	the decorator managed to complete the work within 0days .
F	brilliant work i couldn ’ t judge more_than that .
F	i can_honestly recommend these_guys to anyone ; they ’ re so quick with the service and excellent with the work .
F	my garden needs doing once the weather is clear and i know who i ’ m calling !
F	we ordered our dining furniture from them in february_0000 and where told that items would arrive at end of march_0000 .
F	unfortunately we where informed that there was a problem with the particular chairs ordered and would take a little longer .
F	we where not informed of a new arrival date , but contacted them to find out that they were due in in a couple of days .
F	the delivery company ( branch of oakfurniture land ) have also shown no respect or believe in customer_service .
F	if you are unable to take delivery on the date they specify then you have to wait up to two_weeks to get a new delivery date which could mean you waiting another two_weeks .
F	00 weeks on we are still_waiting .
F	when we complained and asked for compensation for all the problems we have encountered we where told that they do not give out compensation .
F	they where also rather rude and disrespectful and obviously not familiar with customer_satisfaction .
F	when we said that we where fed_up and would like to cancel our order we where told that we would have to pay £_000 for return of goods from their delivery comany to their warehouse .
F	we would not recommend this company just on the basis of customer care and satisfaction .
F	we have yet to see what the quality of the goods are like , but according to a number of reports read , we will not be holding our breaths .
F	i made an incorrect booking - ( okay my mistake ) but they wanted me to pay more_than what i had paid for the ticket to alter the booking .
F	after i waited in a queue on the phone for over 00_minutes .
F	not good !
F	everything at super prices !
F	asda are the best for prices !
F	cant_beat their footie coverage !
F	super pizza !
F	got an online quote of £_000 for my toshiba and received my money on the friday after having my item collected on the monday , solid service .
F	this is a review of the terrible service after ordering mothers_day flowers .
F	i ordered these on friday the 00th of march and requested ( and paid more for ) delivery on sunday the 00th of march , mothers_day .
F	i paid 0 separate delivery charges due to ordering 0 separate bunches for my mother , grandmother and aunt .
F	well no flowers were delivered on mothers_day , or the day after ..... only my mother has received hers at 00pm today ( tues 0st april ).
F	and they are of poor quality , stems are wilted and dying , they weren ' t even in water ?!?!?!?!
F	they had a damp cloth around the bottom which is obviously not adequate or acceptable !
F	i have tried in vain to contact them to complain and try and get a refund of some description , but to no_avail .
F	0 separate calls to their helpline , which_resulted_in being held in queues for over 00_minutes at a time with no answer each time !
F	i also tried the live_chat on their website - no answer and kept expiring my query and logging me out ?!
F	i ' ve also emailed them , lets_see if that is any more successful ......
F	overall extremely dissatisfied mothers_day flowers that just never came and when they did they were extremely poor quality .
F	i ordered a mobile phone from them , paid for it and received an_email_confirming my order .
F	i received an_email acknowledging m order and that its in progress .
F	not long after that , am told am being refunded .
F	no goods & up til now , no refund .
F	that was well over a month_ago .
F	no number to contact them & so was left to email them .
F	many emails & no answers .
F	do not order from them ever !
F	terrible company , terrible service .
F	it ' s very easy to order , great service and delivery was faster_than_expected .
F	got everything i ordered with satisfaction .
F	will recommend them .
F	definately be using them again ..!
F	i highly rate this company for their service .
F	i received emails during every process my order went through .
F	i was expecting my order to arrive post christmas , but got an_email_saying that its been fast - tracked to next_day delivery and ended_up getting it just before_christmas .
F	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone_looking for good delivery service as well as a good customer_service .
F	kudos to you
F	never had a problem with this site always on time always well_packaged and good prices !
F	after an issue on thursday where we got our wires crossed about times we rebooked our appointment for tuesday ( 00th_july ) i received a call this morning saying that an engineer was available today ( 00th_july ) and would we like a quote .
F	as i was going to be home anyway i agreed .
F	less_than an_hour later nick g arrived .
F	he looked at the work we needed doing which was 0 large screen tvs to be wall mounted in not the easiest of locations .
F	he provided a quote which was reasonable considering the work required and we decided to accept .
F	he provided us with the wall mounts and within an_hour and a half , both tvs were up and working .
F	nick was courteous and polite and a pleasure to have in the house unlike some workman i have had to deal with in the past ( from different companies i might_add .)
F	i would certainly use this company again , in fact probably quite soon as our aerial is dated and could do with replacing so aerialforce will certainly be the first people i call for a quote .
F	i was dubious when i first found this website as it was offering me a wii_u premium pack for £_000 . 00 , a good £_00 cheaper_than any where else .
F	i looked at several websites for reviews and 00_% were positive .
F	i decided as they except pay_pal as a method of payment to give them a go as this offered me protection .
F	i ordered my wii_u just before 0pm and instantly received my confirmation e_- mail .
F	it stated that my item would be delivered in 0 - 0 days with the free delivery option i selected .
F	i then received another e_- mail stating that my item would be delivered the next_day , and then another e_- mail giving me a 0hr delivery slot .
F	this was fantastic as i didn ' t have to wait in all day for a courier to deliver .
F	it even told me my couriers name .
F	delivery day came and my item was delivered at the exact time they said it would and was well_packaged .
F	i will certainly be using this company again as they are far cheaper_than anywhere_else and deliver really fast as well as keeping customers updated regards to their orders .
F	a fantastic , customer_focused company .
F	more places should operate like this .
F	my husband needed new work clothing and nightgear offered them at the best price around .
F	website was easy to navigate , goods came in time specified and we were kept_informed via_email of everything that was happening .
F	would reccomend and use again
F	bought a bra , and only after paying was i informed they didn ' t have it in stock .
F	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn ' t have ordered it if i ' d known it was out of stock
F	i bought 0 items , at an amazing price , all in the sale too .
F	i then managed to find a discount_code for them .
F	the delivery was fast , and there was plenty of information how to track my stuff .
F	i ordered more items about 0 weeks_later , and forgot to use the discount_code , i called them up and they were more_than happy to apply the discount_code , as you don ' t actually charge the card until your items are dispatched .
F	i wouldn ' t have any reservations to use this company again , brilliant on all accounts .
F	i love this website , but i despise most of the users .
F	reviews are great , but people are a lot more likely to review something with a negative_review than an honest or a balanced review .
F	it ' s great to find restaurants , hotels and activities , and i base every hotel i go to on the trip_advisor rating .
F	hostelbookers makes booking hostels and cheap hotels so easy !
F	i had queries about a hostel that i was interested in so emailed them with my questions .
F	they responded quickly and contacted the hostel for me to find out the answers .
F	they were so professional in helping me , it really took any stress of booking travel away !
F	great customer_service .
F	last july took my car into halfords for a mot , failed on a few items was quoted £_000 for all the work done , which i agreed to .
F	took the car in the next_day ( a saturday ) for all the work to be carried_out .
F	heard_nothing all day phoned them at 0000 and said the car wasnt finished and they had to wait_till_monday to get a tool , collected the car that evening and would returnit monday , was then charged £_000 !!
F	only noticed after i had added my pin and asked why the sudden change in price .
F	said they had forgotten to add part of the work on when they quoted me !
F	i said that i felt that it was unacceptable and i would discuss it further on monday .
F	took the car back monday and they did give be a partial_refund for the difference , still cost me £_00 more_than the original_quote .
F	again they had the car the whole day and again i had to phone .
F	fast forward 00months and 0000 miles and the wheel bearing they replaced needed replacing again , so i took to a different halfords , part under warrenty which they replaced free of charge after trying to get me to puchase a £_000 exhaust ( which cost me £_000 else where !).
F	all fine again .
F	0 months later checking my car before its next mot , and noticed the the antiroll bar ( which was replace the year before ) was missing !!
F	that was re fitted else where .
F	and now just 0 months later the wheel bearing need replacing again !
F	!
F	taking it to a independent and will never use halfords .
F	nice product , very quick delivery , reasonable_price .
F	quick and easy to use booking service .
F	i would reccommed to everyone .
F	i ' ve used the website for several purchases , and have always been happy with the products , the prices and the customer_service .
F	i ' m sure i will return in the future .
F	very happy with my products from planet bake , all delivered as ordered and very speedy service .
F	would happily_recommend them .
F	great system that i didn ' t have to print out any ticket or anything and really simple to use through facebook
F	this company is the best i have ever purchased from , they are highly efficient , the staff are more_than happy to help you and respond to your emails and the delivery of my items has always arrived when i ' ve asked for it and very quick delivery , items are perfect , never had a problem with anything i have purchased from kitbag
F	i find bulk_powders an excellent website to order through .
F	i am rewarded frequently through offers available ( free delivery , free_samples , bulk offers , percentage off products ).
F	i also benefit from collecting bp points which can be used to purchase next order .
F	theres a wide_range of products - all at excellent value for money and also good quality .
F	my products are always delivered when expected .
F	brilliant supplier !
F	i ' m not going to go into detail in regards to the experience i have had with this company as there have been 0 seperate_occasions and they are pretty similar to most peoples bad_experiences with them .
F	i would never order from this retailer again and i would advise people thinking of doing so to steer_clear .
F	they cannot deliver when stated and when extra is paid for prompt delivery they still can ' t deliver on time .
F	refunds take months to be credited back .
F	clothes are never good quality .
F	and the only way you can contact them is by email , and you literally have to pester them with non stop emails in order to get a non - automated_reply .
F	definately not worth it .
F	i ' ve ordered a samsung mini 0 case and it arrived ( in italy ) in really short time !
F	the product quality did not disappoint me , it was just as i expect it to be !
F	i bought a rug and it was labled wrong as it was a runner so i asked for a different color no_problems there .
F	until .................................... we walked up the street and went in to our lettin agents stood talkin to the woman behind the counter and this fella stopeed my husband in the letting agent and said ive bin told youve walked out with out paying for that rug could you come with me to sort it being infuriated i turned and told him he could wait his turn coz i had my own problem to sort out finishe with the woman who kept giving me funny looks and went to the store turns_out they didnt give us the right recipt there lucky the guy didnt get a smack in the teeth !
F	will never ever use argos again
F	i received great support from kathy . she helped_me quickly and was very polite . even on a chat you could tell she is a nice person .
F	code ec0000
F	i booked parking through looking0parking called svs parking stanstead and everything was fine with the drop_off but when our car was retururned we noticed some dents and scratches on it .
F	we told the driver and he said well at_least its drivable .
F	you have a smart phone right send a picture to my boss .
F	we did but after few rude emails and a text at 00 o ' clock it was clear they will not take any responsibility .
F	originally i emailed looking0parking to tell them i have a problem and rhey replied that somebody from svs will contact me because i have a contract with them but they monitor all the complaints to ensure they have the best vendors .
F	after everything that happened i emailed them all my emails with svs and all the complaints people shared on another review site and i never_heard back from them .
F	i do not think that they monitor the complaints at all .
F	otherwise they would not have such a company offered on their website .
F	company with so mani complaints , without any contact information and any information at all about it anywhere .
F	also make_sure you look at their tc it says they do not take_responsibility for any damage of private property also that your car is parked at your own_risk .
F	i do not think meet and greet would be only picking_up and droping off you car .
F	they should look after it too during this period .
F	ordered cycling shorts and hockey glove .
F	very easy to order and quick delivery .
F	the memory checker was absolutly brilliant .
F	i ordered some memory on a friday_afternoon and it arrived in the post saturday_morning so i think that the service was excellent .
F	thankyou vey much orca .
F	been using this service for around a year now and not once had a problem with it ( although i don ' t use the hermes or tnt services offered as i haven ' t had the best experiences with these in the past ).
F	the biggest advantage of interparcel is the prices .
F	it is so much cheaper_than going directly to the companies and i ' ve saved loads of money now i don ' t have to book directly with tnt or other couriers .
F	one job tnt quoted £_00 to do when i called them but it was just £ 0ish on interparcel .
F	i always go for the interparcel standard or premium ( i think this is operated by ups ) and it is a very good service .
F	always here promptly the day after i book it or even on the same day if booked early enough and always arrives the next_day .
F	also , if you put in the times you would like them to arrive to collect , they always seem to stick to it .
F	staff are friendly and helpful when i ' ve had to call and the drivers are all very efficient and friendly .
F	highly_recommended .
F	after having a nightmare experience with a similar company , i decided to give parcel0go a try .
F	due to issues caused by the other company ( booking the collection in , and then cancelling it saying they couldn ' t deliver , only to collect the parcel which then went missing for 00_hours and was delivered to the customer damaged when it should have been returned to us ) i unfortunately had to first reschedule the collection , which was incredibly easy and just took a couple clicks on the website , and then to cancel the collection .
F	i did find it a little_confusing working out how to cancel a parcel and how to contact someone directly but did work it out in the end .
F	i spoke to emma on the live web help who had the collection cancelled in minutes .
F	very friendly and helpful customer_service from emma and overall very satisfied with my experience of using parcel0go .
F	friendly service and i received my goods in excellent condition on the estimated day of arrival .
F	i received my order within the estimated time period and in excellent condition .
F	dress arrived very quickly considering it was made to measure .
F	dress felt very good quality .
F	looks perfect on .
F	had lots of complements .
F	good selection of cards , easy to upload pics / text .. super_fast delivery in my experience ,.
F	having used chilli - sauce for my hen_weekend last_year with some minor hiccups ; ( chilli - sauce didn ' t confirm go_karting numbers until last_minute even_though provisionally booked 0 months prior , so indoor go - karting became out - door as not enough karts at completely_different venue , * however they apologised and compensated ) i recommended them to a friend .
F	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we ' d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
F	however around 0 weeks prior we ' d discovered the ' rep ' had booked the ibis hotel at temple - meads .
F	the rep wouldn ' t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn ' t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
F	we ended_up having to go to the travel lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes walk extra but the stress would ' ve been easily avoided if communication would ' ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
F	overall they did ' good '
F	this was my 0rd or fourth order with wg and what can i say , 000_% perfect .
F	love their products , our favourites are the half ham , chicken_breasts and our most favourite the meaty pork sausages .
F	the ham that i ordered with this order was very slightly underweight , however i was aware of this because prior to dispatch i received a phone call to tell me and inform me that the difference of price would be deducted - love the honesty there :) plus the best part was that i received a yummmmy parcel of fudge a couple of days_later as way of apology with a lovely hand_written card .
F	i hope my meat is underweight with each order in future ; 0 )
F	furthermore i had a code for free cumberland sausages but we do not like them , so i cheekily asked to swap my freebies for the meaty ones , this was done with no_problems at all .
F	i highly_recommend them and will be returning to buy some more yummy meat , no more filling the pockets of shareholders at supermarket plc for me !
F	discovered iceland today , fantastic experience and was offered free home delivery - result i could go shopping in town and have a coffee and not worry_about frozen stuff defrosting :) will be returning again in the near_future .
F	buy all my work stuff from here and my boy ' s clothes - have bought them from newborn through to 00 - 00 and they have never disappointed :) bonus of next_day delivery .
F	have had the misfortune to visit primark on two occasions .
F	made the mistake of buying a t ' shirt - should have known better as it was only a couple of £' s , washed on cold wash and shrunk on first wash . will now stick with fair trade t ' s from sainsburys for £ 0 . 00 which was perfectly .
F	never had a problem with easyjet - always get me to spain with no hiccups , booking is straight_forward and easy as is check in etc .
F	hate , hate time line , please bring back the traditional format or at_least let us choose !
F	i love amazon , i ' m a student and a kindle owner so use amazon at_least every other week for something or other , each time the transaction has gone_smoothly and quickly with next_day delivery ( with amazon_prime , well worth the money if you use amazon much ) would highly_recommend them .
F	i ' ve been a member of moneysavingexpert . com for the last 0 years , spending an inordinate amount of time in the various forums on offer - they have proved to be invaluable over the years , particularly the old style forum :) i also get martin ' s weekly email and again have saved and gained so much from it over the years .
F	quick , easy and efficient , the return bag arrived and cheque arrived_promptly .
F	no_fuss , totally recommended .
F	got my post bag , sent it off using the freepost .
F	the next_day ( approx 00hrs later ) i had a email to say it had been processed then 0mins later - order complete .. i couldnt_believe_how quick it was !
F	i chose the fast payment bank_transfer and the money was in my bank after 0 hr 00mins from the email .
F	im am a very happy customer and would use this service over and over again !
F	wooooooooooooooo
F	har inget att klaga på , allt är skött exemplariskt !
F	snabb frakt , bra paketerat och riktigt bra priser !
F	kommer handla här flera gånger igen :) tack !
F	i used_shiply looking to transport a sofa i bought and the offers came straight_away .
F	it ' s so easy to use & the email_notifications meant i was quick to choose the most affordable transporter .
F	great site
F	trying to rob my girlfriend of money !!!
F	she already given notice before the 00 day cooling_off period to cancel her contract and now they have the cheek to send a letter and charge her the full 00 months and the minutes and data she has never used !!!
F	disgrace full business !!!
F	please watchdog , sort these criminals out !!!
F	no customer_service and their indian_call centers are awful !!
F	!
F	love amazon !!!
F	wide_range of products and easy delivery !!
F	!
F	i love my halloween_costume .
F	looking_forward to buying more costumes from jokers_masquerade in future .
F	your company , your brand , truly inspirational amongst every man to walk the land .
F	the best chocolate ever !
F	your company is so sweet , nearly everyone alive considers it a treat .
F	i think there is a great thing your missing , its not just the sugar lovers , your chocolate should be kissing .
F	bring out a section , for the diabetic man , and witness your chocolate , encourage all of society to be a fan .
F	ann , you wonderful woman i need to thank_you for filling my life with marvellous enhancements .
F	your products not only inspire but add variety into every woman and mans sex life .
F	i have some ideas for you for future toys .
F	like you i know , what it truly takes to get an o .
F	what a company !
F	remaining aligned with the original founders vision , this company has recently partnered with wallgreens .
F	all they need to do is update their website with more products and give the consumer a longer time to order during the day to be accepted for next_day delivery !
F	once this is done , they need to create an application for the phones which creates more buying and review power for them !!!
F	!
F	easier than ebay and amazon , this trading site is cool , modern and easily navigable !
F	i love the style and the vision for the company !
F	the ceo has a beautiful vision for it and i can see it growing massively internationally !
F	placed an order for a north_face backpack earlier today - opted for the free delivery so was initially informed order would arrive before 00th_june , but i ' ve already had confirmation of its dispatch - so it should now arrive in time for my boyfriend ' s birthday - with no delivery charges !
F	and it was the cheapest price online i could find for the same bag .
F	many_thanks , webtogs .
F	after writing a negative_review .
F	i received a phone call from a very helpful man .
F	offered full_refund or better quality kilt .
F	very happy with the service i have received
F	thank_you very much
F	received my kilt this morning it ' s fantastic brilliant quality and super_fast delivery thanks again for all your help xx
F	i don ' t think any of them actually know what they ' re doing !
F	after going to fourways garage to get my car ' fixed ' i ' ve had endless problems with my car .
F	i ' ve taken it to 0 different garages since and all say that this garage has done something seriously wrong !
F	i took my car back to this garage and they patronized me , not believing a word i said .
F	finally after getting a man to talk to them they took the car .
F	i had a courtesy car ( which was very dangerous to drive , dodgy clutch and brakes !)
F	and a little down the road i pulled over to fix my seat position and i see 0 of the guys from the garage speeding past me in my car !
F	so i followed them , they were going 00mph in a 00 !
F	then they went 00mph round a corner !
F	i have a very large car and cant take corners !
F	i saw and smelt burning rubber from my brand_new tyres ,
F	there ' s an unbelievable amount of negative things i have to say about this appalling place but i don ' t want to waste more time on them .
F	i know of a company that use fourways garage , and they have endless problems with their cars , they are always worse when they come back but they ' re tied into a contract .
F	so i know that its not just me .
F	please avoid !
F	my cars still not fixed and i now have to buy a new one after what they ' ve done !
F	ordered our samsung 0d_tv on friday 00th_jan ( when we had 00 inches of snow !)
F	crampton and moore were the cheapest plus free delivery .
F	within 0 minutes i had a conformation email_saying its about to be dispatched and what day it will be delivered !
F	i was in a little disbelief at how fast it was all happening , however monday 00st jan my television turned_up - before lunch as well !
F	easy to use website , cheapest on the web by_far , free and fast delivery .
F	easy access to lots of information .
F	everything you need and want when ordering a pricey item .
F	i am extremely happy to have located a site that matches reasonable pricing with ease of use .
F	i will most certainly advise patients and friends to visit the site and reap the benefits of easy access !
F	placed an order with garden best buys .
F	over a week_later , i ' d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
F	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
F	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
F	in fairness , the customer_service was good once i got in touch , and the refund was given immediately .
F	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
F	we just bought chip - board flooring for our loft conversion from wickes .
F	researched the product online and wickes offered the best value .
F	item is classed_as ' big and bulky ' but was still next_day delivery .
F	ordered online yesterday_afternoon and reveived immediate confirmation by email .
F	within an_hour , wickes had rung to confirm the order and check we wanted delivery the next_day .
F	they rang again a few hours_later to confirm the time we could expect delivery .
F	the delivery arrived_promptly this morning , as agreed , and i was very impressed by the speed it arrived from ordering to arrival , especially as it was a bulky order .
F	i was also very impressed with the communication as we were kept well informed at every_stage .
F	we have also bought all our radiators and plumbing from wickes ( in store ) as well as our bathroom_suite and always found them to be good value and good quality .
F	they are very good for trade goods and basic diy equipment , as long as you don ' t require anything too fancy .
F	never had any problem exchanging goods either , even outside of receipt .
F	although the value seems good , i have rarely experienced such a slow service .
F	bought an item which ' usually ships in 0 - 0 business days .'
F	payment was taken immediately , but it was not dispatched for 0 days , and even then , only when i chased it .
F	the item had to be returned , and telephone_calls took too long to answer .
F	each email i sent received an_automated_response stating ' we will answer your query within 0 business day .'
F	this was never the case .
F	responses always took significantly longer , and i had to chase for each and every_step of the refund while they dragged their feet .
F	the refund took over a month to be reinstated , and had to be chased up at every_stage .
F	unfortunately , the low price does not make up for the extremely slow service which requires more effort than it is worth to get a response .
F	i would never use this company again .
F	( they also made it incredibly difficult to submit this review !)
F	was recommended this site as never_heard of it and il deff b using it again .
F	i spoke with stephane this evening to help me find where my local drop_off points are , she was quick and effective in answer all my questions .
F	also provided with the closest pick_up point for the person receiving gift too .
F	fantastic service .
F	thankyou
F	the prices are sometimes cheaper_than elsewhere but can cause hassle , shipping times can be good or very poor .
F	i found that i couldn ' t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don ' t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
F	excellent way to save your details and pay quickly without hassle , makes you feel_safe when ordering online .
F	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
F	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can ' t see in person a lot .
F	recently placed my first order from here and it arrived_promptly despite being an overseas shipping .
F	the order was packaged beautifully ( and was delightfully cheap .)
F	the quality of the items was superb and customer_service ( had a little problem with one item ) was amazing , i was told to discard the faulty item and a new one was sent as soon as possible , no questions_asked .
F	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
F	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
F	some of the sizing can come up a little weird ( ever when measured by their size guide ) however the quality is good .
F	ordering from this site is a pleasure , everything is clear , precise , organised ( and pretty !)
F	items are dispatched very quickly and arrive swiftly .
F	never had any trouble with my orders and enquiries are replied to promptly .
F	always found this site to be the cheapest when comparing something i want to purchase and they are packaged perfectly .
F	i fully recommend them to anyone ( in fact i have .)
F	no_problems getting the tickets , it was easy to use , easy to follow .
F	i got the tickets a week before the show , and had no_worries about them not being real , as there were guaranteed byt get me in .
F	an easy way to get tickets !
F	such a great and interesting idea for a gift !
F	a true original , and so much fun !
F	great service , easy to order , and it arrived quickly .
F	bought it to make a gift for a friend .
F	it was easy to use , and arrived quickly .
F	once we had it , it was very well_done , a lovely gift idea !
F	this photobook i purchased was absolutely_brilliant ..
F	the quality is just fantastic first_class ..
F	if i ever need another photobook then i wouldn ' t hesitate to purchase from photoworld .
F	very happy !
F	!
F	for many years , i bought my supplements from gnc .
F	i thought i was getting a " good " deal .
F	i even had their membership card and frequently bought from their deal of the day / month .
F	even with all the discounts & membership card applied , i just knew i was getting the best deals around .
F	until , i came_across this website .
F	i was just eagerly searching the web for cheap supplements , because i felt_like their had to be better deals out there somewhere .
F	i clicked on the link and searched for my supplements , and they are nearly 0 / 0 the price of what i was paying gnc and that was with my gold_card .
F	and , better yet if you find the supplement you are interested in for cheaper on another site , they will even price_match it for you .
F	i was so shocked that i thought this was a scam , i searched for reviews to see if the website was legit , and it appeared to be .
F	it is an easy process and you get plenty of deals / freebies with your purchases .
F	i always feel_like a kid in a candy store when i shop here .
F	and , what ' s better_than having christmas all year round , everyday , 00 / 0 !
F	i get so excited to see my package at my door waiting for me :) i love their products & prices !!
F	they are great and would recommend them to anyone .
F	as i am always in a rush i have put the addresses for collection and delivery the wrong way round .
F	using parcels0go ' s webchat i chatted with dianne who came online instantly , and understood my error and rectified it straight_away .
F	a confirmation was sent for peace of mind and when the tracking was not working i web chatted to adam who confirmed the right addresses and gave me the right tracking_number .
F	polite , professional and quick .
F	thank_you dianne & adam
F	we found flashbay when one of our other suppliers was unable to accomodate our deadline for a management conference .
F	a quick call to flashbay and conversation with an account_manager and we had an competitive ( even cheaper ) quote which would be available when we needed it .
F	we were kept very informed_throughout the entire_process and the flash drivers look amazing .
F	we are very happy with the service and will using flasbay again !
F	no consistency with luggage_allowance , you could take 0 bags out from england but then staff over in spain completely over the top and unreasonable only one bag on the way back , which is fine but you need to make it the same each way .
F	crap company .
F	fly with british_airways !
F	!
F	lovely staff , easy to use website .
F	great value .
F	very fast receipt of return post bag ( next_day ), i then sent the phone back next_day and the money was in my account the next afternoon .
F	fantastic !!
F	!
F	i can ' t believe the response i got and how fast the email replies were , i ' ve never_experienced such amazing customer_service , thank_you so much i will_defo_recommend to any0 wanting to buy from this site .
F	highly_recommend service was excellent and was kept_updated all the time .
F	beautiful flowers too and excellent value for money !
F	excellent service and product of excellent quality would definitely purchase again from oak_furniture land !
F	!
F	i love their t -_shirts and their standard of service is excellent :)
F	they have made it very easy to sell your phone , plus the ease of receiving the money quickly !
F	!
F	my boyfriend brought me tickets for my birthday for rebecca ferguson at the theatre royal on tuesday 00th_march such a lovely surprise !!
F	i had a little letter in with my tickets to leave a review & i have as we were both happy with our double eight experience .
F	we have recommended them to friends :)
F	this was the first time i have booked with hostelbookers . com and i was impressed at the ease of booking .
F	the price for the same hostel was cheaper on this site than another hostel website and they didn ' t charge a booking_fee .
F	i will_definitely use the site again .
F	great variety of hotels and hostels on an easy to use website .
F	the site is very regularly updated by knowledgeable travellers and locals .
F	i used a comparison site to see where i could get the most for for my unwanted phones , one came up with double what all others were saying .
F	i almost sent everything to them then thought i ' ll check trust_pilot for reviews i ' m_glad i did .
F	none of the reviews were good , all where people who had sent the phones but no money and no contact .
F	however when i checked for mazuma it was the complete_opposite and every review was 0 or 0_stars so without reservation i filled in the details and sent off my phone once i received the pack .
F	this was over christmas , they messaged me to say they had received my phone the day after boxing_day and i received my funds the same day , exactly as they quoted .
F	will_definitely use in future and recommend to others .
F	i bought a variety of different products to help me with training for the marathon .
F	i ' m not an_avid supplement user , but i have used a few in the past .
F	whey_protein ( strawberry ) - this is the best protein i have ever_tasted !
F	no chalkiness , or that slightly weird taste ( if you know what i mean ?).
F	i take mine with milk - using the shaker they sell ( which is really good btw !)
F	and it is outstanding .
F	l glutamine - started taking this three times a day .
F	i mix mine with green tea extract in a mug of hot_water ( kills two birds with one stone ?)
F	and it ' s fine .
F	probably absolutely tasteless with juice , but with green tea it ' s acceptable .
F	it ' s not undrinkable but it ' s not something i happily sip on .
F	omega fish_oil caps - take two with breakfast , lunch and dinner .
F	easy to take and will_definitely re - stock once i run out .
F	shaker - i prefer this style as it hasn ' t got one of those metal wire ball mixers .
F	this uses a grid insert , does the job really well and makes the whey_protein seem like a milkshake .
F	overall , quality products and the cheapest i could find .
F	combined with wowcherching cashback , how can you go_wrong ?
F	ideal for presents to loved_ones and yourself !
F	cheap quality products that will be in your hands ready to play with quickly !
F	the perfect online_retailer :_d
F	very very happy , this sideboard was exactly_what i wanted , just took_ages to get it !!!
F	however pine_solutions kept me informed every couple of weeks by email that my order was still on target :-)
F	the delivery company were a bit different on service in the fact that they were paid to bring it in and place it , and they wanted to dump it in the hallway and go , i wanted it in the dining_room so told them and they were not too pleased but did it !
F	the order was delivered to the wrong_address after delivery address was confirmed , went to our office 000_miles_away from our head_office .
F	ordered badge covers and gave specific details on what size was required - wrong_size sent , this was because i had said the order was urgent so they sent what they had in stock rather_than what i needed .
F	order was also incorrect as to the style !
F	having difficulty now trying to get the correct order to be sent out and trying to get details of manager to speak to regarding my complaint .
F	i usually buy nail_polish from beauty_bay and the selection of o . p . i nail_polish is amazing not to mention the cheap prices and the regular running discount_codes which help me get amazing beauty bargains .
F	orders have always arrived quickly , and that ' s on super_saver delivery , they ' ve been well_packaged and i ' ve especially appreciated all the care that was taken to preserve all my nail_polishes on their way to me .
F	beauty_bay also offers and amazing range of other beauty products and their prices and good service you really can ' t beat !
F	it ' s definitely my go - to site for all my beauty needs !
F	this was an easy to use no_hidden_fees site !
F	wonderful !
F	ordered the flowers for a work colleague and she was absolutely_delighted .
F	said they were beautiful and made her day .
F	service was quick and hassle_free and was pleased with the email_updates on despatch and delivery confirmation .
F	i was recommended away0 by a friend in manchester .
F	keep in mind i am travelling from london .
F	i spent months looking through different ( pushy !)
F	agents to book a holiday for my boyfriend and i to go to ny and vegas - it was a surprise trip and i had never been before , so on top of being a nervous and anxious person , i was doing it all alone !
F	stressful !
F	!
F	nothing was too much for the team , and having changed my mind back and forth ( over 00 + times !
F	), they still helped_me out , were not pushy at all and kept giving me the best options at the most economical price .
F	best part , was they put no pressure on me to ' hurry ' before prices changed .
F	they held what they could and have booked me the most exciting trip for my boyfriend and me !
F	highly_recommend and will_continue to use them :-)
F	the hen_weekend was fantastic !
F	we went to newcastle and stayed in the holiday inn express metro - a bit further out than the city_centre , but we got free bubbly and a free taxi for the group into_town .
F	the friday_night entertainment was at a comedy_club , this included a two course_meal - great value for money as there was even steak on the menu !!!
F	the night included free entry into the club next to the comedy_club - we stayed there and partied all night , with much fun had by all !!!
F	the saturday was spent at the hilton hotel for a spa day , much needed as we were all feeling worse for wear !
F	we then got our glad rags back on for a cocktail_making evening at revolutions ; again this included a great two course_meal !
F	the evening was such fun and we had soooo much free booze !
F	the weekend was easy to book and involved little hassle with payments , etc !
F	i would recommend to anyone !
F	great next_day service , had money in my account within_00hrs of recieving my phone .
F	no_complaints , ran_smoothly , recommended to all !!
F	!
F	i made my order and it came in good time , i also had to change one of the items and this was done efficiently and promptly over the phone .
F	the changed item arrived and was exactly_what i wanted .
F	also the other items i ordered were very good quality .
F	thank_you :)
F	great priced products delivered quickly !
F	will_defiantly be shopping here again
F	great products and packages available for all price ranges delivered quickly .
F	i ordered at midday and my order was delivered by midday the following_day .
F	love playing at bright bingo best site i have been on this year
F	very happy with my recent_purchase from waxx .
F	great quality and would definitely purchase from you again .
F	thanks very much .
F	prompt delivery and good quality product thanks
F	hostelbookers sale made it better value , it was very easy and no booking_fees
F	have used hostelbookers multiple_times to book accommodation .
F	always great value and fantastic customer_service .
F	having found the watch i wanted on the website , a tag series 0000 , it was a relatively quick , painless procedure to obtain .
F	what was so impressive about watchfinder is the card i originally used to pay for my watch had to be replaced due to watchfinders own security_measures , for them and myself i add , but dealing_with tom through e_- mail and phone i had a number of satisfactory options to proceed with .
F	fantastic for any company to have a back up plan b , c and even d in place .
F	card refunded almost_immediately , tom calling me to let me know and also e_- mails when my new purchase was through put my mind at ease somewhat .
F	professional , curteous and polite was how i could describe the transaction .
F	now to the watch .
F	just fantastic to open the well_packaged box to find all original paperwork , original receipts , original guarantee with serial numbers and the watch itself in fantastic second_hand condition .
F	i ( and my nosey neighbour stood beside me ) were simply bowled away at the marvellous condition .
F	rang tom and asked for 0 more links , having broken my wrist twice i needed some extra room , not a problem !
F	0 being shipped to me almost_immediately .
F	thanks tom and thankyou watchfinder .
F	i will purchase again and recommend .
F	great selection of great products and a lot of hard to find products in one place
F	my husband forgot some important items for a buisness trip and emma was not only friendly but also very helpful and helped_me to choose the right service for us .
F	i am very impressed with the service and will be using it again .
F	thank_you emma - crisis averted !
F	i ordered a couple of magnet sets , after having ordered them from another company and they arrived bent and unusable .
F	i was a little_worried therefore about ordering more , but i needn ' t have been - it was really easy to order from grindstore , the sets were actually cheaper and they arrived next_day in suitable packaging and perfect_condition .
F	would happily_recommend to all .
F	excellent price and fast service , would use again
F	get good product for an amazing price !
F	great service and speedy_delivery :)
F	i use amazon quite frequently .. always find what i want and find prices pretty reasonable .
F	google for me everytime , without a doubt
F	brilliant and quick service .
F	i highly_recommend using mazuma if you ' re considering selling your mobile and you want dosh quick :) happy
F	my family is spread across three continents , which means i have to take long international flights several_times , if not more , every year .
F	i used to use expedia for all my bookings , but my friend suggested i try using flight network , as the flights are often cheaper .
F	i needed to book a one way flight from vancouver to london , and decided to try using flight network for the first time ( with the intention that if the experience is decent , i would continue using my account on the website for all future_bookings ).
F	i booked a virgin_atlantic flight for september 00th , for a very decent price , only to find out less_than a month later that my sister is quite ill and i need to go to london earlier to help her with her big move .
F	i made a long_distance call to flight network from my parents ' home in asia , and was put on hold for a long time .
F	i was getting impatient , as the call was costing me quite a lot of money already , only to be greeted_by a rather rude customer representative named james .
F	i explained to him that i would like to change my flight date from the 00th to the 00th , and he then took another five_minutes to find out what the fare rules were .
F	he told me that the fee for changing was 000_dollars plus the fare difference , which_amounted to almost 0000 dollars !!!!
F	i asked him where the 000_dollars were coming from , and he could not explain this clearly .
F	i was checking on the flight network website the cost of the flight on the 00th , and it stated that there was a seat left , going at 000_dollars , which would mean the difference would be around 000_dollars , not 0000 .
F	i pointed this out , and he rather rudely told me to send him a screen_shot ( which i found rather ridiculous - why would i lie about this , when i ' m on the flight network website ?
F	), which i did so promptly .
F	he then told me because the change is done " manually ", for some reason , he cant see the fare of 000_dollars ... and then he tried to justify the 0000 dollar fare difference by saying that the 000 dollar price quote " expired " as there is only one seat left and someone_else bought it ... which was clearly untrue as i checked again after the call , and i could make the purchase of that ticket .
F	i felt_like he was coming up with any excuse to charge me more for the change .
F	i then asked him about a cancellation , at which point he said the same fee of 000_dollars apply .
F	once again , he did not provide any coherent explanation of where this number comes from .
F	having studied law , this sort of inconsistent , unjustified , and incompetent service frustrated me more_than anything_else - i then asked him about a possible travel credit , and whether that was valid under the terms and conditions , and i did not get the sense that he knew them well at all .
F	he did not give me a clear answer and directed me to call virgin_atlantic directly ( oh great , another expensive long_distance call !
F	).
F	i then spent another 00_minutes on the phone calling virgin_atlantic , who then told me that they could not do anything as i made the reservation with flight network , and that the agent should know all the details about the fare rules , including travel credit refunds .
F	if virgin_atlantic could actually give me the answer i needed , i wouldnt mind having spent who_knows_how much on making the long_distance call , but it turned_out that the agent should have known in the first place !
F	fed_up with the whole situation , i then called flight network again , and this time , service was even slower .
F	i dont even remember how long i was put on hold for ( and keeping in mind this is at 0am my time in asia ...).
F	i was served by a girl named kris , who was admittedly much more professional .
F	i asked her about the change and cancellation , as well as a possible flight credit , and she replied after a long wait that i couldnt get a travel credit ( i wish james would have told me this before i wasted so much time and money ).
F	she then informed me that the change fee is 000 ( which is clearly overpriced according to the other reviews i read and the research i did online regarding virgin flights ...), and the cancellation_fee is 000 .
F	i was clearly skeptical for two reasons : 0 ) most of the things i read online about changing virgin flights was that the change fee is around 00 pounds or 00 dollars ... not 000 .
F	0 ) so then i asked who levied this hefty sum - flight network or virgin .
F	she replied virgin .
F	she then explained that the penalties are applied in two ways - 00 charged to my card and 000 deducted from the refund .
F	this struck me as odd - this doesnt make sense if the penalties are all levied by one party .
F	she then changed her answer and said the 00 is levied by flight network as a service fee .
F	i was clearly unimpressed by the flip - flopping of answers .
F	i asked her kindly if there was any way she could waive this fee by speaking to her manager , and without actually speaking to her manager ( which would have at_least made me feel better ), she said this is the best her manager can do , and that this fee of 000 is a one time offer - if i call back , i will get charged 000 , which is the actual penalty fee ( but i thought this was 000 , according to james ?!!)
F	i understand flight change and cancellation_fees can be expensive , but the least i ask for is consistency .
F	i even asked kris if she would be willing to waive the fee if i book my new flight on the 00th ( and since i ' m travelling with 0 other people in my family , this would be several thousand $$$ worth of tickets ) with flight network , and she said no ( once again , without consulting her manager ).
F	i ended_up paying the 000_dollars to cancel my flight .
F	i feel bitter , confused , and cheated out of my money .
F	i didnt get a clear answer from any of these customer_service representatives as to where these random figures - 000 , 000 , 000 come from - supposedly a book of " fare rules "... but surely if they use the same book , they wouldnt give me different numbers every time .
F	also , they just wasted too much of my valuable time and money spent on long_distance calls - that ' s another thing to add onto the 000_dollars wasted .
F	i was honestly looking_forward to booking my flights with flight network .
F	as someone_else said on this website , flight network seems to lure you with the cheap prices , and once you buy them , you ' re trapped with bad customer_service ... the way they run their business - bartering the change fees with customers , and trying to squeeze hefty sums ( which isnt much less_than the flight ticket itself ) from them - is just disappointing .
F	i ' d rather pay the additional fee that expedia levies on booking the flights for the better customer_service i used to get there .
F	i have received a controller on two_separate_occasions from gamermodz and both_times , there has not been a single_issue .
F	i have received the controller in 0 days , from the date of the order going through - this is us to uk shipping also , so over the moon with that .
F	the controllers themselves have looked as good as i had hoped and also worked as they should .
F	i did have an issue with the first controller but because of the fast reply from customer_service ( very quick and professional response ), i found out that the fault was mine for using a rechargeable battery pack that wasn ' t powerful enough to power the controller .
F	having the printed out instructions included in the box also helped_me to get up and running quicker_than i had hoped , also .
F	i would recommend gamermodz and their products to anyone who asks me where they should go for a custom controller !
F	the ordering_process for creating your own custom skin or case is very straightforward .
F	the prices are very reasonable and delivery time is a day or two , at the most .
F	the quality of the skins and cases that i have received previously from wrappz has been very high and they turn out exactly how you expect them to when designing on the site .
F	they also cater for a very large range of products !
F	high recommendations from myself !
F	item arrived as_described and very promptly indeed .
F	nice website , easy to navigate and not at all scary looking , liked that it was designed for women .
F	having stumbled_upon marlows diamonds when browsing for engagement_rings , we were blown_away by the service we received .
F	margaret , our sales representative , listened to what we were looking for and really helped_us narrow_down our search until we found the most perfect ring .
F	not only were we helped to find what we were looking for , we were also fully informed of the grading scale so we could appreciate the quality of our purchase .
F	the prices are unbeatable too !!!
F	if you only have time to visit one store in the jewellery_quarter then make_sure it ' s marlows !
F	a truly memorable experience !
F	thanks margaret and the team :) rachael and paul 0 . 00 . 0000
F	i finally found the product i wanted that was actually in stock at this website !
F	i was so excited to come_across my supplement at such an awesome price that would also be shipped quickly .
F	it took a lot of pressure off of me thinking i would have to buy a different product that i knew i wouldn ' t be as pleased with .
F	i recently_moved to the mid - west from the east_coast , and the stores out here carry different products .
F	a huge weight was lifted knowing i can rely_on this site to meet my , and my muscles , needs !!!
F	kudos !!!
F	and thank_you truly !
F	i always buy from amazon if i can due to the ease of use and great prices .
F	it was a big decision to have laser_eye_surgery , but i am extremely glad that i did it .
F	although i had to have lasek treatment , ( i wanted lasik ), and this left me with fairly severe discomfort for two days , and unable to drive for two_weeks , it was entirely worth it .
F	life without contact_lenses is fabulous !
F	swimming , camping , flying , napping (!)...
F	all things that were not easy to do with contact_lenses and now they can be done with no issues at all .
F	optimax were friendly , welcoming and professional .
F	they have looked after me really well , and still ( a year on ) have not fully discharged me - they will keep seeing you until you are completely healed .
F	i would recommend them to anyone .
F	always great prices and interesting things to do .
F	saves a lot ofhard work searching for deals
F	the site helps me have awesome holidays i would not have had without expedia .
F	thank_you !
F	loved the humour on the site , got my awesome vibrator when i needed it .
F	good customer_service .
F	they were very quick to respond to my e_- mail .
F	we have placed 0 orders with flashbay to date .
F	both_times we have dealt_with mark williams , he has been extremely_helpful and efficient .
F	we would highly_recommend flashbay to others !
F	we worked with karen to get christmas cards to send out to all our club members and other clubs .
F	we had quite a specific design in mind as we have our club mascot and club colours we wanted to incorporate and karen took this all on board and designed it exactly to what we were looking for .
F	not only that but we found her very approachable and great to work with , a talented designer !
F	due to the great job_done on the cards we have come back to use karen at printing . com again when organising our fundraising ceilidh , so thank_you again !
F	it ' s nearly 0000 , ao . com promises to be one of the leading ecommerce retailers for electronic_goods we have ever known , a humorous tv campaign , great website , product range and price_match promise .. all fantastic but you cant cancel your orders on - line ... you have to call an 0000 number to be able to amend or cancel your order .
F	seems a bit underhanded and defeats the whole purpose of shopping on - line , having freedom and flexibility to control my purchases .
F	i gave ao . com a shot , but it ' s back to amazon for me where the items are cheaper and i have an account where i can submit questions and cancel orders at my convenience .
F	i am now on my 0rd day waiting for my next_day delivery .
F	driver has been proven to be lying , saying he couldn ' t gain_access to the property (... there are no access issues ) and his gps showed he had been nowhere_near my post code !
F	counting down the days until yodel goes bust , hopefully sooner rather_than later .
F	yodel , you should down right ashamed at how your company operates !
F	my save the date cards arrived today im so pleased with them , fast delivery and excellent quality .
F	i cant_wait to order my invites now .
F	i ' m happy with this site
F	i phoned accident_advice helpline to find out if i could be eligible to claim for a minor incident .
F	the person on the phone was very helpful , professional and my claim has just been accepted .
F	despite assuring me that prestige_flowers could deliver on mothering_sunday , i chose them as a flower delivery company because of this .
F	i then paid for them to deliver on the sunday , happy that this would be met by htem as they had specifically advertised mothers_day flowers .
F	to my horror , the flowers were actually delivered a day early and ruined my surprise completely .
F	prestige_flowers used royal_mail to deliver the flowers , not a particular courier so it wasn ' t surprisingly they didn ' t deliver on a sunday !
F	i then wrote to prestige_flowers explaining my upset and reminding them that their website states 000_% satisfaction guaranteed which i was not .
F	the reply i received was most unhelpful and i was offered no consolation or attempts to keep me 000_% satisfied which is a guarantee they pride themselves on .
F	after further e mails from my part i was eventually offered a measly £ 0 off my next purchase with them .
F	i will never use their awful service again and urge you to do the same .
F	all you have to do is a web search of the company and read the plethora of negative_reviews !
F	i went looking for a mrp and found the lean body hi protein milkshake for 00 . 00 a container alomst a third of the price .
F	went to checkout and found a bunch of free_stuff that looked like it could help as well .
F	love this place
F	just started shopping here , but the prices are the best compared to other_sites that i have browsed .
F	the flat_rate shipping is great for larger orders .
F	my only complaint would be the layout of the site makes it seem like its not very professional or legit , but if that is what keeps the prices low , i guess i can deal with that .
F	they have everything you need to know : location , availability , price , important amenities , and tonnes of reviews by previous guests .
F	first of all , sophie is great with social - networking because this gives the company a very close and friendly laid - back vibe .
F	i also love the no booking_fees and the rates are slightly_cheaper_than any other hostel booking sites .
F	( i ' ve done the research ).
F	thank_you again .
F	communication was excellent & friendly , item arrived within the window i was told it would & in perfect_condition .
F	would definitely use again : )
F	no_problems .
F	certainly cheaper_than high_street
F	we had a photographer for a college musical production pull out on us at literally the last_minute .
F	one quick phone call and lanford guest were there and they took kickass photos .
F	i ' m in love with the whole set of shots !
F	also did really fabulous photos of our graduation ball .
F	the prices are much more reasonable than other photogs as well , which is huge when you ' re a poor , vain person like me who just wants some photos of yourself looking hot without giving away an arm and a leg .
F	it ' s rare nowadays to get all three of the above from a website !
F	i use review sites a lot but very , very rarely write any myself .
F	however the service i have just received from character . com has been so excellent , i knew i had to do my bit ...
F	i recently ordered a set of kids disney cars pj ' s and two rucksacks .
F	the price was so reasonable ( dare i say cheap ?)
F	i was fully expecting them to be either dodgy quality or to be left waiting weeks for them to arrive .
F	i was surprised to be proved wrong on both counts .
F	i have already given the enclosed flyer to a friend and recommended the site to my sister - in - law for future_purchases .
F	so a big thanks and well_done to character . com .
F	i shall definitely be back !
F	good service
F	really pleased with item reasonably_priced , came really quick + arrived in perfect_condition well_packaged would defo buy from cheapsmells again would recommend them good variety of items on website thanks again
F	i bought a ecommerce package . my website was done perfectly just the way i wanted it , anuj build my web perfect he is a good developer to deal with , he is so humble and professional , i give him 00 out 00 i ' m so happy and thank_you so much anuj . i recommend webcreationuk to everyone their customer support_team are excellent especially jose he was nice to me , he help choose the right domain for my site ,
F	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
F	ordered myself some skis that i found to be the best price online and i looked for about 0 weeks , everywhere online ( i ' m a savvy online shopper !)
F	- delivery was super_quick and had incredible dhl delivery service with frequent updates on delivery time ( right up to the hour of estimated_delivery !)
F	- and amazingly , could track my driver with a ( gps or similar ?)
F	tracking service which showed me a map of where my driver was on his route ... amazing !
F	very happy with my first order , will be one of many to come .
F	i ' ve ordered from bodyjewelleryshop once so far , and so far have found an excellent service with order received next_day , although they did have a cut_off point so i had to call up to make_sure my order was being sent out the same day .
F	the lady on the phone was kind enough to make_sure my order went through even_though i had just missed the cut_off point !
F	:) i give them 0_stars because of that customer_service , and the jewellery on their website is a really good selection i thought .
F	i haven ' t joined the forums yet but have had a browse and it seems they have a really nice community , but have yet to find out more about that .
F	fully recommend them from what i have had so far ...
F	i have just been speaking to sarah_hayes on live_chat from parcel0go about an issue i had with a parcel , she has kindly rebooked with another courier for me and was very helpful .
F	thank_you and well_done for the customer_service .
F	goods were delivered within timescale .
F	no hassle purchase .
F	will_definately buy from them again .
F	i would recommend beautybay to everyone ; the shipping is fast , free and i had absolutely no_problems .
F	they often have brands that are hard to find and a lot of the time the prices are better_than most online_retailers .
F	i wanted to send some parcels with parcel0go but was unsure as to how to go about it .
F	i opened a customer chat box and received outstanding and friendly advice from catherine_corless .
F	i now know everything i need to do before sending my packages .
F	so , again thank_you .
F	i ripped all my cds before sending off .
F	i know for a fact that they were all in great condition and all played perfectly .
F	they said they were all heavily scratched , did not accept them and did not pay for them .
F	i said the same day that they could post them back and i would pay the postagee , they said it was too_late they ' d already been recycled .
F	joke !
F	they have had cds for free , i will not be using them again .
F	excellent and quick service !
F	especially pleased over the live_chat where you can chat with staff directly to get help immediately .
F	helpful staff not to mention competitive_prices .
F	recommended to others and will_continue doing so .
F	very efficient and quick and easy to use .
F	i had some issues ( my fault ) with addresses but the customer_service was great - a real_person , by email and problem solved straight_away .
F	just wish i had more phones to sell !
F	i ' ve ordered many_times from kiddicare and also visited their store a few_times .
F	i ' ve always received my items quickly without issue and their 0 year return_policy is fantastic , as we all know that things change when it comes to kids .
F	most recently i had a car_seat delivered but it wasn ' t the colour expected so i took it back without the box as it wouldn ' t fit in my car .
F	they were quick and helpful and i had my refund with no issues .
F	great , my favourite retailer for childrens products and if you need a pushchair check out their top floor , it ' s immense !
F	i ' m a returning customer and just had to share what a great company this is .
F	i ' m often wary of offers on groupon as more often than not i ' m let_down .
F	however hellocanvas produce quality items in a timely matter .
F	i just emailed a question about my latest order and got a reply within minutes .
F	their editing options when ordering ensure the perfect canvas and the postage charges are fair ( the first time i paid £ 0 and got the canvas 0 days_later .
F	this time it was free delivery and i had an_email within 0 days to say it ' s being printed .
F	i ' ll not even get into how much_better this is than other 0 month long experiences which ended in me getting someone_elses prints !
F	fantastic .
F	would recommend to anyone .
F	i desperately_needed running shorts but the local_stores wanted to charge me almost £_00 .
F	i went on here knowing that they were reasonable and got a fantastic pair of shorts for only £ 0 .
F	at the time there was free delivery which was great .
F	they came quickly , and i even got a free mug and brochure with money off vouchers in the book .
F	easy to use website and the sizing is correct .
F	this company is a rip_off !
F	i bought a £_00 fixed - term , fixed - rate contract and they have the cheek to put up their prices for all user not just new ones .
F	when i called to enquire i was told it was only about 00p , and that if i did want to cancel ( as many other prices are rising for me ( i . e .
F	gas , electric ) a phone isn ' t a necessity for me ) i would have to pay the rest of my contract off .
F	there are better offers out there with better networks , who have a better coverage than orange .
F	i can ' t even stand in my kitchen and call somebody because there is no signal !
F	will be changing companies as soon as my contract_ends !
F	i find this site really easy to order off .
F	i have bought a variety of things and they are always good quality .
F	the free delivery helps a lot as many sites want to charge around £ 0 for delivery that is slow .
F	also good pricing as you can get fair priced things in one place , without hunting_around .
F	such a useful source for travel reviews and advice .
F	some bogus posts obviously but base it on the volume of responses .
F	how can anyone leave a positive reference if they haven ' t won anything in years ?
F	seriously though had a win on the instant online games but connection went down for a few seconds and the in game win was lost .
F	although i was given the game again the £ 0 on board win was lost .
F	not happy .
F	easy to use , quick and no isle traffic !
F	love my chesterfield sofa , amazing price too , no_complaints .
F	i love using this site as the information is very easy to find , there are always plenty of reviews for properties and the booking system is very straightforward .
F	thanks !
F	its great to be able to order food this way , nice quick and easy .
F	x_x_x
F	i sent it off then the next_day the money was in my account and recieved the package to send it off in really fast
F	i was completely un satisfied with the service , i had to email them multiple_times in order to get my check through the post .
F	not only that but my ipod must have broke in the post so i got under half of the money i should have got .
F	i called city_link to reschedule my my delivery , i need to change it to a different address , after 00_minutes of waiting - still no answer - what a joke and rip_off !
F	i would recommend first_class watches to anyone , they price matched the watch i brought and it was delivered the next_day !
F	the website is easy to use and the watches are clearly_displayed .
F	i cannot_fault them !
F	i have had such great sucess with hostel_bookers !
F	i ' ve been on both_sides of the fence with them , managing a hostel in canada and using their site daily to update availability and receive bookings , and now to do my own travel and book_hostels as a backpacker .
F	i can_honestly say that it is absolutely effortless .
F	simple and to the point ... what any traveller wants when it comes to planning !
F	i find hostel_bookers to have more locations of hostels than other booking sites out there and can make a choice very quickly of where to go by cruising the reviews of unbaised travellers that have been and stayed at the hostels and searching prices within a backbackers budget .
F	accomodation becomes effortless !
F	i instantly received an_email_confirming my booking and it was cheaper_than hostel_world .
F	needless to say i will be using hostelbookers in the future .
F	hostelbookers is my go - to website for any accommodation booking .
F	i ' m off on three months ' travel around_europe and have used them for almost all my accommodation .
F	the reviews are reliable , website easy to use and generally has the lowest_prices you can find for places - a big bonus !
F	oh , you found a lower_price for an item ?
F	just plug that price in on supplementwarehouse . com and the link to the lowprice and the price adjuster automatically gives you 0 %_off the competitor ' s price !
F	in two cases , with xylitol and nutritional yeast i paid only half of what the discount prices are - i can now justify buying the supplemental foods i love .
F	a higher shipping price still leaves you with wads of extra cash , not to mention , in some_cases , just driving to the health food store would burn more in gas and you ' d have the way higher retail prices .
F	plus , speedy shipping , have your items so quick and cheap .
F	love it !
F	!
F	superb prices , excellent site , easy to use .
F	i love shopping here !!
F	thanks pradamark ... ^ _ ^
F	ordring on the site is horrible , miles easier and faster and you have more choice changing the pizza when you phone .
F	i will never order again on the site or via the app .
F	custmer support dont want to know , total rubbish company
F	the website is very well_laid_out and easy to follow , processing is fast and they keep you updated on your order .
F	excellent value for money .
F	like to say a great big thank_you to release_travel , especially to carlee walker who couldn ' t have been more helpful .
F	hotel was great and very central in sunny brighton would definately recomend cocktail_making and oceana night club !!
F	fantastic and hastel free weekend !!
F	thanks again carlee x
F	fantastic quick and helpful service .
F	needed to re - book a parcel and was dealt_with immediately by a very helpful and lovely girl named sarah .
F	thank_you very much !
F	from , chloe :)
F	outstanding service from first contact via telephone to email correspondence and invoicing .
F	jonny morton was the guy i dealt_with and he was very knowledgeable , helpful and polite - i would deal with him again for our next holiday .
F	very helpfull and knowledgeable_staff .
F	fast delivery .
F	great prices .
F	i have bought several wowchers over the past six_months .
F	some deals were fine and i was able to redeem .
F	with other deals however , it has been impossible to get an_appointment .
F	atelier m , a small beauty salon in putney , is the worst culprit - they clearly sold too many wowchers for ipl treatments (£ 00 ) and are unable to cope with the demand .
F	i have been calling them every day for weeks on end to book a treatment but they will not pick_up the phone and have no voicemail or email .
F	i have contacted_wowcher ' s customer_service but still no luck in redeeming my wowcher or getting a refund !
F	i feel totally ripped_off , not to mention the amount of time i have wasted and the frustration that this has caused .
F	wowcher must do a better job of vetting its suppliers and imposing sanctions if they are unable to honour their promises .
F	easy , quick and affordable bookings .
F	would recommend
F	the service was average .
F	arrival - we travelled late arriving in turkey in the evening and had to wait the best part of an_hour for other passengers to arrive from their flight .
F	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
F	departure - the app that we were told to download didn ' t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
F	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
F	all of this was pretty stressful at the end of our holiday , as we were panicking that we may need to arrange alternative transport .
F	i like that the site because it is very clear and easy to use .
F	for a customer hostelbookers offers a huge_variety of accomodation . you can search and will find just the one right regarding to your requests .
F	furthermore the hostelbookers offers very good prices for accomodation properties .
F	i was always satisfied with my choice and would definately_recommend this site to my friends .
F	all the best !
F	order arrived after only a couple of days .
F	well_packaged but not wasteful .
F	exactly_what i ordered and it was a great price .
F	very impressed , will_definitely use again .
F	:)
F	it would have been quicker for me to request a cheque and get that processed by my bank !
F	it ' s 0000 - how is it taking 00 days to complete an online payment ?
F	telling customers that bank_transfers are the fastest method of payment is false_advertising .
F	' we ' re really busy in january ' is not acceptable - you know you ' re going to be busy .
F	employ more resource .
F	it ' s not rocket_science .
F	i ' d be less upset if , before i ' d posted my ipad , you ' d told me there was a delay in payments .
F	still , i ' ve got until the 00th of the month now to review you all over the place ...
F	as if shopping online wasn ' t enough fun already - i have made a small_fortune since i found this site !
F	easy to use , it really is as good as it seems , i ' ve never had any_problems with it and will be getting a christmas party dress for free this year thanks to the money i have earned !
F	thanks topcashback !
F	i was really impressed with the customer_service i received from zooplus , they have a lifelong customer in me now !
F	would definitely_recommend to anyone .
F	quick and easy checkout and lots of free offers along with great prices on the products i was looking for .
F	the first thing to say is that it works .
F	i found a lodger in just a couple of days .
F	it ' s very simple to use , and well set out .
F	the cherry on the icing on the cake with spareroom is that they give you loads of information about what else you need to do .
F	for example , they send me stuff about tax so i knew whether or not i would need to pay any as a landlord .
F	it ' s incredibly easy to buy from here .
F	this is unfortunate , because although they often have amazing deals on the prices , i still shouldn ' t buy so many !
F	their customer_service is great too .
F	i was quite nervous_about getting laser_eye_surgery so when i finally decided to go for it i did quite a bit of research as i wanted to be sure i would get the best care possible .
F	from start to finish the team at optegra were brilliant .
F	i went to the guildford clinic and it was spotlessly clean and always so efficient .
F	the staff were very professional but human as well !
F	everything was clearly explained so that i knew_exactly_what to expect , there is a lovely nurse by your side through the whole procedure to help reassure you and keep you calm if you are nervous like me .
F	the procedure was over in a matter of minutes and by that night i could already see clearly .
F	they gave me everything i needed in a take home kit for the aftercare and i knew_exactly_what i needed to be doing when with drops etc .
F	i got it done a couple of weeks before i went on holiday to thailand for the first time - it was the best decision i have ever made .
F	i had a brilliant holiday without having to worry or bother about switching between glasses and prescription_sunglasses or putting contacts in and out , which was a first for a long time .
F	it was brilliant !
F	thank_you so much to mr rob morris and his lovely team at optegra in guidlford !
F	i can ' t fault the customer_service i have received from etyres .
F	the girl i spoke to on the phone was very helpful when i asked her about tyre sizes and the tyre technician turned_up on time with a smile on his face taking extra care over my alloy_wheels .
F	will certainly be recommending etyres to my friends and family !
F	quick and easy service and company were quick to help me with my queries thanks !
F	will use again !
F	i have used booking . com for a number of years and it is excellent !!
F	i have never had a complaint as it shows prices and maps so its very clear what you are booking and where .
F	whenever i have needed to cancel it has been a very straight_forward process .
F	i would thoroughly_recommend the site .
F	flights are in march so as long as they go fine i ' ll be happy but no hassle so far !
F	products arrived quickly
F	checked online to get the best price for my iphone_0s and although enviro phone weren ' t the highest price , they had the best reviews .
F	i would rather go with enviro phone at a lower_price but have the trust that i will get the money !!!
F	super easy to process and they send full instructions .
F	you can check the progress online and on the same day they received my phone , i had an_email promising me the price they offered .
F	money was transferred super_fast .
F	will_defo use them again , superb service , thank_you enviro phone !!
F	!
F	the quote i received was very fair and seemed very easy to sign_up .
F	the courier arrived on time and was hassle_free .
F	i was kept up to date every_step of the way via_email and was rung the next_day to state that my laptop had been accepted and the money was on its way .
F	i can ' t believe_how fast it all happened and the customer_service was fantastic !!
F	i will_definitely_recommend to anyone , it ' s the best !!
F	!
F	this is the second delivery and installation of a kitchen appliance from ao . com and both have been seamless .
F	today i was quoted a delivery time of 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 but got a call to say they would be here at 00 . 00 .
F	both the driver , who ' s name i did not catch , and the technician mark were friendly and efficient .
F	the job was done in under an_hour and they tidied up after themselves .
F	tell your friends and family to use this company
F	flowers delivered on time and the recipient said they were outstanding
F	wide_range of products , great prices , very fast delivery , will_definitely be shopping with viovet again and would recommend to my friends .
F	used hungry_house a few_times with no_complaints .
F	i often rely_on other_users reviews as i am new to my area and count on their honesty when ordering takeaway .
F	i enjoy the fact that you so many cuisines , fairly_priced and available to you via the site .
F	keep up the good work !
F	have used the site for a number of large purchases via ebay .
F	i have found the drivers to be very communicative , friendly , helpful and most of all great value for money .
F	i would highly_recommend the site .
F	i have had large pieces of furniture shipped from scotland to london for under £_00 . 00 plus , such good value .
F	we also changed supplier in september_0000 .
F	or so we thought .
F	so far we have heard_nothing from the company , nothing at all and it was 0 months_ago !
F	we are still getting our bills from our old supplier .
F	we are quite fed_up and do not want to rely_on first_utility in the future .
F	we have contacted energylinx ( the agent ) to confirm that the contract we took out in september_0000 is now none and void .
F	i ordered the w - 0000 bike stand at an amazing price with an extra discount .
F	i ' m very happy with the service , packaging and the stand itself .
F	thank_you very much .
F	having dealt the lee from this company back in 0000 , i was delighted to get another wonderful service and a great cv - thanks ..
F	super_quick delivery and a fantastic product , i have no doubts this will get me interviews !
F	highly_recommended !
F	ordered a dragonflies yummy mummy nappy bag via facebook on special offer .
F	it was a beautiful product and can ' t wait to use it .
F	once i had ordered it , it came very quickly and was packed really well to prevent any damage .
F	would definitely use them again if i see another deal or need anything as the product was a lovely quality and was very attractive
F	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
F	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
F	monday_morning got a text_saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
F	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh_?
F	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
F	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer_service number i found online .
F	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by ...
F	what ?????
F	that ' s a lie !
F	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv_shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
F	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
F	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
F	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i ' ll have to call back in the morning !
F	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
F	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
F	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they ' d already got their item .
F	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
F	i now had to call currys to sort out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
F	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
F	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn ' t been dispatched and also that they don ' t know where it is .... is this for real ???
F	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
F	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
F	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
F	it arrived at 0pm .
F	thanks to mr kwame i didn ' t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
F	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer_service , if they can be called that .
F	by choice i ' ll never use them again .
F	my husband wanted to move his flight from may 00th to april 00th .
F	he had to call 0 times just to get someone who could actually help him .
F	they wanted to charge us over $ 0000 to move the flight to a different day , $_000 for the flight and $_000 in fees .
F	that ' s outrageous .
F	we paid $ 0000 for the ticket and all we wanted to do was fly the same route on a different day .
F	i did the same_thing with air_canada in december , i moved my flight from the 00th to the 00th and they did it for me no problem and it cost $_00 .
F	i will never book with flighthub again .
F	i have just had both my brakes and tyres_fitted with this great company .
F	the very pleasant office staff called me to confirm that both could be done together , and after_discovering how far one of them had to travel , it made me realise even more how good the service is and how much they aim to please .
F	brett who fitted my tyres was efficient , thorough and very polite , clearly a hard worker he is a credit to the company .
F	mick who fitted my brakes was equally fantastic , he has many years of experience and it showed , he talked me through the job and his passion for the job , the company and his_colleagues was refreshing .
F	i told him i was concerned_about my steering and he went the extra mike by checking my steering fluid , you can ' t buy service like that .
F	very high_quality in their standards of work , friendly and hard working , it isn ' t just the price that made me a very happy customer !
F	would highly_recommend and definitely return to them .
F	thank_you very much !
F	vee , oldbury .
F	where do i start , i ' m so fussy when it comes to prams and didn ' t think i would ever find one ..
F	so you can imagine my relief ( more relief on partners side i think ) when i walk_into the shop and fall in love with the new silvercross wayfarer back in !!!! may !!!!
F	.
F	anyway my partner quickly placed the order and paid the deposit to which we were told there would be 0 week wait for all the parts to arrive in stock ( which we were perfectly happy with ) and we would receive a phone call to let us know that it was available for collection .
F	time went by and no phone call so i made the call 0 weeks_ago ( 0 weeks after order being placed ) to be told that there was a 0 week wait on the bag , which i was a little p #* sed off about as we hadn ' t been told any different and no one had bothered to phone to keep us updated .
F	0 weeks passed my partner phoned last_week to check everything was available to which we were told that the order was complete and available to collect when we are ( imagine my relief ) had a smile on my face all week because i knew i would be getting my pram this week as i am now full term and ready to drop !
F	.
F	i got on the phone yesterday to arrange pick_up ( 00 weeks after ordering ) to be told that there are parts_missing from the order leaving me heart broken on the phone !
F	again no phone call to keep me updated !
F	after my partner had been on the phone a few_times and made his feelings clear to different people they decided to offer a pre_owned / discontinued pram bag as a stop gap which matches the pram in no way shape or form ( it isn ' t black or pink or even silver cross ) i don ' t expect to order a lovely looking pram to have an eyesore hanging off it ......
F	the customer_service is absolutely_shocking and i am not a happy lady at all , not only has this had me pulling my hair out but the likelyhood is that i am not going to have a complete pram when my baby arrives ....
F	i could sort of expect this service from some company ' s but not from a so called ' pram specialist ' i ' m hoping this matter gets resolved soon because upto now i am getting_nowhere :(
F	i attempted to purchase a photoshoot with wowcher last_week , and after my 0rd attempt at trying , and receiving a message each time saying payment card rejected ( though the money in both accounts i tried with was available ) i gave up .
F	upon_checking my bank_account , and contacting my banks that evening , i find the money has after all been taken , yet i have received no wowcher email_saying that i had purchased 0 lots of the photoshoot .
F	i have , of course , emailed wowcher regarding this , and surprise , surprise , have received no response .
F	will certainly not be using again !
F	order arrived within 00_hours and was securely_packaged .
F	excellent and speedy service and price was unbeatable
F	its fantastic company .
F	fill in online the details , received next_day the freepost abg , posted the phone and checked arrived within next 0 days .
F	absolutely fantastic and quick service .
F	for one , you can ' t even complain to them properly as their complaint form on their website has a 000 character limit and for some people it is impossible to use their phone line , especially if you have speech problems like me .
F	i ordered a present for a friend over a month_ago and it never came .
F	0 weeks_ago i emailed them on their crappy website and was told it had been sent , but they could either refund or resend it .
F	i responded saying i would like it resent , and i never got a reply .
F	so here i am , over 0 weeks_later with my friends birthday been and gone still trying to find a way to contact them .
F	i had to research and find a customer_service email address on the internet that isn ' t stated on the site , just so i could explain my situation properly .
F	i also can ' t find my order anywhere on my account - i don ' t even think it gives you the option to see what you ' ve ordered !
F	even_though it was apparently delivered to my house , i was never contacted about when it was dispatched and it certainly never showed up .
F	absolutely_ridiculous .
F	ordered yankee tea light candles and was easy to order and they came quickly and in excellent condition .
F	would use their site again .
F	rentrant en france régulièrement , je peux grace à ce site , trouver les meilleurs prix pour les traversées , selon le port ou la compagnie choisie .
F	le site est facile d ' utilisation et contient en plus beaucoup d ' infos pratiques , sur l ' hébergement , les différentes routes ...
F	a recommander !
F	!
F	the bag to send the phones off arrived really fast with full instructions and was well explained .
F	they done exactly as they said they wopuld do and met all my standards .
F	they followed this through with updating emails etc which was great .
F	they paid exactly_what they said they would and told me everything as it happened .
F	took my iphone in for repair which was completed the same day .
F	would definitely_recommend this company .
F	i recently_purchased a pair of black suede truffle ankle boots .
F	they arrived very fast ( i think 0 - 0 days ), they were packed well and they were exactly as_described .
F	they fit_perfectly and are very comfortable .
F	overall excellent service and i will be purchasing from here again in future .
F	easy to book .
F	very organised web and always getting what you expected .
F	i came_across bodykind when searching for some of my natural supplements online , one of their google_ads drew me in ... ( i normally try to avoid these !)
F	but i was very impressed with their clear and efficient layout , detailed product information , and friendly service over the phone .
F	very good value too .
F	really horrid airline to fly with - its impossible to sleep , they keep blasting loud ads at you , the chairs are stuck in upright position , the light is so bright , and all so that you can buy more things with them ( as of course none of the food / drink is free even !)
F	optibac offer a range of probiotics as its their speciality .
F	so you can be sure that the different products have been well planned out and researched .
F	my family and i have been taking them for years , after having tried other probiotics , and we all feel great on the optibac .
F	full_marks for quality , and full_marks for value too .
F	it was a piece of cake to use mazuma .
F	i had 0 old_phones which i thought were worthless .
F	it took 00_minutes to log all the phones on the website using the imei numbers and they instantly recognised the phones , gave me a quote and sent out the pack to post back to them within 0 working day .
F	i posted the phones off on wednesday last_week and by monday we had the money .
F	really pleased .
F	my order which was ordered for next_day delivery took over a week to be delivered !
F	called numerous_times and emailed to be fobbed_off and made promises which were never kept .
F	after cancelling the order it was still delivered and even after returning the order i had to chase them up for a refund .
F	customer_service was awful , communication was awful would take 00mins plus to get through to them on the phone every time .
F	if i could rate then a 0 i would have !
F	their valuation was competitive and they sent out a return pre_- paid postal bag so the whole_process was very easy .
F	i posted it back through the post_office on the thursday so that i had proof of purchase and received confirmation of receipt and also payment within a matter of days .
F	very trustworthy service .
F	i would recommend previous little ones to everyone , they always have the best products at the best prices , delivery is always spot on and i ' ve never had any_issues with them , brilliant company :)
F	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can ' t find on any of their competitors ' websites .
F	nothing special about the website as a whole .
F	they do offer some form of customer_service ( which i haven ' t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
F	can ' t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat orders .
F	worth a visit though .
F	i ' ve been buying from amazon for years , both through their online site and through the iphone_app .
F	they really do make everything as effortless as possible and generally offer good value for money when compared with other online sites , apart_from when it comes to ebooks for the kindle .
F	i ' m an amazon_prime member so i almost always get my orders the next_day - there ' s only been one hiccup so far .
F	had to return a breast pump which had stopped_working and they replaced it within 0 days and also collected the old one , with a minimum of fuss ( only online forms to fill in and the bother of posting the old pump back ).
F	this is now a trusted site for me .
F	unexpectedly good value from comet in their sale this year .
F	bought a washer_dryer on friday and had it delivered on sunday .
F	only found a 00 quid difference_between the cheapest site on the web and the comet price , so went with comet as it ' s more of a known quantity .
F	free delivery charge , although roughly 00 quid for removing the old washer_dryer and installing the new one .
F	made everything low hassle and the machine is working well .
F	ordered a washer_dryer for my tenants for delivery in 0 days , as i didn ' t want them to spend christmas without one .
F	order cancelled the afternoon before delivery was due , due to failure of an_automated security check despite the site having sent me a receipt to tell me payment had been taken .
F	company unable to explain_why security check was failed , citing data_protection reasons ( which shouldn ' t pose a problem , given it ' s my data ).
F	i ' ve never failed a check before , so no_idea why this might be - different delivery address to billing_address maybe (?).
F	no help offered , so tenants will spend christmas without a machine .
F	not a position i ' d like to leave anyone in .
F	really impressed with the service from pure luxuries .
F	i ordered a messenger bag for my brother and it was perfect .
F	the delivery super_quick even at christmas and the system they use for delivery is really neat ; you get a text telling you the likely arrival time and can track the driver through their web app .
F	i would definitely_recommend pure luxuries !
F	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
F	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
F	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
F	lynsey thomas
F	fabulous service better_than letting my old phone collect dust in a draw , i received £_00 for my old phone so my old phone has transformed into a new pair of shoes :)
F	the service and delivery from this company perfectly reflects the high_quality product they are selling .
F	in a panic i bought a last_minute travel wallet for my partners xmas_present .... 00_hours_later it was sat on my desk !
F	you get an_email when it is packed and then again when it is with the courier so you have every idea exactly where your item is at all stages of its journey which is great .
F	i wouldn ' t hesitate to buy from them again and again and again .
F	:)
F	i can ' t fault any stage of my online purchase .
F	the products were as_described and will be perfect for my holiday !
F	they delivered my parcel a good week ahead of a competitor after 0 working_days .
F	a great example of an online_retailer getting price , product offering and service bang on !
F	:)
F	do not buy from toywatch . co . uk .
F	after receiving a faulty watch i soon came to realise that their customer_service is non_existent and i am now struggling to track my return which according to them is " pending " despite it being " delivered " by royal_mail .
F	i expect more from a company when your spending £_000 +.
F	save_yourself the hassle and buy it on the high - street just in case .
F	from start to finish the process was professional and the service second to none .
F	we described the wedding_rings that we wanted and they bought them to life , keeping us involved at every_step of the design process .
F	if you want good quality rings at a competitive price alba_rose is the place to go !
F	thoroughly_recommended .
F	i like to use hostelbookers because it is an easy experience .
F	the website is nicely laid_out and easy to use .
F	hostelbookers is cheaper_than hostelworld for the same bookings .
F	this gives me faith that they are more about the traveller and less about the corperation .
F	i have found this company to be very good - with great deals on a lot of popular businesses .
F	great payouts too !
F	i was absolutely appalled at what ebay has now chosen for an_alternative website for selling tickets .
F	i needed to sell some tickets that i had for a gig .
F	i set about trying to sell them on ebay .
F	when i clicked on ' list ' ebay told me i had to sell tickets on " stubhub " instead .
F	although it gave me a link to click on , when " stubhub " loaded , and asked me to sign in , it did not accept my ebay sign in details .
F	you have to create a brand_new account on " stubhub ".
F	all the effort i ' d put in to listing my tickets on ebay was lost , and i had to start again .
F	when i finally got to listing my tickets on " stubhub " it asked me did i want to email the buyer the tickets , or send them by u . p . s .
F	there was no option to meet the buyer at the gig to give them my tickets .
F	( i was going to the gig myself so this would ' ve been ideal )
F	i could not email the tickets as i would ' ve had to have scanned them , and they would ' ve been rejected at the gates as copies .
F	i have no_idea what they meant by u . p . s delivery so i was stuck .
F	it asked me to enter a price i wanted per ticket .
F	i wanted £_000 for both , so put in £_00 per ticket .
F	it then showed me what the buyer would pay -£_000 . 00 per ticket !
F	if you press " see your payout " it shows you how much you would get through this rip - off site - the price for 0 tickets (£_000 ) minus their commission (£ 00 . 00 ) so i would end up with £_000 . 00 after everything .
F	i would not recommend it to anyone , as it stressed me out unbearably that they not only make it very hard to resell your tickets , but they rip customers off in the process - just like other ticket sites do !
F	i do not believe in ripping people off !
F	this website had guest houses where i actually needed it , rather_than suggesting somewhere 0 miles_away like others have !
F	the website is easy to use , with some good pics .
F	i like the fact that you can put a deposit down when you book it but don ' t have to pay the full_amount til nearer the time .
F	staff who were impressively helpful and accommodating with competitively_priced products .
F	a winning formula for return custom .
F	i had booked a ferry which is due to sail tomorrow .
F	i called a week_ago to explain that i may not be able to travel .
F	i was advised that would have £_00 deducted from the price of my ticket for cancelling , and receive £_000 in ferry vouchers .
F	with this in mind , i called today to cancel , and was advised that i wouldn ' t receive the said refund vouchers and would either lose out all together , or would have to pay a further £_00 to amend the booking to next year .
F	i was then advised that it stated in the t &_cs that i was to give 0 days notice but when i clicked on them to view them , i got a 000 error so wasn ' t able to see them .
F	for anyone not in the business , a 000 error occurs if a website has moved a page or resource but did so without redirecting the old url to the new one .
F	i have screen prints of this to prove it , but was advised by ' jane ' that it was my computers fault , and that she could see them .
F	i work in ecommerce , so would expect t &_cs to be available should customers need to view them .
F	i ' m now faced with another £_00 charge or lose out all together .
F	if this wasn ' t bad enough , ' imogen ' the customer_service girl i was speaking with , could be heard whispering to a colleague about me .
F	unfortunately , a ferry do not record their telephone conversations , so it is my word_against their ' s .
F	i welcome a response to this .
F	i usually use another very popular internet florist ( rhymes with tinterflora !)
F	but they had run out of all mothers_day bouquet in my ( large ) town .
F	this was a good week before mothers_day .
F	i am furious so i tried iflorist with some hesitancy as i hadn ' t used them before and mothers_day is a high pressure situation .
F	to my delight my mums flowers were amazing and delivered at the exact time they said theu would be ( on mothering_sunday for no extra charge ) and everyone was happy and delighted , especially my mum who had an amazing bouquet .
F	thanks i florist for saving my skin .
F	i think i will convert to you for all my flowers .
F	the process has been so easy so far .
F	it was as easy as abc .
F	literally paid for the divorce , got the email , logged in and completed the petition .
F	before i knew it the petition was ready to download .
F	i almost ran to the court with the petitions and the cheque !
F	court actually served my husband with the papers the next_day !
F	0 days_later he had signed them and handed back in to the court !
F	i really hope the rest of the process is this simple and quick .
F	really don ' t know why i was contemplating paying a solicitor to do this for us .
F	still_waiting on the consent order but from what i can make out this should be just as simple .
F	so far i couldn ' t recommend divorce_online enough !!!
F	:-)
F	i basically googled " discount opi varnish " and came to fragrance_direct !
F	best link ever in my opinion .
F	after browsing all of their products i landed on the nail_varnish section .
F	i myself am a nail addict and i love finding a good bargain on branded lacquer !
F	i ordered sooo much nail_varnish it arrived in 0 boxes !
F	opi ' s , essie , l ' oreal , astor .
F	my life is complete .
F	ive found a brilliant site at brilliant prices with brilliant products !
F	why pay over the odds for new season colours when you can get them here for a lower_price ?
F	definately using this site again .
F	cheers_guys :) xx
F	so i was told when i had my car mot ' d i needed 0 new tyres as they were really close to the limit !
F	i looked online as i always do and etyres was the best deal i could find .
F	not only were they the best deal but i could have them done at home , even better !
F	etyres organised the time_slot and i was contacted to check it was still ok on the day .
F	i was told at that point that they would check to see if i really needed them done .
F	the fitter did exactly that and said i could go a few more months and there was no need to change them now !
F	to my relief he said they would give me a full_refund !
F	how brilliant i thought , amazing prompt service and honest too ... not many people are like this nowadays and it was truly refreshing .
F	i would definitely_recommend etyres for their excellent prices , slick service and honest employees !
F	thank_you !
F	fabulous package of lessons and tests .
F	would definitely_recommend to a friend to complete one of these courses too .
F	feel_like i have learnt so much over the past few weeks .
F	also with my busy_schedule there was no pressure to complete the course within a specific time period so felt at ease completing as and when i could !
F	fantastic !
F	jessica chriscoli
F	all my shopping is delivered on time the drivers are friendly and have never had a problem with tesco
F	they are unreliable and they are not a company i would go to again they sent me out the wrong handset i sent it back unopened and they said that the phone had to be inspected and the handset i had ordered would not be restocked for 00 days so i had to pay my first bill without recieving the contract handset i cancelled my order and am going to a company that is more reliable !!!
F	!
F	rebooked my parcel for same day collection and emailed my label emma was very helpful and fast at sorting my problem out like the live help will use again
F	i bought some flowers , chocolates , a balloon , a vase and a teddy_bear for my mums_birthday !
F	once the flowers opened they were beautiful !
F	i had my mum take pictures for me too see !
F	everything arrived on time and in one piece and my mum also said the chocolates were delicious too !
F	one thing tho is the lillie ' s only lasted a week !
F	so them coming unopened really didn ' t make a difference in them lasting longer ... just made us wait longer to see the pretty orange flowers .
F	part from that everything was great .
F	will be happy to use this website again !!
F	:)
F	divine_trash is my all time favourite clothes shop !
F	everytime i visit the staff are always very welcoming and friendly .
F	i always find something to buy that i like , and the staff are always there to give you choices about what to wear it with if your unsure .
F	this is the shop i always reccomend to my friends !
F	i completed my full transaction within 0 days , it was amazing service .
F	could not fault it : ) x
F	my first purchase was a black knitted dress from the site , the dress came in the post in a couple of days , very good delivery service !
F	however when i opended the parcel the dress was crumpled up in a plastic_bag inside and the material felt very cheap !
F	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
F	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !
F	i think the return_policy should be longer .
F	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
F	i ' ve been using beatport for the last 0 years and in my opinion they are the best online distributor for electronic music .
F	the newly developed site is so easy to navigate !
F	one of the most useful_features of the site is the way that the player keeps all the tracks that you have recently played so it ' s really handy when browsing through hundreds of tracks !
F	i find the genre browsers very well_organised and i also find the dj charts very useful when finding new tracks !
F	i ' ve never had any_issues purchasing or downloading from beatport , and the way it remembers your card_details for your account is really handy , when you ' re in a rush to grab a tune before you ' re rushing for a set i know i can get it quickest from beatport !
F	i also find the prices very competative compared to other download sites .
F	keep it up !
F	becs
F	didn ' t go on intending to buy anything and ended_up filling my basket :-) loved the products and loved the prices .
F	very prompt delivery despite living in highlands and islands so i was extremely impressed .
F	no question - i will_definitely be ordering from campus_gifts again
F	samantha was very quick when dealing_with my problem , booked a collection for me as i was unable to do so , done it in quick time , very helpful , much_appreciated !
F	never beat a voucher site , not many better_than this .
F	0 * , will be using it more often than ebay
F	easy , user_friendly , fast
F	really easy site to use , they sent me update emails & i was also able to track the package .
F	excellent service .
F	i ' ve used mazuma before so they were the first place i turned to when i wanted to get_rid of my now redundant mobile .
F	the service i received last time was so swift & thorough that i didn ' t even bother wasting my time checking other_websites .
F	i ' m pleased ( but not shocked ) to say that my experience this time was just as good - from initial_enquiry to payment was 0 days .
F	gotta < 0 mazuma !
F	x
F	i received my package on time however the packaging for the fragrance i bought was partially opened , wrinkled and damaged .
F	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
F	reliable service to use , easy and efficient .
F	i would recommend using mazuma to friends and family .
F	thank_you :-)
F	i would definately_recommend release_travel to anybody booking a stag or hen_party away !
F	i booked leeds for a hen_party and it was brilliant !..... much more_than what i expected .
F	the hotel was great , full of atmosphere , everybody pleasant , rooms of a very high_standard and the whole weekend was brill !
F	we went quad_biking through release , had a meal pre_- booked also a butler for the night !!
F	everybody came away having a fab weekend :-) i will be booking with release in the future .
F	thankyou lee for all of your work for arranging the weekend !
F	!
F	love whoever ashley is :) she was so quick to answer my questions , and i had few .
F	and everything was just so easy .
F	i do not like complicated websites with too many buttons etc .
F	the chat was so easy to use and ever so quick .
F	once again , thank_you ashley
F	best prices for kerastase and consistently great delivery .
F	love em !
F	i ' ve been using printed . com over the last_year or so and couldn ' t be more chuffed with their service .
F	major advantage is the easy upload and quoting service on their clear and friendly website .
F	no more waiting on printers to come back to you with prices !
F	their stock range is great , their print quality is fantastic ( indigo presses - yay ) and their turnaround quick and reliable !
F	they ' re constantly improving themselves upon customer suggestions and come back to you pretty pronto when you email them a question .
F	i ' m a big_fan - can you tell ?
F	perfect service , great value , quick money transfer .
F	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
F	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately .. often the products are wrong , aren ' t included , wrong sizes etc ..
F	but i do have to say they always sort the problems quickly and at their own cost .
F	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
F	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
F	the online assistant catherine is very helpful .
F	she made my experience so much_easier and pleasant especially i ' m under the time pressure .
F	well_done !
F	will_definitely use again and recommended to friends and family .
F	intuitive website , very easy to use .
F	the tract rate however needs improving though for different internet explorer ( i . e .
F	firefox , google_chrome , etc_.)
F	puchased an amazin pair of shoes for an event and needed them within two days , they phoned to say there was an issue and their warehouse had sold the last pair that size but not update the sales_team in time .
F	after offereing refund and discount , they did some extra digging and arranged a delivery direct from the supplier at amazing short_notice and sorted all the invoicing details out .
F	they are friendly , truely excellent and have brilliant customer_service .
F	i would not hesitate to recommend them , you should definitely buy your shoes from them as they go the extra_mile for their customers .
F	the online homebrew company are really good price wise and delivery wise .
F	there may be one or two sites that are the same price but i know these_guys will deliver within a few_days so i keep using them .
F	they often have discount days of % 00 off which quite_frankly i have never seen done before and done so frequently !
F	and there is no catch .
F	i don ' t know about any of the customer_service problems as i ' ve never needed to contact them .
F	i spent_ages trying to get my design printed on a placemat and spent loads on botched attempts only to find these_guys !
F	decent prices , prompt customer_services response , , and a great product !
F	delivered in 0 days during the snow !
F	the shipping fee , for first_class delivery , is wonderfully low as well .
F	i doubt you can beat it .
F	thanks people i will use you again .
F	it is so easy to use this website , considering how many items are on sale .
F	i like how the brands have been divided , as i usually know which brands it is that i want to look at .
F	the filtering system is also very user_friendly and easy to use .
F	great work !
F	the service was amazing - at times i thought it was a bit ott , with constant reminders on text_messages and automated calls , but i am not complaining .
F	i would much rather have lots of updates , rather_than having to chase companies up .
F	they were brilliant .
F	would definitely use again and again and again !
F	the price for this service was unbeatable .
F	the service provided too was unbeatable .
F	when we wanted to drop the car off , we didn ' t need to wait and when we came off a long and tiring flight , still didn ' t have to wait to receive our car .
F	definitely go with this company !
F	great service which was quick and easy to use .
F	amazing quality and service .
F	they ran a promotion for 0 pairs of bench glasses recently and i received them today .
F	thumbs_up from me !
F	its a very easy to use website .
F	just booked some accom in cairns which took about 0 minutes ( including the time it took me to get my credit_card from upstairs ).
F	easy !
F	cheaper products than other_places , quick and easy transaction and delivery
F	very easy to use website , tonnes of choice in hostels and hotels and booking is incredibly quick and straightforward .
F	have found some great hostels based on reviews and map features when booking .
F	have now booked well over 00 different places and been happy with them all .
F	this company saved me money and it really helped_me to understand the different broadband packages out there .
F	thanks - would definately_recommend .
F	submitted a query_regarding my domain and received the answer and fixed the problem in a space of 00_mins .
F	this was out of normal office hours and was clear and straight to the point ( thank_you andrew for your speedy help ).
F	i would never choose another provider ever , 000 reg has always been super efficient
F	definitely_recommend this company !
F	great and friendly service
F	offer always suits my needs , very interesting emails and great discounts plus free postage , what more would you want .
F	very good and fair service .
F	this was my first time ordering any protein or supplements off of the internet .
F	i shopped_around and called several stores and supplement_warehouse had the lowest cost .
F	when i decided to order from here the process was so simple and so fast i was done within 0 minutes .
F	including the time it took to write the review .
F	i will be making all my supplement purchases here from now on .
F	paid over £_000 for an exercise bike on saturday_afternoon , received confirmation of next_day delivery and further confirmation that my item would be with me on tuesday .
F	i am self_employed and had to take the day off on tuesday , nothing arrived , furthermore , i have been given no ability to track my item with the courier as i have never even been provided with a reference_number .
F	i am furious as i have lost a full day ' s pay ( over £_000 ) and am still without the item i purchased .
F	unprofessional !
F	just hate it when i have to call these_guys up - the most rubbish customer_service , no one seems to know what they ' re talking_about , you get a different answer everytime you call up , and now we ' re spending £ 0 extra a month on a ' super hub ' which has done nothing to improve our broadband speed at all !
F	!
F	i do like john_lewis - not least cos of the great customer_service .
F	good quality products too .
F	it ' s just so reliable and easy to use - can always count on them in a birthday emergency too !
F	wow , i ' m loving roxy palace right now !
F	really user - friendly website , and a couple of nice wins so far :-)
F	website easy to view and prices are very reasonable . cheaper_than elsewhere we have searched online and in stores .
F	we bought the oyster pram and carrycot .
F	though a tiny glitch with when the item was going to be delivered all in all great customer_service !
F	would shop again .
F	i ordered a pair , on delivery they had secure packing , i was surprised with the quick delivery .
F	just waiting to get another pair once back in stock ....:) recommended the site to my friends .....
F	item arrived on time and they produce good quality music .
F	great service , lenses were in perfect conditions as usual .
F	delivery was extremely fast .
F	been using lenstore for over a year now , they always have the best value contact_lenses and service .
F	i purchased a much needed dishwasher from this crowd .
F	they were great in clearing up all my questions and worries before i went_ahead and paid for the dishwasher .
F	best price around for what i wanted .
F	i ' m very happy with my purchase .
F	i was looking for a lot of different kitchen_appliances and i came_across corairs . com it had everything i wanted and i bought a breadmaker for my mam too she loved it .
F	thanks guys !
F	i ordered late at night and it sill arrived so quickly .
F	i love this website and have already_recommended it to my friends and family !
F	thank_you so much !
F	good service and quality !
F	i would like to see a free telephone_number
F	a return label option .
F	thank_you
F	i love using supplement_warehouse for my supplement_needs .
F	i am an amateur figure competitor and i certainly use my share of supplements !
F	things can definitely get pricey in this industry over time , but sw has saved me a ton of money since i started with them !
F	thank_you guys for what you offer the bodybuilding community .
F	very reliable and budget friendly !
F	fast_shipping , reliable , awesome prices , you can ' t go_wrong with this store !
F	i would definitely recomend hostelbookers .
F	it is the only site i use when i am traveling .
F	it is incredibly user_friendly and super easy to search and compare different properties .
F	and they don ' t charge a booking_fee which is awesome !
F	we purchased the samsung clp - 000nd , and what can i say , it ' s great .
F	we are a small business and we print out a lot of coloured brocures .
F	the printer is able to cope with the high_volume of prints .
F	we also have tested it with photo paper and it hasn ' t let us down .
F	this is a great machine to have as it is sturdy and small , just what you need in a small office .
F	the service was also great , once we sent the payment , we received an_email_saying that our printer would be out next_day , and it was !
F	jessica who dealt_with had great customer_service skills and lovely to deal with .
F	good product
F	i ' ve worked with ali for a number of years now and he ' s always been extremely_helpful .
F	he ' s incredibly knowledgeable on adwords and is always super_quick to respond to requests .
F	highly_recommended .
F	was too ill to go to event but could not get a refund because of their policy which makes no sense given how there was a strong demand on tickets and so it ' s not like they ' d have made a loss . tried to sell my ticket to someone but couldn ' t get through to anyone on the hotline to transfer the ticket to their name despite ringing for half an_hour and so not only was i home with flu feeling miserable whilst all my friends were out having fun i was paying £_00 for my trouble plus whatever my phone bill comes to so yeah , i ' m sure there ' re good reasons for their policies but in this case they pretty_much robbed me for being sick .
F	i was extremely happy with my experience with glasses_direct .
F	i found them just by googling " glasses uk ," and i was really excited to learn that they would deliver trial frames to try on for free !
F	i ' ve always been afraid of buying clothes or accessories online because you ' re never quite sure how they ' re going to look on , and something as expensive and defining as glasses would normally be a definite no - go for me .
F	those " upload a picture " schemes never really work right or tell you how the glasses will feel on .
F	however being_able to try them on in reality was amazing , and it was free to do , as often as you ' d like .
F	once i had decided on frames i liked , it was really easy to order and the prices were amazing .
F	i was able to get two_pairs of glasses for less_than i would normally spend on one .
F	they have lots of add_ons and options so you can do anything from very basic lenses to complicated bi - focals for astigmatism with transition lenses !
F	all at still very reasonable prices too .
F	when the final product game ( much more quickly than i ' m used to when i order from my optometrist !)
F	i was extremely happy with them as well .
F	they both came in cases with a cloth , the prescription was spot on and the fit was right !
F	i never have any trouble ordering off here !
F	i ordered my boyfriends xmas_present and it came the next_day
F	makes my life so much_easier !
F	thanks xxx
F	i placed my order on a dress on the 00 / 00 / 00 as boohoo had given me 00_%_off as it was my bday on the 00rd the money was debited on the same day and i was hoping to wear this dress on xmas day and i have emailed constantly only to have the same automated email i will never order again and want my money back !
F	they are so unprofessional it is a joke it make me never want to order online ever again !!!
F	!
F	after some_confusion over products , the problem was fully solved .
F	very happy they got in touch and made the effort to sort it promptly .
F	i would , however , suggest you speak to your warehouse team or couriers about taking better care of paid for items and not rushing off so quick to give the customer a chance to check for damages else there could be many more people wanting to return .
F	otherwise , worldstores is a great place to buy from .
F	thanks
F	pleasant , fast .
F	will use again .
F	it was easy to use , nice sire .
F	will use again .
F	i have been very impressed with the service .
F	the product has been finished to a high_standard and my order was delivered very efficiently .
F	the service was very professional and friendly and i would not hesitate to use these_guys again .
F	keri bird
F	birds baby showers
F	my item arrived very quickly and the website i very user_friendly !
F	i would continue buying from this website .
F	thank_you !
F	i ordered items for my iphone at the start of december .
F	i emailed in january to say the goods hadn ' t arrived and all they responded was what is your full postal_address .
F	i provided this and had to phone several days_later for an update .
F	seemingly the supplier sent the goods !!!
F	they offered to resend the items as they now had stock .
F	these replacement items coming first_class never arrived so a week_later contacted them .
F	no response .
F	a few_days_later i emailed again and asked for a refund .
F	yet again no response and no refund .
F	will be informing consumer council .
F	this company is atrocious and should not be allowed to trade .
F	they basically take customers money under false pretences and seem unprepared to communicate with customers .
F	loved the wedding stationary .
F	the ribbon invites we ordered were beutiful .
F	had loads of complements off guests on our invites .
F	would definitely_recommend
F	i had read poor reviews about this company so was a little_wary about ordering through them .
F	however , the service i received was first rate with the product arriving in good condition less_than 00_hours after_placing my order .
F	this site has a great range of products at decent prices and delivery was free !
F	i ' d definitely use deep_blue again .
F	appreciated for your friendly services , wish to have more pleasant shopping with you !
F	thank_you .
F	i stupidly signed_up to talktalk & a bt telephone engineer installed my new phone line at the bottom of my stairs even_though i said i wanted it in the living_room , he refused - he clearly couldn ' t be bothered .
F	when i plugged in my router i had to use an extension cable to fit in the plug for my phone & the plug for my router .
F	so i now have a massive tripping & fire hazard at the bottom of my stairs .
F	when i phoned up talktalk to complain_about this , i was told that if the engineer put it there then that is where it should stay !
F	so i complained to the ombudsman about this - still_waiting on a reply .
F	then my talktalk tv box arrived & to my horror , i realised that the tv must be plugged_into my router - which is in the hall at the bottom of my stairs !
F	this doesn ' t make sense !
F	am
F	i supposed to drag my tv into the hall & watch it there !
F	i was then on the phone to talktalk for an_hour trying to get this resolved .
F	apparently i could just run extension cables into the living_room .
F	so my house is to become an even bigger danger .
F	eventually they agreed to move my phone line , i had to stay on the phone as they filled out the form for this request - apparently i have nothing better to do with my time .
F	i was told that an engineer would phone within_00hrs to arrange a date - that was 0 days ago .
F	so again , i phoned talktalk this morning , only to be told that they didn ' t have an update of this on my account !
F	i was then told that it was passed to a manager & someone would phone today .
F	i don ' t believe they will phone .
F	i am sitting with no tv - even_though i am paying for it .
F	i have a fire & tripping hazard on my stairs & when i asked to cancel , i was told that i would have to pay cancellation charges !
F	this is ridiculous - this is all their fault .
F	they then had the cheek to phone me about taking out a talktalk mobile phone !
F	trying to complain to talktalk gets me nowhere - there online help is just trouble shooting & phoning gets me nowhere .
F	i plan to write to talktalk & give them bad_reviews where possible .
F	mairi kate
F	went a bit ott when ordering but it was well worth it .
F	the coffee is great as an early morning kick or as a mid morning break .
F	there are loads of different ones to choose from , whether it ' s just a normal coffee or a flavoured coffee whittards have it all .
F	thanks .
F	always had the lowest_prices and fast_shipping .
F	i will keep using supplementwarehouse . com
F	we got some tickets for reading which were by_far the cheapest tickets around !
F	not only this , all other_places had sold out of the tickets we wanted and double 0 got them to us really quickly .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending the site and am definitely going to use them again .
F	thanks double 0 !
F	vic
F	i have to say that i am seriously impressed with the service that i have received from oak_furniture land .
F	the quality of the products cannot be_faulted and i cannot remember the last time i received such an efficient delivery service .
F	the products were securely_packaged and the drivers took the items into my home and to the requested rooms with the utmost respect for my property .
F	i cannot sing this company ’_s praises enough and i would urge_anyone considering using them to do so – you won ’ t regret it !!
F	!
F	rhian kinman
F	a brilliant company to use for arranging a hen_night .
F	makes it very easy for everyone to pay and see the details .
F	i recommend using them if you have an event to arrange !
F	excellent as always .
F	although more info of whats in the box sets would be helpful i . e " perfume : 000ml ( eau de parfume ) and 000ml : lotion " as i had to email to find that out .
F	no trouble at all .
F	well_packaged when arrived , and all my products were as ordered .
F	thankyou .
F	i have been using tshirt_studio for years and have found them to always be excellent .
F	i am a graphic_designer , and reguarlly use their services for gifts for my friends using my own designs .
F	stated next_day delivery , and that is what i got .
F	i received a text_saying the flowers had been dispatched and then another text when they had been delivered .
F	very happy with the service and would recommend to friends
F	i ' ve just purchased from supplement_warehouse for the second time now and the service is great .
F	i love the free_shaker_bottle , and other goodies that come along with each purchase !
F	the reviews are good as well , i haven ' t been disappointed yet !
F	a good friend_recommended this course to me , so i decided to give it a go .
F	i found it enjoyable and easy to follow .
F	the information given was clearly and easily explained and was very much step for step through the course material .
F	it would be nice to have a free access to the program for a time to be able to click and explore randomly on one ' s own without being part of an assessment or exercise .
F	but no_complaints here ...
F	i would recommend this course to anyone_looking at developing their computerized accounting skills !
F	thanks e_- careers !
F	great website .
F	thanks very much
F	always giving out free money or free_spins excellent customer_service and good value for money xxx alias allboysmummy
F	will be using this site again , i ' m traveling around and making last_minute plans .
F	this worked_perfectly for my needs .
F	love that each hostel is rated , listed with the price and availability is indicated .
F	one thing i had trouble with was using the map of listings on my tablet , it wouldn ' t zoom for some reason .
F	really good !
F	was delivered in no time !
F	great range of products to your door !
F	thanks !
F	:)
F	everyone commented on how much fun the hen_night was , even those that were a little_worried_about pole_dancing lessons !
F	we had a brilliant night and everything_ran_smoothly .
F	all the places were within a few minutes walk of each other and we had no_problems finding our way around !
F	i ' m so grateful to the maxmise staff who had to put up with the information changing what seemed like every 0 minutes due to people changing their minds !
F	maxmise remained very professional and understanding throughout !
F	thank_you !
F	from order to delivery there was no_fuss and everything happened very quickly .
F	cheapest price i have found for the product , without outrageous postage fees .
F	the packing was just right for the product and there was no waste or excess packing as i have found with so many companies these days .
F	would recommend to a friend and would hope to use their services again .
F	many_thanks !
F	everything arrived_safely , and a full week before the latest date .
F	excellent !
F	i was looking for a huge bag of cat_food , and wanted to by online as the shops all have to mark the prices up so much .
F	i searched and found chemist_direct ( the name did puzzle me a little ).
F	the prices were the cheapest and the shipping was not a huge_amount for next_day delivery .
F	it all arrived and i ended_up with three very happy cats !
F	they were the only people i could find who had what i needed , then they were able to get it to me within 0 days !
F	absolutely_brilliant !
F	good quality service , fast postage and item exactly as_described .
F	thanks :)
F	i have used enviro phone on many occasions and would highly_recommend the service .
F	it ' s fast , easy and hassle_free with most transactions completes within a week .
F	we use just - eat on a regular_basis and can highly_recommend them .
F	easy to use and takes away the hassle of trying to get through to a take away on the telephone !
F	love digital_rev .
F	they are my go - to for any camera gear .
F	got a 000ex speedlite and ordered it very last_minute for a wedding and it arrived days before i needed it !
F	hats_off to you digital_rev , i am one very happy customer - you ( and your gear ) never disappoint :-)
F	i have been with vodafone for a few_years now they treated me like rubbish ripped me one on a bill i never got to the bottom of .
F	i am now with tesco mobile and its a breath of fresh_air i will never go back to vodafone and wouldn ' t recommend them ether only if you want to get ripped_off
F	received ipod shuffle only couple of days after ordering it ( ordered on fri and received it on the mon ).
F	condition just as good as_described and all this for a reasonable_price .
F	will_definitely be a return customer !
F	thanks !
F	easy to navigate site , excellent communication regarding delivery and services via_email , quick delivery and excellent product xx
F	it was easy to order some beautiful flowers , and the step by step updates allowed me to be aware of their dispatch and know that they had been delivered safely !
F	the flowers were very much_appreciated and had numerous comments on their quality and beauty !
F	thank_you !
F	booking with hostelbookers was a great experience !
F	it is extremely_helpful to be able to read so many reviews before choosing the best place to stay .
F	it is also easy to navigate and even easier to book .
F	no_hassles .
F	i would definitely_recommend hostelbookers to others traveling !
F	hi !
F	i ' ve got a question about e_- ticket !
F	!
F	today i received my e_- ticket , but it has a name of another person .
F	can i be sure , that seller won ' t use this ticket and i won ' t have a trouble at the day of event ?
F	offered the best prices on hornby figures ( bought for a photography project ) of anyone online .
F	it was very easy to place my order and then the items were delivered ( free of charge ) within 00_hours .
F	the ongoing customer_service has been excellent .
F	i would highly_recommend this company .
F	i might sound like i am exaggerating a bit but i am not , i have been scammed time after time and when i got recommended to sep batteries , they replied me just in time , did i also mention the they helped_me get the new battery for my toyota camry , just days after calling in and ordering they got it shipped to me , and the customer_service like answered all the questions i had time after time , i highly_recommend you to try sep batteries !
F	if you are an_avid player of online casino games , this should be your number one site to consider , it is safe and secured which means you do not have to worry_about scams , they even go_ahead to offer a special bonus for vip players , this site especially went further to offer many different payment options , especially credit_cards and ukash , also i received fast and helpful customer support which i would definitely_recommend to friends and any new customer with a plan to join an online casino site also if you plan on switching casino sites i would greatly recommend you join magic red .
F	very good service - goods arrived in time and was well_packaged .
F	great range of products and the website is easy to navigate .
F	i have booked through prestigia . com for a riad marrakech and also booked a hotel in barcelona and everything went very well .
F	in fact , i paid a deposit and the difference was to be paid when you arrive at hotel .
F	in marrakech it all went good but at check out in barcelona , i went to pay the difference that was written on my voucher and they wanted to charge me the whole amount .
F	after showing them my voucher and making them call prestigia , they finally_agreed with the amount left that i had to pay .
F	all in all a memorable experience .
F	kudos to prestigia !
F	!
F	i can ' t think of a bad thing to say about amazon .
F	a lot of their products have free postage & packaging and most of the time i get my items delivered before the estimated date .
F	i ' ve even had pre_- ordered products delivered a day or two before they ' ve been released .
F	their return_policy for faulty_goods is 00 days after purchase ( which is fair_enough ) but they make no exception for christmas ( except with unopened items ).
F	after opening my new laptop on christmas day i knew it was faulty immediately but because it was bought ( but not used or opened ) in november , and the 00 days had passed , they wouldn ' t let me return it which i think is extremely stupid .
F	it ' s common knowledge that people don ' t usually buy presents at the last_minute , nor do they open them before_christmas day .
F	so there would ' ve been no way for me to know the product was faulty until it was too_late .
F	definitely not shopping there again and i ' d recommend others to shop elsewhere too .
F	as soon as i got my laptop i could tell the cursor pad was off .
F	you would move it somewhere and it would fly right past it , then you ' d spend about a minute circling the link , trying to get the cursor on it but failing .
F	i was hoping to get it repaired or get a replacement laptop but was told by in store staff there was nothing wrong with it .
F	i now have a laptop i dread using and there ' s nothing i can do about it .
F	where to start !
F	in store the staff where nice and helpful it seems .
F	i have a habit of interegating when it comes to contracts , i repeatdly asked my questions to make_sure they couldnt loop hole me ... well turned_out he just plain lied !
F	it was only after i found out that i was unable to cancel the contract at all !
F	and to top it , after_speaking to three who the contract was also with , they told me it was bad practise what carphone_warehouse did .
F	now im paying for a 0 year contract i was explicitly assured i wouldnt end up paying if there was problems .
F	( the contract was for a friend in my credit_rating .. yes dont trust friends with money ) what actually happened was my friend canceled the payment and without any notice i was immediatly paying them .
F	if i had known what i new now about my liability , i would never have agreed to help my friend .
F	my advise .. dont trust carphonewarehouse staff to tell the truth , they will blatently lie to your face for a sale .
F	i bought a photography lighting kit and after 0 weeks of hassle and 0 kits both broken they where trying to pawn me off with replacement bulbs .
F	after some discussion over checking the lights are fine before despatch is was clear they knew full well the whole stock where broken and still sold onto the customers !
F	at that point i demanded a refund !
F	i refuse to purchase from a company who does that to their customers !
F	part of me believes they might purposly buy lights with broken bulbs , as it easily happens , then they can get a cheaper price !
F	surely if a big company recieves broken goods they would get replacements from the manufacturer since they give them £ 0000 ' s .
F	however warehouse express seems quite happy to sell on these goods !
F	so 0 weeks_later i have no lights , mountains of stress and lost work from sitting in waiting for deliveries .
F	if your going to purchase from them dont expect a quality service !
F	i had my hen_party arranged by hen_heaven .
F	it made the arrangements so easy , i could send invites out by email and people could pay online taking away the stress of collecting .
F	the park plaza hotel was excellent it was a perfect central location to all the pubs and shops .
F	it was a few minutes walk from the activity venue where we had the dirty_dancing experience - which i would completely recommend !
F	it was a great ice breaker for our group .
F	we also had prepaid nightclub to oceanas which had different floors for different tastes so there was something for everybody .
F	hen_heaven have made my hen_weekend a completely stress_free , amazing memory and we definately got our value for money !
F	let me say the activities we had were great but the problem was with the accommodation !
F	on arrival we had a drink spillages down the walls , plastic stuck in plug sockets , gone off milk spilt everywhere in the fridge so disgustingly potent and dry and crusty in the fridge it was that old !!!
F	dirty cup in the lounge , dirty plate in with the clean ones in the cupboard , smashed lamp shoved in the draws and a broken window in the main bedroom not just a crack but a full on hole !
F	terrible paint job where they have obviously had a leak in the main bedroom , so the walls were all yellow and obviously needs to be re - plastered and painted !
F	finally there was an immense amount of black mold along the top of the wall in the main bathroom , absolutely_disgusting !!!!
F	we had someone from the company out to come and see all this which was fine to try and get it dealt_with , of which she assured me would be looked into and dealt_with and i would receive a response in regard to this matter .
F	but surprise i did not receive a reply and had to chase the matter myself , to only be dealt_with by neil stonehill apparent managing_director
F	of my big_fat brighton_weekend who states that " with regard to any other of these issues ( other than the window ) they were not pointed_out to him at the time "!
F	which is a total and utter lie , so let_alone do they let you have an disgustingly dirty accommodation ( which is not worth the money you pay ) they also imply that you are a liar !!!
F	there customer_services is a complete utter lie and i am absolutely_disgusted by how we have been treated in regard to this matter !
F	my best advise ... stay_away if you want an enjoyable weekend in a good standard of accommodation !
F	!
F	horrendous customer_service , i email to chase up what ' s happening and the response is " we have nothing else to say " to which i reply " not even an_apology for the standard of the accommodation ?"
F	and the response was " no we have nothing else to say !"
F	so let_alone the terrible standard of the accommodation they won ' t even apologise !!!
F	absolutely_terrible !
F	ordered nearly £_000 worth of goods for a garden party from partyrama .
F	they didn ' t disappoint .
F	it was super_fast delivery , the good were as_described and in tip - top condition .
F	they even did ' buy in bulk ' for some items which cut the cost of our purchases substantially .
F	we ' d done alot of research on the internet prior to making our purchases , just to make_sure that we were getting a competative price .
F	i really trust them and will shop here again .
F	the invitations arrived quickly after_placing my order on the company ' s website and were of an excellent finish .
F	no_complaints .
F	the staff here have great product knowledge and go out of their way to help .
F	excellent prices too and really fast delivery .
F	banana_fingers was recommended to me by a couple of friends when i needed to buy a new harness .
F	the prices were extremely competitive .
F	i also bought a brush for a friend to take_advantage of the free delivery offer if you spend of £_00 .
F	i placed my order sunday_afternoon and it arrived tuesday ( even_though i had only selected normal delivery , not next working day ), which was very impressive .
F	banana_fingers also kept me up to date with my order ' s status by email and text .
F	cannot_fault them one bit !
F	many_thanks .
F	fast and easy with lots of reviews on the hostel to see what it would be like .
F	no problem whatsoever , and personally checked against hostel_world prices ... cheaper on hostel_bookers for sure !
F	i will be using this again for sure .
F	hands_down the best supplement company out there .
F	not only do they beat the competition ' s prices by 0 %, they also have a huge_selection of samples ( who doesn ' t like free_samples of products you want to try ?!?!?!)
F	shipping is ridiculously fast , i typically receive my orders within 00 - 00_hours of confirming transaction , that ' s unheard of !
F	i ' ve only had to use the customer_service line once in 0 years , and not only was the representative kind and helpful , she also was very knowledgeable of other products and suggested i look_into other brands for the supplements i was purchasing .
F	all i can say is thank_you supplement_warehouse , for all that you do !
F	we ' ve only just started working with the guys at pd and have been impressed with what we have seen .
F	we are a start up and need the hand holding and advice they offer without reservations .
F	we look_forward to working more with them in the coming months as we grow our business and would absolutely recommend them .
F	first_class hotel with top_class facilities excellent service could not have afforded such a fantastic top_class hotel for such a low price . i am in a wheelchair and i could not of asked for better assistance and the staff went out of their way to help in every way they could .
F	excellent hotel at an excellent ebookers price
F	excellent service
F	excellent product and very quick delivery !

F	i was trying to complete a review on their imdb website ( film review ).
F	they then started to ask me for my card_details !
F	really ?
F	when all i wanted to do was put what i thought of dodgeball 0 ?
F	their response email stated that the matter would be investigated , but they could not tell me the outcome of the investigation , for privacy reasons !
F	i challenged this and asked them to send a hard copy letter in the post to be of their investigation findings .
F	next email they sent , consisted of them doing a very quick u - turn and saying they were wrong , no investigation would take place ( maybe because they realised they had been caught out after using the privacy excuse for years ).
F	they put they would not correspond with me further !
F	so if you ask any_questions and they don ' t want to answer them , be prepared for them to just state they will not correspond with you anymore .
F	the information to literally put a film review on a site , was more_than you be asked for if you were arrested by the police !
F	ridiculous and they lied in their second email and tried to hide_behind data_protection and privacy laws .
F	amazon and google are taking over the world .
F	be afraid , be very afraid .
F	i bought cosmetics from the leeds m & s store .
F	when i got home , i discovered that i had in fact picked_up an item which was in the wrong ' pigeon hole '.
F	i didn ' t think i would stand a chance of any return , especially with this type of item and , to some extent , the error being partly my mistake .
F	i phoned and the assistant said there would be no issue and i could have an instant refund .
F	in fact , they even asked if i had to pay for petrol or bus fare and they would compensate me for this as well !
F	this is the best customer_services experience i have ever had from any store .
F	for anyone who may at any point in their lives wish to purchase anything from the exquisite emporium which is named argos :
F	always email them - but as with any other company , when they have the crap contact form that you can ' t keep a copy of ( handy that ), copy and paste into a word document , with the date ( and time if possible as it is more imposing - not that the person in the store will even notice - that ' s if they can read - refer as far back as jasper carrott ' s 0000 vide if necessary ), before pressing send .
F	when they respond to your email by phone , which may be for reasons where they do not want written evidence ; but is far more likely to be the fact that they have fingers too fat to type ; insist they confirm the content of the said conversation in some written format .
F	the reason being is that , when you eventually summon up the energy to return any item and have to stand in the inappropriately titled queue for ' customer information / returns ', it may go some way to prove that what you are saying is true .
F	if you do not heed my warning , be prepared for a member of staff to say to you that they " only have your word for it " when you state that the person who phoned you said you don ' t need a receipt even_though the item nearly burnt your house down and every one therein .
F	i took the standard part of the lamp , and the crumbled concrete base in a plastic_bag with me back to the local_store .
F	you will also get ' knowing ' looks as you have lost the receipt , so you may have been stolen the item and then returned it for the sum of £ 0 . 00 .
F	bearing in mind , argos must be about the only store where the items , apart_from those on display , are behind the front_desk and in a store room .
F	if i was skilled enough to be able to access this room without anyone ' s knowledge , i would endeavour to obtain a 00 " lcd tv and would not have bothered to return it , unless " freddie the fence " had not been interested .
F	after the manager eventually agreed to phone customer_services , i was told there was ' no note ' on the system of me being offered a refund , despite the product not being fit for purpose and electrically faulty .
F	i went through the whole procedure of giving my name , address etc , only to be handed an argos card , not money .
F	i pointed_out to the assistant that the card was not in fact a refund .
F	i was told ' it was the same_thing '.
F	i said it was not the same as a refund and was a credit note .
F	i asked if it was the same as cash , i would be able to spend it anywhere !
F	he said i was lucky to get that , even_though the item caused fire damage and collapsed .
F	if , by some miracle , you have not lost the will to live after waiting 00_minutes and been called a liar , i suggest you purchase catalogue nr : 000 /_0000
F	disclaimer : no argos employees were hurt during the making of this email .
F	any resemblance to any employee being a cretin is purely coincidental .

F	my boyfriend ordered flowers from this company to give to me on valentine ' s day .
F	after being told to stay in the house and await a delivery they never came , so my boyfriend had to tell me what he was expecting .
F	i was appalled .
F	the flowers didn ' t arrive until the 00th_february at about 0pm , by which time they were dead .
F	i wrote a lengthy email to the company telling them about the incident and how it was unacceptable that a flower delivery service could be so careless .
F	i received a dry and careless reply of about 0 words and then the status of my case was changed to ' closed .'
F	in my opinion , a flower delivery service that cannot be on time on valentine ' s day is just a disgrace .
F	yet , they barely bothered to say sorry .
F	to add salt to the wound they offered my boyfriend a voucher for £ 0 off his next purchase .
F	ha .
F	like we would ever use them again !
F	don ' t touch this company with a barge_pole .

F	everything was great , the young guy on reception very friendly .
F	would recommend staying here !
F	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
F	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
F	then a few weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
F	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
F	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
F	felt bullied into buyinv more_than i wanted .
F	flights to johannesburg booked !!!
F	excited to go for our holiday .
F	quick and easy transaction .
F	no_problems , no additional_charges .
F	super_fast delivery and great customer_service , i would definitely order again .
F	i am very pleased with my purchase .
F	thank_you .
F	super_fast delivery , great product , what else can i wish for ?
F	our pens and usb disks arrived ontime and are of a good quality , we will be placing further orders when we have the budget in place .
F	not as high a price as some other_sites but guaranteed amount paid and very quickly the money was in my bank .
F	the website was easy to use , clear on what i was booking , not many steps to complete the booking , couldn ' t ask for more
F	customer_service = terrible
F	systems = terrible
F	compensation = terrible
F	i can not recommend lowcostholidays enough - uk call_centres and excellent service - switch you won ' t regret it !
F	i first booked a holiday with expedia 0 years_ago to l . a . and i had problems when they charged my credit_card and debit_card ( saying the former had failed so i paid again ).
F	i was charged by my bank interest on the expensive holiday until it was all sorted .
F	the 0 weeks it carried on was very stressful and instead of sending me compensation for the bank charges they sent me £_000 voucher for expedia - who i would never go with again !
F	suffice to say i never used it .
F	0 years later and i messed_up and stupidly thought it might be a one off ( from looking at other online reviews i can see it is not !).
F	i got sent an_email to say i needed to add baggage to my flight ( already done ) i emailed three times ( no response ), i then called the customer_service ( call_centre in india , very , very rude and unhelpful ).
F	they told me i needed to speak to easyjet .
F	i explained i had paid expedia and booked through them so i needed them to look_into .
F	the holiday was very expensive and adding baggage is only £_00 per_person , you ' d think they would say so sorry about this .
F	we ' ve called easyjet and modified your booking and you ' ll get an_email confirmation later today .
F	instead all i ' ve had is an_email from easyjet - again saying i have no baggage .
F	i will now have to email them direct .
F	they make what should be something to look_forward to really stressful .
F	don ' t book with them .
F	for the sake of £_000 - 000 use someone_else .
F	hate to say it but when you have a uk call_centre they listen to the problem and sort it for you .
F	[_name ] was a great help !
F	was really quick and efficient to my queries !
F	great , fast delivery and very happy with products and price x
F	i was very impressed from start to finish , kept in the loop at all times and i have been told that the flowers were the most beautiful they had ever received : ) will be using again for sure !

F	moneysavingexpert is one of the best sites i know of .
F	i signed_up for their email tips immediately , and i have managed to bag some brilliant deals .
F	as with any site with a forum , there is always the odd bod who you don ' t get along with , but as a general rule i have had no trouble there whatsoever .
F	the mods are quick at their jobs , and do them with a polite and friendly air ( as_opposed to treating posters as though they are peons ).
F	i have mistakenly posted threads in the wrong place , and it has been with a polite little note to let me know i ' ve done so that the mods have moved and / or closed the thread .
F	i can highly , highly_recommend moneysavingexpert to absolutely anyone and everyone .
F	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
F	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free postage offer this time around .
F	i do rather object to the almost constant emails i have been receiving , however .
F	vistaprint , i will buy what i want when i want and need it , i do not need to be showered with emails about " special_offers just for you !!!
F	", which nine times out of ten are entirely irrelevant to me .
F	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
F	i will be attempting business_cards next .
F	all - in - all , if you can handle getting a plethora of emails a couple of times a week , vistaprint are a good place to pick things up from .
F	this website is a goldmine of handy - dandy things that a new mum ( like myself ) can find useful .
F	there are plenty of money - off vouchers to make the pennies stretch further , and other mums in the forums to chat to and share various tips with .
F	getting the little packs at sainsbury ' s is also fantastic , as you get a tu voucher to go towards getting clothing for the little monster ( s ) in your life .
F	it is very daunting being a first - time mum , and bounty goes a long way to giving support and advice to them , be you a mum with a significant other or a mum striking out on your own .
F	great help , all the info i needed .
F	thanks .
F	i have used glasses_direct before and am always over the moon with the glasses i receive .
F	last time i ordered from them last_year there was an issue regarding the ' free tint ' offere they were running at the time .
F	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
F	i have recently had my eyes retested and found that my prescription had altered slightly so looked again at glasses_direct , all the frames i liked seemed pricey so i decided to try a few frames on a home_trial basis and wait for a groupon_voucher to come up .
F	luckily i didn ' t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
F	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
F	unfortunately , like last time , the promotion was misleading and not available in conjunction with my groupon_voucher .
F	this put me in a difficult position as i had already paid for the groupon_voucher and so felt that rather_than waste the money on that i had to make the purchase .
F	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn ' t want to be stuck with frames i didn ' t like .
F	i am now looking_forward to receiving my new frames , am just disappointed that once again i ' ve felt let_down by the incentives to purchase .
F	i enjoyed the way the website is set_up .
F	it allowed me to shop and re - evaluate my order for days , all before having to create an account .
F	i am absolutely_delighted with my recent_purchase from pet_supermarket .
F	the product choice was superb and i received my royal_canin cat_food within 0 days of ordering !
F	fantastic - thanks !
F	kirsty , south lanarkshire
F	i cannot recommend atlantic signs highly_enough .
F	this is the second time that i have placed an order with them and i am , again , delighted with my house sign .
F	their product selection , customer_service and delivery service are second to none and i would like to express my thanks to the staff at atlantic signs for their excellent service .
F	kirsty munro .
F	my husband and i cannot_fault beds on legs at all !
F	their customer_service is second to none and their product choice is excellent .

F	i was sceptical about ordering glasses online .
F	wow !
F	i don ' t think i ' ll ever buy from an opticians again .
F	the service is brilliant and easy .
F	they came on time and just want i wanted .
F	this could lead to a large collection of glasses .
F	i had no_problems getting what i ordered .
F	happy with the services
F	i ' d use this company again , it was hassle_free .
F	ordered some items on offer for ' click and collect ' items were available for the collection from my chosen store the following_day .
F	i was emailed and sent a txt message to let me know my items had arrived to store .
F	great service , great price .
F	thanks
F	used ebookers to book a last_minute flight for parents , was easy to use and neva had a single_issue at the airport or anything , just printed the e ticket and was off .
F	thanks
F	not even worth a 0 star in my opinion , placed an order with river_island on the monday to receive a message on the tuesday to say my order had been dispatched !
F	great i thought will have the items in time for the weekend .
F	wednesday_morning received a text_message " your order will be delivered today via hermes " my heart sunk as i have has issues in the pass with this company via new look and asos but thought id track the item and give them the benefit of the doubt .
F	wednesday_afternoon comes and goes , no parcel !!
F	so i was tracking my item all day and thought fair_enough they state they deliver until 0pm , so come 0 . 00pm when i track the order again the status had updated to " 00 . 00 courier to re - attempt "
F	now im sitting in the office with colleagues and no one tried to deliver that parcel , i even phoned river_island at the time to explain i was sat facing the window ( as we can see when cars and vans enter ) and no one tried to deliver anything , so where on earth were they with my order of over £_000 ?
F	?
F	so thursday comes i receive another txt message " your item will be delivered today " tracked my order again as you do !!
F	nothing all afternoon , phoned the customer_service team at river_island around 0 . 00pm to explain that we are in the office and no delivery has been made .
F	now do i sit around waiting for the same_thing as yesterday to happen or do i just cut my loses and go home !
F	no i wait in the office with the cleaners until 0pm still no delivery .
F	now this is a business address fair_enough they deliver up until 0pm but how many offices are open pass 0pm .
F	when i track the order again at home they update the status to attempted delivery 0 . 00pm .
F	it is now day 0 and i am still_waiting for my delivery , the company is pathetic , and its so sad to say unless im having items delivered home ( as im at work for most of my life it makes_sense to have items delivered here ) im going to have to avoid using online_retailers that use this company , they are so incompetent , they also make out to the retailer that they have attempted delivery when that is a blatant lie .
F	it is then hard to prove to the retailer that you are in the building at the time when they supposedly tried to deliver !!
F	thus meaning you could lose out on delivery costs being refunded !
F	!
F	useless company , avoid at all costs , if you do find your parcel has been dispatched with them dont expect too much !
F	!
F	i have recently_purchased a few eye shadow and blending brushes from crownbrush . co . uk and they are great , ive_seen mixed_reviews on theses brushes but for me they are great , really soft and for the price i really cant_complain and i will_defiantly be purchasing a few more .
F	also the service is great delivery came within 0 days .
F	the only con i would say is they need to update the delivery section on there site , so it is more accurate !
F	ive been in to poppy and zach so many_times now !
F	the kids love it .
F	having 0 children and 0 of them being twins its sometimes hard to please each child and even more so to find something to suit every budget !
F	the converse are my kids top choice in there at the moment as there are loads of choice in colour !
F	having twins that are so identical we colour code them ... red converse and blue converse .... my girls also love the choice !
F	thing is you go in for one thing ... and come out with so much more !
F	there is a little " kiddy " corner where the kids can chill and watch a dvd and play while you shop too !
F	... perfect for those little ones who dont always share mummy love of browsing for toooo long haha !
F	all i can finish with is i have children age 0 , 0 , 0 and 0 and all 0 of them love the place . perfect for presents birthdays and any other occasion !
F	p . s the free parking also gets a high 0 !
F	x
F	i dont know what courier you use ... im emailing mr ryan moore and as email but no response at all . i did call youre contact number but no one is available ... im waiting for the whole day for somebody to help but no help at all ...

F	hi recently_bought a horse from ireland and couldnt_believe the difference_between what hsbc said the exchange_rate was and what the bbc website said .
F	so i did some research on google and found fxcompared . com who recommended the fx_firm as the cheapest .
F	i put an equiry into the website and was called straight_away .
F	i have my money in ireland on the same day and it was about £_000 cheaper .
F	very fast service , very good rate and i highly_recommend them .
F	i ordered over the holiday period so wasn ' t expecting them too quickly but after a quick email i got a swift reply and they came the next_day .
F	good quality glasses at very good prices .
F	i will probably buy another pair later in the year .

F	warning : if you order then be aware you may never see your money again .
F	please , anyone who is in this situation who has ordered from these_guys and been through the frustrating proceedure to try and get your money back please report them to trading_standards and watchdog .
F	nearly two months later i still have not had a refund of the £_00 i paid for a meal which never turned_up .
F	i am so sick of trying to get my money back only to be met with ridiculous excuses .
F	i reported these_guys to watchdog as i was so sick of them and have given up trying to get my money back .
F	i had been using just_eat for a while and we usually used the same couple of restuarants .
F	this time we chose another one and my order was accepted and my money taken from my account .
F	it never turned_up .
F	i phoned the restaurant and hour and a half myself and they said no order for my address had been placed , just_eat said they would refund me but over 0 weeks_later i have still had no refund .
F	i will not be using them again .
F	i think it is wrong to have money taken from my account and expected to wait for weeks to get it back when nothing was even ordered .
F	now two months on i still have not had my money back .
F	be prepared to lose money .
F	these people are very dodgy .
F	i got my first set of music from sheetmusicdirect ( so i know it wasnt my mistake ) and ordered and paid for a second lot .
F	it never arrived so i contacted them and did not get any reply .
F	i would not recommend these_guys for your music if they can ' t be bothered to reply to customer emails .
F	great service from mazuma_mobile ,
F	rapid email responses and payments , notifications all the way through the system ,
F	thanks for being good
F	serenata_flowers add a little something extra to sending flowers to a loved one .
F	i was so happy with their service and the personalised and funny emails i received were a special touch that made me smile .
F	i would definately use them again :)
F	i sold my phone to this company and got payment within 0 days which came in handy .
F	i would sell again to mazumamobile .

F	jv carpentry outshone our expectations in the building of our alcove bookcase .
F	when jeff came over to quote we were impressed by his attention to detail , particularly in suggesting finishes that would tie in with other woodwork in the room .
F	it is obvious he knows his craft inside out and maintains high standards yet his prices are comparable with other quotes we received .
F	the company were in our flat building the bookcase within 00_hours of measuring up and they built it within a day while we were at work .
F	we are absolutely_delighted with the construction and paint finish and would thoroughly_recommend the company to anyone_looking for quality workmanship .
F	thank_you !
F	i find the site is easy to use , it has a very good , accurate search_function , every hostel seems to be on it , the reviews from other_travellers are helpful and the prices are good .
F	no_complaints here .
F	great service , item as_described , item arrived ingood time for my daughter to stand out from the crowd on her school space themed day , a very happy child , thanx guys x
F	i like to booking with ebookers because it make me friendly and easy .
F	i will keep continue to book with ebookers .
F	received an_email from wowcher advertising 0 * 0 holiday to madrid .
F	as it was my birthday last_week i thought that would be a great last_minute deal to use for me to then go away as a birthday treat with my best friend .
F	once i had purchased the wowcher it asks you to follow a link , fill in the form and someone will contact you .
F	when i was contacted to arrange dates , all the dates i mentioned were either unavailable , or will cost me additional fees , although the dates i stated were within the wowcher terms .
F	i told the travel company i cant understand_why i should pay more , all they came back with was they could fit me on a flight which was not any of the dates i wanted but i would also have to depart from luton and return to gatwick !
F	i told them i wanted to speak to wowcher and the next_day after buying the deal i sent wowcher an_email requesting a refund as this deal wasnt meeting its description .
F	in the meantime over the weekend i had 0 calls from the travel company telling_me if i dont book something i will lose my money .
F	they also spoke in a threatening manner towards my sister when i wasnt in to take a call from them .
F	i rang wowcher saturday after emailing again requesting a refund and told them all that had happened , but as the office was closed all i could do was leave a message with admin and they will pass my query on urgently .
F	i contacted_wowcher again monday ( yesterday ) lunchtime as i hadnt heard_anything , but again i was talking to admin and she said if i had spoken to someone saturday and he marked it as urgent i should receive a call back yesterday or today , if not i was advised to call again to then raise this with a supervisor !
F	i have heard_nothing , hence me writing this essay as it seems to be the only way to get an answer .

F	i had never spent a considerable_amount of money online on a product i had not seen in the flesh and was a bit_wary about it .
F	i had absolutely no need to worry .
F	the camera i received was everything i expected and more .
F	i got a great deal with the camera , a 00g memory_card , 0 year_warranty , a case and vouchers for free prints and canvases only 0 pounds more_than the price of the camera alone on amazon .
F	i chose free delivery , estimated in 0 working_days , i ordered it on thursday_evening and received it at work on monday_morning , i was fully charged and out snapping on my lunch_break .
F	i had no issues so no need to contact customer support .
F	although wary at first , i would thoroughly_recommend uk digital_cameras to anyone .
F	ordered the clarisonic plus after much searching on the net .
F	currentbody was the best price i could find with delivery .

F	i would like to mention that i had a chat with a very competent advisor named richard .
F	he knew everything i needed to know , and was quick to help me out and advise me on the best possible service for my needs .
F	i wish there were more people like him , who are competent and straight the point when good advice is needed promptly .
F	richard is an asset to parcel0go , and i do wish his abilities , strengths and positive contributions to this company are recognised .
F	richard is the type of individual that i would gladly recruit to work in my own company .
F	item came on time , postage was excellent , customer_service was super .
F	this is the worst phone network i ' ve ever been with .
F	over the past 00 months i have had the worst service including failure of three to keep their end on the contract , constant rude & unhelpful staff , and complaints that have been ' lost ' on their system with no record of the phone call .
F	i have now reached the end of my contract .
F	i called three a few weeks_ago and they confirmed that my contract_ends on jan 0st 0000 .
F	i was informed that my final direct_debit would be 00th_jan_0000 .
F	when i hung_up the call i received a text from three stating " you ' ve upgraded to essential internet sim at a cost of 0 . 00 a month ."
F	i did not agree to any upgrade of the phone .
F	on the 0nd of jan ( today ) i was debited the full £_00 from my account .
F	i have called again to confirm that i want my contract to end , no upgrade and confirmation of my final payment date .
F	after following the automated instructions it stated my contract end date is february 00th 0000 !!!!
F	where did they get this from ?!!!
F	i have not agreed nor signed anything !!!
F	after getting through to a staff_member i was told their systems are down and to call back in 0 hours .
F	i will be calling back in 0 hours to ensure they correct all of this and send me a letter in writing confirming my contract has ended .
F	i have contacted citizens_advice bureau .
F	if three continue to con me and create contracts i have not agreed to then i will be reporting them to ofcom and failing that , will take legal_action !
F	liars , cheats & thieves !!
F	!
F	excellent easy to use website , good price and speedey delivery .
F	more_than happy to use again
F	absolutely cracking company , was a little_bit_worried as £_000 for two_pairs of designer_glasses just seemed too good to be true !
F	there was an extra 00_%_off offer on the frames too so saved another £_00 on top as well .
F	first time using them and had arrived by saturday ordered on the monday !
F	thinned down , uva , scatch resistant too :).
F	absolutely_gorgeous pairs ( both scout thick rims ).
F	only problem is there a little_bit wide but i think thats just because i have a small head !
F	definitely going to be where i ' ll be ordering my glasses from now on !
F	very prompt service .
F	all items arrived within a short time , all in excellent condition .
F	would deal with again .
F	a +
F	so it ' s my husband and his best friends birthday .
F	his best mate chose a restaurant in chalk farm .
F	i searched lastminute . com for places in chalk farm .
F	the third on the list was a secret location .
F	i purchased due to the insinuation if location .
F	i later come to find that it is in greenwich !!!
F	i paid with the last bits if money i had ( we have 0 boys and just wanted one night away ).
F	they have outright refused to correct their misrepresentation and our misfortune .
F	our whole weekend is ruined and i feel_like our money has been stolen .
F	i like amazon , they always offer a great range of items ( sometimes more_than play . com ) and have always delivered and i ' ve been using them for years .
F	cant go_wrong .
F	nitrotek are great .
F	i loved the website and the fact they offer a help line whenever you need them for follow_up care and advice .
F	i received my expensive item within a few_days and i was chuffed to pieces with it as its an xmas_present for my partner .
F	really impressed and feel i will_definatley order from them again .
F	order no .
F	000000000 .
F	superfast delivery , excellent communication , items are tracked through the whole_process from leaving the warehouse to arriving at your door .
F	any_queries are dealt_with fairly and efficiently .
F	very polite and professional .
F	great items at affordable prices , perfect for resale .
F	i would like to say that the man who_owns this company , karl , prides himself on his customers being 000_% satisfied , any_issues , he will resolve personally ( not a service you receive with all companies that do as much business as this ) !
F	a pleasurable experience , i will_definately purchase from here again and would recommend to everyone !
F	had to contact them as account locked out .
F	immediately got through to catherine on the live_chat and my account was unlocked within a minute and i was able to continue processing orders .
F	fastest and most polite customer_service i have received in a long time .
F	after a few bad_experiences with online shopping i am always a little_wary but beauty_cow was recommended to me by a friend as i was looking to order ghd ' s for a birthday_present and wad looking for the best deal i could get at £_00 with free delivery that is exactly_what i got from beauty_cow obviously as they were for a present there was a deadline for delivery but , they turned_up within 0 days - plenty of time before the birthday meaning i wasnt stressed out waiting on delivery i will definetley be using beauty_cow again and also recommending them to my friends x
F	i left booking a trip for me and a dozen mates to the last_minute and hostel_bookers saved the day and had 00 beds available in a san_francisco hostel .
F	avoid this company at all costs !
F	!
F	i had been looking for a while for the right sofa and i thought i had found it at dfs brentford .
F	the salesman was very quick to say " yes madam , no problem " to all of my requests .
F	( at no point were we offered a site survey ) the sofa was due to be delivered in 0 weeks .
F	0 weeks_later i called dfs brentford to track our order , it would be delivered into the store in a few_days .
F	delivery was arranged for the following week between 0pm and 0pm .
F	knowing this we donated our old sofas to charity ready for our delivery the following_day .
F	after arranging for somebody to house sit for the delivery the sofas finally arrived at 0pm an_hour late !
F	and to our horror it didn ' t fit through our front_door - not impressed !!
F	the following_day my husband contacted the brentford store and was advised that 00_% of re attempts get in , so he rearranged delivery for the next date avaliable which was 0 days after the first attempt !
F	in the mean time my family of 0 had no sofas !
F	again i arranged for somebody to be home between 0pm and 0pm , we requested as late as possible .
F	the delivery arrived at 0 : 00 , luckily i had arranged for somebody to be at home early !
F	the delivery man took one look and said " no chance , but i will give it my best shot ", which to be fair to him he did .
F	again no fit !
F	disappointed is a serious understatement !
F	so my husband spoke to the brentford store and they arranged for us to meet james the manager the following evening , we arrived at the store to find out that james was not there !
F	we were advised that we could make the sofa into a 0 piece but it would cost an extra hundred_pounds and take another 0 weeks minimum to make it !!
F	a note was left for james to call us the next morning , but we heard_nothing !
F	so my husband called in the afternoon and finally spoke with james .
F	he said that he would arrange for a loan sofa to be with us by the weekend , which was essential as we had guests visiting .
F	i was then contacted by head_office and they said that the earliest delivery of the loan sofa was monday .
F	by now this is two_weeks without a sofa , and guests coming with nowhere to sit !
F	!
F	enough was enough so i went in to the brentford store to cancel my order to be told that i can only do this with james and he was busy .
F	i waited for over 00_minutes and nothing !
F	his new sales was clearly way more important !
F	so i left , i have a busy family life and run a business - i do not have time for a company who simply do not value their customers !!
F	i returned home to call head_office to find out the only way to cancel the order is in store !
F	!
F	i have never_experienced such appalling service in all of my life , and will be advising everybody i know to never ever use dfs !!!
F	!
F	i love boohoo :) whenever i need anything i come straight to boohoo and they exceed my expectations and i don ' t have to worry_about the cost .
F	i must_admit though the sizes are a bit small so go a size up if you are not sure .. all in all excellent place to pick_up some style .
F	oh and the customer_services is fantastic !
F	recently_purchased 0 pairs of climbing shoes .
F	they were both the wrong_size and had to both be exchanged for bigger sizes .
F	the order is always processed very quickly and delivery is just as quick .
F	returned smaller sizes to bananafingers thursday 00th_march and received the new sizes on monday 00th_march !
F	now that is good service !!!!
F	the staff is very helpful and friendly .
F	called to ask something about the climbings shoes i bought and the staff were very informative and the customers services is one of the best i have experienced in a very long time !
F	will_definitely use bananafingers again and again and again !!!
F	!
F	thank_you . fast service .
F	a lovely online store with lots of information on their products which i greatly_appreciated and they have yummy chocolates .
F	^^ great service and an easy to use website .
F	i definitely_recommend them :)
F	other than the awesome stuff they sell , these_guys go the extra_mile to make your purchase special .
F	the packaging was amazing and looked like it had been sent from ankh - morpork .
F	totally brilliant , i like supporting these_guys as much as i enjoy shopping with them :_d
F	i found this company to be far more resonably priced than anywhere_else so far .
F	my items were well_packaged and arrived very quickly .
F	i was surprised at how fast .
F	the site is easy to shop too , so a very pleasant shopping_experience .
F	don ' t be surprised if you end up with a rather full basket after intending to look for just one item ^^
F	will_definitely buy from them again .
F	they have a nice selection of stuff , it was easy to buy and pay and delivery was quck .
F	will_definitely shop with grindstore again .
F	i found the whole_process appalling , from being given incorrect_information initially , to being passed from person to person when i tried to make a complaint , to cancelling the whole order and receiving a telephone call 0 days after the cancelation informing_me of the delivery date .
F	there is a complete_lack of ownership , customer_service and product knowledge .
F	as a regular installer of the bathrooms the time wasted on this matter makes dealing_with my tub not viable in the future .
F	we decided to go to v_fest a couple of weeks_ago we looked online and double0 had the cheapest tickets amazing vaule and delivered a week b0 the festival 0 * service wood defo buy from double 0 again !

F	i have never sent flowers before so i have no comparison for this service but it completely exceeded my expectations !
F	right from recognition of order to the delivery of the flowers to my friend i received notification of the status of my order , both via text and e_- mail , which i found a very reassuring for a service that i have never used before .
F	although i never saw the final product my friend said that they were beautiful .
F	i am still_waiting to hear how yummy the chocolates are .
F	i use the next_day delivery service which was a complete bargain compared to the extortionate amount of money other_sites are charging !
F	i would definitely highly_recommend serenata and use again .
F	thank_you so much !
F	!
F	bought something in store and went back the next_day to return it .
F	the shop assistant refused to give me a refund because the item had just gone on sale .
F	i said i wasn ' t happy about this as it didn ' t say anywhere on the receipt or on the website that they don ' t refund sale items and i wasn ' t told when i bought it .
F	he said i could only have a gift_card so i just took it with the intention of complaining to customer_service at head_office .
F	the replies i got were unhelpful , stupid and from different people every time .
F	it started off well , with someone saying that i was entitled to a full cash refund back onto my card and the yasked for my receipt details , then it all went_downhill .
F	the next person said " i can see from the transaction that you paid with a gift_card so we can ' t refund you " - absolute_rubbish as i have proof i paid with a visa_debit .
F	i was then told " as you accepted the gift_card we can ' t refund you "...
F	if i hadn ' t accepted the gift_card they ' d probably now spout the bull that it ' s now gone past 00 days since the time of purchase .
F	i went back into the store and showed them the email i got that proved i was entitled to a proper refund .
F	it was a different shop assistant this time and she refused , was rude , and refused to tell me the name of the shop assistant that served me the first time .
F	tried_phoning numerous_times and they just never answer .
F	absolute morons and fraudulent company with crap quality clothes .
F	i won ' t ever be back .
F	avoid !
F	return transfer in mallorca didn ' t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
F	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
F	i think it ' s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don ' t sort things out though .
F	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
F	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
F	well 00 . 00 came and went .
F	got to 0 . 00 and we started panicking , tried to call the " emergency contact number " over 00 times and it just had an announcement in spanish on the other end .
F	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency number was just a mobile phone turned off .
F	it was like this all day .
F	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
F	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
F	customer_service has been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn ' t provided .

F	valentine ' s day present didn ' t arrive .
F	twitter account said it would definitely be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
F	well 0 . 00pm came and went and still no parcel .
F	the delivery office said the twitter account admin had no way of knowing this because they couldn ' t actually get hold of the driver , so they lied .
F	absolutely_useless .
F	you can ' t order anything online and feel_confident it will be delivered on time if the company use yodel as their couriers .
F	i have no_idea how they are still getting business .
F	i would rate this company higher then 0_stars if i could .
F	where to start , the lovely frames , the free home_trial or the super pricing .
F	the pricing can not be beat , two glasses for £_00 is just excellent compared to some of the silly high_street prices .
F	we completed an order for my husband after he found the two frames he loved from the free home_trial .
F	we both loved the fact that you can tailor the glasses separately so were able to buy him glasses for work and persriciption sunglasses on the same offer ( just paying for the extras ).
F	when the glasses were received they were excellent even came with glasses case too .
F	we have since performed two addition orders another of hubby , for spares ( he was gutted when he left his glasses in a pub in london ) and a pair of glasses and sunglasses for me .
F	for a supermarket that makes itself out to be the best in the country i have had a really poor experience with sainsburys from start , and i would say to finish but my ordeal is not over yet .
F	it started when i ordered some groceries online .
F	normally i use tesco but i thought i would give sainsburys a try .
F	i asked for them to deliver the products on a saturday_afternoon , and when they did the driver refused to give them to my husband .
F	my husband contacted me and told me and i went home to call sainsburys to tell them i was now in .
F	this was at 0pm .
F	at 0pm a representative from sainsburys called me back to inform me that the drivers had all gone home and i would now recieve my order on monday .
F	i said i didn ' t want it on monday .
F	the stuff for my sunday roast was on the van !
F	they then offered me a tuesday delivery and i said no , i wanted a refund .
F	they said ok and told me it would take between 0 - 00 days to reach my account .
F	0 weeks have passed and after numerous_calls and emails they have now asked me for my bank_statements to proove i have not had the refund .
F	not at all what i expected .
F	from the attitude of the woman that called me from the denton store through to their shirty emails , i am not at all impressed .
F	now i am waiting on word from them to say they have recieved my statements .
F	wish me luck .
F	as with many of the posts , i too was looking to purchase a samsung tv from currys after it went into sale .
F	well ... as always , too good to be true and their stock_levels were wrong and i was left without a tv .
F	online reliant direct came up with the same price for the same tv , and as i had nothing to loose , decided to order from them .
F	at first i was a little_dubious , as simon also called me to say the stock wasn ' t there and would offer me the brand_new 0000 model for a fraction more .
F	it sounded too good to be true , but as he was so friendly and gave no sales pressure , i felt reassured that it was the right thing to do .
F	never have i felt that i am ripping off a company for the deal they are giving me !!
F	!
F	two days before it was due to be delivered , simon called to confirm delivery time ( 0 :_00pm on saturday to be precise !
F	), and .... sure enough ..... the driver called on the sat morning at 00 : 00 to say he ' d be there in 00mins !!!
F	bang on the dot !!!
F	friendly driver .
F	brought it into the house and was happy to wait whilst we checked it .
F	i have one word left to say ...... faultless !
F	i was told about ditto by someone who had dealt_with them previously and was happy with the results .
F	a small but efficient , creative , friendly , down to earth yet professional , patient , flexible , modern team of designers , who worked with us every_step of the way from a scrawled initial concept to the finished_product ; in this case labels , catalogues and business_cards .
F	so much attention to detail and care went into our order as is obvious from the end_result .
F	if we wanted to change something minor in the design , it was never a problem for the team , and they also offered useful , relevant advice where appropriate .
F	our branding has undergone a total transformation thanks to ditto and business is all the better for it .
F	now we are another happy customer , and will be recommending ditto to anyone who needs to give their brand a makeover !
F	i honestly can ' t rate them highly_enough :_o )
F	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son ' s school assembly .
F	i needed it quickly so i chose next_day delivery .
F	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
F	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
F	anyway , my son came home from school eager to try the costume on before the assembly .
F	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big_mistake .
F	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
F	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i ' m still finding them .
F	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won ' t be seeing the light of day again .
F	a [ 0 - year - old ] crying shame !
F	quick delivery and very happy with the product
F	item arrived in perfect_condition , and postage was even promoted to 0st_class next_day delivery for free .
F	very good customer_service and excellent after service .
F	00 / 00
F	not satisfied at all as delivery was paid for 00 hour delivery and it turned_out to be 00_hours !
F	would recommend it to everyone .
F	great service , fast shipment .
F	i used funktion_events for booking my sisters_hen_do , after searching the internet for what seemed like weeks i came accross funktion , they had numerous deals available and were considerably_cheaper_than other_companies , not only were they cheaper but once i had received a quote from them i wasnt bombarded with emails and phone_calls pushing me to book with them .
F	the staff were extremely friendly and kept me in the loop throughout the booking stage , as i had to book for 00 women it made the process very easy and whenever i rang funktion it took them seconds to familiarise themselves with the hen_do that i was planning rather_than having to wait and speak to someone who had no_idea what i was talking_about .
F	i was extremely impressed as well as i had 0 pregnant ladies attending the hen_do and funktion advised me on only putting down a deposit and not booking them on the hen_do til the last_minute and as a result one of the pregnant ladies didn ' t end up attending , this saved her from losing any money , this is the standard of service you can come to expect from funktion_events , putting the customer first .
F	finally ( i know this is long ) the event itself was amazing all the girls had a fabulous time at the cocktail_making session ( everyone got very drunken which made it very cheap ) even those that couldnt drink ( staff were very accomodating to the expecting hen ) the food was delicious , served in a timely_manner both the accommodation and cocktail_making / 0 course_meal venue had obviously been chosen for the standard of service they offer because the quality was unbelievable for the price , the hotel was beautiful , staff were friendly and every_aspect of the hen_do had been extremely well_organised and excellent value for money .
F	sorry for the lenghly review but i would definately_reccommend funktion_events to anyone_looking to book a hen_do .
F	hostelbookers is a resource i find invaluable when planning trips .
F	it ' s always the first site i go to because the interface is intuitive and simple while still going one step further to intelligently suggest options i may not have thought of for planning my trip .
F	i recommend it highly and will keep_coming_back !
F	using nortlander for the first time was easy and very simple , communication was impeccable with fast response for all our needs .
F	all the accommodation and resources described previously to the trip were exactly_what was expected to the highest_standard and very good value for money .
F	minor organisational problems close to the time of the trip , but were soon explained and resolved .
F	i would definitely_recommend using nortlander and would 000_% return !
F	very good !!
F	!
F	not the best prices but the best choice .
F	some really hard to find gifts on here .
F	take a look .
F	best price i found on the hello kitty camcorder i wanted for my daughter .
F	ordered in plenty of time for christmas , but i didnt need to worry as i have already had it .
F	thanks so much !
F	this site was so helpful and easy to navigate .
F	it was a bunch cheaper_than booking through the actual site and i got to compare features of hostels to make_sure i chose the right one for me !
F	i have ordered cat_food from this company 0 - 0 times .
F	i find that many " mainland " uk companies charge ridiculous amounts of money to send things to northern_ireland which negates the benefits of shopping around online for a good deal .
F	in comparison this company charges a reasonable rate (£ 0 ) and the parcel arrived in good time by courier .
F	the prices of the cat_food were also competitive
F	before i switched my supplier to mdp , i thought garment printing was laborious and really quite tricky .
F	little did i know , that actually all i needed was to switch to mdp_supplies and i would realise just how simple they make it !
F	i mainly use hot flex and the results are simple fantastic .
F	i have had many a compliment from new customers about how easy to wash and care for garments are now that i am using this vinyl .
F	so easy to weed , and prints like a dream .
F	thank_you mdp_supplies for restoring my faith entirely in the garment printing business !
F	i recently done a excel master course with e_- careers , and i found it very helpful .
F	originally i booked it just to supplement my current job , but i learnt so much more .
F	the learning platform is simple and easy to use .
F	it is very interactive , and you can go as slow or fast as you want .
F	and can re - do course as you want .
F	i had reservations_about doing an online course because of the lack of personal interaction , but this took away all reservations .
F	would highly_recommend it .
F	ordered my shampoo and conditioner on the sunday and has arrived today .
F	great prices !
F	even got a 00_%_discount !!
F	will_defo be buying more from here !
F	!

F	bathroom to you are great value for money , the delivery service is very quick and the telephone service is great .
F	we have been using them for about 0 months now and have never been let_down once .
F	thanks :)
F	i ' m super excited to receive my product .
F	i will order from them again .
F	love the free perks too !
F	hostelbookers is super_quick and easy to use , if you ' re in a rush to book somewhere to stay then this is the place to go !
F	there i was , worrying_about finding a hostel for our stay in bangkok , worrying_about trundling through all of the hostels , images and reviews , but then i found hostelbookers !
F	it actually couldn ' t be easier to find somewhere that you want to stay : for the right price , the right rating and the right length of time !
F	i found the hostel which suited me best , registered and two minutes later i had booked 0 nights in what looks_like an amazing hostel .
F	simple , quick , and pain - free .
F	try it !
F	you ' d be crazy not to .
F	definitely .
F	i spoke to a few companies re life and critical illness and brantwood finance was by_far the best .
F	after going on their website for a quote ( the only company which offers this facility ) i got a phone call which was great as everything was explained to me so i knew_exactly_what my options where and got a policy which best suited my budget and circumstances .
F	brantwood finace were professional and friendly at all times , always calling back when they said they would .
F	i will_definitely be calling them again when my mortgage is up for review and would recommend their service to everyone .
F	thank_you brantwood finance .
F	order arrived 0 hours late after sitting in through the estimated_delivery time_slot .
F	when i got the order , the white folder i ordered was very dirty and the 0 packs of rexel mylar dividers i ordered ( at over £ 0 a pack ) were a cheap and flimsy imitation .
F	annoying as this order ( and the delivery costs ) were not cheap .
F	won ' t be using again .
F	i have used play - sc . com on more_than one_occasion now .
F	not only to they provide outstanding value but the ability to download the games purchased straight_away through the usual and official means is invaluable .
F	no having to wait for a delivery , no items damaged in the post .
F	play - sc has never let me down yet with regards to security or reliability .
F	i will_continue to use you service unfazed .
F	mazuma_mobile have hit the nail on the head with their mobile recylcing service .
F	the website was easy to use , the printable mailing pack was easy to follow , print out and use .
F	i mailed it on monday_morning and the money was in the account the following_day .
F	all in all a brilliant service !
F	the file you receive at the beginning of the course was easy to follow .
F	the tutor i had was extremely_helpful and offered help whenever i required it .
F	i would recommend the course and the company to anyone who asked .
F	they are very friendly .
F	not paying reservation fees is the best part about hostel_bookers .
F	it also has a good range of hostels , and i never had any_problems with the reservations .
F	i would recommend it to anyone .
F	i thought i would give this company a chance based on the mixed_reviews , but beware - i had an extremely bad_experience .
F	i waited two week for my item to arrive .
F	growing impatient , i contacted the company by email .
F	a lady from the dagenham branch then informed me they had been trying to contact me from the day after i had ordered to let me know there had been an issue with my order .
F	( i have no record of this but was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt .)
F	apparently , they had an ' issue with their internet ' meaning that some items they were advertising online had already been sold .
F	when i enquired_about a similar item available on their site , i was informed that this one had also already been sold .
F	i thought this was very unprofessional .
F	surely if you have a problem with your site you should make customers aware that items are not available !
F	to me , this borders on the fraudulent .
F	worst of all , although the lady started out seeming very accommodating , offering either a refund or replacement , this soon changed .
F	once i decided that a whole extra week was too long to wait for them to get a replacement and that i wanted a refund , she stopped_replying and no refund was issued .
F	i have had to put in a claim to paypal , and since there was no response escalate it to a dispute .
F	i am still_waiting on my refund , and am more confident paypal will sort it out than this inefficient company .
F	all in all i would advise_anyone to think very carefully before ordering from this company - the prices seem appealing but they are not worth the potential hassle .
F	accommodation
F	absolutely_shocking .
F	we emaield to confirm that we would be getting twin_rooms to which whoever she emailed confirmed this .
F	turns_out the hotel does not provide twin_rooms , only doubles .
F	standard of room very poor .
F	strip_show
F	dance lesson was late so we were late getting to strip_show , was not offered drink on arrival ( had to go to bar and ask ) missed all food and no photos after , ( strippers stayed for about 00_minutes afterwards ) and we were ushered out by doormen .
F	show was ok .
F	club venue
F	cant_fault tiger_tiger , brilliant place .
F	dance lessons
F	dance lessons were good fun , but instructor turned_up an_hour and a quarter late , we got to venue and it was as though no one knew who we were , asked if one of us was taking the class .
F	then we had to do all chasing with chillisauce , instructor and twist and pout .
F	knocked whole day back and made a horrible rush for getting ready for night .
F	dance filmed on instructors phone , and i have not received a copy of this yet .
F	city
F	had no guidance as to where to go first night and ended_up in really rough part of newcastle .
F	dance instructor said we should have been given better advice by chillisauce as we hated first nights bars and went home early .
F	i have absolutely no_idea what we have paid all that money for .
F	they organised us extremely badly and then left us to it .
F	i woud never ever recommend anyone use that company again .
F	sage 00
F	very good distance_learning courses - study sage on your own or with the help support online - has always been someone ready to help .
F	good value for money .
F	very good courses for busy people .
F	i really_enjoyed this course i would recommend everyone !!
F	!
F	karolina kolaszt
F	having worked with atom00 i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
F	a superb team with a vast_amount of online expertise .
F	product arrived quickly and exactly as i had hoped
F	what a great product !
F	the handi rack stores so easily in my car .
F	it doesn ' t take up much space in the boot and now i can get_rid of the chunky roof bars that took up much needed garage space .
F	i forgot to get travel_insurance and only remembered whilst in the cab to the airport .
F	the process was so simple i got a quote and booked my insurance on my mobile before i took off !
F	returned to a cuddly meerkat !
F	using the website was incredibly easy .
F	i just put in where i wanted to go and the dates i wanted and it came up with a list of hostels !
F	simply press the ' check prices ' button and it comes up with how much it will cost per_person per_night in my local currency .
F	i didn ' t even have to work out how much each person has to pay .
F	the deposit was a tiny amount , so if we have to cancel its not big deal .
F	it also let me know how much was left payable to the hostel on arrival in their local currency .
F	a very smooth and easy process and it took about five_minutes .
F	definitely a great and easy to use website .
F	such a fantastic idea - simple to use .
F	when moving home we had no_idea where to go for removals .
F	but compare my move made it easy to find reliable movers .
F	i found compare my move on twitter and the form on the website is easy to complete .
F	we had two companies call us in 00_hours .
F	lovely flowers arrived next_day and were wrapped beautifully , my mum was very happy
F	terrible service , flowers were nothing like the one ' s advertised .
F	i was embarrassed that my mum received such a terrible item for her 00th_birthday .
F	0000000 - i have been on and off the phone all day with customer_services , they have now said that they have to let ' s aside for me and think its ' positive ' i will get these in time .
F	what i want to know is , do you definitely have my tickets ?
F	when will they be sent ?
F	will they be send by courier ?
F	i don ' t want to have to pick them up from a pick_up point at the event in case anything goes_wrong .
F	i love cooking and eating healthily but have always faltered on snacks .
F	i ordered a graze box as it was free to see what it was like .
F	i am dairy free and the website allowed me to go through and ' bin ' all the dairy snacks , which is great .
F	four little snack punnets came in the graze box , all the perfect size for snacking either at home , out and about or at work .
F	people have mentioned the calories are high ..... yes they are , nuts and dried fruits are high in calories ( just because it ' s healthy doesn ' t mean there ' s no calorific content ), but so is a mars bar .
F	which is better for you ?
F	people also mention the portions are too small , but any bigger portion of nuts or dried fried would send the calorie content rocketing .
F	not having the option to dip into the packet again is fantastic for people with little will power !
F	i drink a fruit , veg , seed and spirulina smoothie early every morning , and one little punnet around 00 . 00am tides me over until lunchtime .
F	i have to say , i think the people who own this company have hit the nail on the head with the website , it ' s great to have the opportunity to have an input on the snacks ( bin , like , love , send soon ).
F	at £ 0 . 00 a box i think it ' s also good value .... averages out at 00p each per punnet .
F	i am so happy with graze that i now have one nibblebox and one lightbox delivered each week .
F	we don ' t usually shop in primark , and tend to favour slightly more_expensive high_street brands .
F	but was advised by a couple of friends to go and have a look in this one .
F	we went to this primark one evening ( 0th_june ) about an_hour before it shut and ended_up spending about £_000 .
F	although they were close to doors closing , the staff_member on the changing rooms upstairs couldn ' t do enough to help both of us .
F	the clothes i bought were better quality than i expected and at really low_prices .
F	we went for a meal afterwards and spent about 00_minutes talking_about the exceptional customer_service we received from the two girls on the tills downstairs ( we paid separately but put stuff in the same bag ).
F	they made an effort to make conversation with us , not just about the products but about things generally .
F	they were happy , smiling , and we came away completely_satisfied .
F	my partner , who is the store manager of a vey well_known brand said he would happily employ either of them if they behaved like that in an interview .
F	i wish we had found out their names , but didn ' t really think that far ahead at the time .
F	well_done primark !
F	i order make up from the boots website every 0 / 0 months , and either get it delivered to my apartment or to collect in store ( depending how much i ' ve spent ).
F	delivery always arrives to either destination within the desired time and products are always packaged well .
F	the only negative part of this process is having to part with my cash !
F	website easy to navigate , checkout_process simple .
F	got an_email to say my parcel was on its way , and it arrived well within the given time .
F	very happy with the products .
F	will_definitely order merchandise from here again .
F	i have received 0 or 0 parcels via yodel and they have never let me down .
F	polite , happy delivery drivers , who don ' t mind climbing up the stairs to get to our apartment .
F	the tracker service is always up to date and i always know when i can expect my parcel .
F	can ' t believe all the negative_reviews !
F	i must be very lucky .
F	ordered from here many_times , as well as having to return / exchange items and have never been unhappy with the service .
F	they have recently changed couriers ( to yodel i think ) and the delivery is super_quick .
F	i have received refunds in the time stated , and exchanges quickly .
F	the sizes on items vary , so it ' s a guessing game sometimes , but they are all of good quality .
F	office 000 offers a great service .
F	their prices are very good , the products are of excellent quality and they deliver on time .
F	what more could you want ?
F	after looking for a cold sterilising system , which aren ' t easily found anymore , i found this site was the cheapest by_far , delivery was extremely fast and arrived the next_day .
F	postage prices were fantastic and overall service was second to none !
F	i ' m very happy because i ordered this pillow .
F	i love it and now i sleeping very well !
F	excellent service and great value for money
F	i ' ve been using monkey products for just over 0 months now and i ' m very impressed with the quality and range available .
F	after years of using other more_expensive brands and being disappointed with the results or taste and texture of their protein_shakes i ' m_glad i ' ve finally found a protein_powder that mixes so well and tastes good too .
F	i use primal_00 at the moment but when i ' ve finished will be trying the x - blend after_reading the info .
F	i also use monkeys fish oils , cla , super d0 , pri multi and creatine and am very happy with all of them !
F	a quick mention to the team at monkey , very helpful , deliveries are quick and well_packaged and the website is packed full of info and easy to use and order from .
F	keep up the good work monkey !
F	really pleased with my order and delivery was very fast .
F	best price i could find and i knew i was ordering from a reputable company .
F	ordered a washing_machine online on wednesday_evening for delivery on saturday .
F	they called thursday to confirm all my details - very friendly operator .
F	he informed me i would be contacted the evening before my delivery date to confirm what 0 hour delivery slot i could expect .
F	i received an_automated call at about 0pm letting me know my appliance would be delivered between_0am and 0pm .
F	i then got a call at 0 . 00am to let me know they would be with me between 0 . 00am and 00 . 00am .
F	i paid £_00 for connection which the two very friendly delivery drivers completed within half an_hour .
F	very reasonable .
F	excellent delivery service and communication_throughout and also one of the cheapest retailers of our chosen product so thumbs_up all_round !
F	00_hours after i ordered an unlock code for a blackberry 0000 ( with new security software ) i received my email , entered the code and within 00 seconds was up and running on 00 ( was on orange ).
F	great service !
F	would recommend to anyone !!
F	!
F	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
F	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
F	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
F	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
F	i shall see what happens from here .
F	update
F	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
F	however i ' m still annoyed from before .
F	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
F	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
F	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer_service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn ' t exist .
F	it ' s an alright shop but isn ' t anything special .
F	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
F	they have some nice stuff because i ' ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
F	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
F	customer_service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
F	i haven ' t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven ' t seen anything online that i ' ve wanted to buy from them since .
F	i will shop at there stores from time to time but it just isn ' t really my favorite shop .
F	amazing ! really quick , quality packed , delivered too !
F	already enjoying my tan :) thank_you guys !
F	the best price i could find after surfing a lot in the internet as i knew already what i am looking for ; plus the delivery was super_fast :) made my day !
F	thanks again ,)
F	i have sold you 0 phones in the past_year , the last 0 being a friends .
F	this time i thought i would get quotes from other phone_recycling websites but you not only came up with the best deal but you are the only phone_recycling site that will pay you even if the phone is not working which myfriends phone was not .
F	thanks again and i will only ever use your site for phone_recycling .
F	also now you have added a bac payments system the payments are alot quicker it doesn ' t take more_than 0 working_days to go through the whole_process of selling a phone to you .
F	i recommend mazuma to any body who has a phone which the no_longer need or no_longer works , if they don ' t have internet access then i offer to do it for them .
F	really simple site to use .
F	plus points are that they have individual photos of the room your booking so you get a better idea of what to expect .
F	reviews are helpful but woul take them with a pinch of salt .
F	always a good place to check when your planning a budget holiday
F	i ' d definitely_recommend , the package we got was perfectly organised .
F	all elements were of a high_standard , everywhere was expecting us , so there were no_problems .
F	staff at chillisauce always very helpful .
F	very pleased with the service .
F	fast .
F	easy will_definitely use again
F	i visited litecraft oldham on 00nd october with the intention of buying a ceiling light .
F	after browsing the store for 0 minutes i was approached by a young_lady who offered me chocolates and a coffee .
F	i was extremly impressed with the service and her knowledge of their products and was helped quickly to find a suitable light .
F	i also found two table lamps that i was interested in but these where out of stock .
F	however i was told these could be ordered for me and sent to my house within 0 days .
F	my lights where delivered 0 days_later .
F	i can_honestly say i had no_problems with my experience at litecraft and have written to the company aknowledging there superb service and i will definitly be shopping here again in the future .
F	did not inform me that the product i had ordered was out of stock and that my order would not arrive until much later .
F	on their website it said my product was in stock !
F	kept my money for ten_days , and it was not until i called customer_services that they agreed to refund me .
F	rude response on the phone .
F	would not recommend just miniatures to anybody .
F	easy to order , fast delivery and good product .
F	have used the runners under my dining_table to protect the carpet and they work a treat .
F	would definately buy from this company again .
F	used e_- outdoor for the first time and found their service to be excellent .
F	the items arrived the day after i ordered them and the price was the best i had found on the net .
F	would definately_recommend .
F	flashbay have a wide_range of products to choose from which allowed us to select what we really needed , as well as modify it to our wishes .
F	the staff gave us an excellent service and the delivery was very quick .
F	ms elorna laudat was our contact person and she was always very helpful and answered our queries immediately .
F	i would definitely suggest flashbay , especially for those teams organizing conferences .
F	after i have read all previuos reviews about this company , i was shocked a bit . how people can be sure it is good , just because it is cheap and " site is easy to use "... absurd .
F	i had two claims on my policy since i ordered this insurance .
F	in both cases i faced an unprofessional , very slow , complicated team work .
F	i have been waiting for an engineer to come about 0 weeks .
F	then i been left with broken washing_machine for 0 more days , just because they were unable to get parts .
F	disapointed and very angry i ordered a parts by myselfe at indesit online shop and fixed lifters in minutes .
F	then i tried to explain to warranty shop group , i don ' t need their help anymore , because all is fixed by customer .
F	i never received a refund for the work they failed to do .
F	remember , you always get what you pay for , and surprisingly low price doesn ' t mean good service in this case .
F	i have cancelled this policy and going back to more_expensive , but reliable company .
F	it is 00 orders been placed with nature ' s best , since i found their shop online .
F	great quality products , which really works and helps , quick shipping - what a happy customer may need more ?!
F	well_done , nature ' s best !
F	i ordered my tyres online .
F	took my car in on the morning and was all done in half hour .
F	staff were friendly and helpful .
F	please do not make the mistake that i made ! i would not advise_anyone to switch to this provider .
F	my energy bill doubled in four weeks !
F	believe me this is no exaggeration . the amount i have been billed in these four weeks is a over a fifth of what i was quoted by first_utility in the estimate for the whole year and with my family is already very energy conscious .
F	do the maths , does that sound like a good deal to you ?
F	i actually feel stupid for listening to these people i am counting down the days to switch back to my previous_supplier .
F	if you want to pay money to a company that is impossible to communicate with these_jokers would be perfect .
F	if you manage to get through to an operator in the first place i ' d be amazed and if they were of any use to you when you did i ' d be doubly amazed .
F	send them an_email .
F	they won ' t respond .
F	ring them and they cut you off .
F	ring them again and tell them they ' ve cut you off , they promise that they ' ll ring you back .
F	they won ' t ring you back .
F	ring them and tell them they didn ' t ring you back .
F	there ' s no one to speak to you .
F	i wondered why i ' d never_heard of this company when it sounded so good .
F	i wish i never had .
F	i ordered a pair of beaver velocity fins and received them a week after i made the order which was fine , until i realised they had sent me one fin of one size and the other fin of a completely_different size .
F	when i rang up to ask what had happened they said it was beavers mistake and if i sent them back they would send me out a new pair .
F	i called them to make_sure they had received the fins i returned and they said they would have the new fins back to me in a week .
F	a week and a half went by and no word so i called them again and they said they just got in a shipment so i would have them in 0 days .
F	0 days went by and nothing so i called once again and they again said that a shipment had just come in but i desperately_needed them by the weekend as i was going on holiday and had been waiting 0 weeks for them .
F	they ensured me that they would be sending them out the next_day and would post them next_day delivery so i would get them on friday .
F	i called on thursday to make_sure they had sent them out and this is when they finally decide to tell me that they ' re out of stock .
F	i ' m sure the product would have been fine but the terrible service diverswarehouse has provided by keeping me completely out of the loop concerning my order has convinced me to never buy from this company again despite using the company before .
F	i encourage you to do the same and take your custom elsewhere .
F	i have used envirofone every time i have needed to sell my old handsets .
F	the process is very easy and quick and i find they always offer competitive_prices .
F	would be happy to recommend and use again and again
F	having laser really has been life changing .
F	its the small things you notice which really make you smile , like seeing the leaves on the trees in absolute clarity , it ' s just wonderful !
F	i ordered t in the park tickets and was nervous_about getting them in_advance of the festival but they arrived within 0 days of ordering - i got a text_message to confirm they were on their way and they were cheaper_than any other site i could find , including the official site which was sold out !
F	brilliant - i would use double0 again .
F	amy duke
F	have only just recently started shopping through tesco . com they are very quick to resolve any_problems and the quality of goods and the friendly drivers is so much_better_than other home delivery of other supermarkets
F	extremely_unhappy with service recieved when moving home spent at_least 0 hours on the telephone trying to sort out a problem that was caused by them .
F	once contract is up i will be moving to another supplier
F	extremely unsatisfied with the customer_services i recieved when the toilet basin they supplied was faulty still_waiting for replacement after reporting fault 0 weeks_ago will not be using again .
F	no communication from them even_though several emails were sent .
F	i purchased a stroller from another retailer ( online_retailer ) that turned_out to be faulty and collapsed with my daughter in it and they were reluctant to refund me , they then sent me another of the same stroller .
F	this one did exactly the same .
F	i work in retail and if something is faulty and its partly due to design fault they should have a product re - call however they did not want to do that !
F	they also said if they didnt think it was that faulty id have to pay and i had to pay for them to collect and replace !
F	after a number of very upsett emails and rude replies i am now waiting to recieve my refund !
F	unfortunately due to their actions i was reluctant to buy again online however i work and im unable to get around to look for a new stroller .
F	therefore i gave ' pramworld ' a chance and im glad i did !
F	i ordered on the friday and right away recieved emails telling_me when to expect my new stroller .
F	emails very different from the other retailer , very polite and helpful as i did not understand the first email it was explained and i didnt feel as though they thought i was daft !
F	pushchair is due today between the hours of 0pm and 0pm ( very specific and helps as i can go out and do without sitting in like a wolly !)
F	and hopefully ill have better look with this stroller otherwise i give up !
F	my daughter is now very weary of a buggy as the last two collapsed with her in them !
F	so i need something sturdy !
F	hopefully this is it !
F	thankyou again great service kept_informed all though the process !!
F	!
F	over all very good fast strait to the door no_messing_about thanks jo
F	it was really easy to do , the freepost_bag turned_up very fast , posted it and received emails keeping me up to date then my money came through v fast !
F	thanks !
F	really easy to use and really fast payment ( i posted my phone and the money was in my account the next_day ) i am very happy would definitely use mazuma again and recommend to my friends .
F	i also like that this is a charity organisation to help people in the developing world .
F	good job .
F	love love love truffle_shuffle !
F	i ordered the coca cola christmas jumper and im soooo pleased with it !
F	quality is amazing !
F	i ordered it on the friday and it arrived the very next_day !
F	:) thank_you !
F	we had a fantastic experience with viagogo !
F	we got our tickets as soon as they said we would and they kept us updated every_step of the way !
F	the iow festival was amazing and im so glad we got to go !
F	!
F	understandably we were nervous_about buying tickets through viagogo as we had never used them before but we will_definitely but using it again .
F	printing . com always provide competitive quotes paired with outstanding service .
F	mazuma has a very simple , easy to use website that makes it great for trading in your old phone .
F	the delivery bag and money / vouchers are sent out really quickly and you get an_email_confirming each_step of the way so you know whats_going on with your phone .
F	for all the phones we have traded in so far mazuma have offered the highest price compared to the other recycling websites and we also really like the option of recieving the money in argos_vouchers - you also get a bit extra if you opt for vouchers instead of cash .
F	overall they offer a very very effective fast service without any complaints !
F	alpharooms its a great website ive used it goin on my last 0 holidays and will be using it on any future holidays .
F	great prices and good honest revies allow you to choose the best accomodation for you .
F	really easy to use website , good lay_out , clear photos of sweets and hampers etc .
F	massive_selection of sweets available , may have to pop down the co - op to satisfy my sweet craving until my order arrives !
F	definitely be using them the next time i upgrade !
F	!
F	i have ordered wheels and made mistake , after confirming the return will cost £_00 i have been charged £_000 for not accepted goods .
F	now they wont communicate at all .
F	i have bought bed which creaks .
F	they don ' t care about my disrupted sleep and discomfort after 0 months of trying to get somewhere they now no_longer reply .
F	if you thinking of buying from them then think again as the quality of their furniture is poor .
F	i have been battling over bed i have purchased from them over 0 months now , their bed creaks at every move so i have been facing disrupted sleep over this whole time and they don ' t care .
F	i had to go trough so many hoops with a complain and after 0 visits to the shop i was told i have to send an_email , not even a phone number to raise my complain .
F	after a lot more time and a lot more emails eventually someone came to see the bed , established that the creaking comes from the frame all over the place and had been explained 0 broken slut which is not causing any creaking has been broken by walking on the bed trying to stop the creaking noises i receive an_email that the creaking is due to the damage i have caused !!
F	this company is disgraceful and does not value their customers .
F	please stay_away from this company as you only in for a disappointment .
F	this site has many great products which many of them i continue to use year after year .
F	given plenty of chances to this company , but it just fails us every time and caused us loss of business
F	we are very happy that we found a reliable supplier which can deliver when we need .
F	great range of products at competitive_prices .
F	delivery is reliable and always arrives within 0 days but usually next_day .
F	what is really great is the text reminder and re - order service - very efficient .
F	wouldn ' t buy my dog_food anywhere_else now .
F	i was having a nightmare with an order .
F	sarah dealt_with my issue in an extremely fast and efficient way - thank_you !
F	ordered a dog harness and didn ' t expect it to arrive for a few_days as i chose free delivery .
F	it arrived much more quickly than i expected less_than a week_later , which was great as it arrived the same day as my dog so was able to take him out in the car straight_away .
F	easy ordering and efficient service will_definitely use the site again .
F	bought a htc phone after seeing unlocked mobiles on the htc website .
F	delivered as advertised .
F	was provided a tracking_number upon dispatch .
F	i have already_recommended them to friends .
F	very happy with my dealings with oakfurnitureland .
F	i placed my order 0 weeks_ago for some solid_oak bedroom_furniture .
F	i must_admit i was a bit_worried_about ordering nearly £ 0000 worth of furniture on line without seeing it first .
F	my mind was put at rest when i visited the website as it has many videos of the products and clearly has stores in certain parts of the uk , however not close enough to me to visit , not to worry , i knew by ordering with my credit_card i would be covered in the event of a problem .
F	i needent have worried , furniture arrived on time as arranged , great communicaton , and i was over the moon with the quality .
F	it has that lovely brand_new smell , and there was no assembly other than a couple of bolts for the top and bottom of the robe .
F	the drivers and the assistant could not have been kinder , and were very profesional .
F	this company is clearly going places .
F	debs
F	supplement_warehouse and everything i need for my fitness needs in one simple website .
F	their selection is unbelievable and their quickness and getting products shipped is incomparable to any other site i ' ve ordered from !
F	i had a dreadful experience with optical_express .
F	went for a consultation and was told i am suitable for ( the most expensive ) laser_eye_surgery they have .
F	agreed to do it and paid full cost in_advance .
F	on the day of the procedure , took time off work , went to the clinic only to have a chat with the surgeon who said he wanted additional confirmation from my gp and a specialist that i am suitable due to my other health issues ( which on the consultation day i was assured would not cause a problem ).
F	very frustrated i was turned away and am now waiting for 0 months to see a specialist to confirm i can go_ahead with the procedure .
F	when i asked for my money back i was told i will have it within 0 days .
F	nobody got in touch with me after 0 days , so i rang the company and reminded them i want my money back .
F	someone took my card_details and said it will take up to 00 days to return my approx .
F	£ 0 , 000 to my account .
F	since when does it take so long to carry out an online transaction ??
F	it took me 0 minutes to send them my money in the first place .
F	after a month , no contact from optical_express and no money , i kept ringing them and they promised to call me back which they never did .
F	finally i got hold of someone from the their financial department who said there was no record of my bank_details , so he took them again and told me to wait some more .
F	i don ’ t think i will hear back from them again and will have to keep ringing and ringing to get my money back for a procedure that i was told i could have and was turned away .
F	when they wanted me to become their patient they didn ’ t mysteriously lose my details and kept ringing twice a day to remind to pay etc .
F	but when it comes to paying me back after having mucked me about for so long , they go quiet .. is this a scam ?
F	?
F	i am never coming_back to this joke of a company !!
F	why waste all that money on advertising if they treat customers who are willing to pay like this ??
F	it ’_s a joke ..
F	i suggest to everyone choosing a different company to avoid disappointment and appalling customer_service .
F	i ordered a mixer from gear0music before_christmas and they kept us updated of when it would arrive etc and it was dead on time .
F	i then ordered a microphone and shock mount and it was due to arrive today and it did .
F	easy and secure to pay and excellent choice of couriers .
F	uk mail were outstanding and their tracking_system works_perfectly ,
F	i ' d definitely reccommend this company to anyone_wanting music equipment like that .
F	my fiancé and i went to marlows looking for our_wedding_bands and were helped by trish .
F	the selection was vast and trish helped_us find the perfect rings at a brilliant price and due to the large_amount amount of stock carried , they were there for us to take away on that day .
F	we are very pleased with the service we received and our beautiful wedding_rings .
F	we would happily_recommend to anyone .
F	i had to send back a bathroom cabinet back to the retailer urgently in order to comply with the 0 day distance_selling regulations for unwanted items .
F	the booking process was nice and simple however after i got the confirmation and printed off all the paperwork ready for it to be collected , i got an_email the next_day stating that the collection had been cancelled as they had " problems delivering to the post code before ".
F	this was unexpected - i would expect a parcel company to be able to deliver to any postcode !
F	i was not impressed .
F	so i booked with [_external reference_] instead - 0_stars for them , 0_stars for you !
F	!
F	gr0 deals .
F	good products . cheap delivery , even get free delivery offers best every time
F	one on every high_street most realible odds .
F	easy to place bets
F	best deals no matter what always got some new scheme or deal
F	brilliant service , products great nearly always the cheapest
F	i placed an order with pet planet and now i am unable to access website says web_page is taking to long to respond .
F	this is not a problem with my internet as have no problem with anything_else . so now am unsure if order was accepted or dispatched or even how long its going to take to come . as i can access webpage i cant even get contact details .
F	alfie and mictchel helped use move from our 0 bed to 0 bed house and could not do enough to help ... nothing was too much_trouble .
F	they made an already stressful day a bit less_stressful !
F	can ' t complain .
F	good all_round service .
F	out of the several other booking sights i attempted to navigate , hostelbookers are by_far the best .
F	they made it very straight_forward and easy to access hostel information and the layout of the site was very user_friendly .... even if your a weary computer user like myself !
F	the confirmation_email was quick in response with detailed directions attached to my chosen destination , would definitely_recommend !
F	we climed kilimanjaro for our_honeymoon and it was the most amazing experience and private_kilimanjaro helped to make it special for us .
F	from booking right through to getting home after the climb the staff were fantastic .
F	the office staff helped_us before we went by dealing_with our booking in an effiencient way and giving us tips and advice aswell as answering any_questions we had about the climb or kit that we would need .
F	whilst in tanzania the private_kilimanjaro staff were amazing , they met us at the airport and took us to our hotel where we were briefed then picked_up from the following_day .
F	whilst on the mountain our lead guides were fab , helping_us in any way they could and tailoring the climb to our needs and abilities - and helping_us when feeling the effects of altitude sickness .
F	they were friendly and chatted to us like friends throughout the climb .
F	the food was excellent - and far better_than anything we could have expected to be cooked on a mountain .
F	we were very well fed with 0 hot meals a day and snacks too aswell as fresh boiled water everyday to help with our climb .
F	the equipment that we were provided with was excellent .
F	we managed to make it to the summit , the last few hours were hard as we had mild altitude sickness but our guides helped_us deal with it in a way which meant we could still reach the top .
F	all in all it was a fantastic trip and i would not hesitate to use private_kilimanjaro again for a future adventure .
F	i absolutely love this product , it is timeless and feels classy and elegant .
F	it has swarovski crystals and they look amazing in the sun .
F	i researched the price and watches first was the cheapest one i found , i expected something to be compromise with the price being so cheap but i was very impressed with the personal_touch from watches 0st .
F	i had ordered 0 of the same product , one for me and one as a gift , and i received a call from a very pleasant man who gently enquired if i ' d had problems ordering online as he wanted to make me aware that i ' d ordered 0 .
F	excellent service - not many companies would have checked .
F	in fact it wasn ' t a mistake ordering 0 , but it could well have been and i was very grateful of the phonecall to make_sure .
F	my order was despatched immediately and reached me the following working day .
F	i am often the moaning customer that gets irritated with bad service , expects reasonable service , so i thought it only fair to review this excellent service too - well_done and thank_you to watches 0st - thumbs_up !!
F	:)
F	i ' ve used interparcel on many occasions and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend .
F	their rates are as low as you can get , but the service is second to none .
F	i usually use ups for my uk deliveries as i ' ve never had a late parcel and the driver is super friendly !
F	if you are looking to send a parcel then you won ' t find a better company than interparcel !
F	tutor is great , fantastic course , modules are well set out and the directive is easily understood .
F	couldnt be_happier with the course or the tutor support :) looking into doing another course with ncc home learning .
F	we booked to stay at a lovely hotel in paris back in march_0000 for our_honeymoon .
F	our booking was processed quickly and we were really pleased to have somewhere lovely to stay for such a reasonable_price .
F	after realising there was no check in or out time given on our booking , i called to confirm with their call_center abroad .
F	after a quick call , and receiving the info i needed , i was therefore shocked to receive an e_- mail stating that our booking was cancelled .
F	the adviser that we had spoken to had cancelled our booking even_though there was no request to do so .
F	the money had been removed from our account
F	as a result , the next week or so was spent desperately trying to resolve the problem .
F	their resolution involved rebooking the hotel room and paying again whilst i waited for my refund .
F	unfortunately i wasn ' t made of money and couldn ' t afford to do that .
F	it was then a waiting game to see whether we could rebook the rooms for the same price once the refund came through .
F	the problem was compounded by the fact that everything else had been subsequently been booked !
F	i was promised numerous_calls back from the team at hotels . com but never received them .
F	to say the experience was stressful was an_understatement and was not how we anticipated the beginning of honeymoon to be .
F	i ' d not recommend this company to anyone and certainly won ' t be using them in future .
F	i first visited the freedom clinic in leeds in 0000 after suffering from terrible sciatica and neck problems .
F	after an initial assessment , i began treatment also immediately and was given a structured treatment plan .
F	i can_honestly say that after the first treatment , my pain significantly improved .
F	i also realised that the pain and stiffness that i ' d been putting up with for years that had been unnecessary .
F	not only do i now very rarely have issues with my back and my neck , but when it does flair up , i ' ve been given exercises to help combat this .
F	i still see my chiropractor rachael , every 0 weeks , but this is to ensure everything is still stable .
F	i cannot recommend the team at freedom highly_enough & have referred many friends and family_members .
F	sehr freundliches personal
F	einfache bedienung des online - portals

F	the memory came very quickly in safe safe packaging to protect the memory , and their find my computer helped_me identify what memory i would need .
F	overall very very happy .
F	super helpful customer_service will_definitely use again thanks for your help !
F	lured in by bargain prices and promises of next_day delivery .
F	the details of my farcical transaction with camerabox are boundless .
F	they took money from my account after they cancelled my order .
F	their packages are impossible to trace .
F	their couriers do not leave a note if you are not in .
F	they delibaretly kept me misinformed .
F	their customer_services helpline is simpley another money eating machine , used to stall and sidetrack customers , manned by incredibley rude " representatives ".
F	they do not care about their customers .
F	they want them to be confused so that they can take_advantage of the situation .
F	they used a different courier service to the one stated on their webpage ( they do not directly inform you of the courier service you are paying for , nor a tracking_number ) and gave them an incorrect address .
F	this was for a redelivery .
F	i have been putting up with this nonsense for weeks , i still do not have the camera i ordered and have paid for in full .
F	i do not know if it will be in working condition if i ever do receive it , and they may never refund their customers as i have learnt from this site .
F	they are under suspicion of fraud .
F	they already have my bank_details , do not give them yours .
F	in reference to a post titled " no refund given since before_christmas ":
F	i also asked for the managers name which was ***."
F	i have been emailing "***" and when i spoke with "***" today and asked him where their company was based ( oxfordshire apparently ) he criticized me for asking irrelevant questions .
F	i ' m giving them till friday , then i would be quite happy to unite with and any other dissatisfied customers to help you and the rest of us get our money back .
F	sarah
F	received my last order (# 000000000 ) rather fast , the product quality is super , also everything was packed really well .
F	had some problem with my older order , which was solved really quickly , which never happened to me in other stores , usually other stores postpone as much as possible if solve anything at all , therefor i ' m really content with healthdesigns !!
F	!
F	i think paypal is a brilliant idea .
F	i ' ve used it as a seller ( ebay ) and a buyer . i love the protection , and if ever a dispute has been raised over payment i ' ve found paypal to be prompt and helpful in resolving the issue .
F	the fees are , at times , a bit high , but it ' s cheaper , quicker and more secure than any other bank .
F	i really cannot recommend this site enough .
F	i was superbly pleased to receive my item the day after i ordered it , despite selecting free shipping .
F	also , they always have the new_releases ready to pre_- order before anyone_else ( or so it seems ) and they have a great selection in stock .
F	so chuffed !
F	trouble free and painless , what more can i say
F	we were very impressed with the speedy and professional service .
F	the range of products is impressive and details are very clear .
F	will_defiantly be visiting the site again .
F	i ' ve been looking for gruffalo trunki under the £_00 pricemark for ages and this was cheaper_than most other_retailers ' prices for the regular designs .
F	very pleased .
F	really easy to get in touch if there are any_queries .
F	the garage was courteous when it called to say my car had failed ( on something i was expecting ) and gave me a clear and concise breakdown of costs , incl vat and labour , before proceeding .
F	collected my car from work as soon as i arrived and had it back to me by the time i requested .
F	really happy .
F	it ' s great to be able to get quality chocolate on the high_street that hasn ' t been pumped full of vegetable fat to improve the texture ( google it if you don ' t know who i ' m talking_about ).
F	the customer_service at the stores is always excellent and often they have samples for you to try when you visit .
F	i ' ve never bought anything from hotel chocolat that i haven ' t enjoyed thoroughly and it ' s well worth the price .
F	i have nothing good to say about vistaprint .
F	even disregarding their scandal with signing customers up to a £ 0 -£ 00 a month subscription service without their consent ( conveniently hiding the opt out box very well ) their product quality are shipping times are appalling .
F	can ' t fault their customer_service though .
F	fantastic company and site .
F	others have tried to copy the idea after justeat ' s success and failed completely .
F	makes ordering the occasional takeaway very convenient .
F	i just wish more local companies would sign_up !
F	last time i used the tesco entertainment it was really bad - unclear and usually down from too much traffic .
F	their new entertainment site is so much_better and while tries too hard to look sleek and modern the actual reliability and functionality is greatly improved .
F	tesco prices are always fantastic too .
F	my mother lives a few_hundred miles_away so iflorist ' s delivery service seemed like a great idea - a combo of flowers , chocolates and cards with guaranteed delivery by mothers_day .
F	i received my order confirmation with a delivery date of saturday ... saturday rolled around with no phonecall from my mum .
F	fair_enough i thought , they ' ll get there tomorrow .
F	called my mum yesterday and she was disappointed that she hadn ' t received anything , and i felt_like a terrible daughter .
F	i have since contacted iflorist via_email , through their support centre , twitter and facebook .
F	they have ignored every message i have sent , and have even gone so far as deleting my a facebook message i posted requesting a response .
F	absolutely_terrible company that i will not be going anywhere_near again .
F	i expect a refund immediately , and an_apology , though with the level of customer_service i ' ve seen here i imagine i ' ll be fighting for it .
F	oh , and if you want a laugh , have a look at all the photos of dead flowers people have received on twitter - it ' s hilarious !
F	maybe it ' s a blessing in disguise that nothing was delivered .
F	i had 0 parcels under the ' prime ' service with amazon and for some reason this week they are all coming via hdnl .
F	they were due to be delivered on monday and according to the amazon website ( which i can only assume comes from information that hdnl supply them ) my parcels were delivered at 0000 00 dec !
F	however on checking the hdnl website they went out for delivery on 00 dec was then returned and went back out again on the 00 dec and no more information after that .
F	i contacted amazon who said that looking through the records that it says there was no access to the property !
F	i am on a military base that has 00hr manning at the main guard room , this company has delivered ( slowly ) to the address in the past ( unfortunately the ou use them too ) and they are aware they should arrive before 0pm for the main post room and carry identification just like all the other delivery companies that have no_problems with delivering packages .
F	i even called them once to hold a package so that i could collect it myself which they assured me they had put aside when i got to the depot ( it ’_s a 00 minute drive away ) the parcel was nowhere to be seen and so they called the driver who said he had just delivered it to me and updated there system saying it was signed for by me which was a lie as i was stood in the depot !
F	the website was easy to use and the price offered was good didnt have to worry_about charger or original_packaging .
F	amazing company , ordered a orbit g0 system got 0 - 0 week wait in delivery and it came within 0 week !
F	the staff are also so helpful !
F	i love amazon , it just perfect for shopping
F	“ hi guys ,
F	i ' d just like to say my furniture arrived safe and sound today and i love it !
F	thanks for a speedy service , and you never know , i might be back in touch for a kitchen table and chairs in a couple of months !
F	kind_regards
F	sandy ”
F	i wished to cancel and re - book my order with a different courier .
F	richard_mileham helped_me on the facebook chat page and was very helpful .
F	he did all the work for me and made it very easy .
F	thanks a lot richard !
F	excellent customer_services .
F	i went into sunglass hut in town and tried on some sunglasses , turns_out the ones i loved were a pair of chanel avaitors costing £_000 .
F	i decided to go home and search the internet for a better price .
F	i found a trusted company who sold them for £_000 and decided to order them , however they were out of stock and would take 0 weeks for delivery , so i contiuned my search , i came_across sunglasses_shop who were selling them for £_000 but i noticed the did a price_match service .
F	i called them and spoke to chloe in customer_services who asked me to send details and they would confirm if they were able to match the price .
F	i called them back and they confirmed they could do them at the same price as the other company at £_000 with free delievery .
F	chloe checked the stock for me and said there was only one pair left ... determined to get this pair i asked her to put the order through asap after a few emails the order was in and payment was made .
F	this was on monday_afternoon and i was advised i would receive them on wednesday .
F	to my supprise tuesday_morning ups turned_up with my glasses !
F	!
F	everything was perfect !
F	i dont normally_write_reviews but the level of customer_service i recieved was outstanding and chloe was really helpfull making_sure i got these glasses !
F	the delievery was extreamly quick !
F	i cant rate this company high enough .
F	if your reading this and deciding if you should buy from them , then i hope ive helped you make your desicion !
F	thanks again chloe , i will_definitely buy from sunglassesshop . co . uk again !
F	!
F	had o0 00 month_contract , no_problems but did find insurance expensive & waste of time to be honest .
F	(£ 0 . 00 pm for samsung tocco ultra ) when phone did break i was told although it was 00 months old it would be covered for repair so didn ' t have to go through insurance .
F	other than that , always had good signal & no other complaints
F	always have everything needed .
F	love the fact you can input receipt details on internet and check you got the best price or they ' ll refund the difference .
F	simple & cheap what more do you want ?
F	?
F	completed all required info on website .
F	sent special delivery as 0 phones worth £_000 , cost £ 0 to send but worth it .
F	sent on monday , received tuesday_morning .
F	bank_transfer tuesday_afternoon .
F	so simple , so quick !!
F	!
F	used a online discount_voucher having checked out products online prior , found the whole_process really easy and delivery was quick , now using my items and they are good quality with no issues .
F	ive been using vegan shake products due to an intolerance to dairy .
F	after months of elimination and a cleanse it was time to try things again .
F	this is the first whey i have ordered , i decided to try the flavour of the month and i wasn ' t disappointed , it tastes just like a bounty bar , what a treat !
F	mixes well in my shaker and tastes lovely with almond milk .
F	small problem with the website crashing prior to payment , quick call to check and then order placed , arrived swiftly , good sturdy packaging , great prices and quality products .
F	found optimal print online by a quick engine search for wedding thank_you cards , had lots of options and templates to chose from ( far more_than many online_retailers ).
F	really simple and easy_navigation tools to complete our own design .
F	when checking out we realised there was a half price offer which meant we could afford to upgrade to better quality paper .
F	like the fact the postcards came with good quality envelopes included in the price .
F	fast , sturdy postage .
F	great website , easy to use and understand .
F	delivery service was very poor on my recent_purchase , disappointing .
F	will be visiting vet - medic again , professional service and very efficient delivery too .
F	i found the price after looking around unbeatable too .
F	thankyou !
F	before finding out about just_eat , i was doing the usual thing of rooting around drawers to find one of the million leaflets that clutter up the house every day , then going through the rigmarole of repeating myself over the phone whilst trying to understand what the takeaway were saying down the other end .
F	but no more !
F	just_eat is simple to use from the start , lists all the takeaways that deliver to your area and most_importantly , gives you a heads up about which are the best and tastiest with their star_rating_system , as voted for by our fellow hungry takeaway hunters !
F	once you ' ve found a takeaway , its a fast checkout and no worrying_about having no change or tipping the delivery driver with the pay by card option , although you can still pay the old_fashioned way if you like !
F	a super service , a tasty no hassle way to get your takeaway .
F	just_eat !
F	google can find almost every question i am looking for !
F	sometimes i have a problem trying to find some questions but overall its the best search_engine there is !
F	its perfect for finding information and images of what i want , i always use google if i need to find something :)
F	this is the first and only place where i listen to the latest music and videos , its easy to search for videos and play them and it doesn ' t cause me any_problems what so ever i ' m impressed with this website !
F	iv never had any trouble with it :)
F	i ' m disappointed with the amount it costs to deliver something from the super drug website .
F	its cheaper for me to go and buy it direct from the store instead of forking_out for the delivery cost as well as the cost of the products .
F	i prefer to go to the store and purchase my items as its a lot cheaper .
F	if hmv can do free delivery in the u . k then so can everyone_else .
F	i love it !
F	it ' s cheap and has all the essentials needed for every occasion and this is the first shop i shop in and actually buy loads of stuff !
F	its so cheap so my money goes a long way and im happy with my buys , its the cheapest shop to buy clothes from that i know of !
F	:)
F	hmv delivery service is brilliant and trusting plus it has free delivery in the u . k which is excellent !
F	i never have to leave my house if i want to buy entertainment again :) hmv is cheap and reliable and i always get my orders on time and they tell me all the details i need to know .
F	thank_you for a brilliant service :) x
F	i ' ll admit .
F	i did have reservations_about the service .
F	friends were full of advice ( unsolicited , and no experience of actually using mazuma ), but i decided to take a chance .
F	i applied online , got my pack through the post the next_day , i packaged my phone following the instructions and sent it off special delivery .
F	i was expecting to get emails the next_day giving me a " revised_offer " once they has my phone as a " ransom " , but nope .
F	i got an_email_saying it has been received , another saying processing and then another , the same day saying order accepted and that my chosen method of payment ( argos_voucher ) would be with me shortly .
F	it arrived at 00am the next morning .
F	i had no_problems using the voucher at all , and now my old phone is now a shiny_new games console for my son .
F	literally couldn ' t be more pleased with the service from beginning to end , and have already_recommended mazuma to friends and family .
F	when i received the car from stoneacre hull it came with the log book , mot certificate ( that stoneacre had done ) and spare key .
F	no manual or service history or proper key .
F	the car never had a description and so stoneacre ' couldnt see what the problem was ' ( their words !)
F	and that they could possibly ' 0 finger discount ' a manual if another car like mine came in .
F	shocking .
F	also the bumper they said would be repaired ( slight dint and scuff ) before being brought to me has simply been resprayed ... dint and bumps still evident .
F	again , stoneacre couldnt see what my issue was !
F	i have been in touch with trading_standards and , stoneacre head_office and also complained to barclays ( stoneacre got me a loan through them ).
F	000_% of all my calls to stoneacre have never been returned !!!!!
F	the only time i received a call was when head_office told me to ring them as they wanted to sort the problem out ( after barclays had been in touch with them !)
F	and the guy i had to speak to was busy and then rang back .
F	when he did call back he tried to fob me off by saying he would get me another spare key ...
F	i dont want another spare key i already have one !
F	he then claimed to know nothing about the manual and bumper .
F	i have since been told a key has been ordered , they have a manual for me to and will take my car in to sort the bumper out when i go to collect them .
F	this was a few weeks_ago , i have called stoneacre many_times and no one will speak to me , one guy who was supposed to chase up the key order only spoke to me when i refused to give my name ( after calling 0 times !)
F	and then knew nothing , i had to tell him how to do his job by asking him to speak to the parts department !
F	he was useless and i spoke to the parts department myself ... who said there was no record of an order and to speak to the sales manager .
F	i have tried to call him 0 times today , every time i was fobbed_off and no call back .
F	since the nights have got lighter i have noticed another major problem , swirl marks alll over my car !!!!
F	a very poor polishing job , i have never seen anything like it !
F	as my car is white it is diffcult to see in low light .
F	also noticed scratches to the inside of windscreen .
F	the list just seems to be growing and i feel im getting no sort of customer_service whatsoever from stoneacre .
F	i have seen that someone tried to sort this through barclays but to no_avail , may need to go to financial_ombudsman .
F	i just want it all sorting , its been nearly 0 months now !
F	i would never recommend this company to anyone , not even my worts enemy !
F	if i didnt have other things to take my mind off this horrendous situation i would just cry as its so frustrating !!!
F	!
F	i have used pet_supermarket a couple of times now and its the cheapest place online to buy my special cat_food and with free delivery .
F	brilliant , thank_you very much
F	i was looking for a pair of teva sandals and found them on the taunton_leisure website for just £_00 . 00 , £_00 cheaper then any where else on the internet !!
F	i ordered them , payed with paypal and they were delivered the very next_day !!
F	unbelieveable good service , i will_definately use again for buying my outdoor equipment .
F	many_thanks

F	i tracked my order at 00 . 00 with royal_mail and was informed by them that it had not yet been received by mazuma .
F	an_hour later i received an_email off mazuma informing_me that my phone had arrived and been processed .
F	a couple of hours_later i received a second email informing_me that the money would be in my account by midnight , so as soon as i arrived home i checked my balance and sure enough my money was in .
F	it took less_than half a day from them receiving my phone to me having the money in bank .
F	absoultely incredible service .
F	i will be recomending them to anyone who will listen !
F	my first experience with this company has been absolutely_stunning !
F	their prices are incredible & within just a few hours of placing my order , it had been shipped and i was provided with tracking_information .
F	in the end everything had arrived at my door in less_than 00_hours of placing my order .
F	i couldn ' t be_happier !
F	not only that , but complete_aquatics kept me up to date with emails to let me know as soon as my order had been processed and shipped .
F	this gave me great peace of mind , as i knew what was going on with my order .
F	rather_than being left in the dark , as with some other_companies .
F	i will_definitely be shopping with complete_aquatics in the future !
F	very quick to despatch the free delivery envelope & also to transfer the money .
F	i liked that i could track the exact progress of everything as well .
F	i am a big superdry fan and have brought many items for myself and others online and in store in the past .
F	my partner had been going on about the windcheeter jacket for months so i decided to buy him one for christmas to match mine .
F	after trying the item on and to his disappointment the jacket did not sit right so we decided to return it .
F	i was shocked to find that your policy_states that returns are not free and we could not return to any store for a full_refund !
F	after talking to the lady at the post_office she advised me that the normal recorded_delivery would not cover the value of the jacket so i had to send it special delivery !
F	this is an outrage as that cost me nearly £_00 !
F	!
F	my question to yourselves is why do you not provide the facility to return the items free of charge or in store to your loyal_customers ?
F	and upon talking to one if your representatives they informed me that the return would be free if the item was faulty ?
F	so i , as an honest customer am being scrutinised for being honest and doing the right thing !
F	why should it be one rule for one and one for another ?
F	this whole incident had left me feeling very disappointed in this company and will be cautious_about returning to you as a customer .
F	is there anything that can be done to resolve this issue ?
F	ordered quickly and easily using paypal .
F	as well as being the cheapest place to buy what i was looking for they had amazing service with email_updates_throughout .
F	couldn ' t recommend highly_enough .
F	i sent my phone by special delivery on tuesday , arrived with them around 00 :_00am after which i received an_email telling_me it had arrived .
F	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating the phone had been processed .
F	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating payment had been made directly into my account .
F	i then checked my account balance and sure enough the money was there .
F	not the top price quoted but i had heard terrible things about the company that did quote the top price .
F	well worth going with mazuma , the price they quoted was the price they paid .
F	no replies to email , no answering the phone , possibly the worst customer_service i have ever_experienced .
F	i ordered some clothes and after_reading reviews online , 0 days after i placed the order i emailed them asking them how long the standard delivery would take and they sent it express delivery so i got with within 0 - 0 days , i was very happy .
F	however only one of the items were in a plastic_bag , the rest just loose , the jeans i recieved were a different shade of pink to the picture on the website , the denim shirt had a yellow stain on the back and the two tops i ordered were not a flattering fit .
F	i kept one plain white vest and have been hoping to have my ' return request ' processed , however this has not happened and i am not waiting on the company to reply , meanwhile i ' m stuck with faulty items and my money tied up in the company .
F	it ' s been at_least 0 weeks no and no return !
F	no response !
F	absolutely_terrible service , i ' m very unhappy .
F	after_reading the reviews i gave them the benefit of the doubt , but i have been very disappointed and unfortunatly , after this , won ' t be ording with select again .
F	always very helpful !
F	i have had a few problems , stock issues on the website , so they don ' t have the right stock i ordered and some faulty items .
F	but ark have always been very amenable and lets me know asap , sorted it out and any returns have been processed quickly and my postage refunded .
F	i think everything is very reasonably_priced the clothing is good quality !
F	one of my favourite shops online , for dresses to vintage jumpers , they ' re perfect !
F	i ordered an outfit for a work do , not only did it not arrive , i was told i ' d have to wait 00 days , for a refund , only they couldn ' t get the dates correct so i ' ll be expected to wait two_weeks for my refund , and i won ' t be getting my postage and packing back .
F	so i ' ve spent a lot of money for only stress and the support_team has been less_than helpful .
F	i am beginning to get the feeling i will never get my money back , i won ' t be using this service again .
F	i always use hostel_bookers whenever i book accommodation for my holidays and i have never had a bad_experience .
F	the accommodation is always exactly as_described when i arrive and the customer reviews are the best way to find out what you need to know about each place before you arrive .
F	its great to have a booking engine i trust and know will always deliver !
F	i always use them for all vitamins as they deliver free very quick and the products are high_quality and good value for money
F	value for money in these hard times and free delivery
F	i have always found my shopping_experience enjoyable and the staff are very helpful .
F	the goods were delivered before the date given and have never had problems returning goods .
F	i bought an automatic watering system from garden0less and it got delivered really quickly .
F	the items were exactly as_described .
F	when i had a question about the products and phoned customer_services , the man on he phone was very helpful .
F	i used partyrama to order some decorations for our stall for children in need .
F	i chose this website , because they had a wide_choice .
F	i received the products ahead of the promised time and they were just as_described , so i thought their service was excellent .
F	the items arrived in promised time and acceptable condition .
F	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
F	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn ' t type the special character in the middle of my name .
F	and without preview we didn ' t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too_late to order new cards .
F	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
F	also , from the website it wasn ' t clear , that there will be no difference_between the thank_you and save the date cards .
F	as the evening invitation had evening invitation on the front , we wanted to use save the date cards to invite guests to our afternoon drinks reception celebrating our_wedding abroad .
F	but as the save the date ' s were the same as thank_you ' s we had add decorations to make them presentable .
F	so overall we were disappointed with the order .
F	we ordered our_wedding invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
F	i spoke to katie via the parcel0go . com live help chat online to gather more information .
F	the service was quick to respond and was free instead of calling which cost 00p from a bt landline .
F	would use this service again .
F	hostelbookers provided us with many options and locations for hostels in dublin .
F	as dublin is our first of many stops on our first - ever european backpacking_trip , we will_continue to use hostelbookers the whole way through if the service is the same in different cities / countries .
F	we are keeping a blog and social_media record about our experience and will be referring to hostelbookers throughout .
F	we found the perfect hostel in the heart of trinity college and dublin itself .
F	we were very excited to see that hostelbookers listed events that the times hostel provides .
F	actually , the special pub_crawl on thursday_night was a pretty big selling point for us ;)
F	i was a little hasty when ordering flowers online for my mum for mothers_day , however i was very pleased with the email_updates_throughout my order and dispatch process , and my mum was over the moon with the results !
F	especially the cute little instruction cards that came with the flowers .
F	thankyou very much
F	we are regular users of hostel_bookers and always find the site simple .
F	to use .
F	it is very busy quick to make bookings and i find the reviews from other_travellers very useful .
F	ordered a personalised phone cover from tescos site !
F	and as i said i ordered a phone cover not a sticker !!
F	i was very disappointed when i received the envelope i expected a hard phone cover not a bit of paper !
F	i am outraged at the amount i paid for a bit of paper !
F	will never be ordering anything from tesco again
F	poor service - they refused to assemble our bed
F	we placed our order online for a sofa and bed and when the two guys from the brentford warehouse turned_up , they were rude , by refusing to remove their shoes before walking on our brand_new cream coloured carpet .
F	they brought the sofa in and put it together .
F	then they bought the bed in and said there you go all done .
F	i said " what about the bed ?"
F	they said " we don ' t assemble beds , if we did we ' d be here for two hours ".
F	i said no , it says on your contract you must assemble all beds .
F	they said " no , that ' s just what the sales people do to make the sale .
F	we don ' t know how to assemble beds ".
F	so my wife and i checked the website and then called dfs online help .
F	they confirmed that we were indeed supposed to have the bed assembled .
F	after confirming this will them they said " ok we ' ll give it a try but we don ' t usually do it ".
F	they finally_agreed to it and put it together in ten_minutes and said " there you go that one was an easy one ".
F	they tried to get me to sign without looking at the bed and sofa and when i looked at the bed they hadn ' t even screwed the frame to the headboard properly - i could see it was loose .
F	it became_clear that all the while they had been attempting to pull a fast one .
F	after they left , we put the mattress over the bed_frame and the bed_frame immediately fell_apart .
F	we are currently waiting for someone to come and fix it .
F	really disappointing service
F	i am a returning customer of healthexpress . co . uk and the service is always impeccable : parcels arrive on time and the attention provided by the customer_service is very personalised and efficient .
F	i saw a design i liked and searched online for the best deal .
F	i came_across blaze advertising the marc jacobs sunglasses for a very competitive price .
F	i was impressed because postage was approx $ 0 opposed to the $_00 - $_00 postage fee that other_sites charge .
F	i ordered my sunglasses and was pleasantly impressed when they arrived all the was from the uk to south australia within 00 days .
F	i am very happy with my purchase and will be sure to be a returning customer to blaze sunglasses !
F	even_though the case i ordered wasn ' t the one i needed bop_dj were very accommodating in picking_up the case and providing a full_refund .
F	they were very pleasant and easy to get on touch with .
F	i would recommend using this company
F	shopping at poppy and zach is a lovely experience .
F	the shop has a boutique feel with beautiful products which have been displayed excellently .
F	unlike some shops which have this quality , the staff are extremely friendly and attentive without making the customer feel pressured .
F	there is a good range of products on offer and is a much needed and welcome_addition to leighton buzzard .
F	i ordered two children ' s bow ties and they arrived the next_day and are wonderful products .
F	very impressed with the site & service .
F	will use again .
F	this shizz works
F	no_problems on the site , found what i was looking for ( taken straight there by google actually ), got free next_day delivery and arrived next_day - cannot_fault at all !
F	well_done
F	this is the 0nd time i have used double0tickets !!
F	great service , would definitely use again !
F	this was my first time buying from feelgoodcontacts . com .
F	i ordered freshlook illuminate on saturday midnight and received them on monday .
F	very happy with the product - £ 0 . 00 per box , free first_class delivery .
F	you can ' t complain_about that !
F	the website is user_friendly - everything is so clearly_laid_out .
F	this is the first time i ordered from tshirtstudio and i must_say , i am one happy customer :) i ordered a personalised photo keyring as a valentine gift .
F	the quality of the photo is absolutely amazing !
F	the delivery came within 0 days using the saver delivery .
F	i would definitely order from tshirtstudio again in future :_d
F	thank_you tshirtstudio !
F	!
F	initial delivery quick but once i had a quality issue i am 0 months on and still not resolved !!
F	failed deliveries , collections and inconsistant communication
F	greaf time , chilli_sauce couldn ' t have made things run smoother and great value for money .
F	is very good sit
F	lots of useful_information and reviews
F	i am very happy with my purchase !
F	the website was easy to navigate , delivery was free and risk free payment via_paypal .
F	package was delivered very quickly ( 0nd_class ) and discreetly packed .
F	will buy again .
F	thankyou .
F	i was supposed to be flying to germany this morning , to see my family over christmas .
F	due to weather_conditions , i checked the airport site for planned departures last_night and to my surprise , my flight didn ' t come up .
F	then i called the airport but neither they could find my flight number on their records .
F	panicked , i called the airline and found out , that they don ' t even fly on sundays !
F	after an_hour on the phones , upset and tired , i realized , that this is a scam andhad to choose between two options : not see my family and spend christmas on my own , or find another last_minute flight .
F	well , i chose the second option and spend £_000 on top of my original price .
F	for the sake of £_00 i could have been at home now , now i have spend nearly £_000 to get there !
F	very sad and feeling violated , i can ' t believe this people can live with themselves !
F	please be aware of this scam , i fly very often and this looked like a genuine low_cost website , receiving confirmation_email and text_message .
F	be_careful !
F	i have shopped at divine_trash for many years now lucy has always been very friendly and helpful , she even scoured for a specific belt for mefor months a few_years back thankyou :))))) from the start divine_trash has been amazing to shop or just browse .
F	lots of delishious goodies for all tastes , i have had great advice from the staff and been made to feel welcome and as a special shopper !
F	its an exquisit experiance . well planned and quality location .
F	one of the best owners , lucy seriously kicks ass .
F	everything she touches turns to gold she has an eye for style & perfect items !
F	great place to get the gifts that make you the cool family_member or friend around holidays and birthdays .
F	seriously you need to visit divine_trash clothing to experiance it yourself < 0 love love love
F	thanks to emily whom chatted with my partner today , and sorted out the massive confusion of where my 0 parsells where as nobody else could she found out where they were and explained why they where in the wrong place and sorted out that my parcel will be either re directed back to me or delivered to the right address asap .
F	valued my mobile , had a great valuation .
F	the freepost_envelope was here straight_away !
F	sent my mobile to mazuma and had the cheque straight_away too !!
F	excellent !
F	thanks mazuma !
F	bought my new blue panasonic tz00 camera on friday and got it on monday_afternoon .
F	it was my first online purchase for digital_cameras so i was very cautious_about choosing a right dealer .
F	since i required them to deliver to my work address they asked for a prove of my billing_address , but no more hussle .
F	very pleased with my camera , geniue and bargain price !
F	plus there have been problems about the stock of these cameras , i originally ordered one from another online dealer but they said they were out of stock until end of this month / beginning of next month , so i cancelled that order and am now very happy that i got hold of one so soon with a much lower_price !
F	received a £_00 voucher in the post from tesco , worth the saving ;)
F	ive used this store before without any_problems , always quick to deliver and respond to any_problems .
F	this time i thought i ' d test out the pay by cash facility at techdna .
F	ordered an n0 vision router on 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00am and checked out with pay by cash .
F	it gave me a receipt to print out and take to a paypoint outlet .
F	paid it and by the time i got home had received an_email_saying the payment was received ( 00 :_00am ).
F	item arrived 0 days_later .
F	well impressed .
F	will use again .
F	oh my word , what can i say - the villa was outstanding !
F	we went to villa eleana at aphrodite hills for my friend ' s wedding , and it was amazing .
F	they were so helpful from choosing what villa , what extras to have in the bride to be ' s wedding package , things to help keep our 0 year_old entertained etc , to where to go for day trips , meals out , help with car_rental etc .
F	i would highly_recommend them again , and the bride says that james_villas really took the ' stress ' out of healing to organise a wedding abroad and making it a perfect day .
F	quite simply , they know what they ' re good at , and my word they do it well .
F	thank_you for a wonderful holiday !
F	amazing photos at good prices with grey customer ssrvice
F	0lbs of whey_protein for $_00 !
F	amazing !!!
F	works great and tastes fantastic , thank_you so much !
F	following a family bereavement i needed to return to the us for a close family_member ' s funeral and to be with my family .
F	i purchased my tickets online and recieved a confirmation_email and the funds were taken from my account that evening .
F	however , on arriving at the airport i was told that my flights had been cancelled by opodo !
F	at no point did opodo make contact to let me know .
F	the virgin_atlantic desk staff were very helpful and contacted opodo on my behalf , but it took us 00_mins just to get through to someone that could help !
F	we then found that due to an error on opodo ' s part , the money was never transferred to virgin_atlantic .
F	after a very distressing hour or so of waiting they were able to sort out my tickets with about 00_mins to spare .
F	i can only classify this as gross incompetence by opodo , a site which my husband has used and trusted since 0000 , and feel both disappointed and let_down that a travel_agent would make this sort of mistake .
F	there was also a significant chance that because of opodo ’_s error , i would have missed the funeral , something which could not be undone .
F	my suggestion - take your business elsewhere !
F	i posted my phone ( special delivery ) on the saturday and by monday lunch time , i received an_email to say that the money had been transfered into my bank_account .
F	i got the full_amount i was quoted on line .
F	i ' m a very satisfied customer and would highly_recommend mazuma !
F	!
F	after trawling_through loads of websites to find a suitable trampoline for my 0 year_old , i came_across this company .
F	when i called their sales line , the lady gave game some great advice and helped_me choose the right one for my little girl .
F	they were very friendly and helpful and the item was very reasonably_priced and arrived the next_day .
F	i now have a very happy , bouncing toddler !
F	!
F	would deffo_use them again in the future
F	i was very pleased when i found the uke that i love at a much cheaper price than on other music sites .
F	i was a little_worried at first as i read these reviews .
F	when i checked out i specified a delivery day , that day came around i received an_email_saying that it would be delivered the following_day .
F	as i had purchased this item as a christmas_gift i started to panic a little !
F	i have to say they sent me 0 further emails .. one saying the item was ready and one saying it was dispatched and as promised i received it the next_day .
F	fantastic uke ... beautiful in fact it also came with aquila strings which pleasantly_surprised me as they are the by_far the best and it did not state that on the item description !!
F	so in regards to recommending the company yes i would , i am very pleased with the instrument and very satisfied with their communication .
F	product arrived very quickly and my emails were responded to promptly .
F	ive been with vodafone for over 00 years now .
F	the family package is a god send as i dont need to worry_about my son having credit and i can talk to my boyfriend who is 000_miles_away without_worrying_about using minutes and credit .
F	i also add a freedom pack every month which are excellent value for money .
F	the signal is always excellent and have used customer_services twice and both_times have had a very helpful and productive service .
F	ordered an icetoolz chainwheel bolt tool and was very impressed with the speed of delivery .
F	the item i ordered was of high_quality and was packed well and sent out very quickly .
F	will_definately be shopping here again .
F	quality products and quality service .
F	ordered for the first time from boohoo and veiled items quickly and they were all good quality for money .
F	will be ordering again !
F	its been the first time i ' ve bought tickets from double0 and initially i was a litlle nervous .
F	i bought the tickets as a christmas_present , i found the website easy to use .
F	a couple of months later i received a phone call from double 0 informing_me they now had the tickets available and would be posting them to me and wanted to confirm my mailing address .
F	tickets arrived_safely the next_day !!
F	!
F	they had even better prices for the same hostels .
F	definitely using this site in the future !
F	beauty_cow is on of the best sites ive ordered from soo fast .
F	came within i think a day or two and that was standard post .
F	impressed .
F	also all the products are lussh and well worth the prices .
F	soo cheap .
F	i do lovee beauty_cow .
F	keep up the good work :)
F	i couldn ' t believe_how cheap supplementwarehouse . com ' s prices are compared to other stores .
F	even with shipping it was still less_than what i would pay to go to places like gnc or vitaminshoppe !
F	we received excellent service from jack walton , from our initial query and quote up until we received our items .
F	he communicated the progress of our order so we knew what was happening .
F	very impressed .
F	thank_you .
F	my experience with protectmybubble was fine until i needed to make a claim .
F	the claim was a long process and getting a response was not quick considering we are in the age of advanced technology .
F	i then asked a query which meant that my claim could not be processed until i had received an answer .
F	i am still_awaiting the answer and can ' t yet claim .
F	i have sent another email reminding them i am awaiting an answer .
F	i may consider cancelling my insurance , especially as i received my renewal today and it is not a good price considering my phone is a year older and i am being charged the same price ... if i had known it would be this difficult to make a claim i would not have joined protect my bubble .
F	added to on 00 / 00 / 00 , funny how after writing this review i got lots of help , followed advice given and now it ' s disappeared again , and i still have a broken phone !
F	updated on 00 / 00 / 00 : after emailing the company several more times and getting no reply , including when i asked how i go about cancelling , i have just emailed them and asked them to cancel my policy .
F	i am beginning to think this is the way that they make their money , they insure your phone , when you make a claim they don ' t respond so you get sick and tired for waiting and cancel your contract .
F	they therefore have had a whole years money out of me for nothing .
F	the only other solution is perhaps they have gone_bust and that ' s is why they are not replying to emails ?
F	i will certainly not be recommending this insurance company to anyone .
F	this has been a very disapoiting and unsatisfactory experience .
F	updated on 00th_october_0000 .
F	as expected i got a reply from the cancellation department saying they had cancelled my contract less_than 00_hours after asking them too .
F	do not insure with this company they do not fulfill their obligations and won ' t get back to you when it comes to them paying out .
F	avoid !
F	eflorist are a company i would recommend .
F	the ordering_process is simple and effective .
F	there were no_problems using this site to place an order unlike a very well_known florist .
F	an_email to confirm the order was sent , which was good as it put my mind at rest , knowing that the order was registered , again , unlike a very well_known florist .
F	the flowers were beauitful and it was a smooth_transaction .
F	the discount was much_appreciated and the fact that there is another discount for my next order is great .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting a smooth , simple , trustworthy and effective florists and i will use them again when i next need to send flowers .
F	an_email / text confirming the flowers have been successfully delivered would be even better .
F	gameseek provided quick service and kept me updated about my order throughout the process .
F	would definitely_recommend !
F	i can ' t believe_how much money i have saved buying my spices and herbs from you !
F	everything came packed really well and exactly as i expected .
F	fast delivery , what more could i ask for :-)
F	posted out my phone , and the money was in my account lunch time the next_day , first_class service !
F	all went_smoothly and i was over the moon with how much i got and it was paid straight into my bank , now that ' s what i call efficient .
F	thanks mazuma x
F	customer_service started off amazing !
F	needed to cancel an order called them up he said it would be cancelled and refunded straight_away .
F	received an_email to confirm it .. so far so good ..
F	however
F	now i am £_000 down because the refund was never given , if i call them up they tell me it has been refunded to get in touch with my bank so i did ..
F	still no sign of a refund 00 days_later ..
F	disappointed !
F	!
F	approved ghd sellers , yet much cheaper_than anywhere_else ( i did extensive_research !).
F	i ordered the straighteners on sunday , opting for the free delivery , and they arrived on the tuesday_morning !
F	i would definitely recomment this company .
F	thanks beautycow !
F	i ` ve ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 and i still didn ` t get my item .
F	today is 00 / 00 /_0000 , and i have no feedback regarding where the product is .
F	i ` ve already sent a lot of messages , but nobody answered me !
F	just bought my car_insurance from its0women .
F	saved me over £_000 would highly_recommend .
F	website was really easy to use .
F	found everything i needed and arrived pretty quickly .
F	items were great quality .
F	overall really pleased
F	i came_across linda at holidays_please by complete accident !
F	i thought i had contacted the company who i had booked my honeymoon through as they had provided good service , however i am pleased i got hold of the wrong company .
F	i wanted to book with a company that could give me great service , sound_advice and good rates , linda at holidays_please provided all of this and more .
F	we were considering a few options and linda listened to what we wanted and found us the best rates .
F	we went back and forth a number of times with a number of routes before finding our ideal trip .
F	i also benchmarked prices i could get by booking direct with travel companies online , thinking that linda would struggle to match or come close to the deals i could achieve direct , but i am pleased to say i was wrong and via their industry contacts they could outbeat the prices i was being offerred .
F	i am always willing to pay a bit extra for outstanding service but linda was able to offer both outstanding service and competitive_prices .
F	i will_definitely be contacting linda again for further holiday advice before making direct bookings myself .
F	i have never dealt_with a company who provides next_day delivery for free !
F	i ' m so impressed with them i never knew people like this existed !
F	i ' m 000_% satisfied with their service and couldn ' t have asked for more !
F	plus even better the jacket looks absolutely fab !
F	i ' d advise_anyone and everyone to get their country gear from this place and i will most definitely be using them again .
F	they ' re so good i ' m actually shocked !
F	v . happy customer !
F	the price is good .
F	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide_evidence to show you are not a fraud .
F	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
F	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway ... am i no_longer suspicious then ?
F	i understand the need to dig out frauds , but needing to provide_evidence after purchase is ridiculous and needs to be made more clear .
F	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
F	i have bought a few items from here and every thing was excellently priced , awesome quality and really fast delievery .
F	never had a problem .
F	i will_deffo buy from here in the future :-)
F	after trying the gevey card , this service is the best !!
F	less_than 00 hour and i can use my iphone with a new carrier !
F	ive used hostelbookers now numerous_times in many different_countries and always found them amazing .
F	the website it easy to use and im yet to find anywhere_else cheaper .
F	its always my first point of call :)
F	andy came he was very proffesional and quick would use again
F	ordered my prints straight from my phone and had them delivered to the door within a few_days .
F	the prints are excellent quality , better_than i had expected them to be as some phone pictures can be bad quality when printed .
F	would definitely use again for prints and i will be recommending them to anyone_else looking prints
F	when things go well asos are great but if you have problems - wrong items or returns they are a nightmare .
F	they state returns will be dealt_with in 00_hours so when mine hadn ' t been dealt_with in 0 days of then receiving it ( you can check this on the collectplus tracking website so i have proof it got there at that time ) i emailed them they said they don ' t have it wait another week !
F	an_absolute_joke when there ' s proof .
F	this isn ' t a one off either 0 of my recent orders have had issues .
F	i suppose i was daft to keep ordering from them but i ' ve learnt my lesson now and i ' d won ' t be using them again they ' ve had enough chances .
F	if there ' s any chance you ' ll need to return something i ' d seriously consider if the hassle is worth it .
F	items came quickly and well_packaged - no_problems .
F	arrived really quickly and well_packaged .
F	couldn ' t ask for better .
F	placed an order in middle of march_0000 .
F	item had not arrived .
F	after 0 weeks i contacted them to be told it was not dispatched .
F	then heard from them a month later 00 / 0 / 00 to say it was dispatched and to go to my royal_mail office to see if it is there which it wasn ' t .
F	i contacted them for refund and was told no .
F	only for them to refund me in may with out letting me know .
F	i wish i had researched the company before buying from it as there is loads of other people in same_boat as me on other review site .
F	please look before buying as the item they sell are needed right away not 0months later .
F	i live in northern_ireland , and the only place a seen a halloween_costume i liked was at fancy_dress ball .
F	it was a last_minute order and i was worried it wouldn ' t be here on time , i ordered it on the monday using standard delivery and item came the very next_day , was very pleased , item was as_described and delivery very fast will order from them again .
F	i had a sideboard delivered yesterday and i was impressed by how courteous and helpful your delivery men were .
F	i have recently_moved_into a second floor flat and have had a number of very negative_experiences with rude and unhelpful delivery men who complain_about the two flights of stairs .
F	the sideboard is beautiful too .
F	i am a very happy customer !
F	the item was not delivered when it was supposed to be and the driver did not call to let me know that there was a problem .
F	very disappointed with the standard of the service as i had to call them before they told me of the situation .
F	i can ' t fault the service i ' ve had from glasses_direct , from cancelling and order ( customer_service was great , polite and extremely_helpful ) to the speed at which i got my new order .
F	just great .
F	my mother ordered me a ted baker ladies watch a couple of week_ago .
F	we have it the 00 working_days delivery estimate but it has still not arrived !
F	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
F	!
F	after spending a lot of time finding the best place to have laser_eye_surgery - ultralase was the obvious choice !
F	from the moment you walk through the door , the service received is excellent .
F	the staff had extensive knowledge of the surgery and my mind was put at rest in all areas i had concerns .
F	on the day of my surgery , i was very well looked after , and this level of service continued throughout my after care .
F	thank_you very much !
F	when i moved in to my ( single occupier , one bedroom ) flat in sept 0000 i was told that the supplier was npower and silly me , i didn ' t think to look at a site like this to check them out .
F	although , looking at the reviews below , switching wouldn ' t have helped .
F	i sent off a direct_debit mandate as normal , and some time had passed before i realised i hadn ' t heard_anything from them .
F	i rang them up and the advisor had some trouble getting a direct_debit into the system .
F	he eventually managed it at an amount of £_00 per_month and i thought nothing of it until may , when i cancelled the direct_debit in error and i couldn ' t get another set_up over the phone because of their new systems ( i called the next_day ).
F	i was told by one advisor that i had an economy 00 meter ( correct ) and i would have to get the meters removed and a standard one put in as they couldn ' t bill the meter on their systems ( bullshit ).
F	i rang my landlady to check with her and then rang npower back to be told by another advisor that it would be fine - a ' complex metering team ' would calculate the bill manually and a new direct_debit would be set_up when they did that .
F	did they hell .
F	i ' ve been having to make monthly manual payments since then as they didn ' t manage to bill me until august .
F	i chased this many_times after hearing no reply and eventually complained .
F	each member of staff in customer_services seemed to have a different idea of what timescales this complex metering team work to and they seem to say anything to fob you off and get you off the phone .
F	when they billed me they transposed the readings from each meter and evidently couldn ' t be bothered to set_up the direct_debit so they closed my case down .
F	i rang in ( lost_count of how many_times since may ) to get it sorted out and received another bill today with a debit of £_000 . 00 on the account , so they have billed me for £ 0 , 000 . 00 between 00 sept 00 and 0 sept 00 .
F	again , single occupier in a 0 bed flat .
F	again they haven ' t set_up a direct_debit or acknowledged the complaint so i ' ve sent them a message using their contact form telling them ( moderately politely ) that they are imbeciles .
F	they are demanding payment for the 0rd october_0000 .
F	oh , and all their correspondence seems to reach me a week after it ' s dated so god only knows what ' s going on there .
F	the last time i received a reply from the contact forms , it was clear that they had taken zero notice of the notes on my account so i had to ring in anyway - not expecting much this time , since i received an acknowledgement email telling_me that they are getting more correspondence than usual ( i wonder_why (!))
F	and that it will take them longer_than normal to reply .
F	well that ' s just brilliant .
F	so , after numerous phone_calls to complaints and customer_services , one written complaint and a couple of complaint forms later , the issue has not been resolved and i have been left with a debt that they have let accrue on my account because they couldn ' t bill me for a year .
F	who ' s to say the amount is right anyway ?
F	sounds_like from other people they seem to charge whatever they want and don ' t care less about how it affects people .
F	so , unless you like being put under unnecessary stress and love being charged insane amounts of money , don ' t use npower .
F	i ordered a hair product from them as i couldn ' t find a better price anywhere_else .
F	they have a voucher_code that can be used to get 00_%_off your first order if you sign_up to their newsletter .
F	they dispatched my item promptly , very pleased .
F	i ordered 0 items on monday_morning , and recieved emails for each one informing_me that each had been sent to the courier ( 0 with yodel and 0 with hermes ).
F	not realising that tesco used these couriers i was a little_worried , as yodel has a terrible reputation .
F	however , the items from yodel were delivered on tuesday_afternoon , very impressed !
F	however , one of the items had a part missing , so i emailed customer_services asking for it to be posted out to me , as i was recluctant to phone the 0000 number .
F	i recieved a phone call from a very friendly lady informing_me that i could have a replacement delivered and they would pick_up the old one at the same time on thursday .
F	i recieved the hermes parcel on wednesday , and the swap was fine on thursday .
F	all this was from the £ 0 delivery option which promised delivery by the saturday , very pleased !
F	as i had the week off work , this was very convenient , but had i been at work it would have been quite awkward with no one to collect packages .
F	would definitely use again .
F	this is a cobuying website where you can join cobuys for various types of products , mainly beauty and cosmetics , and get discounts off these products by doing so .
F	the best deal i have gotten was a lovely delonghi toaster for £_00 , would have cost me around £_00 elsewhere .
F	they can sometimes take a while to dispatch , but if they take longer_than 0 days ( which has only happened once in all the time i have been cobuying with them ) they will send you a courteous email apologising and explaining the delay .
F	this is a very fun way to shop , just make_sure you can ' t get the item including the delivery price cheaper anywhere_else .
F	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
F	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
F	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
F	i tried to contact quidco , and found i could only view some useless faq_section which does not allow you to send them a message .
F	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
F	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
F	delivery and dispatch are usually quite quick , and they often have huge discount days .
F	the problem with this site , is firstly , the swatches of the products .
F	it is impossible to tell what shade you are in their foundations , and even some of the nail_polish swatches are completely untrue to real_life .
F	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
F	you can buy a product , love it , then repurchase it and it will be horrible !
F	i don ' t understand_why they don ' t have better quality_control .
F	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
F	i bought a lipgloss from their mineral range and the packaging is so bad you can barely get any out of the tube !
F	not sure if i would buy anything again .
F	i recently got a new phone line when i had internet installed .
F	immediately , the phone_calls started from some unknown number .
F	they kept asking for a woman who does not and has never lived at my address .
F	i told them this time and again and they still refused to stop calling .
F	i asked them to update their records and still they wouldn ' t .
F	the person calling would never introduce themselves , or explain_why they were calling , which i find appallingly rude .
F	i eventually looked up the phone number to find a few people had experienced similar treatment .
F	i rang the number to find that in fact it was natwest home insurance !
F	i thought it was some kind of debt_collection agency the way they were acting !
F	i forwarded a complaint via their website telling them to sod off ( mostly politely ) and i recieved a letter saying they would look_into my complaint .
F	i have not had any further letters but hurrah , they have stopped calling me !
F	i used their home delivery service to get some furniture .
F	i was unable to get time off work for the delivery slot they allocated me , so i rang them to change it .
F	i was on hold for around 00_mins on an 0000 number to get it changed from tuesday to friday .
F	i came home from work on the tuesday to find that delivery had been attempted .
F	i was furious that i had spent money trying to get a delivery slot changed and they hadn ' t even done it properly .
F	i was able to change it with the courier , luckily but sent a complaint to ikea .
F	a woman phoned me regarding my complaint and treated me as if i was stupid and i had gotten it wrong !
F	when i explained i had recieved an_email that confirmed the friday delivery slot still no apology .
F	would not use again .
F	i saw a throw at the norr00 showroom in berlin but had no room in my luggage .
F	i was pleased to find they had a website and that they shipped to the uk .
F	i ordered my throw - i now own my throw and it is gorgeous !
F	i am a very happy_camper .
F	there was no sympathy option for flowers to the us so i chose a florist ' s choice bouquet to send my condolences .
F	i had emails from two people commenting on the beautiful flowers .
F	sounds_like a good job to me .
F	thank_you .
F	amazing value and so quick !
F	im glad i found this website ,
F	i was about to post my phone on ebay but luckily i found this .
F	the cost of my phone on ebay is £_000 excluding vat , paypal fees but fonebank qouted me £_000 and sent the phone on monday and received the payment into my bank_account on wednesday !
F	thanks fonebank !
F	my opinion of supplement_warehouse is only half formulated because i haven ' t received my order , but the ordering aspect of my dealings with supplement_warehouse was pleasant as the prices were fair , and the free_samples were nice ... minus the shipping part of it .
F	lol
F	i would recommend supplement_warehouse to my friends and family ... possibly even ahead of gnc , as i am a member .
F	for the first time i used wowcher i never received my items and when i tried to log in to find out the apparently my account then didn ' t exist !
F	when i contacted them i got a reply to say i had an account but no voucher had been used yet clearly the money had been taken out of my account !
F	been a month and still_waiting for my refund and for them to get back to me !
F	disgusting stay well clear !
F	for 00 years my family have been loyal orange / ee customers and are suposedly " valued customers " are we heck !!
F	this term means nothing to the company or it ' s staff !
F	for three_weeks now i have been paying £_00 a month for an iphone that i cannot use due no service .
F	i have been back and forth_between phoning the company and going into a ee store and no one seems to be able to sort out my problem !
F	it ' s beyond a joke and the company simply do not care !!
F	i would never ever use this service and given the option i would leave in a flash !
F	secondly what ever they have told you about being the fastest network with the best coverage is a lie !
F	i get rubbish coverage wherever i am and recieve less_than half the broadband i pay for !
F	for first timers looking into ee do not do it !
F	o0 all the way from now on !!!!
F	extreamly unsatified customer !
F	oak_furniture land have been fantastic .
F	everything from the service in store , through to delivery & quality has been great .
F	they called , text & emailed to say when my items would arrive .
F	the driver called me 00_minutes before they arrived & said they would be with me within 00_minutes , which of course they were .
F	i ' ve had complaints with several other big firms & was expecting there to be an issue with this too but far from it !
F	i will be the first one complaining & kicking off if things aren ' t up to scratch but this experience has been fantastic , & i would definitely_recommend them .
F	items arrived very quickly , beautifully_packaged - super reasonably_priced , couldn ' t fault it !
F	i have 0 pre_- order item ( red kite walker ) in this order under " pre_- order for may delivery ” status , which was placed on tuesday , 0st may .
F	i received my items within 0 days , but the walker .
F	i know it ' s a pre_- order item , so i waited for another week .
F	waiting .. waiting ... on 00th_may , i emailed them as to when the walker would be in stock .
F	they said it was cancelled because they received a cancellation request email on 0th_may for the item and was refunded .
F	i did not send them email with regards to this order until i asked when the item was likely to despatch !!!
F	i was angry because they just cancelled the item i had been waiting for without telling_me it was cancelled .
F	they should at_least send me an_email to confirm this .
F	i emailed them back on the same day and said that i did not cancel it and asked them to forward me the cancellation request email they got .
F	i also further send them another email to reinstate my order back to original status .
F	they replied on 00th_may saying they could not retrieve the cancellation request email and explained my card would be charged again if they placed and order to the item and it could be delivered in may .
F	( later , a reply from the manager in a separate complaint email said they only kept customer ' s email for 0 days !!!!!!!
F	shocking for such an important thing !!!)
F	i asked the customer_services for confirmation when it would be delivered on saturday , 00th_may , but no reply from them till now .
F	i wrote an_email to the complaints team too on the same day .
F	the manager replied_saying their staff did recall i cancelled it ( but they could not prove it !)
F	and the item would not be delivered unless i approve the payment from them again .
F	they were basically saying they did not do anything wrong !
F	the email i got was sorry on the surface , but they were saying they were right and not sympathetic whatsoever or do i get any compensation for it .
F	they should have better communications to customers .
F	things like this will be avoided if we do get emails about status of our order .
F	even when i tracked the order status on their website , there was no note about the cancellation on 0th_may or any other notes , apart_from a note about another item in this order that was going to be despatched , dated 0nd may .
F	first of all the concept is more complicated than first expected and very little explanation is given .
F	i then got charged twice for my wowcher and when i complained , they told my that " it hadn ' t got as far as them and paypal was responsible " this turned_out to be a lie when i called paypal , who contacted them and sorted it .
F	to top it all off the product supposedly had a sale price of £_00 . 00 , and i was getting a fantastic deal for £_00 . 00 .
F	upon further investigation , the average sale for the item on other_sites was £_00 . 00 .
F	i have been mucked around and ripped_off .
F	i will not be using wowcher again .
F	ordered ghd air over the weekend and arrived on tuesday .
F	great delivery , price and really love the hairdryer .
F	it drys my hair in no time and leaves it feeling great with a salon finish .
F	beautycow are a excellent company to do business with .
F	will def use them again .
F	thanks beautycow
F	a great company .
F	their immune boosting products are reasonably_priced for what they do .
F	finally tried an introductory box and both my husband and i were very impressed by the quality if the sausages , burgers and pork chops .
F	they were all very meaty and better_than any other equivalent product we had bought from the supermarket top range .
F	only minor criticism is that the steaks were quite thin so lacked the juiciness we usually enjoy but would still be willing to try other steaks
F	i posted my phones by recorded_delivery tuesday_afternoon .
F	wednesday_morning i received an_email to confirm they had received my phones .
F	00_minutes after that , i received an_email to say that my order was complete and a cheque was being dispatched that day .
F	thursday , i received the cheque !!!
F	it would have been even quicker_than that had i opted to have the money paid directly into my bank !!!!
F	i ' ve already_recommended mazuma to a friend !!
F	!
F	before you book or go on your holiday go on trip_advisor i wish we had before going to turkey , didn ' t make the same mistake twice and it really helped with our trip to salou
F	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
F	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don ' t cater for the bigger lady .
F	good communication , very quick dispatch .
F	good range of delivery options .
F	easy to use website
F	very good service , fast dispatch .
F	would recommend to a friend and will be returning to purchase more items for my dogs .
F	we booked the premium transfers from and to barcelona airport a week before our trip and it was worth the money - the cards were shiny black and brand_new , clean inside out and very luxury .
F	the driver met us at the airport and took us to the hotel and a different driver picked us up a few_days_later , but they both were very polite and nice .
F	the only negative_comment i could make is that they both were driving extremely fast , probably twice the speed limit ( n . b .
F	we are in our late twenties and drive every day ourselves !
F	), but it must be a spanish thing :)
F	spoke to sammy_taylor she made me feel very comfortable and was clear and concise with her advice
F	i had been on other_websites , but found that hostelbookers gave a 00_%_discount on my selected hostel in nice .
F	it was really easy to book the hostel and it saved me a fair amount of money .
F	thanks hostelbookers .
F	great service .
F	a colleague of mine used this service back in july and it was excellent .
F	however , on the accounts side i was getting frustrated that i couldn ' t optain an invoice .
F	but today after_speaking to daniel on the live help i found out that i was looking for the wrong information from the wrong company .
F	within minutes of giving my reference_number daniel had it all sorted for me .
F	what a speedy service !!!
F	i will_definately but using them again both for business and personal deliveries !
F	thz for the experince , great all_round , will be back when i get more mobiles .
F	i couldn ' t believe_how quickly they delivered my item and what great condition it was in when it arrived straight to my door .
F	i would highly_recommend
F	they picked the item up and delivered exactly when they said they would and a friendly guy delivered it straight to my door .
F	my baby daughter ruined my msi u000 netbook by spilling a drink on it , so i desperately_needed a decent new one ( as i rely_on it for my income ), at a really good price ( as i really could have done without having to by a new one due to money issues !
F	).
F	i brought the acer eeepc 0000p - selling on ebay at around £_000 , but save on laptops doing it for £_000 !
F	i ordered it bank hol monday ( after a desperate weekend trying to dry the other one out to no_avail ), it arrived wednesday !
F	so not even 0 days work lost !
F	- excellent service , they must have come back to any number of orders tuesday_morning but this did not in any way delay the despatch of my new netbook , couldn ' t ask for more and will_definately recommended to anyone who needs a new laptop at a great price and in a hurry !
F	i make my sons baby formula and they have almost all of the ingredients that i need at a much lower_price !
F	i saved over $_00 on my last order !
F	when i came_across your website i was immediately attracted to the arrangements and the variety and for very reasonable prices .
F	i was taken with you and found what i wanted immediately .
F	i was very reassured receiving texts at every point of the transaction and really_appreciated the delivery options as my mum is not always guaranteed to be in .
F	your choices of bouquets and arrangements are second to none and really different .
F	i will_definitely use your services again .
F	thank_you for making my mums day .
F	not only was the process of valuing and selling online easy and painless , the envelope arrived the next_day and the money was wired to me the same day they received my mobiles .
F	excellent service and i will_definitely both recommend and use again ,
F	i was really impressed with the easy to use website .
F	the videos showing the different fridge freezers was a real help when deciding which one to order .
F	the ordering_process was simple and being_able to choose the delivery day meant i could organise my time .
F	receiving texts was a good little touch , the day before delivery i was text the name of the driver .
F	on the morning of delivery the driver rang and gave me an estimated time of arrival and when they arrived the delivery was smooth and went without a hitch .
F	i ' d definitely use again and will recommend to friends and family .
F	to sum up i ' m a very happy customer !!
F	:-)
F	i ' ve purchased from healthy_supplies twice , and have had an excellent experience both_times .
F	i don ' t know of another place in the uk where i can get all the healthy_supplies i need , and have them delivered to my doorstep so promptly .
F	i ' m so glad i came_across this website and decided to give it a shot .
F	plan to use it again and again !
F	i purchased several products from here .
F	the products arrived quickly , well_packaged and are the real deal .
F	i will_definitely be purchasing from here again .
F	i was amazed as my parcel arrived first thing the next_day , as i ordered only the afternoon before .
F	my outfit was amazing will_defiantly be buying from them again .
F	this is a great company !
F	i would even work here or definately buy shares if i could !
F	the staff are always accessible , friendly , and helpful .
F	the items were exactly as pictured , and the website is so much fun to shop in !
F	delivery was super_fast , even_though i am overseas !
F	really , great .
F	thank_you partyrama !
F	!
F	ordered a suitcase with next_day delivery - it took much longer to deliver and the suitcase arrived the day after i left .
F	disappointed as could have used another company for urgent delivery to receive it before the journey , not after ...
F	asked for clarification , the company didn ' t bother_replying ...
F	i ' ve booked with double0tickets twice now , while there weren ' t any real problems with either booking , there were little things the agents did that gave the impression that they would be very helpful if issues had arisen .
F	for example , they courtesy called me to give proper directions twice and remind about entrance hours for the first concert .
F	with the second , i managed to get a day ticket for reading_festival which was sold out absolutely everywhere .
F	everyone there seems very together and focused on great customer_service .
F	they would probably be my first point to search for any tickets at the moment .
F	we had a french girl , elodie roche , very easy to speak french with her .
F	we had lots of problems and she was perfect , fast and lovely .
F	thanks a lot
F	i decided to purchase glasses over the internet due to ever increasing prices on the high_street .
F	selectspecs was an easy website to use and the glasses on offer were very reasonably_priced !
F	delivery was as_described and i loved my glasses when they arrived .
F	i mainly wear contact_lenses , however , since the arrival of my selectspecs glasses , i have worn the contacts much less !
F	very pleased and would most definitely use selectspecs again !
F	!
F	mazuma is a great place to get_rid of any unwanted phones .
F	i was surprised to find my nokia was worth £_00 !
F	the information pack was quickly delivered and once i ' d returned my phone , the payment was made straight into my bank_account on the same day that it was received !!
F	happy customer , definitely worth looking through drawers for any old_phones knocking around !
F	thanks .
F	have ordered from this website several_times ... for sure the best priced there is for authentic products !
F	quick delivery , great communication and always reliable !
F	i have been using this company for over a year now and i think they are absolutely_faultless !
F	sometimes i order as much as 0 times a week so have had much experience with them and they are brilliant ..
F	i live in the netherlands and i always receive my package 0 working_days from ordering .. everything is always better_than i imagined and the quality is mostly fantastic considering that everything is just 0 pounds !
F	customer_service is always efficient and helpful and i think the e0p team should all be very proud of themselves !
F	i ordered 0 yankee candles which were very cheap with the 00_%_off offer , they arrived very quickly and were very well_packaged , will be ordering some more within the next few_days , very happy with the service
F	i could no have been happier with the service and quality of the products from flashbay .
F	i requested some samples and received the most impressive sample_pack i have ever_seen .
F	i received visual proofs within an_hour of requesting them and my order was received to days early .
F	will_defiantly be using flashbay again .
F	at first it felt_like an entertainment website , with " playful " fonts and colors so you assume it ' s gonna be easy to navigate around .
F	and then , you realise that it is actually really easy to find your way around , but the content is far from shallow .
F	stats are useful and noticeable at first_glance , and there are lots of offers whether it ' s for a job or a flat .
F	i particularly like the connectivity options , which make it more personalise and it feels_like you have an extra search assistant .
F	just hope they will soon open the job search to other countries .
F	easy to order .
F	great service to compete with prices of other online competitors .
F	will_definitely order again !
F	i highly_recommend supplement warhouse .
F	they have price_match on all of their products to get the best deals .
F	they also have free products to go along with your order .
F	brilliant price and speedy service , will_definitely use them again
F	wanted to send my aunty in france a thank_you bouquet so found iflorist online .
F	they offered delivery to her address at reasonable rates .
F	the flowers were delivered on time in perfect_condition and she was very pleased with her surprise !
F	will_definitely use their service again .
F	terrible customer_service , took nearly a year to resolve issues with account when i left the property .
F	bounced from person to person and no one seemed to understand the query .
F	then at the end of this nightmare they opened the direct_debit account for the next occupier of the property where i had closed the account ... with my bank_details and without my consent .
F	fast and efficient service from sarah_h , very very helpful indeed !
F	thanks for your help today :)
F	the price i was offered was great and the speed of the transaction was extraordinary , i will_definately use mazuma again !
F	!
F	i sent my phone off , with a note stating that the screen did not work however everything else did fine .
F	i even paid for special delivery .
F	next_day i got an_email_stating there was faults in that ' the power_button did not switch on or off ' which is not true at all , offering me £_00 . 00 for a samsung_galaxy_note .
F	either they employ people who can not read or who are too lazy to notice that the phone does turn on but it is just the screen , there is nowhere to state on the website when ' selling ' the phone what damages it has so you can ' t point it out to these morons .
F	totally peed off and wasted my money and time sending it .
F	( also because i rejected my offer they reported my review stating i ' m not a genuine customer , why just because i rejected the poor offer ?!)
F	i have now received my phone back , low and behold it does turn on ,
F	also i sent my phone in it ' s original box with charger .. only received the phone back !
F	contacted customer_service and they are sending out a replacement box and charger .
F	printing . com have been excellent at giving us imaginative ideas , fantastic quality printing at great prices , and speedy_delivery - 0_stars !
F	my dad bought me and my partner a mini break but when we came to book it there were no weekend dates available and very limited midweek dates .
F	we ended_up with wowcher credit which we have managed to spend some of .
F	the remainder we will loose , as after checking the deals daily there hasn ' t been anything we want .
F	i emailed wowcher to ask them to extend the credit .
F	after a week they have replied , refusing my request so we will now loose the money .
F	or i have 0 days to buy something i don ' t even want .
F	i also noticed on numerous_occasions that the items selling are not discounted at all and in some_cases are available much cheaper elsewhere .
F	definitely shop around .
F	there are rugs on currently that were in aldi half the price .
F	also watch out for expensive delivery charges !
F	i ' ve rated wowcher 0 ☆ as i believe they do have malicious_intent .
F	they clearly don ' t want to revise their credit policies because they are making so much !
F	can ' t think of another company that operates such an unfair returns / refund policy !
F	excelllent service - the whole_process took 0 days from start to finish !
F	the prepaid_envelope came the day after i submitted the order , i posted the phones immediately , the following_day they received the phones and processed them .
F	the next_day the voucher arrived !
F	amazing !
F	a faultless service which i will_definately use again !
F	sky_vegas is great to use , easy and reliable .
F	great service , received my order quickly with no_problems : 0 )
F	i ordered a washing_machine a while ago and had a good experience so i decided to buy a fridge /_freezer from them as well .
F	i researched through their products and chose a model that worked for me .
F	i placed the order for the next_day delivery and only upon confirmation did i notice that the delivery date wasn ' t for the next month .
F	then i had to wait on hold ( at 00p_per_minute ) to cancel the order .
F	they could have avoided this if they had just indicated that the item wasn ' t in stock .
F	now they say it will be 0 - 00 days to refund my money - awful service !!!
F	!
F	i ordered well in_advance a nice bunch of flowers for my mother to be delivered on saturday as she works on a sunday .
F	it is now 0pm on the monday and they have still not arrived .
F	i payed a lot of money for these flowers and feel totally let_down .
F	when i eventually got though to iflorist on sunday_night ( they had been offline all day ) i got no apology .
F	they gave me a link to the delivery tracking website which showed by flowers had been " in transit " since friday .
F	if they do ever arrive the flowers will be approaching the end of their natural life .
F	iflorist should not be taking our money if they cannot uphold their end of the bargain .
F	had they said they could ' t deliver on the saturday then i would have simply sent something else .
F	i have emailed demanding a full_refund and have not received any word back as of yet .
F	very distressing interaction which has caused a lot of stress over the last few_days .
F	i will never use this company ever again .
F	given the number of other negative_reviews showing others being let_down also , i ' ve decided to write to trading_standards .
F	i recently made a booking , without realising that i ' chosen the wrong option of payment .
F	after_speaking to a customer_service advisor , lius martins , he resolved this over the phone in a very polite and helpful manner .
F	this has helped_me out a lot , stopping the worry and cunfusion on my behalf .
F	excellent customer skills , would definately book again with this company .
F	once i placed an order , i received numerous reminders to send my phone which was great as i kept forget to post my item .
F	within the next working day of posting my item , i got an_email_saying they received my image and sent my cheque in the post ( great fast service ).
F	i then received the cheque in the post the next_day .
F	thank_you so much for excellent service .
F	the price_match is great but i often find that they are the cheapest anyway !!
F	fast and reliable i always check to see if sw has the item i am looking for before i look anyway else .
F	lol i got my whole family addicted .
F	from start to finish i found the whole experience fantastic - service was excellent and the speed superb - highley recommend to anyone
F	ordered some flowers today for the mother ' s day weekend for my mother in law today and i always find browsing sites for items daunting but i must_admit that when i went on i found that what i would want is how it was all laid_out in front of me .
F	like a sit_down brochure .
F	i found something i liked really easy because of the lay_out of the pictures i even found a little gift balloon i could add .
F	bonus too was they gave the offer of free chocs and a card .
F	don ' t get that everywhere !
F	anyway i ordered my flowers card balloon and put what i wished for them to put in the card and continued with ease to the checkout and voila !
F	all done .
F	instant email confirmation came through and not over stressed by the whole experience .
F	probably took longer to write this than order . lol it ' s that easy .
F	;).
F	congrats on a site that ' s not confusing . com !
F	;)
F	good reviews of good hostels .
F	it allows you to use the experiences of others , learning from their mistakes is better_than your own .
F	easy to navigate the plentiful information .
F	excellent - quick delivery , well_packaged and very competitively_priced .
F	would thoroughly_recommend !
F	i ordered my costume on sunday and it came on wednesday .
F	i couldn ' t believe_how quick it came i thought it would take longer_than that so imagine my surprise when i came home from the cinema to find it sitting on my couch where my mum left it .
F	i would defiantly order from this site again love it .
F	i ' ve tried a few other hockey companies including barrington and gilmore sports and total hockey are the only guys i ' ve used time and time again without any_issues .
F	every time the service is top_class , very personal , genuine , and they ' ll go out of their way to help you .
F	don ' t be put off that they ' re based in ni , their delivery is quicker_than any other company i ' ve used and unlike the others they ' ll let you know if it will be delayed !!
F	i ordered wednesday_morning and received my kickers on friday_morning as promised .
F	the sweeties are always a nice_touch too !
F	keep up the good work :)
F	very fast very easy and very friendly service , also great quality costume .
F	thank_you x
F	i ordered a canvas_print on - line this week , i did not read the web_site correctly and to cut a long_story short i said i would collect my item in person , this would be all and well if i lived in wales and not scotland , lol .
F	i called up as soon as i noticed what i had done and spoke to a very helpful guy who not only helped_me ensure my order would be sent to me he was able to look at my picture and i explained about how i would like the pic in the back round taken out or moved if possible .
F	in the end i had an e . mail that very same night to say my order had been dispatched !!
F	to me that is amazing and a great service i have ' nt received my order as yet so can not comment on the quality of my canvas , however the service i received was 00 / 00 !!
F	cant_wait to see my canvas now !
F	!
F	from begining to end the process of selling my old phone was quick and easy !
F	payment was in my account the day my phone was received and the communication along the way was outstanding !
F	i loved my dress but the necklace was broken so had to send it back :( fast delivery and an_absolute bargain :)
F	would defiantly recommend this store to anyone_wishing to purchase a new appliance i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else always very helpful and excellent value for money :)
F	one of the best experiences so far , not only concerning the reservation procedure it self , but also on having great variety of reviews .
F	to sum it up , it ' s a great website .
F	plenty of options , and very fast to navigate too !
F	highly_recomended !
F	without a doubt the easiest hotel booking website i have used , it was easy and simple to select what i wanted and within_seconds i was presented with several options .
F	i found that compared to other_websites it offered the best deals and i particularly found it useful the way it presented each hotel on the map to show the best location .
F	i will_definitely be using this site again for future_bookings .
F	my husband to be ordered some gifts for his best men , usher and reader in the form of a personalized engraved pocket watch and lighter .
F	what turned_up can only be described as a scratched engraving not a proper laser cut .
F	the delivery was also painfully_slow , and he has had to go and buy new gifts for everyone as we were not happy to give these to our friends .
F	we are now waiting on our_wedding favours , which we also ordered from confetti , which have still not turned_up .
F	even_though the website displays delivery 00 days before the wedding date .
F	we ordered invitations , rsvp ' s and evening reception invites from the young love collection .
F	after going to order the order of service and menu closer to the wedding date it became_apparent that the collection was not available in anything_else !
F	why ?
F	then when we did settle for something similar to that collection for the place cards and guest book what was delivered was completely_different !
F	after_speaking to the customer_services it seems that what was displaying on the website was different to what they were reading in the warehouse .
F	when ordering something for a wedding on what is a very stressful time this did not help !
F	i have good experience of shopping with precious_little , i come_across a little_bit of delivery issue as i missed my delivery , but their sales represented helped_me to get that delivery same day ...
F	i have purchased quite a few item .. bedding , cot bed , push chair , mobile cot , changing mat etc .
F	i will_definitely_recommend precious_little for shopping .
F	they have good customer_service .
F	it ' s an easy website to fine as you can compare the price difference to other website .
F	prompt service and realisable .
F	easy access to where the tickets needs to be collected .
F	well_done horray .
F	ordered a couple of fox t -_shirts on monday , received today ( wednesday ) really pleased and i got some free sticker !
F	good work freestylextreme
F	first time i have used double 0 and i would highly_recommend this site again and will be using it for every concert etc that i wish to attend .
F	tickets arrived the next_day special delivery
F	thanks so much double 0 you are now my guilty pleasure
F	kate
F	i never have an issue with the service from very .
F	i order and receive next_day with collect +, so no delivery charge there and if it needs to be ordered to the house i am more_than happy to pay for the delivery .
F	what ' s great is , i can more or less book in what day i want to the goods delivered .
F	currently waiting on a bed for my wee one but it stated low stock and the availability date at point before purchase , so really can ' t grumble with that .
F	when i got this account , i also signed_up for a littlewoods account and instantly noticed that very had the cheaper prices for their highly branded items .
F	returns are also very simple , all done online for my smaller items |( haven ' t had to return bigger items ).
F	can go to the post_office , back to collect_plus or drop it with the local drop box .
F	even your account tells you how many days you have left to return a certain item and i love you can buy two different_sizes , find the best fit and then return the one you are not wanting .
F	i have never had to contact customer_service , everything completed online !
F	big_thumbs_up x
F	very friendly staff , and a fast response to problems i had .
F	would fully recommend them
F	i spoke to paul on live_chat and he was very helpful and dealt and helped_me with my enquiry very quickly x
F	i booked a room online for the 00st december till the 0st of january , which a friend of mine clearly saw me correctly input .
F	i handed_over my bank_details , was forced to take alpharoom ' s insurance in order to make the booking and agreed to a no cancelation policy as i definitely was going for a special new year ' s eve .
F	only at the end of booking the receipt said i had booked the room for the 00st jan to the 0st feb !
F	of course i called alpharooms straight_away as there had been some terrible mistake in their website system .
F	i couldn ' t get through , the line was just dead .
F	i then called the hotel , they kindly called alpharooms on my behalf , alpharooms agreed to call me .
F	they called and then hung_up on me .
F	i called the hotel again and this time the hotel connected me directly to alpharooms .
F	i explained there had been some mistake in their system as both myself and my friend had clearly saw me input the 0st january for the the check out date .
F	they said it was tough_luck and i would still be charged !
F	they tried to tell me they " couldn ' t do refunds as they would be charged by the hotel " ( this was not true as i had spoken directly to the hotel who have a policy of canceling up until the day before , especially if there had been some serious mistake like this .
F	alpharooms refused to change the wrong date to another , they were very unhelpful , saying it was my fault !!
F	and finally_agreed to just a 00_% refund on my money .
F	they basically stole 00 pounds from my account .
F	alpharooms are a scam beware !!
F	!
F	“ we received our new furniture today and are delighted with the product .
F	from initial order to a call from your team to confirm delivery dates to update texts to the final delivery , everything has been of excellent service .
F	within the space of a week of ordering can ' t believe we have the furniture already .
F	easy to unwrap and as already built everything was so easy !
F	can ' t thank_you enough .
F	great experience with oak_furniture land .”
F	brought some of the supreme crest whitening strips from this website , i must_admit i was very skeptical and didn ' t think they would really work !
F	i received my products the next_day , super_fast delivery !!
F	after just the first use i could see a huge difference to my teeth !
F	and after a week the difference was absolutely astonishing !
F	i literally could not believe_how white my teeth were !!
F	i had strangers asking me how i got my teeth so white ( no exaggeration !!!)
F	my friend who has had her teeth whitened at the dentist paid £_000 and didn ' t get as good results as i did !
F	these strips are absolutely fantastic !
F	i did experience some slight sensitivity but nothing major and only lasted 0 day !
F	the customer support is amazing also and they reply to email very quickly !
F	defiantly recommend to everyone !
F	!
F	i like hostelbookers and would definitely_recommend it .
F	it ' s easy to use and there are no booking_fees
F	i ' ve used amazon for quite sometime now and i ' ve never had a single problem with them .
F	top quality company .
F	really good anti_- virus software .
F	it dosen ' t constantly throw pop up messages at you and seems to get the job_done .
F	offer a good price and look very professional but don ' t deliver , on any level and hold on to your money for as long as they can .
F	like many others have said this is also a us company not uk as they advertise .
F	wish i ' d of checked the reviews first !
F	placed my first order on the 00th of march at 00am and i received it at 00am the following_day .
F	couldn ' t have asked for a better service and will_defiantly be ordering from them again in the future .
F	if only all online_retailers were this effective .
F	hostelbookers will always be my " go - to " site when i feel my feet getting itchy and need to hit the road !
F	it ' s so easy to see all the information you need to make an informed_decision about the hostels , and the booking procedure is quick and easy with a very reasonable deposit rate of 00 %.
F	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for years and never once had a problem , i happily use this site and book with confidence every time .
F	excellent !
F	i used the live_chat option to resolve a query veronica was very quick , polite and patient and resolved my query .
F	from the moment we received our free_sample we knew we had found the perfect invitations ; perfect quality , stunning design , perfect price and totally personal !
F	i would recommend on every level !
F	hopefully i will never use them again as i only want to marry once !
F	but would never hesitate to recommend !
F	every_single_person who received one of our invites has commented on how gorgeous they are !
F	well worth every_penny and more !
F	couldn ' t be_happier !
F	thanks so much !
F	excellent price , excellent service and you deal with real people , would highly_recommend this company
F	i always use hostelbookers . com when booking a hostel .
F	i have never found a website with lower prices and better offers .
F	they don ' t bombard you with emails , just important ones with great deals that any traveller would want to read !
F	the policies are fair and the company is very professional .
F	it is also easy to navigate the website and sort through preferences when searching for a place to stay .
F	it ' s a very trustworthy website and i would definitely_recommend it to anyone - in fact , i always do !
F	goedkoop , mooie bril , hele goede service .
F	ben zeer tevreden over smartbuyglass en heel erg goed geholpen door de medewerker ,
F	zeker een aanrader ... n voor de helft van de prijs heb ik tommy hilfiger bril gekocht die ik bij pearl zag .
F	found the products i wanted that i couldn ' t find elsewhere .
F	easy to buy from and sent out quickly .
F	brilliant !
F	i enjoy buying from chemist_direct as the website is easy to use and they are always quick to despatch my items .
F	i receive emails to keep me up to date and the products always arrive safely_packaged and in good condition .
F	happy with all parts of order start to finish - price , delivery , timings and products .
F	thanks .
F	free delivery and competitive_prices - love it .
F	it would be great to have a larger and more diverse range and choice of natural and new brands of cat foods , but they suit my needs right now which is perfect .
F	i buy small packs of applaws biscuits for my cat every now and then , and they ' re the cheapest around .
F	delivery takes about 0 - 0 days which is excellent .
F	hostelbookers . com is my go - to website for finding affordable lodging abroad .
F	thanks for providing the best places at the best prices !
F	i ordered from asda direct on 00th_nov , i received a email to say my product had been delayed but would be dispatched within 0 working_days and would be delivered 0 - 0 working_days .
F	i had no problem with this delay as i work in retail and completely understand the delays of christmas .
F	it got to the 00th_nov , still not product , i contacted asda direct .
F	who told me the delivery service yodel had attempted delivery to my property 0 times within the last_week now i know this was lies and i did say this to the customer_service agent at asda , as my husband had been off on holiday all week .
F	after this challenge asda got back onto yodel who then said that because my property was a flat , they deemed they didn ' t have full access to my property so couldn ' t deliver ,
F	this was laughable considering royal_mail have no problem , parcel_force no problem but yet yodel couldn ' t press a buzzer ( which is loud enough to wake the dead ) to gain_access to the building .
F	so after being on the phone to a very helpful asda colleague him back and to between me and yodel , we arranged another deliver , the next_day again my husband was still off .
F	0pm came , and a yodel van was in my street i though brilliant they ' ve kept their word ...
F	no they were delivery to a house 0 yards from our flats main entrance .
F	the guy got back in his_van and drove off .
F	needless to say i got back onto asda and cancelled my order and will be getting a full_refund ,
F	i will never use any company that uses_yodel as a delivery service .
F	a bunch of liars not to be trusted !
F	this company is great , good value for money , fantastic customer_service department delivery at various times days to suit all , very happy customer would definately use them again
F	i am already a regular shopper at getbusy and love the products and the service .
F	my parcels are always delivered by next_day delivery with a text to say the exact time to expect them .
F	i would recommend getbusy to anyone !
F	great service - dispatch and delivery was super_fast .
F	after being let_down by another retailer who said they had the stock but did not i ordered my rab jacket from webtogs and it arrived the next_day .
F	item arrived in a good delivery time and was exactly as i ' d ordered
F	do not use this service unless you enjoy being left endlessly on hold once your order fails to turn_up .
F	having ordered a bouquet for mother ' s day ( ironically at the recommendation of a banner advertising specifically mother ' s day services ) four days in_advance , i was surprised to learn that the next_day , my order hadn ' t turned_up .
F	i emailed twice and received useless automated_responses and then decided to ring them .
F	i was on the phone to an unhelpful operator who specified a ' technical difficulty ' which had prevented the flowers from being delivered .
F	i quite reasonably requested a refund but again , my query had to be passed on to the ' customer_service escalation manager '- who sends one automated email to confirm your phone call and nothing more .
F	after three days of no contact i decided to ring again to be told that a refund had been authorised - and yet i had not been notified of this .
F	no email with an_apology , no compensation , not even a lousy refund confirmation .
F	i wanted to show my appreciation on a public holiday for someone i care about - and the one service that they are supposed to provide apparently is beyond them .
F	terrible customer_service , didn ' t even notify me that there was a problem with my order .
F	i cannot stress this enough , do not order from them .
F	popped_into park_cameras as wanted advice on a christmas_gift & to check out prices .
F	all staff were extremely_helpful & not pushy to get a sale either .
F	will_definitely return to make my purchase , as so refreshing to get such good service .
F	the payment came through quickly and was easy to post .
F	the price was better_than the competitor and so i ' m_glad i went with mazuma .
F	thanks mazuma :)
F	easy to use website , lots of payment options , had a problem with citylink but the other couriers cannot be_faulted , and the service fro parcel0go is outstanding they sorted my problem out really quickly
F	made my plans for travelling really straightforward and clear .
F	i ' m on a budget so it ' s great to have no booking_fees and it ' s easy to find the cheapest option .
F	will_continue to use the website for all my bookings over the next month .
F	quick and easy to order , easy to set out in lovely pots !
F	kids loved the sweet buffet x
F	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
F	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
F	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
F	the people ( i ' m_guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
F	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
F	he gave me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
F	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
F	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
F	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
F	thank_you ashley :)
F	somebody stolen my phone yesterday !
F	but i still have insurance till 00th_july_0000 !
F	and it ' s covered this trouble !!!!!!!!!!
F	but --- when i call to customer_service t - mobile - they give me information that my insurance was canceled !!!
F	it ' s really bullshit - because i have the paper where i can see that it ' s still working !!!
F	insurance company don ' t see my insurance at all !!!
F	the guys at the store also see my working insurance ( 0000 w atlantic blvd , margate , fl 00000 , 000 - 000 - 0000 )!
F	but nobody wants to help me - they tell me that it ' s my trouble and they don ' t want to help me !!!!
F	someone on the line ( some manager ) told me - i can deleted your insurance and give you back 00 $!!!!!!!!!
F	are you serious ?!
F	give me back my money for the phone !!!!!!!!!!!
F	i really will go to court !!!!!!!!!
F	and they give me money for moral damage too !
F	i found artifolk by pure accident ordered arrived very quickly .. and have stayed with them .
F	i can buy elsewhere for less but why when the service is second to none and very quick with no issues or delay .
F	perfect and well worth every_penny in my opinion .
F	i will only use them as i know i am getting the genuine product ( swann morton ) and not a cheap counter part .
F	thank_you and keep up the brilliant work :)
F	marlow ' s was highly_recommended to me by a few friends so when i got engaged last summer there was nowhere to else to go .
F	an early start from somerset was definitely worth the effort .
F	we were served by margaret who was very informative , i had already researched the type of diamond that i wanted , and margaret listened carefully to our requirements and then found us the perfect diamond that met all the requirements .
F	we then spent a while trying on the different settings , before narrowing it down to two where margaret placed the diamond in the setting allowing me to make a decision .
F	within 0 hours my engagement_ring was ready for collection and was everything i had hoped for .
F	just under a year later we returned as it was time to purchase our_wedding_rings .
F	again the service we received from margaret was fantastic and we now have two wedding_rings which are exactly_what we wanted .
F	at the same time free of charge my engagement_ring was cleaned and serviced .
F	i cannot recommend marlow ' s highly_enough and i am absolutely thrilled with all three of our purchases .
F	bought winter_tyres last winter great fast service !
F	will be back this year and the new site looks good to .
F	thanks sarah
F	the site was very user_friendly , i managed to find a voucher_code to give me 00_%_off my order , free delivery on top of this was a bonus and the item arrived very fast , before the expected date !
F	very happy as this was a present for my mum .
F	the site also has an amazing range of brands and products .
F	would recommend lookfantastic to anyone , and will_definitely be returning soon !
F	very happy and satisfied customer x
F	the easiest and quickest service i have ever used .
F	just like the advert says , all you do is put it in the envelope and send it away , payment was recieved within 00_hours .
F	excellent .
F	p0g number : p0g - 00000000
F	i truly wonder if the parcel0go service can get any worst ..
F	i paid them to deliver my laptop and it was subsequently lost , found and then returned to the me smashed , four weeks after sending it and despite filing claims and numerous_emails today they sent me this :
F	' please_accept my apologies for the damages caused to your goods and any inconvenience this matter may have caused you thus_far .
F	my apologies again mr ******, i have credited you pre_- pay account with £_00 . 00 should you ever wish to allow us to restore faith '
F	so having returned a smashed laptop ( worth £_000 . 00 ) they credited my account with £_00 . 00 ; notwithstanding the fact that i have already paid them £ 0 . 00 for a failed delivery , so they actually credited me £_00 . 00 to spend with them .
F	the policy of parceltogo appears to treat the customer with utter contempt and an attitude that it ’_s not our fault so we couldn ' t care less .
F	i have been insulted at every_stage by parcel0go and frankly the latest one of adding £_00 . 00 to a pre_- pay account is the final_straw , for the sake of good manners i won ’ t put into words what they can do with it !
F	original post 00 / 00 /_0000
F	almost four weeks_ago i used parcel0go to send a laptop that didn ' t arrive .
F	i was told by there staff to put in a claim after being told it was smashed in the warehouse and then being told it was lost .
F	so i filed a claim and after several weeks of going through a very difficult claims process it was finally accepted and i was offered a rather insulting £_00 . 00 despite proving the laptop was worth £_000 . 00 .
F	i wrote to parcel0go to say i was not happy with there £_00 . 00 offer which they ignored and then to my surprise the laptop was suddenly returned to me , smashed .
F	the box looked like it had been ran over and then someone wrapped lots of brown tape around it .
F	i contacted parcel0go and was told to write to them and attach photos of the cardboard_box and packaging along with photos of my smashed laptop .
F	the laptop had been well wrapped up in bubble_wrap and the cardboard_box was also well_packed with more bubble_wrap .
F	a week on and parcel0go have chosen to ignore my letter and emails , clearly in the hope i will just go away ..
F	so in short i used there service to send my laptop and four weeks_later its returned to me smashed .
F	this was not what i paid them for and i feel very let_down and will never use there service again , a very unhappy customer .
F	beach club resorts give you the opportunity to stay in a wealth of fantastic resorts , providing first - class accommodation .
F	all of our resorts offer spacious , luxury self - catering apartments .
F	fab place my daughter always enjoys getting her shoes there and when i ' m son is old enough i will be taking him too . lol
F	love this site won loads of time ' s
F	sold heavy item on ebay so booked hermes through parceltogo . co . uk .
F	on there behalf it was a great service and was collected next_day and on time and tracked throughout .
F	however as soon as it was passed_onto hermes it seemed to all go_wrong .
F	buyer emailed saying the item was heavily damaged inside and they were very dissapointed as it was a present .
F	this item was in my family many years and i am saddened to think it has been so damaged because of carelessness of the courier company .
F	the buyer now at their own cost is having to repair the item .
F	very dissappointing service and at a cheap price i thought it was too good to be true !
F	and it was !!
F	:-(
F	i have been using hostelbookers for booking hostel since 0000 and everytime i found it very user - friendly and trustworthy to use its service : no extra charge , reliable review and most_importantly , reasonable_price with good services provided by the hostels .
F	the user_interface is very user_friendly that i can find what i want easily .
F	sorting is easy , filter is easy -- everything is tailormade for users .
F	just one minor comment that i would like to make for improvement would be the function to find a particular hostel ( seems cannot do so right now to search a stay by name )
F	i have used groupon many_times and i have had a couple of issues .
F	their customer_service is fantastic and resolve my issues within 00_hours unlike wowcher who i made the mistake of using once
F	brilliant service , fast delivery , easy website to use .
F	will_definitely use again
F	booked a hotel in belfast for a overnight stay and when i phoned the hotel that day to ask about parking they had no booking for us .
F	after 0 phonecalls made to alpharooms i was advised that we had been moved to another hotel without being told even_though i had already received the accomadation voucher for the original hotel .
F	they argued that they had upgraded us from 0 star to 0 star but this was not the point as i had booked the hotel initially because of its location we had to taxi to and from the alternative hotel and were separted from the rest of the party who were staying in our chosen hotel .
F	this is my 0nd disappointment with alpharooms and if you take my advice you wouldn ' t touch them with a barge_pole , i was also out at_least £_00 on phonecalls .
F	recruit so simple is such a breath of fresh_air .
F	it ' s beautifully designed , quick to use and it just makes_sense !
F	half of our office uses macs , and the other half uses windows and it ' s so nice to have a product that just works on everything .
F	when i ' m on the train i can access everything on my phone as well .
F	the support is also pretty impressive , especially when you get a reply within 0 minutes of asking your question .
F	i get the impression that they really do care about their customers .
F	i certainly won ' t be going anywhere .
F	please do not use this company avoid_avoid_avoid !!
F	!
F	they delivered a damaged table back in august , with promises of delivering replacement parts at the time , many phone_calls and email later at christmas we was told it was no_longer available and they would arrange a collection and refund , it is now the end of march and they are now trying to say that we have to return it ourselves , it is a joke of a company !
F	what company has a customer_service department that you cannot speak to !!!
F	they cannot tell me the reason_why i have to return it because the reason is they don not want to pay for the collection .
F	please stay well clear of this company !
F	!
F	they messed_up our transfers saying it was a computer error but had rebooked them once we got to the airport they could not find the new reservation of the transfers and was told by the desk to get a taxi and claim it back when we where back home .
F	on the return transfer we waited until after 0pm to leave the hotel and again tried to claim back to claim back transfer , because they say they turned_up for the return transfer at 00 . 00pm and was told we was not ready but no one asked for us , they are refusing to help us return the loss for either transfer , we feel totally let_down by this company and would not recommend to anyone to use them and to avoid at all costs , go to a trusted website , this was extra money that we hadn ' t budgeted on spending so affected the holiday .
F	avoid_avoid_avoid !
F	!
F	this shop is excellent value , order arrived very quickly and when i reported a shortage in my order they were very efficient and posted out missing items which arrived the following_day .
F	would recommend petsupermarket to any animal owner
F	i would recommend healthysupplies to anyone .
F	the website was easy to use and delivery was very quick and well_packaged .
F	we had to order hinges for our fridge door .
F	these were dispatched very promptly and delivered when expected .
F	packaging was excellent and hinges arrived all intact .
F	no_complaints at all .
F	i was returning from holiday and my flight landed too_late for me to get back home .
F	i booked a double room for my partner and i in the travelodge near the airport .
F	on arriving i discovered it was a twin room that was absolutely freezing and had no towels .
F	when i returned home i tried to contact travelodge and their is no way of calling them .
F	i emailed them and complained about the circumstances and got a very pompous reply telling_me i was mistaked , and that i booked a twin room and if i wanted a towel i should have walked to reception to ask .
F	my partner did get a towel from reception as i had already jumped in the shower before i realised there was none .
F	even so i don ' t feel i should have had to do this in the first place .
F	they did not mention the temperature of the room .
F	as i still had my booking confirmation which showed i booked a double room , i sent them a copy to which i had no reply .
F	i had to resort to sending them a letter which i got a reply and said pretty_much the same_thing .
F	they obviously know people are not going to the effort of taking them to court for the sake of 00 pounds so just pawn you off until you stop contacting them .
F	will never stay in travelodge again and will tell others to do the same
F	bought some great shorts from asos .
F	delivered promptly with the promise of free returns if unsuitable .
F	item was a great fit and a good match to the online picture .
F	bought a cake for my daughters_birthday and it was amazing !
F	it looked so good and everyone was very impressed .
F	tasted delicious and lasted for ages .
F	would definitely recomend to others .
F	next are very reliable for deliveries .
F	they stock a wide_selection of high_quality goods and have no problem with returns and generally their employees are very friendly and helpful .
F	when i found flights to rome for 00 a head i thought it was a great deal .
F	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
F	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00 quid for a 00 kg back for check in .
F	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it ' s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
F	while the sellers themselves may be a bit_tricky sometimes .
F	ebay has a good system for it .
F	easy to use and trustworthy
F	ordered a pc from pc_world , paid for a specific delivery date .
F	( today from 0am until 0pm ) so they had a few_days to get it to me .
F	stayed in all day ( with an infant who was bored out of her mind ) and absolutely nothing .
F	i tracked it online and the last thing that came up at about 0 pm was that it was scanned as part of a secure process .
F	no phone call , no delivery .
F	so at half seven i called them to see what was going on .
F	a very miserable woman told me that they weren ' t delivering it today because it didn ' t reach the depot until 0 .
F	i told her that is not my problem , i paid for a service and you are not providing it .
F	so she blamed pc_world for not getting it to aberdeen in time .
F	in reality it was yodel who transported the pc from hatfield to aberdeen so it was yodels fault .
F	not even a hint of an_apology .
F	just , " yeah but , yeah but " when you pay for something and they simply don ' t do it and then have no reasonable explanation or apology or anything , speaking to their advisers is like speaking to a spoilt 0 year_old .
F	will not use yodel again under any circumstances and am severley p **** d off
F	zoomfish are fantastic !
F	they gave me the best quote around for my ipad 0 (£ 00 more_than all other_companies i looked at !)
F	- they also gave me extra money for liking them on facebook , bonus !
F	they are true to their word , the payment was in my account the day my parcel was received and , something most companies seem to fail on , they sent me x0 different sized envelopes so i was able to return my ipad safely and securely in the box because i had a nice large envelope to put it in - the instructions were clear , the process couldn ' t be simpler ...
F	i would recommend to anyone , in fact i already have done and i ' m foraging through my old gadgets to see what else i can recycle with them !
F	thank_you zoomfish !
F	from going in buying the couch with my partner and children , the lady in the shop made us feel extremely welcome .
F	no hard sell , just friendly advice and good to have woman to woman opinion on colours , kids , wear and tear etc .
F	everything was clearly explained , no_hidden_costs , kept us informed right up to delivery date .
F	the delivery service was excellent also , the lads where extremely_helpful and kind to my children who where very excited to see the new couch .
F	the whole experience was just easy .
F	no hassle at all and i would come back for my couch year after year without a doubt .
F	they even forwarded some advice of how to get_rid of my old couch which was another stress took off my hands .
F	my couch is pride and place of my living_room and is of excellent quality and everything i wanted .
F	so thank_you dfs !
F	!
F	no_problems whatsoever .
F	i ordered , paid same day , delivered 0 days_later .
F	no issues_whatsoever and have already planned my next purchase !
F	thank_you !
F	just wanted to share my brilliant experience with this company .
F	ordered online with ease , and found a chocolate wine ( i ' ve not seen in ages ) at the checkout .
F	delivery was next_day ( despite me only ordering the normal delivery option ).
F	the packaging was so secure that i think the box could have been run over ( agree a slight exaggeration !)
F	and the bottles would still be ok .
F	i will_definitely be ordering again !
F	!
F	i ' ve paid for a wowcher to get hair_extensions from samereh hair but have been unable to get hold of them ... they have ignored all my voicemails and their website is down and has been for weeks now .
F	i ' ve contacted_wowcher 0 times now and they keep saying they can ' t put me through to customer_services but they will contact me as it ' s an urgent matter ... 0 days_later i have still heard_nothing .
F	i have explained that i ' m getting_married in a few weeks and ( as i have no address for the people doing my hair ) will now miss my appointment and my hair will not get done unless i find a new salon and pay full price which i can ' t afford .
F	i am_disgusted that wowcher for not dealing_with this properly and i am so frustrated that i have had to waste so much time sorting this out and seem to be getting_nowhere .... is it that hard for them to contact samerah ?
F	they are doing_business with them afterall ....
F	i was a bit_skeptical_about what the quality of the shoes would be like when i placed my order .
F	the pictures on the website looked good but i couldnt help but think that for just £ 0 they would look cheap .
F	i couldnt_believe it when they arrived .
F	they were nicely boxed and placed in individual protective bags with spare heel caps .
F	the pictures didnt do the shoes justice as they looked much_nicer in real_life and looked much more_expensive .
F	i am very pleased with the service to as you were kept up to date with where your package was and when it would arrive .
F	i recieved my order 0 days after_placing my order .
F	will_definatley use again : )
F	bargain price and fast postage .
F	very pleased thankyou
F	their customer_service is excellent and they were super helpful when i ordered the wrong_size of shoe .
F	they also had very , very speedy_delivery !
F	i ' d had some diamond earrings reset here around 0 months_ago , during which they ' d been really helpful with the new settings , what material was appropriate for the size of the diamonds etc .
F	my fiancé recently proposed with a plain placeholder ring , so i went on the alba_rose website and discovered their online interactive tool .
F	we then went to a store to look at the samples ring ( made up with cheap metal and cubic zirconia ).
F	i wanted a change made so my wedding_band would sit flush against my engagement_ring , so they sent the sample ring to their workshop so i could see the change i was requesting in real_life before we ordered .
F	they also ordered into the store various size / quality combinations of diamonds ( all a similar price ) to see which one we liked the best - we went into the store and they showed us how to properly look at a diamond under magnification - we went for smaller but better quality .
F	all of this was free of charge .
F	we then ordered the ring on a bespoke basis and they pushed it through quickly for me in just over a week .
F	i ' m so impressed with their service , their pricing is very reasonable comparatively as you ' re going directly to the manufacturer and the finished_product is beautiful .
F	i ' ve already_recommended them to a friend who wanted an_alternative quote for some pearl earrings she ' d seen in hatten garden , and they ' ve come in much more cheaply and are ordering her in different_types of pearls to choose from ( as they did with diamonds for my engagement_ring ).
F	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
F	i purchased a my little pony t - shirt for a birthday_present and didn ' t really want to pay the £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery so i just opted for the normal first_class delivery .
F	omg !
F	i recieved the t - shirt the next_day !
F	i can ' t fault the guys at truffle_shuffle they did me proud and the gift reciever loved her t - shirt soooo much .
F	it was well_packaged and of course i had fun nibbling the sweets that came with the item !
F	my family received nothing for christmas as a result of ordering from this company .
F	i ' m not someone who can normally afford to buy flowers in any case , so when i discovered that my flowers had not been delivered and then found them uncontactable i was naturally very disappointed .
F	please do not use this company .
F	at_least my parents got to see a picture of what they would have looked like and appreciated the sentiment .
F	such a waste of money for effectively thin_air !
F	one word to describe your service …‘ awesome ’ discreet packaging , a free gift , great products and fast delivery – i really couldn ’ t ask for more especially when buying intimate items .
F	i rang the customer helpline to ask for advice on an item and they were really helpful , polite and knowledgably .
F	i was updated via_email with the status of my package from ‘ pending ’ to ‘ processing ’ to ‘ dispatched .’ i asked for next_day delivery and goods arrived the next_day in perfect_condition and were delivered by royal_mail .
F	when i opened the box i found everything had been wrapped up in the company ’_s tissue_paper and i was just so excited to get tearing into it to see what i would find first .
F	all the items arrived in good condition .
F	i received an_email two days after my delivery stating i had £ 0 . 00 to spend in loyalty_points .
F	in a nutshell , great service and i look_forward to purchasing from your website again .
F	my boyfriend , kory , has always been a health buff so naturally i jumped on the band wagon .
F	i previously shopped at stores like gnc and vitamin shop , which were great but really hard to keep up with the bills !
F	supplmentwarehouse . com encourages me to keep up with my nutrition and health goals through discounted prices .
F	balance is everything in both health and checkbooks .
F	i ordered a pair of guess prescription_sunglasses and was completely_satisfied with both the service and product .
F	ordering was straight_forward .
F	i would happily buy again .
F	great price , even better service . thanks
F	appalling - please do not use if you expect a collection .
F	drop_off may be reasonable but staying in for two 00hr windows is not acceptable .
F	thank_you cell0get for making this easy for me !
F	you were easy and very nice when i called .
F	i ' ll be telling my friends .
F	best company to buy lenses from - fast delivery and good prices .
F	i keep_coming_back to them when i need more .
F	fantastic service !!
F	!
F	sent phone in freepost_bag on sat 00th_june - money in bank on 00th !
F	!
F	thank_you !
F	order arrived in super_quick time .
F	i have used medicanimal for over 0 years , having a dog with special dietary requirements .
F	initial problems with dented tins has been resolved .
F	dispatch is always timely and if i ' ve ever had need to phone through with a query , staff were helpful .
F	if you buy two of the same product you get 00_%_off the second item .
F	worth it if you have the space to store !
F	i could not be_happier with the service .
F	i browsed for possible christmas_presents and ended_up buying quite a bit .
F	the pricing was very good , ease to find things were very good , delivery timing was brilliant !
F	!
F	i have recommended to family and friends !
F	we ordered the janna invites and reply cards , and they were amazing .
F	the colours were exactly like you see on the computer screen .
F	the whole site is classy and very easy to follow .
F	the way the prices are shown are easily to follow and makes_sense .
F	we booked this trip in january and a week before the trip my grandmother passed away i dealt_with customer_service who were understanding and attentive .
F	the trip went well and without issue everything went_smoothly .
F	would cerstianly use again and reccomend .
F	the money i was offered wasn ' t great , i sold 00 cd ' s and got £_00 . 00 !!
F	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
F	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn ' t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly .... you know they ' ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
F	i posted my old phone monday money in my bank_account tuesday_afternoon !
F	service !
M	more_than pleased !
M	many_thanks .
M	:)
M	service was so easy to use , got an excellent price for my old phone and very professional in terms of updates of when they recieve your phone .
M	will certainly use again .
M	used chilli_sauce for a stag_do , would highly_recommend , all events was well_organised and the hotel was in a good location .
M	what can i say , it just kind of kicked ass .
M	not only did they have a very cheap guitar pack ( i payed less for a guitar , amp , lead , tuner , strings and picks than i did for just the cheapest guitar i could find in australia !
M	), but it ' s all of a decent quality .
M	although they forgot to send the lead with the pack one quick email was all it took and they sent one to be delivered they day after , no questions_asked !
M	and speaking of delivery , it arrived very quickly .. great stuff !
M	love the fact this company makes it so we dont get locked into a long service , when better ones are showing up everyday thanks imie and absinthe :_d
M	just sold iphone_0s it was great , quick .
M	got argos_vouchers which meant i got a bit more but you can ' t spend them online .
M	think that ' s argos ' s fault tho not envirofone .
M	convenient and easy .
M	website provided good information on the location .
M	good stuff .
M	i had a great experience with these_guys , they kept me up to date with loads of emails and texts to let me know exactly ( to the hour ) when my parcel was coming so that i could make_sure i was in the house to recieve it and didn ' t miss it .
M	not only that but the service was really quick and within 00_hours of ordering , i had the product in my hands !
M	to top it all off , the product i ordered was in top condition and exceeded my expectations in quality .
M	overall , literally no_complaints but plenty of praise - 000_% the best online buying experience i ' ve ever had !
M	( no exaggeration needed )
M	they were very fast in posting everything , it was a very simple procedure and overall i was impressed .

M	moved to orange .

M	i was going to give 0_stars because every now and again i got a problem with my order .. but then i realize that all the problems i had it was never the website ' s fault , and always due to some problem ( most being lack of drivers ) of the shop that i ordered the food .
M	so hungryhouse has achieve what it was supposed to be .
M	an easy to use website with plenty of associated shops to chose from wherever you are in uk ...
M	and the new feature ( express delivery in 00_minutes or money back ) works_perfectly and the customer_service is not bad either !
M	had no_problems at all . extremely quick delivery .
M	excellen choice and service for all_sorts of items .
M	good returns_policy as well

M	i always use amazon , i also have no problem using any of their third_party sellers because the service is always good .
M	this company is second to none , a caring approach which is lacking is similar companies .
M	i have been using this company for many years as i care for my elderly parents , they are always caring , friendly and are willing to go the extra_mile .
M	when im away from home i have used the website to order the stuff i need for my parents and it has always arrived in good time .
M	i am on first name terms with the staff at the branch i visit , and its this personal_touch that keeps me coming_back and i wouldn ' t ever go anywhere_else .
M	a genuinely good company , so rare these days .
M	the service and product are both first_class !
M	my wife loves her solitaire engagement_ring which would have been at_least twice the price from a national high_street jeweller .
M	there is no need to worry_about ordering online as everything is 000_% genuine and trustworthy - i did have some intrepidations beforehand .
M	i have had the ring independantly valued at beav ******* ks when we took it in to get cleaned prior to the wedding and they commented how nice the ring was and asked where i got it from .
M	comes with certification .
M	i have recommended it to friends already !
M	!
M	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for all my strength training needs .
M	their variety of supplements and whats better_than free shipping , free products !.
M	supplementwarehouse . com will_continue to have my business for as long as live .
M	i would recommend their services to anyone for their supplement_needs .
M	not one glitch , great communication and the product is exactly as i spec ' d and paid for !
M	buy from pc_specialist - they get my highest recommendation !
M	this is the worst company ever !!
M	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don ' t give you your moneys_worth .
M	i have been with t - mobile for several years now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
M	normally you would get full network when your in a open space but on the other handy my network_coverage is always being cut_off .
M	sometimes i cant make a phone call because there ' s something wrong with the server .
M	my phone_calls always being cut mid way through a important to professional people or just general conversations to my friends .
M	and then at the end of the month t - mobile then want to charge me a ridiculous_amount of money for my monthly plan that i haven ' t even been able to you use to the full extent .
M	t - mobile , you are ripp offs we should compensated for are losses and inconveniences !!
M	there customer_service is just as bad with there rude members off staff that don ' t even seem to bothered to help you when your asking for a little assistants , and most of them cant even speak understandable english with there heavy accents , because it seems like i speaking to someone on the other side of the world .
M	and don ' t think when it comes to the end of my contract i will hesitate to leave your useless company !
M	!
M	if you can be bother to get back to me ( which i doubt ), email me on ; samanthajs0 @ yahoo ,. com
M	miss samantha .
M	good value , great product and speedy service !
M	sell your laptop offered the best price for the laptop and it was also pleasing to note that profits are treated as charity donations .
M	i would have no_hesitation of using this service again .
M	after booking the services required i tried printing off the labels .
M	i had trouble because my printer died to put it simply lol .
M	after getting home i asked [_name ] ( not me lol ) if he could refund me the full_amount .
M	it was done without any trouble and we had a little laugh afterwards as well
M	i love playing with my ferrofluid !
M	it ' s so much fun and all my friends are so impressed .
M	i also love my magnetic putty !
M	it ' s really ralaxing to play with .
M	my first cold steel espada came blunt & scratched but they sent me a replacement straight_away which was high_quality !
M	great customer_service .

M	great range of products available too .
M	very impressive .

M	these earplugs have made the world of difference to me at night .
M	i ' m a very light sleeper & would be woken up several_times during the night before i purchased these wonderful comfy earplugs !
M	00 out of ten for me !
M	thank_you snorestore :)
M	it ' s a great service and was impressed with the speedy email with my 0000 ms points code !
M	thanks gamesbites !
M	i will definatly be using your service again and i will also recommend to friends !
M	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
M	when my order arrived poorly packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn ' t very happy !
M	great service provided , item arrived in as_described condition and on time .
M	had no_problems and would use again to get a good price .
M	i have discussed with 00 + oisc registered immigration consultant , no one was confident on my case , ( i had long absent 000_+ days contentious at one stretch due to my father illness ), most of them suggested me to go for extension rather_than ilr .
M	but , when i spoke to ali & vaibhav , they were highly confident and realistic approach ( they have successfully dealt_with many similar case ) .
M	i am glad i have come_across with imperial , otherwise i would have to wait for 0 more years for my ilr and addition tier_0 renew ( with cost of 0k tax to my pocket ) .
M	i have got my ilr on compassionate ground on someday at croydon peo .
M	thanks to ali who spend all day along with me in croydon peo , and vaibhav highly experienced consultant who advised me and gave confidence at every_stage .
M	i highly_recommend there service , 0 star is very less
M	ordered my game on saturday game arrived first_class tuesday .
M	really easy ordering system and they accept paypal how good is that !!
M	awesome :-)
M	purchased a few things now and so far , i ' ve not had a single hiccup with the service , and each purchase has been available immediately .
M	fantastic service and i ' m sure i ' ll be using again and again , keep up the good work cjs .
M	god pice and quick delivery , all you need this days
M	a good and fast service .
M	the customer_service was great , the virtual terminal did the job i was looking for , just found a cheaper service else where .
M	i remember when signing_up to payment_sense i was told i could terminate the contract anytime .
M	so emailed to cancel my service to be told i have to pay for the next 0 months , this is very annoying , as i can ' t use the account but still being charged .
M	it may only be £_00 but its a little harsh to charge me for something , i can no_longer use .
M	i needed a powerboard for my tv ( fix # 0 lasted some months , but a chip blew and that was getting silly ).
M	lg were useless .
M	lg official engineers quoted £_000 for entire internals ( as that is what they could get from lg - i think the tv cost £_000 ).
M	flattvparts . co . uk had the powerboard , dave confirmed it was correct and i received it the next morning .
M	excellent service !
M	thank_you :)
M	stuart
M	i have always bought phone cases for my iphone but i found mendmyi on google and the service provided was absolutely superb !!
M	i would recommend them to anyone .
M	everybody asks about where i got it customised .
M	i love it !
M	!
M	a + for this team .
M	bewarr everybody .
M	this company has taken payment from my account and the goods have not been delivered .
M	it has been over two_weeks since they took payment , and they haven ' t replied to emails or telephone call ever .
M	have alerted american_express fraud department and they are following it up , and said that necessary compensation will be sought .
M	just wish i had read some of the reviews on here before purchasing .
M	good tender steaks , huge chicken_breasts all delivered on time .
M	saw these fitflop due shoes at full price .
M	i ' m usually 0 . 0 shoe size but tried them in a shop and they were big .
M	i ordered the 0 and they were great even for my larger left foot .

M	pre_- ordered the last of us from simplygames as it was the cheapest price around and still came with the pre_- order dlc .
M	received notification when the game was shipped and it arrived a day early !
M	received the code for the dlc via_email which was sent out almost_instantly .
M	after pre_- ordering from several different retailers in the past that had a ' guaranteed launch day delivery ' for games only for them to arrive a few_days late .
M	was very pleased when simplygames were the first to actually honour that promise .
M	couldn ' t ask for an easier transaction and would definitely_recommend the company to anyone .
M	bf0 worked in seconds !!
M	!
M	i just wanted to thank_you for the outstanding service i received when purchasing my wedding_ring .
M	having rung up at 0pm , i was very impressed to get straight through to a real_person at this time of evening .
M	furthermore marianne could not have been more helpful answering all my questions with authority and professionalism .
M	once the ring had been ordered , it was posted out the very next_day and i received it the following_day .
M	although the ring was just what i wanted , it was a fraction too small .
M	however , the service provided by marlows was again second to none ; the ring was resized at no extra_cost and was back with me within three days .
M	i would like to congratulate marlow ' s on their excellent customer_service and products .
M	literally the worst customer care skills in the history of the world .
M	do not use this company for anything , ever .
M	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .
M	this company have obviously never_heard of customer care and they dont deserve to be recognised as a supplement selling business .
M	stay_away at all costs !
M	a very good selection and fast efficient service
M	ordered a quantity of film only to realise the breakdown was wrong - i emailed a request to change the breakdown of film type and they immediately responded .
M	i also received my film the very next_day - awesome .
M	needed a new headphone lead , they had it in stock and was delivered to me 00hrs later .
M	the free sweets was a nice_touch .
M	will buy from again !

M	pingligt !!!
M	!
M	0 . : når_man bestiller en ( hvad man forventer at være en_god bøf ) som medium , så skal den også være det .
M	- det kunne jeg gøre bedre selv !
M	0 . : der_er åbenbart også forskelsbehandling på servicen om man betaler med kreditkort / kontant mod at man betaler med_et giftvoucher .
M	vinen var dog rigtig_god .
M	bestilte et sæt sko , overførte penge til deres konto med_min netbank , og_havde skoene 0 hverdage efter .
M	leveringstid lige efter mit hoved .
M	vil varmt_anbefale dem .
M	arrived quickly with no_problems .
M	muscle_foods quite literally have the best service going .
M	there isnt a bad_word i can say about the quality of the products , the flexibility of their service , or the customer care standards .
M	i have sampled a variety of products from top quality chicken to addictive nut butters , and all surpass my expectations .
M	thanks for the constant premium service you provide , i see no reason to ever buy my meat from a supermarket again :) i recommend to all my clients ( as a pt ), and almost all of them are converts to the gospel of muscle_foods !
M	best price out there for ghd ' s ( bought for my wife for xmas , hope she ' s not reading this .......) and were delivered within a couple of days - thoroughly_recommended , and will_definitely use again !
M	thanks :-)
M	great and fast option
M	excellent print quality , customer_service and very well_packaged !
M	after checking several places in and around london and a few online we came_across just poles .
M	we rang them several_times to ask for advice and they were always friendly and helpful .
M	the price was great so we placed an order and awaited the curtains .
M	there was a fair lead time but i guess they ' re pretty busy and we weren ' t in a rush .
M	when the curtains arrived we were delighted by the quality and how great they look in our living_room .
M	all in all a very good company that we ' d fully recommend !
M	adzuna is a really simple site to use and it gives you accurate search_results for property ( or jobs and cars ) without asking you too many questions first .
M	i think that this is important because often you don ' t want to spend time with lots of filters before you find the property you want to look at .
M	i really like the friend map_feature where you can see where your friends on facebook hang out also , it makes property search a lot more engaging and relevant to you .
M	overall , i would definitely_recommend .
M	it ' s easy to use and gives you the information you want very quickly .
M	i ' ve dealt_with aquatics warehouse on a couple of occasions now and can ' t complain_about the service i ' ve received .
M	the customer_service is excellent , the response time to email correspondence is very quick and even after some time from first buying something from the company and inquiring about a new part i needed they remembered me and were able to send the part free of charge .
M	one of the best companies i ' ve dealt_with over the internet .
M	prices are very reasonable and they have a great variety of stock .
M	fully recommend their service , thanks guys !
M	recommend the company to anyone .
M	there ' s always good offers , plenty to choose from and hassle_free ordering with very quick delivery .
M	can ' t complain !
M	i can not believe_how bad the customer_service has been with tap portugal .
M	they lost my luggage on a flight from the uk to brazil , and nobody tried to help , answered the phone or replied to my emails .
M	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0 weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
M	as for the flight - the plane was fairly old with a ' entertainment ' that was awful for a 00 hour flight , and uncomfortable seats .
M	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
M	i ordered this globe 0 - 0 weeks before fathers day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
M	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn ' t arrive .
M	i decided to email globee to find out what was happening with my order .
M	after 0 weeks they still didn ' t even bother to reply .
M	i have now emailed them to cancel the order , as i ' m not confident whether this is even a genuine retailer .
M	really really disappointed with the service .
M	don ' t waste your time with globee !
M	i purchased a samsung 00 " led_tv from pixmania as the price was very good .
M	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
M	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains lead , just a 0 pin continental plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
M	there is no uk tuner facility which means no freeview hd .
M	i ' m sending this tv back , and will not be dealing_with pixmania again , as the goods are not as_described .
M	very misleading and very poor service .
M	really happy with the quality of service offered by g wizz , who sub contract our work out to city_link and ups at amazingly competitive rates .
M	we have now been using them for a year and are delighted .
M	any_problems with the actual carriers are handled for you , and all claims have been dealt_with , on items for which we have taken out their insurance option , which is unheard of with couriers .
M	great service - keep up the good work !
M	!
M	i went in to the store after seeing a tv on their website and phoning the store .
M	the salesman was really helpful and explained about the tv and told me that there was a free 0 year guarantee if i purchase the item in the store .
M	i went in and had a full demo of what the tv could do and there was even free 0d glasses as well .
M	well_done and thank_you to paul who helped_me
M	ordered twice now for in store collection .
M	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
M	for a company that bleats on about how great their customer_service is , disappointing_experience both_times i ' ve been in to collect .
M	arrange pick_up for southampton now !
M	!
M	great service when buying from there preferred seller for certain music - indigostarfish . they have delivered cd ' s within 0 days on 0 occasions without having to pay the extra fast delivery charge .
M	ordered a dyson vacuum on there website at 0pm and it was delivered to me the very next_day before 00am !
M	! what service - and the delivery was completely free . sent me my tracking_number which was deliverd by ups .
M	great to deal with . thanx
M	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
M	technical problems their end prevented both of my credit / debit_cards working , it would not connect to the 0 d secure screen and they would not accept my payment , nor would they accept payment over the phone .
M	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem ... which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
M	then the cd players disappeared out of my basket , and into another persons !
M	at that point , after contacting their levenshulme store again for the umpteenth time and complained as i had been the first person to try and buy these , " riz " confirmed that their technical_team had identified a fault connecting with the 0 d secure payment stage and that this other person couldn ' t pay for these either .
M	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
M	there was talk of taking the item off sale or refunding the new buyer if the payment went through .
M	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
M	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn ' t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
M	thanks a bunch
M	update 00 - 00 - 00 -
M	my issue was never resolved .
M	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
M	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
M	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
M	i suggested to resolve the issue , i should have those at the same price that i should have been able to buy the original items i wanted , that their website prevented me from doing in the first place , as they were basically the same .
M	this should have been fair_enough , even if it did cost them a bit of money , they created this issue after all - that is if they gave a toss about customer_service of course .
M	they refused .
M	they basically on the phone said they had " tried and failed to appease me and resolve the issue ".
M	the most dire customer_service i have ever received in my life .
M	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally ignored too .
M	i am still struggling to believe a huge company , sponsoring a premier league football team , can treat people like this when they have cocked up all along .
M	a score of 0 on this site , scraping acceptable , is pretty bad and it shows that their priority is money money money - not customer_service .
M	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!
M	oh and they still_haven ' t explained why they originally couldn ' t simply take the items off their website until the payment part of their site was fixed .
M	really unhappy with this whole experience which was completely preventable by cash_converters and has marred previously pretty good experiences of using them .
M	a shame .
M	bought a cd_player on their website , but the cd_player sent was different to the one described on their website , it was a lesser model .
M	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
M	i had nothing back from them .
M	i eventually had to go through paypal just to get the small discount i requested .
M	then a couple of weeks_later the cd_player , that was sent incorrectly , failed on me and no_longer powered on .
M	i emailed the store again - asking what the warranty is on these items , again completely_ignored .
M	i also emailed their head_office - completely_ignored .
M	so i have not only been basically sent the wrong item , it has failed on me within 0 or 0 weeks of barely any use .
M	i have sent numerous_emails to the store and their head_office and i have had not even 0 word back from them ..... shocking .
M	i would ring the store but i am that wound up about it i am worried_about losing my temper over the phone .
M	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown away my money .
M	thanks very much .
M	ordered some sound magic headphones recently , website was excellent , great detail in the products i was interested in , easy_navigation through products and website in general , quick and easy order / payment process and to top it off next_day delivery .
M	thanks very much guys keep up the good work .
M	will_definatley be purchasing products from here again
M	i had no_idea what i was doing , all i wanted was my website set_up in the root directory .
M	000 made it easier than wordpress own 0 minute set - up .
M	once i got through on the live_chat ( that took about 0 minutes , but i am pretty relaxed , i went and had some tea ) bogdan came on and made everything work for me .
M	he even explained why it wasn ' t working in a way that i could understand !
M	i would recommend 000 to anyone
M	our designer was [_name ], he did an excellent job with our template design , extremely_helpful and co - operative .
M	good communication_throughout the whole_process , [_name ] kept us updated at all times !
M	really pleased with our design and outcome .
M	the software is really good , allows the addition of promos in different locations and bulk revisions .
M	professional designer and company .
M	next_day delivery no problem !
M	no stupid excuses about the weather , just got my item here on time & in perfect_condition .
M	thanks !
M	will be using you again in the new year !
M	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
M	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
M	excellent service and an amazing stag_do in krakow .
M	we couldnt have asked for more , top work all_round .
M	the venue and organisation was top_notch , we felt looked after every_step of the way .
M	i will be recommending them in future to everyone !
M	thanks !
M	!
M	i needed 0 new front_tyres for my vauxhall meriva .
M	i have gone with blackcircles for my previous tyres but etyres . co . uk had the same ' c ' rated tyres for a much_better price so i went with them .
M	they came to my work and fitted the tyres saving me the bother of taking the car to the garage .
M	would highly_recommend .
M	firstly - it is disgraceful that you can only write comments if you are satisfied .
M	so repairs0 block out comments if they do not like them ?
M	?
M	they kept my phone for 0 weeks when they promise to repair in one day .
M	it then took them another 0 weeks to refund my money .
M	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
M	they told me a week_later they were awaiting a part and the phone would be with me by the end of the week .
M	this came and went , and i called to chase .
M	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .
M	again nothing .
M	i was then told that they had no_idea when they would get parts in and i had to wait indefinitely .
M	they finally sent the phone back to me on 00th_november , it took them until the 0th_december to refund my money .
M	they constantly promised that a manager would call me back but never did , and they ignored all of my emails .
M	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
M	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
M	they will also promise to refund , and then will not investigate for 00 working_days if anything goes wring .
M	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
M	i look_forward to seeing them on watchdog .
M	i can ' t fault physio supplies in any way , everything was easy to find , order and pay ; my order arrived on time , all correctly packaged , and the product is of very good quality .
M	would use again , definitely .
M	fastkeys have been fantastic .
M	order placed at 00pm , despatched next_day , arrived the day after .
M	can ' t complain and fantastic helpful service !
M	will_definitely use again and recommend them to our internal buying department and maintenance team !
M	i received my print within 00 from ordering .
M	very easy to use website !
M	i will be back !
M	i ordered my smurfette soft toy on friday and it was delivered by saturday .
M	the customer_service lady rebecca was really helpful and i felt that she went out of her way to help me .
M	excellent service , email_updates regarding the order and fast delivery - definately_recommend ...
M	mp0 player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
M	utterly disappointed ... my kid was like - what the **** is this ?
M	its useless !
M	cheaper , dispatched earlier and delivered on time !
M	free delivery and easy to return if unwanted .
M	customer_service is amazing too .
M	thanks deep_blue outstanding service and pricing as always .
M	i ordered this the day before i was going on a stag_do at 0pm and was worried that the next_day it wouldn ' t arrive but i was wrong it did .
M	absolutley amazing couldn ' t believe my eyes when it arrived .
M	will definateley order from them again .
M	making the order was so easy i spoke to a scottish guy who was very friendly and informative , mclachann was his name i believe .
M	arrived at the airport , very friendly chauffeur collected my vehicle ( considering the time ) and i as lucky_enough on return to have the same chauffeur bring my car back to me .
M	would be more_than happy to use again in the future .
M	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
M	this is not myproteins fault !
M	but
M	i have emailed them twice , in regards to my missing item and have had no response , hermes who delivered my item responded within 00_hours advising me to contact myprotein , as they will not deal with me directly .
M	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
M	i have been using myprotein for easily around 0 years , and have never had a problem , their customer_service is normally excellent .
M	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
M	bought a copy of battlefield_0 limited_edition russian_version as i missed out when game was released and wanted the extra perks of the game .
M	after paying received code in less_than 0 minutes if not instant activated and started installing .
M	changed language to english and started_playing no_problems and for those interested the physical warfare pack is included with the russian_version its the same key as the main game unlike_other_places who have to email you a seperate key , will_definitely buy from again .
M	:)
M	great price_match option , got what i wanted for cheaper just by copying the url .
M	also had all the sugar free syrup flavors i was looking for in one place .
M	it ' s a real_shame so many companies choose to use yodel .
M	i ' ve had the misfortune of dealing_with them after buying goods from both ' very ' and ' carphone_warehouse '.
M	they really don ' t do good service , or to think of it , anything at all .
M	it ' s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
M	it has to be said , the brand itself is pretty_cool , but what good is a catchy brand name when the service ' delivered ' or in this case not , is nothing but appalling .
M	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has been a multitude of problems .
M	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn ' t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
M	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play football and other sports activities with the parcels .
M	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let ' s say a more rounded design .
M	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
M	the only positive thing is that i ' m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
M	ok yodel , so on your website you say :
M	we look different and feel different because at yodel we truly believe there ' s a better way of delivering .
M	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
M	and at yodel , we have the scale and capacity to make it happen .
M	and we do so with a smile !
M	you certainly do believe that there ' s a better way of delivering don ' t you .
M	i ' d probably stick with the old concept of getting a parcel from a to b , in one piece and on time .
M	we want and need our parcels on time .
M	we don ' t need late or missed deliveries , damaged goods , rude and unhelpful staff etc .
M	you don ' t make it happen and i ' ve never seen a smile .
M	you might be laughing to yourselves when you see the company profits .
M	most of us have to laugh , else we ' d probably cry .
M	... maybe revise your ' about us section '?
M	oh and this did make me laugh ( also from your website )
M	' at yodel we really give you something to shout about .'
M	- yes yodel , yes you do .
M	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
M	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
M	thanks yodel , i hope that i never have to deal with you ever again .
M	i really cannot_praise printing . com enough .
M	they were reccomended to me by a friend who had used them several_times before .
M	as a result of hearing such good things , i used them to print all of my promotional work for a uk tour i was producing .
M	i remember smiling continuously when the print arrived as the quality was absolutely exceptionl on every_single item , from the a0 flyers to the ao posters .
M	the service and professionalism of the company and the wonderful jonathan cobb was second to none , everything was made easy , everything was exceptional value and most_importantly the work was simply brilliant .
M	have always reccomended anyone use these_guys as you can ' t go_wrong !
M	thank_you printing . com !
M	richard from the sales_team kept me in the loop all the way .
M	spoke to the guys in glasgow to check the specs .
M	great price , next delivery , no beef whatsoever !
M	i ' ll be using this site again for stuff in the future .
M	nice one everyone !
M	spink out
M	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
M	wrote a little message for my mum .
M	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
M	0 .
M	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
M	0 .
M	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
M	0 .
M	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
M	0 .
M	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
M	0 .
M	there was no card or message on the flowers .
M	0 .
M	they are small and pathetic
M	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
M	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
M	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
M	i would use them again a +
M	brilliant web_site , easy and encouraging to use .
M	plenty of support available .
M	i was sceptical at first , given the low price but the end product was brilliant .
M	the sizing and the colouring were perfect .
M	if i could suggest an improvement about anything it would be to offer a personal consultation / design service for £_00 - 00 quid .
M	word of warning though make_sure uploaded images are high_quality and not cropped and resized to much otherwise they will come out pixelated .
M	thank_you .
M	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
M	no contact with the mods or site owner since saturday - phone has been missing for over a week !
M	does look like they even have insurance for anything like scams ridiculous !
M	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
M	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
M	i made a cash withdrawal for £ 0000 a week_ago and still_haven ' t been paid it .
M	they say the withdrawal has been processed and i need to chase it up with my bank .
M	i ' ve done this and they can ' t see any credits pending which i ' ve told betfair and they say it ' s not their problem as they ' ve processed the withdrawal .
M	great , how the hell am i supposed to get my £ 0000 ???
M	?
M	on the 00th_june i bought a golf belt which should have been delivered within 0 - 0 days and now 00 days and still no sign of it .
M	i have contacted dpd who say they have never received anything and all clubhouse golf do is direct you to their pathetic tracking_system .
M	i ' ve now escalated this problem to paypal trying to get my money back but still clubhouse golf are failing to respond .
M	absolutely_shocking service and i warn anyone away from using this website !
M	this company is absolutely_terrible !
M	i purchased a gigantic piano keyboard for £_00 . 00 for my 0 year_old_son to open on christmas day and when we did it was not only damaged but it was broke .
M	i immediately emailed them and was told i would be contacted in 0 working_days .
M	that was nearly 0 weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven ' t heard_anything .
M	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
M	i am now going to take some type legal_action_against them to stop them getting away with this with other people .
M	couldn ' t fault the service provided as product arrived on time and it was exactly how described .
M	i ordered the game and paid by bank_transfer which got approve in record time , but unfortunately it was out stock .
M	however by the time i came back the next_day it was back in stock and before the game was released so i still got the pre order bonus very happy customer :_d
M	the selection was great .
M	various sizes and able to order large quantity as it was in stock .
M	i was amazed at the speed of delivery , within 00_hours .
M	and products were packed nicely .
M	i ordered the lens late on the sunday_night , and received the lens in great condition on the tuesday , can ' t fault the transaction at all !
M	the item was received very quickly and without any_problems , definitely worth it
M	the shoes fit exactly as the description said , they turned_up on time and there were no issues in the process .
M	very happy customer .
M	as a returning customer , i knew what i was signing_up for and always , thoroughly pleased .
M	bought a wd mybook live duo .
M	price was the best around , tracking_information was supplied promptly and the delivery was quick .
M	the guy almost dropped it at the doorstep , but i can ' t pin that on kikatek .
M	all_round happy customer .
M	went on the website to purchase a parcel , decided to use the live_chat to get some information , and i spoke to katie , who was very helpful and efficient !
M	i would really recommend the website and the live support , and for katie ' s service i ' m sure she should get an award !
M	she was very polite and responded well to all the queries i had about the website , thank_you katie !
M	i have been returning to as for over two years now .
M	i have never had anything but top_class service , honest advice and always recommend them to my friends and family .
M	words won ' t do justice to how happy i am with their service .
M	keep up the brilliant work .
M	thanks guys
M	naveen

M	everything i ' ve purchased has arrived exactly as expected , when i was told it would be delivered .
M	i ' ve even expressly asked for something that wasn ' t on their website ( 000ml snake oil ) and this was ordered in specifically as per my request .
M	can ' t fault the service , the guys seem to be around to answer your queries all the time .
M	great job guys !
M	can ' t wait for new e_- liquids .
M	had encountered an issue with the wrong type of quickdraws shipped , the problem was solved promptly and leaved me totally satisfied .
M	i ' m confident to be their customer in the future .
M	i recently contacted adband regarding a possible donation to our charity event .
M	since then they have been so helpful .
M	their customer_service is fantastic and they are so quick to reply to any_questions .
M	also there products , in our case silicone wristbands look amazing .
M	thank_you so much adband !!
M	would 000_% recommend
M	i had the phone and ipad fixed first with a stall in my local market trying to support local traders ...
M	this was no good the screen lifted from the phone and the ipad cracked as it was weak already in my opinion , i then sent both devices to gloopy where i have now had them back for a year and fixed now i am selling both devices for upgrades :_d awesome customer care and very organised as these kind if services are alien to us public it ' s nice to know every_step of your repair .
M	collected and delivered the goods on time .
M	was kept_informed of the progress throughout .
M	very professional .
M	a ++
M	bought pink tickets at the o0_arena , london for the 00 / 00 /_0000 for my wife last christmas .
M	spent £_000 .
M	tickets were unsuccessfully delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 by royal_mail ( 0 days before the show ) to the wrong_address after i did an address change on their website 0 weeks previous after lots of worry_about not being home .
M	went to collect tickets next_day from royal_mail who stated i had to wait 00_hours before collection .
M	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
M	after 0 calls to viagogo , and promised call_backs from a senior_manager ( which did not happen ) i was told just to " sort it out " as there was no other way to get into gig even_though ticketmaster offer a re - print on their website .
M	viagogo had no further details of the ticket to pass to me ( seat number , row , ticket number etc ...)
M	had to cancel train tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
M	picked_up tickets saturday_morning from royal_mail to discover the seats advertised as " side view " are actually " rear side view " mis_- sold as far as i am concerned .
M	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
M	follow me on twitter @ danryanskinner to share your experiences of @ viagogo so we can protect others in the future of this awful service .
M	i have brought many items from just golf and i have had no_problems .
M	quick delivery , brand_names and cheap prices what more could you ask for .
M	the website offered exactly the service i was looking for and paid me promptly for my items .
M	excellent .
M	cjs_keys is the best website for cd_keys .
M	the prices for all games are best bar non and the auto_key service means you can get your key straight_away unlike_other_websites .
M	would recommend to any gamers or movie fan .
M	have used these chaps a couple of times - great range of shades , really helpful staff , amazingly quick delivery and spot on prices .
M	can ' t recommend them enough .
M	after accidentally recieving a car_park ticket at an asda carpark i found their customer_service was terrible .
M	i ' m £_00 out of pocket and they don ' t care about thier customers .
M	store manager mike doidge - rude and not helpful .
M	customer_service advisor mary - ann lied to me and couldn ' t help
M	customer_service manager william hayton - didn ' t even phone back
M	0 days_later after i sent an_email_stating i wasn ' t going to be a customer anymore i recieved a call off someone called rob who wouldn ' t even tell me his full name and he was as useful as a choclolate tea pot .
M	don ' t shop at asda !!
M	!
M	ordered a few items from ffx tools and the delivery was speedy with great quality items .
M	absolutely perfect .
M	i sent the phone on the friday and got paid on the monday .
M	no reservations_about recommending them to anyone and they paid more_than mazuma and envirofone .
M	superb and would trade with them again for sure .
M	this company has recently changed it ' s online pricing so that you can see the actual cost including taxes .
M	before it was very frustrating getting a ' bargain ' only to then have taxes , fees , baggage fees , seat fees etc added at the end , so well_done for the change .
M	i flew from leeds to southampton and back with them and on the journey back , our flight was going to be cancelled , however , they instead let us on a scottish flight and made a stop at leeds for us !
M	fantastic customer_service .
M	i would use them again .
M	i have been a customer of the production_room for a very long time and i will always be one .
M	they are the only shop where when i go in , the staff will shake my hand and remember my name ( and even remember me when i phone up ).
M	this is excellent customer_service in anyone ' s book .
M	they often do product demonstrations and have an excellent array of equipment to try out in store .
M	it is very important to support local businesses like these when there are so many competitors and i like shopping there .
M	if i ' ve ever had any_problems with gear purchased , it has been sorted without an issue .
M	the only_drawback is the lack of extended_warranty ( for what they are worth ) which is not offered here .
M	i ' m so glad i found lexmark .
M	after years of fighting with hp printers and spending endless money on cartridges i finally found the prestige pro 000 printer with really cheap ink and a decent cost for the printer .
M	everything works , delivery is quick and i am a very happy customer .
M	what a joke - since when does next_day delivery end up not arriving the next_day when you wait in all day for it ?
M	why does the company have phone_lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
M	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
M	i ' ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
M	i would start by saying that the company has been going for many years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
M	however , they use dpd to transport their parcels and this lets them down a lot .
M	i ' ve had next_day deliveries not arrive next_day , no apology from the delivery company .
M	when phoning to enquire with studiospares , they couldn ' t get through so gave me the number to call , which was never answered .....
M	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
M	but they did resolve my complaint to my satisfaction .
M	just check the size before placing an order to avoid disappointment .
M	overall , an excellent company to deal with but the delivery service lets them down in my opinion
M	i cannot_fault this company .
M	they pay very competitive rates in the comparison_sites , but what drew me to them was that they pay the same day of receiving the phone direct to your bank_account .
M	if you don ' t want to pay postage , you don ' t have to but i paid for special delivery .
M	this money then went towards my new phone !
M	thanks mazuma - i ' d use you again
M	quick delivery , recorded post and well_packaged .
M	i ' ve visited the store and called them on the phone in the past and they are always helpful and informative .
M	fast service , quick payment plans , very happy with the site , would recommend to anyone .
M	i have been a customer of affordable_supplements for a few_years now .
M	i have always found their prices and service to be the best around .
M	the loyalty_points scheme is great , they really know how to treat returning customers .
M	i am now a vip member which is their way of saying thank_you for my loyalty , well_done as .
M	nice fresh , bright healthy flowers .
M	just as many buds as flowers .
M	was amazed at the amount for the value .
M	next door neighbour absolutely loved them as well when mum invited her in to show them , then she was off to tell her mum .
M	i will be a repeat customer 000_%.
M	i recently made an order with charterhouse for frozen_food .
M	sadly the courier company interlink let them down badly .
M	they failed to deliver the items next working day .
M	so charterhouse offered to send replacements of what they had in stock .
M	and were assured 000_% the parcel would arrive friday ..
M	no such parcel , and i got an_email from interlink informing_me i wont get my parcel until monday 00th .
M	charterhouse have issued a refund , and i believe they will be contacting interlink about there lack of service .
M	lol this company is nothing more_than a joke .
M	0 attempts now to deliver time sensitive items , i ordered frozen fish food during the bank_holiday weekend , knowing it would not be sent out until the tuesday .
M	it was supposed to arrive wednesday , absolutely nothing and when checking the tracking page i seen it was still in the sortation facility .
M	spoke with the company i bought the food from and they looked into it , and got back to me and offered to send out replacements as they have been assured if they send a parcel out it would get to the customer today ... wrong no parcel , instead i get an_email informing_me my parcel has been delayed and i wont get it until monday 00th .
M	well interlink after the weekend you will be known as interstink as i have been in touch with the company , they have issued a full_refund to me and they have told me they will be taking this further with your selves .
M	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
M	well i made an order with a company for mums 00 birthday_present .
M	was sent an_email on the 0th telling_me my parcel has been sent by city_link express which is 00_hours .
M	and not to check the tracking link until after 0pm .
M	i checked after 0 and it informed me parcel has been scanned and is on its way to the delivery depot .
M	delivery date is thursday 0th .
M	i checked in the early hours of the morning * 0th * and still showing parcel scanned and on its way to delivery depot delivery date 0th .
M	i checked a few_times through out yesterday and no up date .
M	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
M	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has been delivered .
M	pretty pathetic service if you ask me .
M	well it is now delivery day and nearly 00_hours and yep still no new tracking_details , still been scanned and on its way to delivery depot and delivery date 0th .
M	dpd kept me up to date on progress and then sent me an_email giving me a 0 hour delivery slot , 0 mins into that delivery slot the door_bell went and it was an other parcel i had ordered .
M	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
M	i am only complaining_about lack of information / lack of tracking_details .
M	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
M	?
M	well they are not the quickest in processing orders .
M	but they are more_than quick enough to take payments in full long before dealing_with your order .
M	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
M	a week to process an order ...
M	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days ... then got an_email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
M	checked tracking after 00pm to find my item was on its way and for delivery next working day ...
M	ebuyer should take notes on speeding things up a bit .
M	quick service .
M	quick payment .
M	will use again 000 %!!
M	!
M	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails
M	are you looking for an efficient , trustworthy and solid purchase ?
M	unparallable customer_service and great prices with a huge updated game collection ?
M	well , then you really don ' t need to look for any alternatives , as cjs - cdkeys are topping the lists on every_single layer .

M	my order 0000000 was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn ' t bother .
M	rang customer_service who said they can ' t help or reinstate offer .
M	welldone perfume shop ( owned by superdrug ) as i won ' t be using your site again may be it about time you pick_up phone and speak with your customer than relying too much on your systems !

M	i used british_gas over 0 years and they always sent me estimate which i paid in trust that i was paying correct amount , never i was sent meter read request , eventually when i found out that i paid them thousands in over charges they refused any refund , didn ' t even both explaining is to why estimates were sent instead of meter read requests .
M	my advise keep safe distance from this company do not use them or you will regret like me .
M	also make_sure you have your account no .
M	and bill hand if you write negative_review they will report it to trustpilot , not the positive once though !
M	i made mistake of buying vaccum form vax twice which i regret as they both broke_down within week , absolute_rubbish company and products that are not tested before been sold through the country .
M	do not buy there products or you shall regret like me , complete time waste , bought mr , henry hoover and it works like magic have used them for years without any_issues !
M	i have made mistake trusting philips and buying them many_times , all of my items sit and breakdown even something as simple as clock , products are designed well however quality is absolutely awful and i will ever recommend anyone to buy philips as you will see it won ' t be long before you will see issues with product !
M	never buying again !
M	i have been banking with halifax for 0 years and can ' t fault them , advanced online_banking with almost all the payments can be accessed faster_than you think , the reward_scheme certainly proves to be success as you receive £ 0 every month , good work halifax keep it up !
M	few orders placed from them never arrived due to poor courier service , however if you dint receive your goods , next will make_sure you keep waiting for good few weeks before outcome .
M	however quality is great and items are reasonably prices .
M	customer_service is good too !
M	i booked my tickets with this company february last_year and decided to cancel in less_than 00_hours , despite booking in 0 months advance i was charge £_00 for cancelling item , money was refunded after waiting good 0 weeks !
M	they employ most unprofessional and untrained staff who lack basic customer_service skills .
M	this company does not have a proper number to call !
M	i advise keep away !
M	the reviews are clearly fake and genuine customer won ' t rate company when the provide such a poor service .
M	never using again
M	i have been using discount supplements over 0 years and absolutely love them !
M	prices are very competitive and regular offers keep me here as a customer !
M	i shall recommend them to anyone who is into sports and trains regularly !
M	keep the great prices and discounts !
M	i am far more_than just impressed !
M	company is on par to everything a customer expects , my product was delivered to my convenience and arrived smoothly .
M	i was contacted at every_stage of the process to ensure i was updated with delivery information of my product .
M	such a phenomenal example to many companies out there who need to learn from you !
M	i will be recommending you to friends and family , off course all my future appliance will be ordered from here !
M	undoubtedly .
M	i have been bombarded by non sense letters asking to pay bill of an address that i have never lived at neither i have even been to such place .
M	i guess their customers has disappear and they found my details with same name so they decided to pass my details to debt_collection agency .
M	it is horrible that numerous_calls has not stopped them from writing to me for paying service i never used !
M	i will take this matter with relevant department so this company can pay me for causing me massive inconvenience !
M	scammers !
M	i always buy from webiste directly rather_than buying from boots or hollant and battets , vitamins are excellent quality and very effective too !
M	i always webiste to order as 0 for 0 offer is really beneficial , saves money on my order , also got free shipping and products arrived in 0 days !
M	thank_you i will_continue you using you .
M	been with o0 for seven years , when contact o0 they have been very polite to resolve any_queries we ever had and o0 priority moments have been extremely rewarding !
M	i love them and no doubts that thy know how to keep customers happy !
M	wanna free cuppa every week join o0 !
M	i recommended secretsales . com to have superdry brand and its on sale now , i got my items for almost half price than in store cost .
M	it save me the money and gave me opportunity to use my favourite brand !
M	if would recommend this site to my friends , also lookout for discounts they run , if you are lucky you will get further 00_%_off .
M	i can compromise waiting for item if i am saving fortune .
M	i will_definately use them again .
M	i still_haven ’ t received the second item of my order despite being told by iwantpants . com that it would be dispatched after a week ( see response below on 00 . 00 . 00 ).
M	nobody has updated me with the situation of my order .
M	the money was taken at the time of order yet even after 0 weeks + there is no sign of it .
M	i have called emailed and filled in a contact form on the website and still nothing has happened .
M	overall oks are a fantastic company .
M	over the years i have purchased alot of games from there particularly ones from the battlefield series and they have always delivered on time as promised .
M	having pre_- ordered a selection of games from there aswell i can confirm that they have all been sent on time on release day .
M	although i have never had to fully use it whenever i have had a query the customer_service team have always delivered aswell , making purchases a pain free experience .
M	overall i 000_% recommend onlinekeystore and will forever be a loyal_customer .
M	00 / 00 .

M	this service is very good for those , who stucked on no solution basebands .
M	ordered a refurbished ipod_touch .
M	fast delivery .
M	the ipod_touch wasn ' t in great condition , mainly because the charging dock was damaged , so the cable wouldn ' t plug in .
M	phoned the customer_service , the person was very helpful .
M	he told me i would either go to apple_store myself or send it back to them .
M	i went to apple_store and switched to a brand_new ipod_touch .
M	i was very pleased .
M	apple staff told me there is about 000 days warrenty left , which is not a year as advertised .
M	overall , i was happy with my purchase .
M	however , as the product was rated as a +, i would expect it to be in a full working condition .
M	guess i was a bit unlucky or lucky ( since now i have a brand_new one ).
M	would recommend studentcomputers to my friends .
M	bough a pair of sunglasses on a groupon deal .
M	piad for but didnt arrive for a few_days ( fair_enough ) when they did arrive , they were in a jiffy envelope saying signed for but unfortunately they did not attempt to get a signature but instead rammed them through what is a tiny letterbox causing them to break .
M	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
M	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .
M	i returned them back and now their customer_services rep vishu wont refund me as there warehouse cant confirm status of this return and i need to send them proof of postage !!!!
M	!
M	absolutely_appalling service .
M	do not use – you will only be disappointed .
M	opened an account as the offer of the free £_00 and the free matched bet was emailed to me .
M	opened an account , placed my first bet for £ 0 after depositing from my debit_card .
M	won the bet , got £_00 from a fiver .. happy days !
M	and also got my free bets !
M	before betting , they asked for my documents too .
M	emailed them and they unlocked me :)
M	i ordered a large tv from littlewoods and arrow xl was chosen as the carrier .
M	yesterday i received a timeslot which was 00 . 00am - 0 . 00 .
M	i was partially hesitant due to the fact that i leave at 0 : 00 for work so i rang customer_services on an 0000 number would you believe !
M	very helpful and informed me that the delivery driver would call me half an_hour before .
M	very sceptical at this as lots of companies say this but never do !
M	anyway , 0am came this morning and i got a text reminding me that my delivery was due .
M	i got a phone call at 0 : 00 saying my goods will be 00_minutes and lo and behold , they were .
M	very friendly drivers too .
M	everyone is so quick to write complaints about bad deliveries on here it ’_s absolutely_shocking , it seems like a different company is being described from what i have read on here !
M	it ’_s logistics , one of the hardest industries to keep everything satisfactory .
M	as soon as it ’_s bad , complaints get written but when it ’_s good , there is silence ?!
M	very well_organised 0 / 0 .
M	when i was looking for job i was shuffling loads of website .
M	since i found adzuna i save time and i discover connections between friends and job opportunity .
M	this was because of the amazing intergration with linkedin .
M	do not , do not under any circumstances order a phone from carphone_warehouse on line or by telephone .
M	to put it quite simply .
M	they lie through there teeth .
M	i have now been waiting in for my delivery for four days .
M	each day i have called after waiting in and been promised that i would ' certainly receive the phone tomorrow '- complete lies .
M	also if you wish to make an enquiry you will have the privilege of having to wait in a queue on a premium_rate line .
M	without a doubt the worst company i have ever_encountered !
M	do not use , do not use !
M	i am now waiting to chat to customer_service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
M	i now prey they go_bankrupt
M	made my second order through this company and for the second time they are not " able to despatch this order in full " even_though their website said ' in stock '.
M	very annoying as one of the items was a birthday_present that is now going to be late !
M	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
M	the product was fine but was very disappointed with the service quality here
M	i had never used cjs_cd_keys before now and i am a very skeptical pessimistic person .
M	however on this occasion i decided to try it , and i have to say i could not be more pleased .
M	the price was excellent and the delivery was instant .
M	after a quick security verification by phone i had my key in seconds .
M	would most defiantly use this company for my future key related purchases in the future !
M	expect business from my friends !
M	only place i shop .
M	my wife made me give her the deal this month on women ' s fitness magazines .....
M	haven ' t tried the meats yet , but have just taken delivery of my first order ....
M	delivered at the time stated , well_packed and still chilled .
M	ordered the 00 item hamper for £ 0 which was immense value , look_forward to trying a hache steak and the gammon steaks look good quality .
M	the mince was an_absolute steal at a £ 0 a pack and again looks great quality .
M	finally , the chicken .
M	good large breasts and at £ 0 a kilo , a great price .
M	i will update once i ' ve tried the meats , but i can ' t see me being disappointed .
M	this is the second time i have used heinnie , and it wont be the last !
M	such a vast_selection of knives ( if you like knives ) and great reliable service .
M	next_day delivery arrives as promised , with emails detailing progress .
M	what more could you want ?
M	well , actually , if you guys would mind moving your showroom closer .. haha !
M	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
M	i was told all items were in stock , and the conformation e_- mail to say my delivery was due on the 0st nov . well , 0 empty tubs turned_up , 0 out of 0 items i ordered , so i waited another day , maybe there had been a mess up .
M	end of the 0nd of nov , i ring customer care , theres still no parcels or any information on whats_happening .
M	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
M	so i waited , and waited , rang up , and i might_add spend 00_minutes on hold to a business number , only to be told the items i ordered are now not in stock , and they didnt know when they would be .
M	alas , on thursday0th , i receive an_email telling_me 0 items are due for delivery the next_day .. well , here i am , still_waiting .
M	only god_knows when ill get the others .
M	and by looking at the other issues people have had recently , im not alone .
M	but to make it worse , this isnt the first time things like this have happened .
M	it gets better , they have taken payment in full !
M	shame i cant give them my money in installments based on their service !
M	so by all means , myprotein products are great .. but order your stuff a month in_advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises
M	这是我第一次通过非店铺形式购买钻石饰品 ， 结果很满意 。 钻石不管是切工还是质量 ， 的确都是物超所值 。 下次肯定还会再光顾 ！！ wanwan小姐人很nice ， 强烈推荐 ！！！！！！！！！！！！

M	won ' t hesitate to use the service again or to recommend it to others !
M	!
M	my grandmother hasn ' t been able to use the internet for 0 - 0 months now and i ' ve spent more_than 0 hours on the phone from my mobile as i live a 000_miles_away just trying to get this resolved .
M	i have also complained 0 times in total 0 phone escalations and 0 e_- mail witch was also reports a breach of data_protection , this was more_than 0 weeks_ago and still no response lol .
M	she has only just had a so - called engineer out who was unable to fix the issue .
M	as of yet they have not credited her account back anything for lack of service and i am fuming .
M	i think the office of the information commissioner is going to get a letter soon , off - com as well and lastly a court claim .
M	how dear they treat my grandmother and me with contempt like that time to come down on talk_talk like a ton of bricks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	!.
M	good communication
M	happy with products arrived day after i ordered it and came with a free tester supplment
M	placed my first order and have to say i ' m very impressed .
M	will be placing regular or scheduled orders , as this has suddenly taken the pain out of remembering to buy food for the ever hungry fat - cats !
M	ordered monday_afternoon , it was on my doorstep 0 :_00am on the tuesday - wow !
M	great quality t - shirt , my mate will love it when he opens it on christmas day - along with all the other stuff from there which i ' m just about to go buy !!
M	!
M	would definitely_recommend .
M	they called me after i placed my order to say that some of the laptops they send out are faulty , and without paying a £_00 inspection charge , they would refuse to cover any faults such as pixel loss , which is not deemed as a fault ... on a brand_new laptop ?!?!?
M	!
M	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i ' m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
M	i have now had three follow on calls , even after i cancelled my order trying to upsell some rubbish internet security package without which apparently i will be in grave danger , and it is way better_than norton and mcaffee which they have had a lot of complaints about , apparently .
M	buy from someone_else , you have the choice , don ' t waste your time with this bunch of **** s !
M	i got my iphone 0 unlocked in less then 0 hours , just a perfect service .
M	i would recommend to all my friends and family
M	just received my banner in the post this morning , it came really quick and the quality of the printing seems excellent .
M	really happy , it ' s going to make my halloween party !
M	the service they provide is everything you would want from a music tech store .
M	they are very happy for you to try before you buy , and there is always someone who can answer the most technical and obscure queries .
M	ive been to most of the main london pro audio stores and very few compare to the all_round quality of production rooms !
M	my phone took longer to get to mazuma_mobile than anticipated ( only by a day or two .
M	when i asked if my handset had arrived they responded with an_email_saying that i should not worry because my quote will not change because i have notified them of the date it was sent .
M	if only every business was as decent as this !
M	i ordered some flowers for my mother on mothers_day and within one day of being received they were all but dead .
M	i emailed them angrily about this and the service i received was phenomenal .
M	quick reply and got a fresh batch of flowers and a £_00 voucher with no minimum_spend .
M	will use again .
M	item came when they said it would next_day i think ..
M	great help on the phone in explaining what to do .
M	would use again , floor is brill , really nice and warm ..
M	easy to fit .
M	great item and stat ...
M	thanks the payne family
M	i can ' t praise them enough !!!
M	i ordered my udg cd wallet 0pm monday , it arrived very swiftly approx 00am the next_day !!!
M	unbelievably quick !!!
M	i will be shopping with them again for sure !!
M	!
M	ordered 0 clubs both showing in stock and still are but both out of stock and when i called to ask why and date of delivery was told complete bollox so don ' t buy from again as this is the second time i ' ve bought from them and both_times poor service .
M	updateplease read !!
M	!
M	this online store is extremely useful ....
M	please use this online golf store to get other more reputable golf stores to price_match these joke prices !
M	!
M	i got american a golf to price_match the driver these_clowns said they had in stock and didn ' t so i ' m happy to use these fools like they use our money for cash_flow !
M	!
M	as per the title great company would buy from again
M	ordered a few keys and nearly all have had issues with lastly assassins_creed iii advertised at £_00 . 00 brilliant so put preorder in .
M	then day before_release er there russian keys ( that wasnt mentioned before ) and they dont work in the eu .
M	refund given without request in store credt !!!
M	then told me if i wanted a refund then i would lose £ 0 to the company who refunds me lol what a joke .
M	but the story dosent end there .... then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!
M	never use these_clowns ever .
M	i sold my 00 " macbook_pro which was 0 years old , i put my details in the system honestly and a good price came back , even with the laptop having no battery pack which would of cost me £_00 off ebay to buy a new one .
M	collected by courier and got the money a few_days_later .
M	also paid out the agreed original online quote so was very happy .
M	would definitely use again .
M	0st time using them so i can vouch for their general price quoting on other items .
M	a *
M	the product is amazing quality , the delivery was very fast and i was really impressed with the packaging quality .
M	faultless even when dealing_with groupon code also
M	i have been using aria for a while now and each time i do , i remember why .
M	i very rarely have to check elsewhere as nine times out of ten they will win on price but they still don ' t skimp on customer_service .
M	the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable .
M	i ' ve not had a single problem with delivery , especially since they switched to dpd .
M	i ' ve ordered quite late in the day and still ended_up receiving my order the next_day .
M	as well as the customer_service , the community forum is pleasant to partake in and the competitions and rewards for loyal participants just top off what is already an excellent online shopping_experience .
M	if i had one criticism , it would be that email support is sometimes a little on the slow side , but pick_up the phone and you will always get a response .
M	i never have any hesitation to suggest them to friends and family .
M	this is the best parts site i have used and best of all its free which is a refreshing_change from being ripped_off on other_sites .
M	within a few hours i had quotes from a number of parts suppliers and as my part was a bit awkward to find i was really impressed with the service and the prices .
M	highly_recommend using these_guys
M	after waiting a while for a cheque that didnt arrive due to being ' lost ' in the post and resolving this with a very helpful person , ive decided to change my review as they did as much as they could to resolve the issue . they have given the best price for my phone out of all the companies available . from sending my phone in uptil the payment process i was informed everyway possible .
M	as my phone was a high value one i was recomended to send special delivery which i would have just posted recorded so have to thank them for that too .
M	i use creatine from these_guys which is of high_quality , a great price and very quick delivery .
M	use cyclone exclusively and don ' t buy it from anywhere_else .
M	big range of specialized products , no tat to be found .
M	my order came through the post so quick it made my head spin !
M	nightgear cover all bases , and are cheaper_than anywhere_else that i can find online .
M	the range of kit that is available is immense , and there are stacks of different brands .
M	everything from nvg ' s to boot polishing kits .
M	the quality of the products and the service from the customer care team is far beyond what you would expect for such online value .
M	i would highly_recommend nightgear as the first stop when looking for tactical kit .
M	great experiences with them !
M	i have never been disappointed by the company .
M	helpful , great staff .
M	thanks !
M	the company doesn ' t respect the warranty_period , doesn ' t answer complaints , lies ...
M	ordered at 0pm and recieved it two days_later , earlier_than stated which is great .
M	would highly_reccommend using this company .
M	user_friendly , comprehensive and easy to use or navigate !
M	my iphone_0s locked on o0 now unlocked !
M	highly_recommended ...
M	this is my fourth time buying from cjs_cdkeys , and i ' ve only had impeccable service from you guys .
M	keys are delivered on time and always activate every time .
M	would recommned to anyone :)
M	i looked all over the internet for the very best prices .
M	when it came to one product i was looking anywhere from 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
M	i came_across supplementwarehouse and their listen price was 00 . 00 .
M	however !!!!
M	the will match the lowest_price you find and beat it !
M	simply amazing .
M	not to mention ill be receiving a free workout cup .
M	supplementwarehouse is the only way to go !
M	!
M	needed to buy replacement keys for cupboards and lockers - arrived quickly , keys worked and no_fuss .
M	good communication_throughout , well_priced , reccomended .
M	having been severely let_down by yodel , amazon sent out a replacement product via the dpd express service .
M	i received an_email informing_me of an_hour_window ( it arrived bang in the middle ) and was in good order .
M	nice to know there are some delivery companies out there who do their job !
M	the parcel was out for delivery on the 0th .
M	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated_delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
M	i phoned the next morning and was told that it would deffinately be with me that day and if there were any_issues the driver would call me ...... all day went by and no parcel .
M	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
M	she promised to be here just after 0000 this morning and you guessed it ...... still_waiting .
M	its not like i have a life !!
M	!
M	great service , price matched another shop i had found the mandolin i was after in , and had it shipped the same day .
M	great service and great price !
M	the best prices by_far for lens hire in the uk - all the lenses you could ever need from a fisheye to 000mm - and above all a fantastic service and very helpful staff at the end of the phone doing everything they can to help ....
M	very highly_recommended , i will never rent from another company again .
M	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
M	the fact is yes they are very good / nice / efficient at taking your money and it is cheaper_than other insurance providers , however do not rate until you have actually made a successful claim .
M	it seems to be impossible to do so .
M	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .
M	also when i add up all the excesses charges and phone bills i have used to try and get hold of protectyourbubble then the cost almost outweighs the near £_000 phone that was " insured "
M	they never phone you back , never reply to emails , you end up on hold for hours .
M	please_please people mark my words and pay the extra few pounds for a proper insurance_cover as you will be throwing your money away like i did .
M	its either giving away £ 0 a month or paying £ 0 - 0 to get some actual insurance .
M	in 0000 we made the decision to go into the online market and for us this was very daunting as we had very little experience or knowledge of how it all works .
M	after doing a bit of research and talking to people in our trade who had already expanded into the online side of business , one name kept being mentioned as a professional and reliable company for creating our website .
M	that company was visualsoft .
M	from our very 0st talk with them we felt at ease that we had chosen the right people for the job .
M	any_questions we had be it serious or silly they were there to answer and every process was explained to us in full detail .
M	we now have a great looking website that is easy to use for both the customer and ourselves .
M	if we have any problem be it big or small our account_manager hester is always just a phone call away and always ready to help .
M	their aftercare and support are second to none .
M	truly a professional and supportive company that we have and will_continue to recommend to others .

M	another top quality service from p0g - i use these_guys on a regular_basis for sending parcels abroad and have had nothing but top quality service .
M	even when the website acts a little screwy the instant chat / help function is there to help .
M	- a big thanks to catherine who helped_me book a parcel to ireland when the website wouldn ' t ;¬)
M	i would highly_recommend steve and logodepot - i am really pleased with the designs that i got , as well as the stationary designs .
M	i didn ' t give them a huge_amount of information to start with , but they still managed to come up with some fantastic initial designs , and any changes requested were sent back very quickly ( within a few hours max ).
M	the business card printers that i am using commented on the quality and originality of their design - saying they were some of they best they had seen !
M	the price was extremely competitive , and i am now going to be exploring my website design with them .
M	thanks !
M	until recently play . com was always the fallback website .
M	there if i couldn ' t find my product anywhere_else .
M	but recently i ' ve been finding myself using it more and more .
M	myself ( and my wife ) now use this site as one of the first calls when a birthday comes along .
M	you can ' t go_wrong for friends and family with a dvd , game , music or one of the other great products play . com offer .
M	fast delivery and varied selection are what keep this site on the top list ( though their prices can someones not be very competative ).
M	until this week i had never_heard of clickforgames .
M	i thought i ' d give them a try as they were offering the product i wanted cheaper_than anywhere_else on the net .
M	i was shocked when , the next_day , the product was waiting for me when i got home .
M	the game is in mint_condition ( the wrapping isn ' t even damaged !
M	).
M	as a keen gamer i buy a lot of games and i am pleased to say that not only will i be using them again , but i will be recommending them to everyone .
M	i love using supplement_warehouse !
M	you can ' t find another site with cheaper prices or faster shipping .
M	they have everything you need to supplement propertly and help you obtain your goals .
M	i won ' t use any other site to order products from .
M	hey , i was totally unsure on which direction to take getting in to computer recording but these_guys helped_me greatly with what software would be best and what instruments to add for somebody like me getting in to producing electronic based music .
M	i ' ve since been back to them and ordered some monitors and had the same great service again .
M	couldn ' t be_happier .
M	; )
M	they ' re always really happy and nice .
M	compelled to review bananafingers . co . uk having used them 0 times now and have to say i ' m thoroughly_impressed .
M	having used other_websites to purchase climbing_gear previously i have found bf to be competitive on price and the guys in the shop offer friendly and helpful advice when i ' ve needed it .
M	highly_recommended .
M	non_existent customer_service , i emailed them about a query on my order , that was around the 00th_july , can ' t remember the exact date it was that long ago , today is the 00nd august and still no reply , don ' t even try phoning unless you have nothing better to do all day as a long wait is in order .
M	all i wanted was an explanation to a mistake , seems that once you get the curtains its goodbye .
M	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
M	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn ' t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
M	update_:
M	received a phone call from woodyatt apologizing for the non reply , they say that they have no record of my query which was sent through their own ' contact us ' tab on their website , what a surprise , also was never asked which number i rang from so don ' t know how they checked a call log without the number i rang from .
M	funny how it took a review on trustpilot to trigger a response from them , they got that email ok !
M	they have even admitted their website needs improved to make it easier for customers but yet i am still out of pocket to the value of £_00 with no offer of compensation .
M	careful when trying to use the code they send you for registering for their newsletter , after i purchased a song i seen the deal showing 00_% of your first mp0 purchase and applied 00_mins after my purchase .
M	when i then tried to apply the code it said error , already used , i then complained to their customer_service team and was told that it was applied to the song at 00p not the album i was going to buy at £ 0 . 00 . the fact that they hadn ' t even sent me the code before i tried to purchase didn ' t even click with them .
M	going back to itunes .
M	terrible company , totally useless !
M	achica sent me an_email with a code to use for my first purchase , a £_00 voucher .
M	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i ' ve heard that before !
M	they now have given me another code to use but now the items i first wanted have ended .
M	what a complete_waste of time , i wish i had read the reviews about the company first of all and would never have went near them .
M	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well_established , reputable company .
M	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with , their so called customer_service is more like i couldn ' t care less attitude .
M	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don ' t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
M	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .
M	if they can ' t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
M	also while all this is going on , not one word of apology from them , hopeless !
M	!
M	a complete_disaster from start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
M	every time i get an expected date for delivery it passes by and now going by the recent date it will be one year to receive the light , if it ever arrives !
M	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
M	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
M	update 00 / 00 / 00
M	after my post on trustpilot i received a phone call from emilie who apologised for the inconvenience and said that she would apply for my refund and process as quickly as possible but it could take up to 00 working_days , so my first thought was , i won ' t hold my breath , we will wait and see and planned to count the days down .
M	i received another phone call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked ..................... and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
M	so thank_you emilie , you have restored some faith back in infurn !
M	the product was very competitively_priced with free delivery .
M	product arrived with no_fuss , within a day of ordering and was very well wrapped .
M	lots of mechanisms to communicate with webtogs and whilst i didn ' t need to as the ordering_process was very smooth i had the confidence that customer_service is a priority .
M	i will_definitely be buying more from them !
M	0 year_ago this month i started my diet to lose_weight , with the help of ds staff , their knowledge of products that i should be taking like proteins , vitamins and recovery supplements and the motivation i received from them along with some of the sponsors they had come into the store like optimum nutritions aaron smith i have gone from 00 stone ( 000pounds ) to just under 00 stone ( 000pounds ).
M	i am a happier , healthier and more motivated person and want to thanks ds and their sponsors for their help , knowledge and motivation .
M	they even helped_me out with workout advice and diets .
M	top lads altogether !
M	i included a picture of me before i started my diet and one from the other day .
M	im not great with photo editing so feel free to laugh !
M	ha !
M	thanks for helping me change my life !
M	this is innovation at its finest using a webcam make u feel more in the game and seeing some of the live wins is hilariously fun and the chat_hosts are great friendly and a bit crazy which makes it a pleasure to play and users are friendly and helpful
M	i received great advice and was put at ease by clive while purchasing my wedding_ring online from diamondgeezer . com .
M	i would gladly reccomend anyone_else who is in the market for a great ring at a reasonable_price .
M	quick delivery and exactly as_described .
M	no_problems ordering .
M	fantastic service !
M	transferwise can really save me some money in these exchange_rates .
M	supplementwarehouse has the best prices any were ..
M	very hard to beat !
M	!
M	thank_you for your application .
M	we are busy processing your account and you will receive an_email as soon as it has been activated .
M	processing normally takes less_than 0 hours but may take up to 00_hours .
M	if you would like to check the status of your account , you can log in at any time .
M	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has been processed .
M	this was 0 days ago :( not impressed so far .
M	what is going on ??
M	?
M	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
M	cheapest site online , delivered on time and great communication when i asked to change delivery date !
M	top_notch !
M	tackle_uk sent me an item that had been taken out of its packaging and there was a piece missing so i could not use the item they sent me .
M	they tehn want me to waste my own_personal time and petrol money to go into to town to return the item before i can have a refund .
M	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty_goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
M	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
M	i have ordered here a few_times and almost always price_match .
M	it is a good place to do business .
M	i like the free_samples to see if i would be interested in purchasing new supplements .
M	i order from this site every month after being let_down by other supplement sites previously .
M	it has every supplement i ' ve ever needed and at some of the lowest_prices i can find .
M	you ' re rewarded for your loyalty with discounts up to 0 % for repeat buyers which is cool and free_samples !
M	delivery is second to none .
M	their cheap saturday delivery has also been a life_saver for me many_times and has not let me down yet .
M	i recommend this site to everone !
M	i dont think i could of asked for much more .
M	they ' re good value and fast .
M	very fast considering it comes from_hong_kong .
M	they also supplied me with a uk plug adaptor and paid my import_tax .
M	there was no need to contact customer_service so i cant comment on that .
M	i will_definitely be using them again .
M	our bar guide was fantastic she even bought her friend along !!!
M	( both hot ) she kept in contact all weekend as we arranged additional activities upon_arrival .
M	our_guide even accompanied us on the second night for drinks .
M	the boat hotel was the best stag accommodation ive ever stayed in , it was clean and tidy i would use it again .
M	overall well impressed with pissup . com
M	ordered 0 items in past_year , 0 have been cancelled by hmv after anything from a day to 0 weeks for various reasons .
M	( maybe i ' m unlucky )
M	i still order from them , i ' m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
M	if they truly have the item in stock , you ' ll usually get a " it ' s on its way " email the next_day or so and everything is nice and fast .
M	the letting you know the item is in the post is a good touch .
M	if you find a really good bargain , just don ' t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
M	the money is refund quick enough so you can buy elsewhere if needed .
M	finding urbanindustry on a blog i often go on ( thedailystreet . co . uk ), i decided to order my christmas clobber from them and i couldn ' t be more happier even if santa himself had delivered it .
M	was fast , delivery and packaging of goods perfect , great communication , will_definitely be using again in the future !
M	having used shopto before on multiple_occasions there service never ceases to amaze .
M	they have by_far the best shipping and fastest delivery of any website ive tried and shopto is always my number one choice when im looking to purchase .
M	i had two orders already with musclefood and i am extremely happy with the meat i received .
M	i have recommended them to all my friends and already placed third order .
M	thank_you musclefood !!
M	!
M	my order was process very fast , the barbecue arrived in less_than 00h .
M	product is fantastic and was eay to set_up .
M	would recomend it to all my friends .
M	thanks
M	very satisfied with all products you are selling , genuine products , fast delivery , very competetive prices and good discount .
M	tacky tat that is overpriced .
M	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
M	massively disgraceful .
M	avoid
M	after being let_down by idiots claiming how amazing they are and being left needing something to sit on , i came_across this concept of design and build your own sofa .
M	delivered within a couple of days , excellent communication , faultless courier ( pink ), took about 0hr and a half to put_together .
M	very comfortable and very happy with it .
M	especially the price .
M	recommended .
M	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
M	stay in all tuesday , the booked and agreed delivery date .
M	no contact to say its not coming .
M	i phone them at 0 . 00pm and they say its not coming .
M	they couldn ' t be bothered to get in touch .
M	very poor service .
M	first and last ever order from a third rate outfit .
M	conversation went :
M	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let me know its not coming today ?"
M	them : " i ' m can only say i ' m sorry "
M	me : " so when is it being delivered ?"
M	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
M	me : " just a minute … every day ?
M	you mean you ' ve no_idea when it ' s coming at all even_though your website states in stock and available for next_day delivery , and you claim to provide amazing next_day service .
M	are you expecting me to take the next few weeks off work hoping that it might finally arrive one day ?"
M	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
M	me : " well clearly they haven ' t bothered to today when it was supposed to arrive .
M	can you give me the telephone_number for xdp as there is none on their website ?"
M	them : " no we don ' t have one ."
M	me : " just cancel the order then ."
M	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
M	these are a bunch of clowns with no_idea about prompt reliable customer_service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
M	avoid and save your time and sanity .
M	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
M	pathetic
M	back in november ordered a sofa from these_clowns .
M	website states delivery 0 - 0 weeks , in - stock , direct from manufacturer .
M	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .
M	apparently manufacturer would call us with eta .
M	delivery day comes and no sofa .
M	telephoned studio who say they cannot give us the telephone_number for the manufacturer because they don ' t know who the manufacturer is , but the manufacturer will telephone us as soon as its ready to deliver .
M	yes you read that correctly - we will be phoned by the manufacturer but they don ' t know who the manufacturer is !!!
M	so who have you passed our details to ?
M	they don ' t know .
M	there you have it in a nutshell - studio dont know who they buy from so they have you waiting in for a delivery but they dont know who it is delivering it or when its going to come .
M	so now we have nothing to sit on thanks to complete incompetence from a shocking cowboy outfit .
M	don ' t even waste your time peeps , you ' ll regret it !
M	i should have read the other reviews on here because clearly studio is not the place to buy a sofa - they seem unable to deliver ( pardon the pun ).
M	perhaps they should concentrate on selling cards because home furnishings is not an area they are capable of dealing in .
M	i have now cancelled the order rather_than have any more poor service , lack of information , and general incompetence .
M	update_: i haven ' t responded to your reply because as stated i ' ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
M	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .
M	these_idiots are the nasty people that get hold of your mobile number illegally and text you at all hours of the night and day pestering you about ppi , but dont reply because firstly it will cost you each time you do , and once you reply ( even stop to try and stop it ), they then know that your number works and they will_continue to bombard you and sell on your number to other rogue illegal outfits
M	from the website it tells you that this guy has been in business for years on the high_street , and has now started selling online .
M	you can see from the way the online ordering goes , the email confirmation of processing and dispatch that this guy has survived on the high_street by being professional , and has now embraced the internet to keep going and move with the times .
M	and good luck to him , prices are excellent , delivery charges are cheaper_than going into_town , choice and selection is brilliant .
M	ordered yesterday , should have them tomorrow .
M	these are operating a fantastic money making scheme -- for them .
M	the way they calculate interest is unlike any other reputable credit_card , and will leave you paying a fortune .
M	their apr is high , the interest is calulated to leave you paying more interest than your payments unless you pay in full as soon as the bill comes .
M	this is not the card for anyone who doesn ' t clear in full , and let ' s face it - they advertise and aim at those that don ' t .
M	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
M	when i asked for the bank_details of this direct_debit they said you don ' t have one set_up .
M	so if i hadn ' t queried this and thought , oh they ' ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn ' t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .
M	furthermore , if you try and make a debit_card payment online it rejects every time , ring up and use the same card over the phone and it works .
M	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
M	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you ' ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
M	as it clearly_states on your statement : " interest is charged on a daily_basis so interest payments will increase the longer you take to pay , even before the monthly payment date ".
M	what an underhand devious money making scam !
M	very amateur website that doesn ' t work and gives misleading information that only serves to make them more in charges and interest by cheating the customers .
M	if you ' d avoid the likes of payday lenders like the plague , you ' ll be well advised to avoid these fagans .
M	when you ask for a quote you ' ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
M	they don ' t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
M	there is absolutely no warning on the text about the charges of ringing this number which begins " 00000 " and looks_like an ordinary mobile .
M	if you go on [_external reference_] com you are given genuine mobile numbers so its easy to think this is the same .
M	it ' s not !
M	don ' t get stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
M	if you look them up on companies house , you ' ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
M	make of it what you will but to me i can ' t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn ' t something sinister here .
M	you ' ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
M	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
M	no_idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these people .
M	i ' m on the tps register to stop marketing calls and also ex - directory !
M	further searches revealed this is the same company as yourcalls . net - a shoddy set of scammers also run by the industry named " scumbag " owen bloodworth .
M	do yourself a favour and keep away - they ' ve changed their name but you know what they say about leopards !
M	just had some goods sent to me by this company , smashed beyond use , clearly intentional .
M	couriers like this company deserve to go bust .
M	sadly they continue to operate as management clearly don ' t care about the massive negative attitude of their staff , the loathing they have of customers , the immense negative image this company has .
M	i now ask online_retailers which company they use .
M	if its herpes , i ask them to use another courier and if they won ' t then i tell them i will buy elsewhere because of the courier they have chosen .
M	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .
M	this review is not about buying from these people , but from working for them .
M	your day will start at 0am and end around 0pm , yet you will only get paid for 0 . 0 hours .
M	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
M	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
M	simply - there is too much to do within the timeframe allowed .
M	the area covered is around 000_miles .
M	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
M	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
M	subtract a further two hours at the depot for sorting and scanning the stock , loading the van , printing out the paperwork and completing van checks and daily / weekly / monthly company sheets and you ' ve only four actual hours to deliver or collect at around 00 locations , thats if you can average driving speeds of 00mph of course ( which you can ' t because of the vehicle limiter @ 00mph ).
M	the products are " desktop delivery " which means boxes of paper etc have to be taken to the floor level and actual desk / cupboard where the customer wants the product .
M	which is ok but it takes considerably more time , this isn ' t just go to the front_desk , " sign here " " there ' s your stuff " and gone in less_than a minute .
M	especially when only a wonky - wheeled sack cart is provided so sometimes one person collecting over 00 boxes from an above ground level could be at a single drop for well over an_hour .
M	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
M	the final pettiness of this company though has to be when you take the van to the fuel station .
M	you are given two cards , a bp card to pay for the fuel and a nectar card - yes they get the points and you have to record the number of nectar points on your manifest .
M	they don ' t even let you have any little perks !
M	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
M	was about to order a mac mini from here .
M	now i won ' t because they clearly an non - uk_based and absolutely awful to deal with .
M	also i note the positive_reviews are by reviewers with only 0 review to their name .
M	always makes me think their own staff write those reviews !
M	just paid an extra £_00 and bought it from [_external link_removed ].
M	it ' s worth paying a bit more sometimes to go with tried and trusted and have peace of mind rather_than use some scammers .
M	have been with them about 0 months or so , for broadband and line_rental , as they were offering a competitive deal .
M	thats the positives dealt_with .
M	the negatives - poor line speeds , regular disconnection , downloads so slow it takes over 0 minutes to load a web_page ( ironically their website support pages at the time !
M	), low monthly restriction ( allowance they call it - which is both upload and download added together ) which soon gets used up having to press refresh on your browser all the time .
M	feels_like i spend more time trying to get it working than using it .
M	found their support useless too , just standard responses and they hide their contact email address so you have to go round in circles through the faq_section which is never relevant to the problem that ' s happening , which meanwhile uses up more of your monthly restriction , oops allowance .
M	it ' s crap , but it ' s cheap .
M	so you pays your money ....
M	if you want good reliable broadband , pay a bit more and go elsewhere .
M	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
M	for me , frustratingly slow , poor service so ultimately poor value .
M	after telling them that their broadband is throttled so much and ridiculously slow , and taking up to 0 minutes just to load their own website pages , their answer is that i have to go out and buy another router from the one they supplied or pay for an engineer to visit .
M	this is their award winning service ?
M	what award is this then ?
M	" biggest cowboy outfit isp award "?
M	time to refer them to the regulator as every other poor reviewer on here seems to have to do ...
M	have used these for years , the service is absolutely spot on .
M	very good choice for cigar and pipe tobacco , and very keen prices .
M	delivery charges are very reasonable too compared to other_sites .
M	usually get orders next_day , though its down to postal service if first_class gets to you next_day or day after .
M	found them to be far cheaper_than the likes of comet , currys , john_lewis .
M	goods arrived within the 00 minute promised time_slot .
M	item was damaged , offered 00_%_discount to keep it or replacement could be sent the following_day .
M	delivery guys were friendly and helpful , they called in on their phone to report damaged item .
M	unwrapped it and took away all packaging without fuss .
M	shame about dent , but these things_happen and they did make a generous offer or prompt replacement so that plus the excellent prices means it has to be 0_stars !
M	bosch " blue " power_tools are for the trade .
M	similar in design to some of the green diy tools , but inside are better components for daily use rather_than occasional .
M	hard wearing .
M	its good gear right enough , but when things do break down they really excel .
M	the blue stuff has a year guarantee that if you register your product within 0 weeks of purchase , they upgrade free to 0 years .
M	if anything fails , they send a courier out to wherever you ' re working , collect the faulty item and repair / replace and return it to you within a few_days .
M	all under_warranty .
M	now that is service !
M	haven ' t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
M	stuff takes a few_days to arrive , not a next_day outfit so if you do want it quick maybe look_elsewhere .
M	but the prices and range i think are good .
M	latest order was sent in two parcels , one parcel went astray but that was citylink ' s fault and arrived the next_day [ website showed 0 parcels but they only delivered 0 ].
M	when i emailed transtools , they responded quickly .
M	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
M	haven ' t had cause to fault transtools yet so until then i ' m happy to keep using them .
M	no_quibbles website which is easy to use .
M	wheels have been throughly tested and run like a dream !
M	thank_you
M	easy to use check out .
M	cant_wait for the items to arrive !
M	!

M	trustpilot is playing very unfair .
M	it has banned reviews from a company i work for - canvasdezign .
M	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
M	they are making it very difficult for us to increase or even decrease our profile .
M	either start allowing reviews or remove the fake_reviews that are visible .
M	it is totally unfair .
M	easiest and safest purchase i have made on line .
M	the prices are at_least 00_% cheaper_than direct or anywhere_else and they are absolutely awesome !
M	will be using many_times in the future !
M	what can i say , easy to use site & great price - what more do you need ?
M	we ' d been looking for ' something ' for a month or so , no_idea where to go or where to stay , found a great deal on flights to tenerife from manchester - the price you see is what you pay unlike a few other_sites we ' d been using .
M	clicked through to see a few_hundred available hotels in costa adeje , filtered away to get to the good stuff , 0 * all inclusive , good reviews , good price , clickity click and booked !
M	added insurance and airport_transfers for next to nothing .
M	ive read a few stories about online companies being quick to take your money and then later on you find out the hotel doesnt exist , cant get in touch with them , extra fees at the hotel / airport etc but ive travelled and am now safely back in the uk .
M	no extra fee ' s , phoned to pay my balance and enquire_about transfer time , was on hold for no more_than 0 minutes and had my fairly trivial query resolved .
M	flight went on time no_problems there , taxi waiting at tfs took us straight to the hotel where we spent 0 weeks eating and drinking as much as we liked .
M	i cant_fault the service , price or weather so a big 0 / 0 from me !
M	the service provided from function00 was absolutely fantastic .
M	the staff were extremely_helpful and talked me through each_step of every process .
M	shipping service was great , so quick !
M	i have already_recommended function00 to all of the golfers in my club .
M	great service , great gear , great site !!
M	!
M	shopto are really good .
M	i ' ve been genuinely impressed ( enough to write a feedback review , which i never do ) by their service .
M	the prices are usually around as cheap as anywhere_else might go , and i don ' t think i ' ve had one order that arrived later than_expected ( thanks , play . com !).
M	being_able to order before 0pm and get the game the next morning ( at no extra charge ) is such a luxury , it ' s spoiled me when ordering from other_places .
M	i know it ' s hyperbolic , but i can only recommend them highly .
M	i ordered some flowers at around 0pm for my mum ' s birthday the next_day and they arrived bang on time and looked fantastic .
M	the website was really easy to use and understand and the prices were very reasonable .
M	i could easily upgrade my order to ' deluxe ' for little extra_cost .
M	i was updated via_email and text at every_stage of the process , thanking and confirming my order , telling_me when the flowers were out for delivery and when they ' d been delivered .
M	the brand voice and experience was great from start to finish , very easy to use and i ' d definitely use them again .
M	very happy :-)
M	i had a great experience ordering from truffleshuffle .
M	i was given updates on where my order was up to and when to expect it to be delivered .
M	the cost of delivery was considerably_cheaper_than a lot of other_companies , especially_considering how quickly the order arrived ( i ordered on monday_evening and received the order early wednesday_morning ).
M	the products themselves are fantastic and the fact that truffleshuffle threw a sweet in there as well just made my day !
M	i will_definitely be using truffleshuffle again and would wholeheartedly_recommend them to anyone .
M	with myprotein receiving such praise from other people who have ordered from it , i set my hopes quite high for the product .
M	however , i was completely let_down .
M	the protein will not mix properly with water , instead the water turns a horrible yellow colour that looks and tastes disgusting .
M	the protein is completely unusable .
M	great prices
M	great variety of brands
M	tons of high_quality shit
M	easy to order ; speedy_delivery ; item exactly as expected - 00 / 00 .
M	i don ' t normally leave_feedback on anything that i order , but felt_compelled to due to the excellent experience of ordering from woodhouse clothing .
M	i was a little_wary of ordering , as it was my first order with the company and the reviews here are mixed .
M	i ordered a pair of onitsuka tiger trainers on saturday_afternoon , and i have just received delivery of them now ( midday on monday ) - very fast .
M	the shoes are exactly as_described , very comfortable , and they were £_00 cheaper_than the next nearest price i found at a more well - known company .
M	i would not hesitate t order from this company again .
M	i will not be using cash_generator again .
M	i was sent a faulty ps0 which i later sent back .
M	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
M	they also told me that they would get a replacement sourced and sent out to me .
M	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
M	it is now tuesday and they have stopped answering my emails and i have the feeling that like many other people , i will not be hearing from them again .
M	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
M	super products , fast delivery and very well_packaged .
M	once again i ' ve unlocked my 0rd iphone 0 locked to korea carrier ... im very satiesfied with this services , its real ... now im waiting again for iphone 0 00gb japan carrier unlock services to be available in this services ... i hope i will get discount for my next unlock ... hehehehe
M	i buy my protein from supplement_warehouse every time .
M	i have never had an issue with shipping and it always ships fast .
M	even_though shipping is expensive , they make up for it with their extremely cheap rates on products .
M	great company !
M	until recently my experience with 000reg had been ok and i never had any_problems with the few domains i ' ve registered with them .
M	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
M	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
M	a third_party bought it and wants $ 0000 for it !
M	i am not paying $ 0000 for 000reg ' s mistake , and to make it worse their support staff have been completely dismissive & try to avoid taking responsibility at every opportunity .
M	they even have the audacity to tell me they failed to pay the registry , but the loss of the domain is my fault for not checking with a third_party that they did their job !
M	this example shows serious incompetence and a lack of care for customers when they make a mistake .
M	any domain registrar should know how to renew domains without losing them , and in any case of a renewal failing they should at_least detect this so that action can be taken .
M	000reg failed to do their job here and try to escape responsibility so they don ' t need to pay for their mistake .
M	i could forgive a mistake if they made up for it , but their attitude is unbelievably bad .
M	atrocious customer_service & incompetence .
M	i will try to transfer all of my domains away from this terrible company !
M	great service , quick delivery , very good price
M	i have used this company for well over a year now for all my supplements and theyh are always the best price and delivery very quickly .
M	highly_recommended
M	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .
M	i booked them in march - a month_ago .
M	as well as paying for the tickets i paid over £_00 in booking and postage fees .
M	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
M	oh no it didn ' t .
M	the tickets were confirmed as shipped a day or so after i bought them , but a week_later i hadn ' t received them .
M	i got in touch with eventim who said that it i waited until 0 days before the event they ' d arrange for me to collect them on the night .
M	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone wrong once .
M	i asked them to send them out by recorded_delivery instead .
M	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
M	i got an_email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn ' t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
M	so i phoned them up .
M	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .
M	the best i could get out of her was a promise to contact the venue and ask what they would allow the ticket agents to do .
M	much later in the day i received an_email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
M	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
M	i should not have to wait months worrying_about whether i would gain admittance after paying over £_00 in fees for a service that should alleviate any such worry .
M	i got a reply a week_later from another customer_service manager , stuart james , just repeating the same nonsense again .
M	naturally they will not refund the booking or postage fees , and had the cheek to claim that it was because they are making them available for collection at the last_minute , and that collection fees are the same as postage (£. 000 ).
M	i ' ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .
M	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
M	i got exactly_what i ordered and on time .
M	so far i am pleased with it .
M	i ' m hopeful the product will survive continual use .
M	if so it ' ll prove exceptional value .
M	if not i ' ll just have to re - evaluate what to use in future .
M	i have been using sw for years and they take care of me every time .
M	out of the few_times that something went wrong they were quick to resolve the problem .
M	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn ' t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which_resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
M	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don ' t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
M	do yourselves a favor and go with a different carrier , 0 are a shambles of a company .
M	didn ' t know what to expect at first after being a shopto customer but very happy with the service that simply_games provides .
M	well recommended
M	i ' ve used it for the second and i have got to say i am not disappointed .
M	the process went_smoothly and the autokey_system is amazing .
M	i got my key in less_than 00_minutes !
M	good options - good infor about stay .
M	suggestion - would be good if there is an option to specify the number of children also .
M	apart_from total adult travellers
M	it is cool , but have no messenger for windows platform .
M	i can not live with out it !
M	i like to buy books on this website .
M	it is cheaper then buy in bookstore !
M	i had been told i would get £_00 for my 0gs .
M	it failed it ' s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
M	i wanted it returned but this would cost almost £ 0 , they are based in london so i said i would rather collect it myself and they refused .
M	reluctantly i accepted the offer and 0 weeks_later i ' m still_waiting for the money to be put in to my account .
M	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
M	was renting a ford focus or similar and ended_up with a skoda octavia !
M	very very powerful beast and was perfect for the drive from dublin airport to electric picnic .
M	will certainly be hiring from here again !
M	i ' ve looked all over and havnt seen any thing close to these prices .
M	way to go supelement warehouse

M	ordered thursday_evening arrived monday_morning .
M	much_quicker_than_expected
M	this is the worst customer_service i had to deal with !
M	there was an issue on their website and charge me twice for an event .
M	they refused to refund me the money .
M	stay well away from them !
M	the product arrived on time and was perfectly packed .
M	the whole experience couldn ' t have been smoother .
M	well , i was curious at first .. cheap price was nervious , but paid then short time later i recieved a key !
M	great company , + 0 for support and price .
M	will buy again in the future :)
M	mass effects ;)
M	thanks cdkeysdirect !
M	great key store would advise buying from these_guys - 0stars from me :)

M	i will_definitely use them again , just as good as any high_street retailer .
M	i bought a hairmax laser comb from peak_nutrition who are the only uk stockists with such a low price .
M	very pleased with the speed and quality of the delivery
M	they have a site that makes it easy to find what you are looking for with great info on each product .
M	they also have great prices and also have a matching guarantee .
M	a fast and speedy service , at a good price .
M	they have pretty_much everything you could need .
M	generally its the cheapest you an find as well , but if it isn ' t then you can put in the link and they will beat that price by 0 %.
M	pretty good deal .
M	its a 0 stop_shop and ive always received my products within a few_days of ordering .
M	i love the supplements , high_quality and quick results !
M	!
M	oh dear , it seems as if i ' m not the only one suffering with this retailer ' s poor customer_service and deliveries .
M	ordered an item on june 0th , which i ' ve still yet to receive .
M	despite contacting the retailer on june 00th , 00th and 00st , i have received a single reply on the 00th to advise they are investigating .
M	however , i ' ve yet to receive a reply since then , and am now out of pocket as there is no item and they have my money .
M	avoid at all costs - despite their previous positive_reviews , it appears in the last few weeks they are not delivering items .
M	do not order from them .
M	fast postage , excellent item .
M	video helped make decision to purchase , and ankle brace has really helped ongoing rehab back to sport .
M	i sent back a item for a full_refund under dsr more_than a month_ago , i still yet to receive a refund which they keep saying they will process yet don ' t !
M	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
M	i was threatened on the phone that i will not receive a refund if i keep calling them about it , and i was also called a idiot on the phone !
M	ever since the hut group took over this company customer_service is terrible , scam_artists !
M	avoid like the plague
M	an all in one solution to getting your tyres replaced at your convenience .
M	used twice and very good , also cheapest on the market .
M	delivery nice and early in the day ready for me to go train and no_problems .
M	perfect .
M	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn ' t fit
M	i was with aol from the days of compuserve and had always raved_about them ; their reliability , speeds , customer_service .... oh how times have changed !
M	!
M	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
M	aol blamed everything from filters to the router to windows , basically anything_else apart_from them .
M	i ' m quite geeky so when i caught them out at each point they finally , after many calls over 0 months offered to upgrade my service and send a new modem - all i ' d have to do was sign_up to a new contract .
M	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
M	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 ' s era pc with a script to read from .
M	they have no clue_what to do , are unwilling to escalate and their two main functions are to :
M	a ) get you to sign_up for another contract - preferably with line_rental .
M	b ) get you off the phone by telling you any lie they can think of , or as a failsafe that you have come through to the wrong department and they can ' t transfer you .
M	my main issues were with email not being received , but this didn ' t worry them .
M	i was promised call_backs , escalations , uk_based technical_team visits ..... nothing .
M	what really angered me were the constant lies , when you have been a loyal_customer for 00 years , you expect better treatment that this .
M	i left in march and have not looked back .
M	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
M	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don ' t .
M	i went to the extreme of changing everything away from my aol email but when my cancellation was complete , my email and screen name have remained active .
M	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .
M	i ' m now with orange as i also have my mobile contract with them and although others may complain_about them , i ' ve found them good .
M	sky are attractive if you stay on their good side , but my advice would be to go with o0 who seem to have the best customer support and that is what you need if things go_wrong .
M	very happy with there customer_service , they sent me the wrong item but as soon as they were contacted they were straight on it , the correct order was sent out and received with no damage .
M	i have now just ordered a subwoffer from them due to the excellent shipping , prices and customer_service .
M	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anyone .
M	thanks
M	ordered 0 new tyres on monday_afternoon and they were fitted by andy the technician before 0pm the next_day , excellent service .
M	i will_definitely use this them again and would highly_recommend to friends and family .
M	function 00 offers a fantastic range of golf and other sports aparel .

M	won ' t use again !
M	terrible service and a rude staff_member .
M	nothing else to say other than avoid them .
M	i ' d you ' re looking for accommodation and you want a hassle_free way of doing it , use this site .
M	simples .
M	easy to redeem codes .
M	it ' s quick , cheaper and a nice way to get codes without going out .
M	i liked the security system and i would buy another gold_membership next year .
M	:)
M	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
M	but same time charing 00 gbp for installation of the line i already have !!!
M	!
M	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren ' t moving inch forward .
M	i have been paying loads of transfers to poland , using barclays , which were costing me fortune !
M	now i do save about 00_% in comparison to them especially when you check exchange_rate to polish zloty
M	initially i was skeptical_about these kinds of sites that offer fast cash for your old_mobile , but i was hoping to sell my iphone 0 to make a few extra quid .
M	i read the overwhelmingly positive_reviews online about mazuma and thought i ' d give them a try .
M	suffice to say i posted my phone ( registered delivery ) at 0 :_00pm on wednesday and the money was in my account by 0pm on the thursday .
M	less_than a 00 hour turnaround !
M	i was worried that the quoted price may change after the phone had been expected ( the phone was in working order but had very minor surface scratches and cracks ).
M	but no , the quoted amount was sent directly into my bank_account with no question .
M	the whole_process of making the order was really smooth and i didn ' t feel left in the dark at any time .
M	every_step of making the order was highly informative and plenty of options were given as to the method of posting .
M	as well as this , the terms and conditions were really clear and the important stuff was highlighted on the relevant_information .
M	highly_recommended and would definitely use again .
M	after years of struggling with computers which barely managed to run fsx , let_alone run it well , toby and james talked me through my options and provided a system which runs fsx really well - so far , not a single_issue with reliability or performance .
M	i ' m finally able to max out graphics settings , and to do a long_haul flight from london to hong_kong with absolute confidence it won ' t crash the pc .
M	it was at a good price too - far more affordable than the other systems i looked at .
M	it was a additional bonus that the w0f guys were always available by phone , that i always spoke to the same few people , that they went the extra_mile to build what i was looking for - in all respects a really great customer experience .
M	the best experience and help bus driver on return .
M	i was worried at first about the car , but the website put at ease .
M	brillaint service this is my second phone with a massive price difference from the first one and i have always got the full_amount .
M	good service , will use them again and suggest to others .
M	good prices , fast delivery - what else do you need !
M	excellent service .
M	by now i have been using transferwise for about a year and a half .
M	throughout this period i have made over 00 transfers - each and every one of those was executed quickly and professionally .
M	i have had experiences with different money transfer companies such as moneygram , regular banks and western_union .
M	transferwise is by_far the best company in the aforementioned list .
M	the company is young so currencies are few but i see a prolific future for this promising enterprise .
M	thank_you transferwise , for making transferring money easy , fast and cheap !
M	palju edu ka tulevikus !
M	i ordered a few bits for my once weekly climbing sessions .
M	it was delivered in a flash , the website made choosing very easy , i will_definitely buy more kit with these_guys as i need it .
M	i don ' t have much to say , but think of what you ' d expect and it ' s better .
M	sales advice is fantastic , and the item arrived almost before i ' d ordered it .
M	i always use broadbandbuyer , its simple , easy , good website , great advice and reliable .
M	smooth ordering , quick delivery and a great product .
M	thanks !
M	they ' ve an extensive_range of wellies and socks , all at reasonable prices , and really quick delivery .
M	can ' t fault it
M	would definatly use this service again .
M	often find some great deals on here .
M	delivery was extremely fast and efficient and got my stuff the next_day !
M	never had a problem through just_eat - always works_fine .
M	sometimes the orders are incorrect but that ' s the fault of the takeaway itself for being careless and not reading orders properly .
M	if you don ' t get what you ordered , it ' s the fault of the restaurant and not just_eat .
M	just_eat is just an online directory .
M	as an analogy ; if you use the yellow_pages to find a plumber and the plumber is rubbish - that ' s not yellow_pages ' s fault .
M	you don ' t then start slagging off the yellow_pages , you slag of the plumber who did the work .
M	the same applies to just_eat ; if you buy a takeaway through just_eat and that takeaway is rubbish , it ' s not just_eat ' s fault .
M	they ' ve done their work by relaying your order , which is all that ' s required of them .
M	i ' ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0 weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
M	0 with rubbersoles . co . uk which tracked immediately with no_problems
M	0 with play . com which have not tracked at all
M	0 with tesco which has also not tracked
M	i guess it all depends on the reliability of the merchant to report the sale to top_cashback , which it is not in their best interests to do .
M	i will keep using them , but if there ' s any more of this i won ' t bother as it ' s not worth my time to keep chasing amounts of 00p odd .
M	i bought some shoes from here through top_cashback as they were a good price with the cashback .
M	placed the order and within 0 days my shoes had arrived .
M	i was a bit_dubious whether the shoes would turn_up because after i placed the order i suddenly noticed they use hermes as their courier service , which are not the most reliable firm around .
M	however on this occasion the all_round service was top_notch so would definitely use them again .
M	customer_service was also good and kept me updated as to the whereabouts of the order .
M	cashback : so far this is the only company who has actually honored the cashback offer they provide and confirmed the purchase immediately .
M	very pleased with this aspect also .
M	de bestilte varer er_altid kommet til_tiden .
M	har dog aldrig haft brug for kundeservice så kan_ikke udtale mig og_den .
M	men_det klart et sted jeg_vil anbefale .
M	i has ordered several_times from cyclestore .
M	there has never been any_problems , and they are cheaper_than most stores here ( denmark )
M	sold item on ebay bough delivery with interpacel two days late picking it up only going 000_miles down the road 00 days_later got email_saying item is lost no money back no help nothing
M	stay_away i wouldn ' t wish this company on my enemies !
M	0 star is 0_stars too many
M	i am a short - film maker , and amateur photographer .
M	i was looking at upgrading my kit , as there were some things that would help me on other cameras , that i didn ' t have on mine .
M	i started out with the canon_000d , and this wasn ' t enough for me , so i looked around , and i found that the canon_00d would suit me .
M	the professional look , with the qualities i needed , however the price was a little too high .
M	i then thought about second_hand purchasing , so i looked around , and stumbled_upon mpb_photographic , and i can truly say the service was incredible .
M	it took 0 days to deliver , it came out of the box like it was brand_new and everything seemed to be okay .
M	i had also been talking to one of their employees for a long time about selling my camera with them as well .
M	which , because of their service , i think i will do in the future .
M	so , overall , they are a great company , with great prices , great services and they are very helpful .
M	as title suggests .
M	great site , with a huge_range .
M	excellent customer_service , would happily_recommend this to anyone !
M	very efficient and accomodating service , thanks
M	i bought a pile of gear , namely a vape - only clearomizer from libertyflights a long while back .
M	along with a pile of unmixed liquid , of which i was warned to start with premade instead :
M	but i went_ahead and mixed anyway , with some help from a representative at libertyflights over the phone , and i ' ve steaped it and vaped it , and it ' s brilliant to this day !
M	thanks for that !
M	:)
M	---
M	and both the e_- cig & the liquid ; to this day are my favorite way to start the day , so i bought another set ' just in case '.
M	i received it not long ago and despite my excitement , and love of newer and better gadgets ...
M	i couldn ' t but help use my old trusty clearomizer , which in other eyes would be long over due a replacement .
M	non the less all of the gear is going strong and better_than ever .
M	a sign of amazing quality and value .
M	thanks again for your great products ...
M	the pink elephant liquid is also a fantastic creation !
M	^^
M	- chris booth : 0
M	great service , great communication .
M	took the hassle out of buying and was kept up to date at all stages .
M	equipment exactly as advertised and well_packaged .
M	top_notch .
M	totally love this company , no delays , no_problems + excellent prices !
M	tottaly recommend it !
M	used these_guys to buy tools and bits and bobs for diy onwards over the years , and have found them to be generally very good .
M	sometimes they don ' t have the product in store but the deliveries i ' ve had have been good with glitches ironed out well .
M	always found them to be excellent , and they often set the standard for customer_services .
M	astonighing considering the range of goods they carry , they ' re my go to site ( and most peoples )!
M	only wish they ' re search functions in sidebar were better but then again no one else carries this range so it ' s probably the best you could expect given the choice !
M	can ' t argue with the facts people , amazon as it stands today is a safe bet for buying !
M	me and my partner both order from m & m and they ' ve been good .
M	the difficulty with buying on line ( especially clothes ) is sizing but we ' ve found if we ' re a bit_iffy between sizes and there is the option then buying both sizes and paying up front for returns via the pop in package drop_off centres they use is cheaper and faster_than parking in town !
M	another success and they ' re generally very fast at refunding returned items , usually taking a day or 0 maxumum , just as it should be .
M	will_continue to use , but would be nice if they carried more small / medium clothes or had a slightly bettwe size search_function as we ' re not all built like weebles !
M	make_sure you update your website offers as fara in_advance as possible , and possibly ( a la aldi . com . au ) put your grocery prices so even if we can ' t order online we can compare .
M	other than that , brilliant store , occasional problems with goods ( usually incorrectly stored cold items like cheese ) which can be a bit_annoying but accept this and save money as it ' s on the way home !
M	having had faulty items from another big company ( which they dealt_with well but were unable to supply working items ) i bought from tesco_direct .
M	items arrived very quickly ( surprised by yodels ' efficiency in this case as have heard mixed reports ) and the items were exactly as needed .
M	chap on the desk was friendly and not the first time i have used direct , as delivery to the desk is free and can be combined with the shopping !
M	yes they ' re big and they have made mistakes on orders sometimes , but they do seem to rectifiy them well .
M	we get our dog_food from these_guys ( last 0 years ), a very small local operation who deliver in the east midlands .
M	they do sometimes take a week to deliver but as we order in plenty of time this is never an issue and the value is very good .
M	the deliveries are always by a really friendly delivery woman and the service on email and phone is also great .
M	on the one_occasion in the last 0 years when food was delayed , they called us to let us now , which was nice .
M	ordered some panniers and they arrived when they were supposed to , and were exactly as advertised .
M	as good as going into branch and buying them , just as internet shopping should be !
M	every consumer occasionally has difficulties , the challenge of buying sight unseen in some_cases .
M	in play ' s case , they have typically dealt promptly with any questioons , and have provided information and assistance over a few_years worth of purchases .
M	sometimes delivery is slow , other times fast ( slow being around their estimated_delivery , fast being next_day !)
M	but on the whole i have been very impressed .
M	case in point , i purchased a micro_sd_card around a year_ago ( 00 months ), never thought to check it ' s speed .
M	when changin phones , i noticed it was class 0 and i was sure i ' d bought class 0 ( which i had ).
M	despite the purchase being over a year_ago , play apologised , accepted return , and sent the item i should originally have received .
M	i was very impressed , and will be rewarding that with further purchases , as play are also ( usually ) fairly competitive , and a couple of pounds on larger purchases isn ' t as much of a deal_breaker as poor service .
M	well_done so far play . com !
M	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
M	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
M	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don ' t abuse .
M	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained staff .
M	that said , very little has ever been returnred to any of them !
M	updated following the very fast ' response ' from ebuyer ' s nikki .
M	absolute diddly squat !
M	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then ... still do nothing !
M	if their service was as good as their responding to poor reviews , then there would probably be no poor reviews !
M	update !
M	should have updated this a while ago !
M	ebuyer did remedy this issue and acknowledged that it was the goods at fault .
M	although they required chasing which should have been needed , they did reimburse my out of pocket expenses in sending back the defective goods .
M	note that they took less_than an_hour to test the items to find them not suitable .
M	as such , i have altered the rating to 0_stars as this is a ' middle of the road ' experience now that resolution has passed rather_than a truly_awful one .
M	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer_service experience .
M	i will find out when making future_purchases .
M	called jl and they advised me store had stock and would price_match ( never knowingly undersold my ar $ e !
M	).
M	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don ' t stock that ' response .
M	useless and poor internal comms !
M	very dissapointed with experience , purchased from a different retailer in the end .
M	ordered an item ( garish pink fleece for my better half ).
M	arrived in 0 days .
M	not only that , but online discount on their website didn ' t track , and when i phoned , they refunded the amount that was supposed to be discounted straight_away , very impressive !
M	would use them again if this is the level of service they offer !
M	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
M	thieves !
M	avoid at all costs .
M	after comparing a number of different sites , i decided to buy from pc_specialist .
M	they had the best price on the clevo laptop i wanted .
M	perfect !
M	always buy my protein_shakes and supplements from here when i run out .
M	especially their reflex products since they ' re usually the cheapest around and delivery is always prompt and packed well .
M	ordered a pc case from box . co . uk and it arrived pretty quickly .
M	very well_packaged but the best thing about them was how they would update you on your order .
M	as usual with most shops online they send you a confirmation_email and the order dispatch email but box . co . uk also send you a text_message to your phone !
M	just incase you couldn ' t get to a computer at_least you ' d be made aware about the status of your item .
M	will hopefully be ordering from box . co . uk again .
M	you need to experience quality - that ' s why dj_deals is the best - you can feel the quality coming to you from the click to the delivery .
M	quick , professional and reliable service i trust when it comes to my gear .
M	bought a redsub bod - 0 bass distortion pedal on a whim to see what it sounded_like .
M	very impressed with build_quality ( as this is own_brand stuff ) and sound quality for the price !
M	very fast postage and good communication so would definitely use again !
M	bought pair of makita drills for £_00 less_than i could find them anywhere_else hadn ' t used the site before so some reservations but extremely easy transaction and quick delivery so will_definitely be back !
M	the eyewear_outlet store was fantastic , an amazing range from stock and delivered next_day for a very competitive rate , what i really liked was the confirmation of delivery , i got a txt and an_email from them saying when it would be delivered , to the hour !
M	very impressed and will_definitely use them again !
M	best seller online ... safe transaction . great customer_service .. most recomended .
M	couldnt be better really if youve got a flat tyre you dont need to think about getting your car to a garage just get it changed where it is
M	bought a jim root telecaster got e_- mails and texts the next_day letting me know the hour of the day when it would arrive will_definitely use again
M	i think she should be promoted , or given a large pay_rise as she helped my business out hugely today
M	fantastic service ,
M	i could say a lot about webtogs , but i really want you to go and explore for yourselves .
M	you won ' t regret it for a second ...
M	great products and advice at every_stage of your online journey .
M	personal service delivered with care and attention .
M	swift delivery and great after - care .
M	the list_goes on ...
M	webtogs has provided one of my best online shopping experiences , and like many of the other_reviewers here , i will use them again and again .
M	customer_service is so important nowadays , but often forgotten by many .
M	webtogs has got it right on the money and is leading the way .
M	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
M	driver was very helpful in working around my time in order to deliver the parcel to me that day .
M	i had had to go out in the morning but was able to speak directly with the driver to adjusted and made sure he got to me when i was back home .
M	great service !
M	great idea and very easy to use .
M	nice to get some cash for something that is otherwise just sitting around in the drawer .
M	very easy service to use .
M	efficient .
M	arrived within 00_hours with the cheapest of the shipping options .
M	product was really well_priced and i would definitely buy from here again .
M	i was so used to paying huge sums of money for the supplements me and my husband would use .
M	i just got so tired of it that we were going to just stop using anything at all .
M	luckily enough i stumbled_upon supplementwarehouse . com .
M	i was more_than ecstatic to see that they have a price checker right there next to the item , so that just in case that they aren ' t the absolute lowest_price they will check and beat it ( can we say " awesome ").
M	plus all the free_samples and gizmos they give you with each purchase will have me coming_back from now on .
M	don ' t pay high prices for drug store chains with big markups .
M	discovered brown bear just recently and fell in love with their coffee !
M	excellent site and super_fast delivery !
M	will be back for more and more …. my wife tells_me i ' m addicted lol .
M	not even fully with first_utility yet but after a week of trying to contact them im heading back to my previous_supplier .
M	sent an_email to them on monday , got a automated_reply and heard_nothing since .
M	tried to call on monday with no joy .
M	tried again today and again no joy .
M	read the reviews on this site and low and behold they answered first time when i said i wanted to join .
M	i then got transfered both_times and cut_off .
M	customer_service is obviously low on their company values .
M	ta ta
M	i ordered some window lock keys from lockandkey . co . uk as they had the most competitive price i could find .
M	having ordered and paid by paypal , i received an_email a few hours_later to say that the order had been despatched .
M	i received the order the following_day .
M	the items were what i was expecting .
M	excellent experience all_round .
M	i ordered a humax hdr0000s freesat pvr from electricshop .
M	this was my first ever order with them .
M	i chose electricshop as they were the cheapest reputable store i could find on the web .
M	order communication was good , and the item arrived_promptly today .
M	however , when i opened the grey mail bag , i was very disappointed to discover that this item had just been shipped in its retail packaging , and not in a box .
M	this is not ideal for fragile products that contain hdds .
M	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough handling by couriers .
M	if humax ship their products like this , then so should resellers of their products .
M	i have now placed 0 web orders with tool line in 0000 .
M	i find their prices to be unbeatable and the range of goods they offer is far wider than what can be browsed using the categories on their website - the trick is to use the search box .
M	i have had to make changes to several orders and sending them an_email during business hours always generates a helpful response within an_hour .
M	next_day delivery by citylink is free for orders over £_00 which is a lower threshold than many of their competitors .
M	i have recommended tool line to a number of my friends who have also found them to be keenly priced and efficient .
M	i ordered some pens from cult_pens .
M	their prices were good , especially the p_& p .
M	the pens arrived quickly and even included a free pen to thank me for my order .
M	i would purchase from cult_pens again .
M	awesome site , easy to use , loads of choice :)
M	i had an issue that resulted_in royal_mail holding back the product i purchased due to unpaid postage .
M	however , a guy from the sales_team got in contact with me asking what had happened .
M	nevertheless , the problem was simply dealt_with and gadget case had refunded me the cost of retrieving the item .
M	the matter was greatly handled and a good customer_satisfaction after the issue .
M	i use iphone for internet ..
M	it took me 00mins to leave a review for a company it only took me 0 mins to book return transfers from airport to hotel not happy .. takes 0 sec delay for what you type to come up on screen ..
M	same del in tryin to navigate site :(
M	just used suntransfers for the first time , having received a really good quote for a return transfer for 00 guys on a stag , from palma airport to magalluf , and i could not fault the service at all .
M	both drivers were courteous , the vehicles were clean and included the necessary child seat if needed .
M	the pre_- holiday booking service allowed me to make changes without any extra money taken a nice surprise when most travel companies try to charge more .
M	i will certainly use suntransfers for all my future transfers .
M	p . s it was easier to book suntransfers . com return booking than it was to submit this review :(
M	preorder went well received with plenty of time for preload .
M	fast at support , plan . io provide a great full featured issue reporting system .
M	always polite and always helpful they even anticipated our request to map a new sub - domain when our company re - branded .
M	in short this has taken the hassle out of many of our project_management hosting issues and allowed us to concentrate on managing projects instead of managing our project_management !
M	ffx are a fantastic company to deal with - i placed my order over the phone with a very helpful member of staff who was very knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with .
M	the processing and delivery was very fast and efficient and i will definitley be using the company again .
M	i will recommend ffx to others .
M	this is a first_class service , i placed my order online and two days_later my tyres were fitted , during the process black_circles were keeping me up to date with my order via_email and a call .
M	very highly_recommended !
M	!
M	had an issue all of my own doing and the help livechat assistant , richard_mileham , was so helpful , sorted my issue promptly , politely and with great ease .
M	yet more great service from parcel0go . com
M	quick delivery backed_up with fantastic customer_service .
M	you can ' t ask for more from an online_retailer .
M	i ordered replacement headphone tips for my klipsch earphones .
M	as one of only 0 authorised retailers which have online stores i quickly ordered with them .
M	sure enough 00minutes later i had a email_confirming my order had been dispatched .
M	it arrived the next_day before 0am with a lollipop thrown in too .
M	i liked that touch .
M	would definitely_recommend !
M	i ordered a brilliant cheap guitar from this site not only is it great value it looks brilliant but i got it in just one day i was emailed with details of my order going through and i was emailed and texted as soon as the order had been dispatched and i was also given all the tracking_information which came in handy i spoke to them with a query_regarding the order and they answered to the best of their ability they are a brilliant site with some great guitars i really recommend the semi acoustic guitars which you can find by typing in semi acoustic in the search box great value brilliant
M	i had an excellent experience with ritehome and can recommend them highly .
M	at a fraction of the cost of a regular agent they helped_me secure a tenant and were great at staying in contact during the whole_process .
M	i bought two things online both from croydon .
M	both said dispatched emails one arrived_promptly the other i waited the 0 days and then mailed .
M	no response - mailed again the next_day copying in info @ - again no response .
M	raised a complaint with paypal asking again polity where it was - no apology just a tracking_number : it was sent on the day i fist asked where it was - obviously that had prompted them into sending it .
M	why couldn ' t they just sent a email_saying sorry - its in the post now ?
M	another complaint - sent a email to feedback_@ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
M	i don ' t order much from amazon anymore , i find their prices tend to be more_expensive than other_companies and out of the 0 recent orders in which i paid for a timed delivery i have only received 0 on time .
M	however i did receive the money back for the delivery
M	i have used aria for a couple of purchases recently both were cheaper_than anywhere_else and the delivery was next_day .
M	their prices are updated very regular and if your a active_forum member you can get free delivery on some items .
M	top_notch company
M	save a ton of money , and time ordering through supplementwarehouse . com .
M	the best on the web .
M	don ' t know how you guys do it , but keep it up and you ' ll have my money .
M	god_awful service from dabs
M	god help anyone who uses this company .
M	il begin with the web_site stating my solid state drive would be in stock in 0 - 0 days , 0 days_later i got bored of waiting and removed this order since it was a compleate load of rubish that it will be arriving within 0 days
M	so ...... my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card ...... whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
M	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo .... how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
M	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
M	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
M	out of intrest i sent them an_email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
M	my job takes me away from my hometown and although im not strugling for money i would have been looking at taking a new contract last_week , yet im still stuck here with no answers , not even replys to my emails
M	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
M	nothing .....
M	all i want is to be able to return the faulty_goods iv been delivered , and i should at_least get back half the cash for the chasis
M	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court
M	kind rigards

M	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
M	i assumed this was an oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank_details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
M	i rang back to check if this went through ok only to be told i had been declined by o0 , no explanation was offered as to why .
M	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
M	rang back carphone_warehouse to explain the above , no satisfactory explanation just told me i had been declined due to adverse credit , this is utter nonsense as i have since seen my equifax credit_report which has no marks or blemishes and scores me as " excellent ", the only offer your staff made was to try another network .
M	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
M	since i have seen my credit_report ( and its fine ) i have asked them to tell me specifically why my application has been declined , surprisingly they couldnt tell me .
M	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
M	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
M	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	edit_: 00 / 00 / 00 - well its 0 working_days on and no comment from cpw - bad publicity on trustpilot is one thing but we ' ll see what watchdog have to say about it if cpw cant be bothered to respond on here .
M	the service just_eat provides is fantastic , long gone are the days of trying to phone your local takeaway and getting that annoying line busy tone !
M	yes they charge 00p for the benefit of the service they provide but its worth it !
M	there is also far more choice than other online inferior rivals .
M	i have used the service now for about 0 years , heres to the next 0 !
M	cheers just_eat .

M	used this service for the first time to get a motorbike delivered .
M	saved me about three hours of a round_trip and probably saved me money over the petrol cost .
M	will use again if the need pops up !
M	as always great products at a very good price and super_fast delivery .
M	wouldn ' t dream of going anywhere_else !
M	very fast and perfect service
M	great great .
M	ordered the key at 00 noon on sunday , and although it said between 00mins - 0 hours i was expecting abit longer due to it being sunday but it was delivered within half an_hour , had a tiny scare when the code didnt work but i realised i had typed it in wrong ( stupid me ) but really easy and quick service , much recommended !

M	products delivered to galway city within a day .
M	competitively_priced and samples of other products included .
M	what more could ya want !
M	we at zoukmobile been working with txtnation for the past 0 years now and we have nothing but praises for their conduct and service reliability although there were issues here and there we know these were not in their control and they always push on to provide us the best in terms of service !
M	they truly meant when they said they are the global sms text messaging solutions for business !
M	been using test - meter for well over a year , excellent prices , excellent customer_service and a pleasure to deal with
M	theres no need to go anywhere_else !
M	matt
M	this site has the best deals for any supplements .
M	i brought some new windsurfing sails from boylos . co . uk this month .
M	the guys there were extremely_helpful and really knew there stuff .
M	not only did they give me some good advice but made sure i had the sails in time for the weekend .
M	thanks to the team , will use again for sure .
M	i ordered a custom laptop from pc_specialist because i couldn ' t find a pre_- built machine that met my specifications .
M	the most difficult part of the whole_process was deciding where to draw the line in terms of the wealth of options available - with all hardware offered at very reasonable prices .
M	it took a bit of time to get built - i think it took about 0 weeks from order to delivery , but i hadn ' t opted for an express option so no_complaints there .
M	a couple of my chosen parts where unavailable , but these were upgraded to the next available part at no extra_cost .
M	on delivery , the laptop worked_perfectly , exactly as i expected from the spec .
M	windows was sensibly set_up , with no extra ' bonus ' programs clogging things up .
M	i would heartily_recommend pc_specialist to anyone .
M	cheap , efficient , next_day delivery - can ' t fault shopto . net .
M	will be using them again ...
M	ive bought parts and sold parts to flatout , and they certainly have the customer in mind and consumer satisfaction !
M	in regards to selling on items , i really found it easy and straight_forward you send them details and within_00hours there back with a response so quick and easy and prices are suprisingly really good in most_cases , also with buying used items from them , product condition is always great and serviced were it can be before sold on .
M	certainly recommend .
M	i wish the site was more user_friendly ; being_able to view all supplements related to what a user is searching .
M	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
M	fast delivery and a great item .
M	fantastic .
M	item arrived on time and was quite cheap , but customer_services were very poor indeed when something went wrong
M	they now ship new_releases from the uk , so there is no waiting involved .
M	i ' ve been getting some big releases early recently too .
M	big_fan of their site , best on the web for games imo
M	fantastic idea and absolutely beautiful when mixed truly epic product !!
M	!
M	quite simply powerbody are second to none on service .. they are the only company whom offer the following
M	deal of the week - with products voted by customers
M	free giveaways on fb_page
M	free supplements to useful members of their forums
M	complete stacks free to log on their forums .
M	this combined with a close knit community spirit , helpful videos , fun conversations ( without shameless plugs or spam ) and freindly approachable staff makes them the only company i have used since the summer
M	i received my order quickly and it was the best price around at the time .
M	it only took about a week from the moment i confirmed it on the website until i got the money for the phone and it wasn ' t too bad a price considering it was a fairly old phone .
M	i started the live_chat as i was unaware of the whereabouts of my parcel regardless of the parcel tracker .
M	emma assisted me and i was able to determine when my parcel would be delivered to me .
M	thanks emma :) merry xmas
M	i have been following the blogs on the website for a while now , some good information on he celta course as i am hoping to start that soon .
M	also taken on the grammar challenge ...
M	i didn ' t do too bad :_d
M	learning a lot on the course at the moment , great customer support as well .
M	overall really pleased .
M	thanks !
M	i have been with vodafone over 0 years ... and not been happy with the bills , customer_services and generally the whole company !!
M	!
M	i had been over charged on each bill for no apparent_reason and took me over 0 years to get my money back for the over charge !!
M	i had to go through my bills each month an check properly .. just to see where they will charge me extra !
M	not happy at all !
M	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
M	( unless you can :_p ).
M	i have purchased a lot of supplements from these_guys , great prices and fast delivery .
M	i ' ve signed_up to them and get offers emailed to me as well .
M	some good offers on the usn products :_d
M	ive had a problem this morning with o0 top - up not crediting my wifes phone after the £_00 was taken from my account , the bank has confirmed this with a transaction_id .
M	0 hours of phone_calls and im now waiting for a manager to call me back , but the way ive been dealt_with so far im not expecting a call .
M	the " customers service " advisors are the most incompetent patronising and unproffesional i have ever_dealt_with .
M	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
M	phone service and reception is also very poor and mobile internet is poor at best , if i can get a signal .
M	great site for awsome supplement deals beats any competitor price this is the only site i visit to buy supplements shipping is fast and i love all the free_stuff i can order costumer_service is great too and are always willing to help bottom_line this sight is awsome !!!
M	!
M	nothing to complain_about
M	great selection of shisha pipes and accessories .
M	very good value for money , especially the soex tobacco free molasses !
M	i cannot_fault american soda .
M	every order has been delivered on time ( usually ahead of the expected arrival date )!
M	the delivery charges are incredibly reasonable given the weight of items i usually buy .
M	prices are high but expected for imports from america .
M	the service is excellent and i will keep on buying !
M	a fantastic resource for small_businesses and start - ups .
M	advice ranging_from finances to legal information !
M	the title say it all .
M	i have had my hosting_package for six_years now and changed my primary domain a couple of times - effortless support with knowledgeable support staff ( how refreshing )!
M	the prices are unbeatable - by_far the best hosting company i have ever used !
M	a great review site with a clear and easy to use interface .
M	do not book a collection when it ' s cold - it will not get collected as all their couriers are afraid of snow , ice or even the prospect of snow and ice .
M	it took 00 days for one of my parcels to be delivered !
M	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
M	all items can be tracked online .
M	customer_service is poor - i am still_awaiting a response to a delay claim .
M	great range of shoes for large footed people and reasonable prices too .
M	fast dispatch although p_& p is pricey at £ 0 . 00 !
M	service is excellent - returned shoes as they were damaged , received the new pair before i even got a chance to return the damaged pair !
M	products are crazy and fun !
M	service is outstanding - i ordered wednesday for friday delivery , dispatched wednesday_evening , thursday_afternoon i was told i had to work so a quick call to firebox and my parcel was re - routed to my work address .
M	totally effortless and so helpful !
M	one word of warning - their prices are quite high .
M	shop around before buying as you may save a packet !
M	all my batteries are bought through battery - force . co . uk now !
M	their batteries are excellent value for money , beating the highstreet prices by at_least 00 %.
M	p_& p is also cheap too with a variety of options .
M	novelty : they scan your purchases on dispatch and attach the image in an_email - plus you get a tasty chocolate too with every purchase !
M	interparcel are the ' middle - men ' agents between couriers and customers .
M	i dispatch all my sales through interparcel - they are cheap and cheerful !
M	all my collections have been picked_up when stated ( except when it was snowing - the customer_service team were outstanding at re - arranging collection with a different courier at no extra charge !)
M	and i have never had any reason to complain .
M	delivery status is visible at the click of a button and i can provide my customers with a link too !
M	personal use , again no issues what - so - ever !
M	thoroughly_recommend them for price , service and helpful ' ness !
M	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
M	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
M	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
M	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
M	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
M	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
M	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
M	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
M	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
M	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
M	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
M	hilarious and politically incorrect shirts at great value prices !
M	no extortionate shipping fees for international addresses , good customer_service , easy to use ordering system and speedy dispatch ( considering items are printed to order ...)!
M	visiting ny in march and while we are there we want to see an ice hockey match at maddison sq .
M	had a look on the official site and tickets were in excess of $_000 a piece , so hunted around , found ticketloot and bought three tickets , same block for $_000 total !!
M	!
M	ticketloot act as the sales platform between punters and sellers - great service , secure_payments and timely status_updates plus satisfaction_guarantee too !
M	cannot wait to see the rangers vs . panthers !
M	every order i place i seem to have to return something because the item is faulty , sized incorrectly or not as advertised .
M	customer_service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an_email .
M	additionally , when i item is exchanged , they automatically add £ 0 . 00 p_& p again and every time i have to email and ask them to refund it - getting very tiresome !
M	good joe browns range and £ 0 . 00 next_day delivery is great value .
M	a totally unique and unparalleled ' all - in - one ' suit / thing !
M	easy to use website .
M	will buy again !
M	i saved on average 00 - 00_% when i shop at maplin as_opposed to other high - street electrical retailers .
M	also , maplin stock so many different components , your pretty_much guaranteed to find what you looking for !
M	delivery is usually very quick too !
M	i haven ' t got a bad_word to say about maplin !!
M	!
M	best prices sexcure shopping and you can always find that hard to find item !!!!!
M	!
M	its easy but its costs more_than going your self i always get less_than when i go and do it myself you cant look for the deals either !
M	if your trying to save money go to your local_store
M	not great some things are cheap but the rest is overpriced just like b and q
M	great delivery , great communication and a good service all_round .
M	ive used it twice now and both time where awesome and got to me quickly
M	i was very satisfied with the service
M	i ' ve been using gak for several years now .
M	i don ' t have a single complaint .
M	great prices , great service and great delivery .
M	never had a problem with myprotein .
M	the prices are fantastic and the delivery is cheap but fast .
M	i only ever had one problem , and that was sorted out by mp in no time despite it being the couriers fault ( lost the product ).
M	by_far , supplement_warehouse is my all time favorite and only website i ' ve used to order supplements in the past couple of years , i always recommend them to any person wanting supplements .
M	best prices i ' ve found and great deals constantly .
M	thank_you supplement_warehouse !
M	by_far the cheapest prices on all of my supplements .
M	and a prompt delivery time as well .
M	t shirt_studio is a brilliant service , selling items at top_notch quality and prices .
M	i have recently_bought t shirts from this company and i must_say i have never been so happy with a t shirt .
M	it ' s not only made by but is a amazing quality as well .
M	brilliant service !, will_definitely use again without a moments hesitation .
M	am pretty new to the whole bitcoin game .
M	after spending more_than 0 hours looking for a fast and reliable method to buy coins i was close to giving up .
M	i was lucky_enough to find bittylicious .
M	simply wow , you guys_rock - my transaction was completed in 0 minutes .
M	many_thanks to all you for such a wonderful service .
M	i use this company every time for my printer bits and pieces and always the service is excellent everything in stock and it arrives the next_day can ' t get any better !
M	brought 00 months xbox gold_membership at amazing price compared to others .
M	email arrived immediately and after confirming mobile number , code arrived and worked brilliantly .
M	will use again !
M	as much as we may look upon these tv ads and large organisations as rip_off_merchants , i think it is now time for people to become realistic .
M	mazuma have taken my phone , and put cash into my account , simple !.
M	they have given me a better price than any small retailer , and trust me i have been to loads over the last 0 weeks .
M	so .......... get onto mazuma and let the small rip_off shops rott .
M	this company is a success for a reason , they are good .
M	you ' ve heard the saying " if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is ", well with flubit it isn ' t !
M	!
M	saved good amounts of money on a few items now - that ' s after an exhaustive web search to find the best prices i could .
M	would highly_recommend to anyone !
M	despite early scepticism this site has proven me wrong - no catches , no junk_mail and you get cash back on your online purchases !
M	sign_up and use - you won ' t regret it !
M	great company !!!!!!
M	love the products , fast_shipping and amazing prices .
M	i ' ve used them multiple_times and will again in the future !
M	thanks supplementwarehouse . com
M	very good delivery time , especially for free delivery .
M	will probably continue using this company because the service is very quick and easy to use .
M	they are okay if you register before days like easter .
M	i ordered my domain on friday ( it ' s now saturday ) and they have said i have to wait for monday !
M	this is fustrating !
M	live_chat not very helpful neither .
M	spoke to erick on the online_chat facility as i was having problems redeeming my voucher .
M	i gave him the code and he sorted it all for me with little effort on my behalf
M	a friend who had previously used mazuma_mobile had highly_recommended them .
M	after using them myself , i have found the service extremely fast and excellent value .
M	by using the " print your own pack " option , the money was in my bank_account within 0 days !
M	i will_definitely use them again .
M	great site explains everything a person needs to know , depending_on what form you buy your herbs i bought tinctures as they are said to be more potent and easier to consume the site explains how to prepare them etc ..
M	i phoned indigo to ask about certain things to which i was greeted with great service and help , the items arrived on time , packaged well and most of all they work !
M	after the first day i could feel a genuine difference !
M	so when it comes to herbs i don ' t think i will need to go elsewhere , very pleased with this company !
M	first of all the e_- hardware website has a great layout for ease of use , everything was well described and informative .
M	in my case i just wanted to purchase a door handle set so decided to phone them which was late on afternoon time , the call was tended to promptly and the service was friendly , fast and further to that my product arrived next morning , excellent !
M	the product itself is high_quality and well_packaged , will be using and recommending e_- hardware in the future , top drawer company !
M	thanks e_- hardware - matt speake
M	fast delivery .
M	good packing .
M	very easy to order , and free next_day delivery is superb !
M	superb website and the delivery is usually always next_day ( even_though it ' s a bit_pricey !
M	)....
M	but the products are the best price you will find anywhere and have helped_me with my training .
M	much_better value than big brand_names who sell the same_thing .
M	i regularly use them and will_continue to do so
M	you order things , and days_later after chasing , they finally tell you it ' s out of stock and you ' ll get a refund , ok , that would be fine if , they didn ' t have multiple companies around the uk that they own , doing the exact_same_thing !
M	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it ' s in stock , get charged , then the same_thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
M	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!
M	three times !
M	glad i found 0quid , could not ask for more .
M	joyetech is already well renowned for making superior vapor products , so i won ' t wax poetical about them here , except to say that they deliver a quality product at a great price , and with the fastest , most convenient service i ' ve experienced in quite some time .
M	absolutely satisfied with my ego - c .
M	i always have a great experience when i order from supplementwarehouse .
M	their prices are the cheapest i can find and the shipping service is excellent !
M	a new shop in haverfordwest , this is really the only music shop worth dealing_with with if you ' re in pembrokeshire , cardiganshire or carmarthenshire .
M	a great selection of keyboards , stage pianos , drums , electric and acoustic guitars , as well as pa equipment .
M	even if they don ' t have what you need there , they ' re happy to get hold of it for you .
M	they ' ve got a great online store , which is really quite unique for a small shop .
M	they also hire out pa equipment and even have a yamaha music school downstairs , perfect if you ' re a beginner pianist , guitarist or drummer .
M	seriously nice people to deal with , who will do whatever they can to help .
M	brilliant customer_service , great prices , free delivery .
M	and - get this - ordered nikon d000 00am , arrived from_hong_kong the next_day in uk .
M	brilliant .
M	don ' t buy from these , needed to cancel order , tried to charge me 00_% of total order to cancel it - how they still exist is beyond me .
M	efficient , friendly , helpful - everything you want from a bed company .
M	don ' t be taken in by their cheap prices , or promises of good customer support - this company , it seems , is a sham .
M	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
M	once ordered , the order status page then gave me 0 - 00 days .
M	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
M	spending 00_minutes waiting for someone to answer my call , an indian lass answered , citing a ' delay ' in getting it dispatched , as if it were a valid excuse .
M	' next week ' she pulled out of the air .
M	never going to happen .
M	they don ' t have the stock , plain and simple .
M	getting a refund , or else my bank is getting involved .
M	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these_jokers .
M	i guarantee you , wae_+ will not exist in 0 months time .
M	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn ' t worth it .
M	ebay takes such a huge cut , it ' s almost not worth selling on it .
M	item was out of stock , but they made sure to call and ask whether i would like to wait or cancel order ( very cheap too ).
M	0 * for excellent and personal service - very helpful staff really care about you as a customer ; it ' s like dealing_with your local shop in the 0000s - brilliant !
M	after an intensive internet hunt for a set of 0 barum bravuris 0 tyres i found that national . co . uk had the best value for 0 new ( mid range ) tyres , balanced & fitted !!
M	great .
M	there are other_companies offering generic mid - range tyres for a lot less , however i know barum bravuris 0 have a good reputation , and with national - at_least i know what brand i ' m getting .
M	i also found a 0 / 0 price wheel alignment offer on their site which is worth going for !
M	hostelbookers makes traveling that much_easier and less_stressful when you are traveling from city to city !
M	its the best !
M	no hassle transaction .
M	good as_described and arrived on time as promised .
M	fast dispatch as promised , no_problems , would use again .
M	great value protein , easy to mix and tastes good .
M	i wanted my fiancee to have an input when picking the engagement_ring of her dreams and she found it with ease at marlows .
M	we searched for styles online and had a decent idea of what we wanted before going to birmingham ' s jewellery_quarter .
M	marlow ' s had been recommended to us by friends and they did not let us down .
M	fantastic customer_service , as trish explained all our options without any pressure and with no sense of ' upselling ' to buy something we did not want .
M	the range of settings and diamonds that marlow ' s had available was vast , so we could find exactly_what we wanted .
M	within 0 hours of selecting our diamond and our setting of choice the ring was made and ready for us to pick_up .
M	marlow ' s offer great after - care of it ' s rings , as they will polish and clean them each year .
M	we will be back to buy the matching wedding_bands and are so glad that we chose marlow ' s to be part of a very special shopping_experience .
M	the site has lots of products for sale at a good price and the free overnight delivery is great as you can order what ever before 0 : 00 pm and it will arrive the next_day , this service is great and i plan on using it more in the future .
M	optical_express has helped_me in so many ways .
M	after getting laser_eye surgury , my whole completly changed ; my confidence grew ; i had less stress of loosing and finding my glasses .
M	in the long_term i believe it was definatly the best financial option , rather that consistently buying new glassses and contactlenses .
M	had a quick query to do with an order i was in the process of making , and had a fully professional and prompt response to the query from the agent i spoke to ( samantha ).
M	highly_recommended
M	very happy with the experience received !
M	website is relatively easy to navigate and order from , picked a fitting_centre and got my confirmation in no time at all .
M	unfortunately the snowy weather delayed my tyres getting to the fitting_centre but i was called the day before by black_circles to inform me of this .
M	my fitting was rearranged and the old tyres swapped over to the new in less_than half an_hour for the 0 wheels !
M	great fitting_centre with helpful and friendly staff ( seems very rare on the isle of wight !)
M	i will certainly be returning when i need more tyres !
M	highly_recommended !
M	i did know what i wanted which may have helped but it was very easy to find on the site and the shipping was incredibly fast .
M	great price too !
M	i ordered my v_festival ticket through double0tickets . com and am amazed at how great they really are .
M	the ticket was an excellent price , the customer_service was great and i even got a text_message to say when the ticket was sent and will be delivered .
M	an all_round great website and company that offers great tickets at excellent prices .
M	ignore all the other reviews , this is a trusted website .
M	thank_you double0tickets . com !!
M	!
M	dean mendum , east grinstead
M	it is easy to use , cheap , and no booking_fees .
M	the layout is easy on the eye .
M	use these_guys , they rock .
M	seriously .
M	i ' ve been using them for years since the early days of dreamhosting ( their old name ) and i can only say that they are exception .
M	instant replies on support , solving all kind of queries ( even those relating to my dodgy php !
M	).
M	would recommend them in a heart beat .
M	they are genuinely one of those companies where you can ' t quite believe they exist , such is the quality of their service for the price the provide .
M	i always get my supplements from supplement_warehouse .
M	i have been a satisfied and loyal_customer for over a year .
M	there is a huge_selection , great prices , and the customer_service is second to none .
M	i recommend subscribing to the newsletter .
M	it consists of current specials and discount coupons toward the entire purchase .
M	supplement_warehouse is responsible for helping me reach my potential .
M	thanks sw !
M	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven ' t dispatched the order for over one month !
M	and no one respond the email and phone call !
M	!
M	many_thanks for your help with sorting the delivery of our parcel .
M	any_problems we will be contacting sammy_taylor at parcels to go
M	amazing first transaction with digirev - i had some pre sales questions , all of which we ' re answered succinctly and quickly .
M	top_notch .
M	i will shop with them again .
M	even_though it was my first time at hostel_bookers , booking a hostel was easy as anything .
M	it took me only a minute to find a good value hostel and another minute to book it .
M	great experience
M	very high_quality products at very competitive_prices .
M	a warm and friendly service , and items dispatched and delivered extremely quickly !
M	i read good reviews for panelbase , it was even at the top of some survey lists .
M	however , my experience with them has been the opposite .
M	very , very few surveys in comparison with other survey sites like valued opinions or mysurvey .
M	there is a very tedious profiling section to be completed at the beginning and it ' s all for nothing .
M	most of the time i ' m not even eligible for their surveys , yet they give them to me anyway ( at most one per week ).
M	terrible site and an_absolute waste of time .
M	avoid .
M	nothing good to say about it - really hate this site .
M	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook ' s case i think that user opposition is justified .
M	layout and feature overhauls aren ' t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn ' t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
M	they could do well by listening to feedback .
M	other than that , it is a solid social_networking site .
M	they ' ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
M	whether you ' re just casually looking for information on an upcoming movie , or searching back for movies that you want to check out , your needs will be met .
M	as far as user controlled movie ratings go , imdb ' s scores are fairly good representations , though there are still pointless - and unavoidable - rating wars .
M	i ' ve also spent a good deal of time on the forums on the site , especially after watching a movie and looking for fan interpretations .
M	first off , i do purchase my music , but the prices on itunes are just off - putting sometimes .
M	i would go for the occasional album , but they just don ' t seem to be throwing a lot of offers out there nowadays .
M	it can also be frustrating to search for music on their site and find out that they don ' t have it .
M	it speaks for itself whenever you no_longer refer to searching on the internet , but " googling ".
M	top_notch search_engine , very popular email service ( which i can ' t comment on further since i don ' t actively use it ) but they really flopped with their social_networking site .
M	but did they really need that anyway ?
M	their origin service is atrocious , their downloadable content schemes pathetic , and their respect for gamers nowhere to be found .
M	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
M	they ' ve taken enough franchises under their wing and prematurely buried them - amongst them some of my favourites .
M	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
M	the customer is always right , and ea should finally open their eyes to see that .
M	by the way , just look_elsewhere online to see the appalling services that ea have provided .
M	rarely you ' ll find an original and interesting article on ign .
M	however , their videos can be decent , ranging_from informative to humourous , and is the strong point of the site .
M	unfortunately , they are given an incentive to review certain games favourably , which really tarnishes ign ' s reputation amongst gamers .
M	for some reviews this is really obvious and distracting , especially compared to other gaming review sites ( but this practice of companies pushing for good reviews doesn ' t just fall onto ign , don ' t get me wrong ).
M	you might as well be reading a piece written by the lead developer of a game in some_cases .
M	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
M	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
M	i don ' t know how a company like dell can continue running their business with their current customer support base .
M	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job ... until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that ' s my belief anyway ).
M	i had a laptop for about three years before it kicked the bucket , and , to my surprise , i had forgotten about the warranty that i had with it .
M	it was actually due to run out about a month after the time of the laptop dying .
M	called up support , was redirected to india and was put on the line with totally unhelpful staff that i couldn ' t understand , and who probably couldn ' t understand me .
M	if you think it ' s as simple as saying " my laptop is broken , and the warranty covers it , please come and send assistance " then think again .
M	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
M	first off , they don ' t believe you .
M	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute nightmare .
M	i managed to somehow spark some life into it and go through a few bios checks over the phone with dell .
M	the results of that ?
M	inconclusive , but they " suspected " different problems .
M	i had to get a family_member braver than i to shout down the phone at them to send an engineer out .
M	on and on this went , and then they finally did their job , sent an engineer out who didn ' t have the proper equipment .
M	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
M	woo !
M	then the laptop dies of the same problem two months later .
M	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your sanity .
M	haven ' t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven ' t run into any_problems ( yet ).
M	however , there ' s just something about paypal that i can ' t quite put my finger on ; it really feels_like they ' re lacking a useful presence .
M	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
M	also , adding / changing addresses on the site is stupidly overcomplicated .
M	i ' ve been using amazon for years now and they ' ve always been my first choice for buying online .
M	great prices , love the super_saver delivery that i usually put on orders , and any concerns that i ' ve had have always been dealt_with promptly by excellent customer_service staff .
M	actually , i haven ' t found as good customer_service elsewhere on the net .
M	0 of us went to brighton and it was the dogs !
M	the hostel was everything we needed , the go_karting was really good !
M	chillisauce made the whole booking progess stress_free and a total breeze !
M	could not recommend them enough .
M	this is the worst customer_service i have ever received .
M	initially was refunded for items not provided in the shipping .
M	the second time however was when the charger for my lavatube shorted while charging batteries , both malfunctioned .
M	was requested to send back the charger , which i did at my own_expense .
M	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no indication of whether i ' ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .
M	avoid !
M	ordered many many_times and they never fail .
M	the bath looks great and is well appreciated by all the members of the
M	family .
M	got the bath at discounted price and with the facility of next
M	day delivery .
M	lucky me .
M	well the service was equally good and looking
M	forward to buy from you .
M	i won some prize from this site and its really very good to play .
M	no_hesitation and no extra_cost .
M	only pay for the play
M	excellent service , at impossibly short_notice , very professional problem handling and general management !
M	i found the whole experience very easy and stress_free to use .
M	staff were more_than helpful , and really did go the extra_mile where other_companies let me down , i would and have recommended lenses for hire * to others and i will certainly be using them again in the future .
M	the lens made my safari trip what it was , without it i would have returned with a very bleak portfolio of landscape images !
M	saviours !
M	***** 0_stars
M	the best customer_service , delivery came quick !
M	excellent service , very well price .
M	very happy and will use again
M	excellent service , keep you well informed as to were you orders upto .
M	pricing of goods is excellent and super_fast delivery .
M	will definatly buy from beautycow again !!
M	!
M	ordered a couple of pc parts totalling just under £_000 .
M	even paid £ 0 . 00 for the express delivery ( 0 - 0 days ).
M	was given an expected delivery date of 0 - 0 days_later than the 0 days for the express delivery .
M	decided that i would wait for the estimated_delivery date .
M	this is the last day but still no sign of the items so i e_- mailed and called the customer_services .
M	i was told that the item was not at their warehouse but that it was expected to arrive today .
M	this however , means that the item will not get sent until monday and i will not receive it until tuesday ( 0 days after the express delivery i paid for and 0 days_later than the estimated_delivery dates given !!!)
M	at the time of ordering the parts they were " in stock ".
M	at no point in all this was i informed that the item i ordered in was not in stock and would take longer to get here .
M	had i been informed of this i would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere .
M	when i called them and spoke to their customer_services i asked for a refund on my express delivery as they had not kept to the time_frame .
M	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
M	as if i would want to use them again after this experience .
M	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
M	if you ' re thinking of buying from shopto then don ' t hesitate .
M	i ' ve always received any pre_- ordered games on time and never had any_issues with the wrong game arriving or not receiving a game .
M	even better is the fact that they inform you by text when they have dispatched the games !
M	i cannot_fault the service at all .
M	i had to have the frame of my door repaired after i had to break into it once .
M	i called them straight after and i got an_appointment the next_day .
M	the carpenter came right on time , took a look at the damage and got to fixing it .
M	he was done in about 00_mins , leaving no mess and i clouldn ' t even spot where the damage was before .
M	i must_say he was great and friendly .
M	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have ' t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
M	!
M	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
M	!
M	it ' s hard to find a great company that stands behind their products while offering a reasonable_price .
M	i have found both qualities here .
M	their customer_service is prompt , courteous and professional , and did i mention timely ?
M	take note fellow competitor bike parts companies , alwaysriding . co . uk is setting the bar for good service and great prices !
M	ok , so i was sceptical at first never_heard of coolshop !
M	plucked up the courage to make the purchase .
M	how grateful i am that i did .
M	ordered darksiders ii : collectors edition ( ps0 ) as i stupidly didnt preorder the game beforehand >.<........ 0st good point : the price was a considerable_amount cheaper_than that of ' other ' retailers & they had stock which i couldn ' t locate anymore from other stores .
M	0nd bonus : ( express 00 hour from when package gets to uk ) order was sent from copenhagen post on 00st august , in uk by 00rd and * drum roll * received the item today 00th @ 00 . 00am xd - speedy_delivery service from abroad !!.
M	0rd good point : item delivered as_described excellent condition .
M	overall : add coolshop to your list of retailers to buy from , speedy_delivery , cheap prices , items as_described .
M	can ' t get better .
M	making my next preorder soon if they have resi evil : 0 .
M	coolshop are colossal !
M	from : one happy customer !
M	- dean .
M	great quality products .
M	next_day delivery failed ( order at 0 . 00pm , waited in all next_day , cam day after !!
M	).
M	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
M	blurb , is the market_leader by a country mile !!
M	when sinead o ' connor first sang her hit song she could not have known then that she was singing about blurb !!
M	the quality is off the shelf , bookstore stuff , i love making books and wish i had time to take more photos so i could make more books , it is addicitve .
M	i have tried other_companies in the early days and they are amature to blurb .
M	never going to leave !
M	how anyone does not give them 0 * / or a 00 i do not know .
M	bought 0 products with next_day delivery , both were faulty .
M	no replacement offered just store credit , i complained about having to pay delivery charge again and asked that my original delivery charge be refunded as i did not get a working product next_day .
M	i was fobbed_off and ignored until i was contacted by the customer_service manager who told me they had processed a refund of the cost of the parts with no mention of the cost of the delivery charge or the cost to return the 0 parts , now they are ignoring my emails .
M	i have nothing to show for my order and its cost me money .
M	worst customer_service ever do not use cos if they mess up your order it will cost you to fix .
M	yodel has no_problems leaving packages in my back garden when no one is at home , which is usually the case .
M	this was very welcome until they left a large item they damaged in transit that way .
M	the damage was * very * visible , and yet they left it instead of taking it back .
M	what ' s worse , they failed to pick it up afterwards , twice !
M	i complained via a form on their website but never_heard back from them .
M	bought several items from them without problems .
M	used collect_+ whenever it was available and found it very convenient .
M	where it ' s not available , very uses_yodel for deliveries .
M	yodel always leaves my packages in my back garden when i am not at home , which was very welcome , until they left a large item they damaged in transit .
M	the item was a set of window blinds plus a metal rail something like 0 . 0 meters long .
M	in transit , the rail bent and its thick cardboard shell was literally ripped apart at a point of impact .
M	so , the damage was * very * visible , yet they left it in my garden in my absence , instead of taking it back .
M	i explained the situation to very , attaching pictures of the damage , and asked if it ' s possible to send me just a replacement rail , as a rail itself isn ' t that expensive , according to argos .
M	they replied it ' s not possible and i will have to send the whole_thing back .
M	i arranged a pick_up date and gave the instructions to pick it up from the back garden , as i wasn ' t going to take a day off work , given a day of my time is more_expensive than the item they damaged .
M	i also had to patch up the packaging , as bits would literally fall through the hole at the impact zone .
M	guess_what ?
M	they failed to pick it up !
M	apparently my back garden is fine to leave a damaged item at , but not fine to pick it up from .
M	i wrote back to very customer_service and got a call back from a polite lady who apologised for the inconvenience , but the only thing she could offer was to arrange another pick_up .
M	i mentioned i didn ' t believe yodel would pick it up this time , but agreed .
M	needless to say i was right - they failed to do so again .
M	i wrote back to very customer_service , but this time only got a generic " canned " response , suggesting me to arrange another pick_up .
M	at this point i ' ve given up trying to return the item or get a refund .
M	i will buy a replacement rail from argos and avoid both very and yodel like plague .
M	ordered a washing_machine from them , as i really needed it next_day .
M	delivered as promised , so far so good .
M	however , somewhere between the order and delivery i got a phone call from them where they started by confirming my delivery details and then_proceeded pushing me for an extended protection scheme with monthly_payments .
M	i don ' t know why i agreed - i must be slow thinking over the phone .
M	got the papers today , did some calculations , and was shocked by how much of a rip_off it was !
M	by the end of my 0 year normal warranty , i would have already paid a third of the appliance ' s cost !
M	cancelled the policy immediately , without paying anything .
M	but hell , they knew pretty well it was a rip_off when they pushed me for it !
M	therefore , 0_stars .
M	if they try to bug me further , even calling to apologize , an additional star will go for each call ...
M	ordered a pair of wayfarers last summer and got them next_day .
M	even got a text to say they were on the way .
M	too bad i lost them in the sea !
M	i will be ordering again from red_hot sunglasses this year
M	having found a fault with my squash racket , i was quick to get in touch with pdhsports for help with a repair or replacement .
M	the racket was a gift so i thought it might be difficult to authenticate my request , with no order number to supply or date of purchase .
M	they were quick to reply to emails and arranged a replacement racket to be sent as soon as possible .
M	very thankful for their service and would recommend them to anyone .
M	bought a set of knives .
M	they arrived extremely quickly and are of a high_quality .
M	very happy and will be using the site again .
M	i hear numerous horror_stories about other_companies where you send off the product for them to rip into it and grade it .
M	the price they display is never what you actually get .
M	however with mazuma as long as the product matches the clear to see requirements the price you are quoted is the price you get .
M	i ' ve sent numerous phones and always get what i ' m quoted .
M	this is a great service from a lender in my opinion , applied for the loan on the monday_evening and money was in the bank the following evening .
M	had the loan over 00 months which makes the interest fairly low considering my credit_file .
M	i tried a different cd_key website which caused me problems due to asking for photo id and such when i had paid through a verified paypal account !
M	here i had no such problems , everything was pretty_much immediate and i would definitely buy from here again , no question !
M	ordering is simple , great selection , fast_shipping .
M	lots of free_samples as well .
M	i ' ve bought from rcgeeks on a few occasions and can_honestly say it was the best service i have ever received ..
M	always willing to help , in touch with me via_email throughout the order giving advice with anything i needed .
M	next_day delivery that actually arrived next_day .
M	couldn ' t rate them highly_enough .
M	have used aria for several bits over the last_year or so and have no_complaints , they usually have good deals on that include free delivery which is handy if you ’ re in no rush to buy parts .
M	have used their rma system to return a steelseries mouse that developed a double click issue after a month of use , system was very smooth and they kept me updated along the way and a replacement mouse was sent out quickly .
M	i have used networking store on many occasions and every time they have always delivered a great service .
M	always the cheapest prices , next_day shipping and a friendly service they are always my first stop for networking equipment .
M	i was looking for a printer that was economical to run without a high upfront cost .
M	printer lands website enabled me to view all the units within my budget and their friendly sales staff were able to help me calculate the cost per print so that i knew_exactly how much it would cost to run
M	after the placed the order online i received the unit next_day in less_than 00_hours .
M	i had a good shop around first and could not find anyone selling the same printers cheaper .
M	i would highly_recommend printer land to anyone who_likes a good deal and great service and will_defiantly be using them again in the future .
M	shop here its way better then everywhere_else
M	my first experience with wimdu was when my family organised a surprise birthday weekend in paris .
M	we stayed in what can only be described as a millionaires apartment for a long weekend , right in the centre of paris , for less_than a hotel .
M	perfect !
M	after this experience , i decided to try it myself and book a private_room in london , this worked out equally well .
M	hotels in london can be cheap on friday / saturday , but are a rip - off mid - week to take_advantage of traveling businessmen .
M	wimdu allows me to book a room or apartment for considerably less_than any hotel in central_london .
M	i ' ll never book another hotel in london again .
M	simple .
M	we used so - called stress_free parking at luton airport at the end of november_0000 and will never be using it again and would like to warn other_travellers of our experience of having to wait 00_minutes for our car to be returned to us on our return on 0st december_0000 .
M	it was a quiet time to be travelling , the weather was absolutely fine and our plane landed on time at around 00 . 00 .
M	when we phoned to say we were ready to collect the car we were told it would be a 00 to 00 minute wait as a couple of planes had landed at the same time (!!)
M	- hardly a rare event !
M	after 00_minutes we called again to be told we would have to wait another 00_minutes as they had 00 cars to return - again hardly unforeseen as they have the information about when their clients are due to return when the booking is made , and they then said for the first time that a problem with the barrier was delaying them which we found somewhat hard to believe as it had not been mentioned the first time we rang .
M	we eventually got our car back at 00 . 00 , 00_minutes after our first call .
M	it would have been much_quicker to use one of the other airport car parks with buses that run regularly and frequently .
M	we complained about our experience to stress_free customer_services and asked for compensation .
M	we were offered 00_%_off our next booking but as we shall never use this company again that was useless and they would not give us any other form of compensation and even started to question what we were saying about how long we had waited when i had sent them a screen_shot of the call logs .
M	just be aware that you may have to wait 00_minutes on your return for your car
M	fantastic site , and some of the best value ecigs and mods on the web .
M	check out the news and clearance sections .
M	i found the evic kit price impossible to resist , fantastic product at a price that is very hard to beat !!
M	!
M	excellent value , quick delivery and a vast_range of e_cig products , informative and clear , what more can i say ?
M	great experience shopping with them .
M	rob
M	i probably could have got more money by selling the phones on ebay , but then i would have had to go to post_office to send phones out , plus all the hassle of non paying bidders etc , so in actual fact when you consider the ebay fees and hassle , mazuma was probably a better option .
M	the whole_process was easy , straight_forward and hassle_free .
M	highly_recommended and would definately use again in the future .
M	before i bought from cyberpower i had read many , many bad_reviews and ratings about them , but i soon learnt that that was for the us company : upon visiting cyberpower uk ' s website ( site in question ) i learnt the truth .
M	awards as soon as you take a look at the index page : testimonials , and quite a lot of them to your right .
M	what could be wrong about this company ?
M	after taking a few fiddles - with the ' configuration ', which i found extremely easy and fun to use , giving a real - time price with every variable .
M	it had everything , from entry - level graphics , to the powerful gtx_000 and ati 0000 , a wide arrange of processors and cases , a varied amount of psu brans , ram , cd drives , hdd ....
M	i think you get my drift .
M	so , after poking around the forums , i engaged in the cyberpower - feel and looked at the customer feedback : which nearly all was good , and if it wasn ' t , there was a suitable response given and an offer to help that person with their negative situation .
M	and so , after saving about 00 configurations ( no joke ) i placed my order , but not without luke ' s and other moderators on the forums help and assistance .
M	and so , i placed my order , got a 0 %_discount and freebies ( amazing !)
M	and the pc construction was complete !
M	regarding the order , it was built on time : dispatched on time , all with the exception of my zalman monitor , which was put down to weather and transport difficulties in the south : which is perfectly acceptable given that the snow these past few_days has been catastrophic globally .
M	and , if you see that as motive not to shop at cyberpower : think again !
M	i was then offered a 00 " viewsonic monitor , a size upgrade to my pre_- ordered 00 " zalman .
M	but nay , i really wanted a 0d - experience , so i ' ll hang out for a couple of days !
M	all in all : i ' ll definitely be using cyberpower for the future , and have already_recommended it to numerous friends : one of which has bought one already : and his experience was also flawless .
M	seriously : if you want good customer_service , technical help , fair prices and an enjoyable_experience : cyberpower is the place to go !
M	eagarly awaited the delivery to try this food , unfortunately i found the curry to be very watery & no flavour .
M	very disappointed to be honest , i ordered having heard good reviews but for me it just isn ' t good enough .
M	got a mobile to sell ?
M	cant recommend mazumba enough , easy process and got paid the day the phones were received .
M	they do what they say , what more do you want ?
M	00 / 00
M	i had almost lost faith in software that claims to tune up your pc but i can highly_recommend this software , been using for a couple of years and its stable , updates properly and does what it says on the tin .
M	i have just got the new 0000 and it has improved even more .
M	good work people , please keep up the good work !!!
M	00 / 00 cheers
M	the course is excellent , well_structured and detailed .
M	the tutors are very supportive .
M	online learning is an excellent way to work towards qualifications , gain knowldege and competencies .
M	i have enrolled on two courses and they are both excellent .
M	i have been an urban_industry customer for over a year now and have never been let_down with the service i have recieved .
M	the product information is always on point and products arrive as_described in good time and well_packaged .
M	always happy to do repeat buisiness .
M	the decision and ordering_process was made really simple !
M	hard to go_wrong really !
M	will_definitely use iflorist again !
M	i ' ve bought web master package and it seems to be quite promising .
M	pretty easy to use .
M	thankfully , i didn ' t face any problem while buying the course .
M	i compared this deal with many others and found it the most affordable .
M	the package consists of all that is mentioned on their website .
M	brilliant !
M	delivery was on time , the service was great i ' m really happy with my purchase loved the site as it was really easy to navigate il be ordering from wheelspin again .
M	thanks guys .
M	this was only based on a simple mot .
M	i have a friend locally who is a mechanic and does all the work on my car so knew that it would pass without any_issues .
M	i ' m not sure i would be prepared to have my car serviced through them though based on previous reviews , though this will all come down to the garage doing the work on their behalf and i think on this occasion i got lucky .
M	i don ' t make a habit of dishing out bad_reviews but thought in this instance , it was required ....
M	ordered with next_day delivery on 0 / 00 and nothing arrived by 0 / 00 .
M	i was informed that it had been dispatched and i ' d receive my item within 0 - 0 days ..... still nothing on the 00th .
M	at this point my protein were no_longer returning my emails and on the 00rd i decided to cancel my order ( having to wait 00mins in a telephone queue ).
M	on the 00th i received a phone call from one of my protein ' s customer_service agents apologising for what had happened and i was offered a discount for my next purchase which would be emailed to me .
M	00 days_later and i ' m still_waiting for my voucher and again after mailing them i have not received a response .
M	absolutely_shocking customer_service .
M	at first i put it down to the courier company being at fault , but apparently a change in their systems was to blame .
M	this i could understand , but it is unacceptable to make false_promises , leave customers waiting for long_periods in a telephone queue and not respond to numerous mails .... and then fail to send a discount when offered !!
M	!
M	like many others i will never again order from my protein .
M	do not use this company .
M	they may seem like the cheaper option but they are extremely ruthless when it comes to penalty charges which are ludicrous !
M	i was charged £_000 in one month for using my limit of data and they didn ' t once think to tell me these charges were taking place .
M	they cut me off and refused to re - connect until i paid them .
M	i refused and now they are trying to claim £_000 through a debt_collection agency .
M	this all could have been avoided with some good communication .
M	avoid
M	very impressed with the whole experience .
M	would handle a problem with the delivery , which ensured i received the package .
M	the only issue is that they only use one delivery company ( city - link ) who only use an_automated service for re - delivery and could not specify a more accurate eta .
M	would definitely shop again .
M	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
M	i am on a very low monthly tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone .
M	they offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets .
M	when , and usually before the contract expires , a free upgrade is offered .
M	both the o0 store and o0 online have very good deals with extremely competitive_prices .
M	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
M	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
M	goods ordered on 00th_august_0000 .
M	received on 00th_september , taking a total of 00 days to arrive .
M	on arrival , model did not match picture shown on web_site .
M	customers buying online are entitled to a 0 day cooling_off period , where a full_refund must be provided .
M	on reporting this issue , i was told i had to pay a 00_% charge ( approx_£_00 ) making it a total_waste of money to return .
M	on speaking to the manager i was told i would have to pay £_00 just to return it .
M	do not touch with a bargepole
M	i don ' t normally leave reviews for anything but this was by_far the best massage i ' ve had ..
M	very good , super - fast delivery and a large_selection of stock
M	fantastic company super cheap , just the right nets that i wanted will deff buy again !
M	there fantastic !
M	buy from them you wont be disappointed !
M	great company , had no_problems easy to order massive_selection of glasses to choose from , sent the next_day via ups .
M	totally awful company , brought a 00 " hd plasma from them at a cost of £_000 , they promised me delivery between_0am and 00am , after 0pm i got worried so i rung them .... 0 times in total though out the day for it finally be delivered at 00 . 00pm !!!!
M	worst company ever !
M	i will never be buying from this bunch again ....
M	i think it was very easy to use the site and buy things on the website , the delivery was very fast and i was very happy with the items .
M	i would always use this site again .
M	preferect transaction and a god price .
M	purchased and communication was excellent and the item arrived extreamly quickly .
M	they are now saved on my favorite list .
M	ordered tickets for cheryl cole & they came very fast & a lot of other_companies add on extras like commission etc at the end but with double 0 its in the total price so you know what your paying !
M	would def use again :-)
M	thank_you
M	ray munoz
M	as i was not able to go through the antifraud process with my phone , the procedure was a bit longer ( photo of id card and credit_card ), and i had to remind the site of this , but i have been answered very quickly .
M	the antifraud process , even contraignant , is a mark of an efficient and serious service , and the prices are very attractive .
M	i would strongly_recommend this website for these reasons ( but be sure that your phone number works if you don ' t want to lose some time ^^).
M	i am absolutely livid about the delivery practices of yodel .
M	yesterday yodel knocked on my door and i walked downstairs only to find a note already slipped in my door .
M	i don ' t live in a huge mansion , so it took less_than 00 seconds for me to get downstairs .
M	i was godsmacked .
M	today i was ready for the race and the second the door was knocked on i literally ran down the stairs to catch the delivery .
M	as you probably guessed , the delivery guy was no where in sight and there was another card in my door .
M	seriously it took maybe 00 - 00 seconds , but more realistically probably only about 0 .
M	so i can only assume the deliver person slipped the card into my door , then knocked , and left .
M	i am amazed how lazy these people are .
M	first off i notice they avoid ringing the doorbell .
M	this is most_likely done in hopes they don ' t alert anyone to the fact they are there .
M	secondly they leave immediately after they knock .
M	they must have the card already filled out prior to coming to the door because it would be impossible to write out the card in the time it took me to run down my stairs .
M	lastly , good luck calling customer_service to complain .
M	the only number on the card is to reschedule or pick_up your package .
M	i paid to have my package delivered , not drive across town to pick it up .
M	i will never knowingly use any company that works with this " delivery " company .
M	this was my first time using the fx_firm , and i can ' t express how pleased i have been with them .
M	the communication from start to finish has been phenomenal .
M	i initially was planning to use a larger , more well know fx company , and after countless issues setting_up an account , multiple_times calling only to be placed on hold , being told someone would call me back only to wait and find out it was a lie , i gave up and started to research further .
M	i found the fx_firm , and although they only had a limited number of reviews , they were all positive .
M	not only were the reviews positive , but they also provided the best exchange_rate .
M	i just completed my first transaction with them and will not hesitate to continue to use them .
M	sam bennett , owain walters , and jane burn were fantastic in answering my questions , and dealing_with my initial concerns .
M	the communication and promptness of this company could not have been better .
M	thank_you .
M	not a chance i would shop anywhere_else !
M	you can ' t match supplementwarehouse ' s prices !
M	i was thoroughly_impressed with the service and more specifically the speed of which i recieved my order .
M	i placed the order at 0 . 00pm on the thursday and it was delivered on 00 . 00am the next_day .
M	i ' ve experienced problems before with one particular net based company , so i am always wary .
M	but i wouldn ' t hesitate to use this place again .
M	a week and 0 days_later my product still never came , i payed for postage and it hasn ' t arrived !
M	disapointed
M	probably the best uk job search_engine out there .
M	i ' ve had a couple of orders of montana gold paint from graff - city and every_aspect of my transactions were spot on .
M	firstly the site .
M	the look of the site is very sleek whilst managing to have a layout that is clear , simple and very user_friendly .
M	the price of the items that i have ordered is the best i can find online and their " freebies " section allows you to add one free gift with qualifying orders .
M	i ' ve had two mixed bags of spray caps now for nothing :) the postage_costs are really reasonable which is something that can be a sting in the tail when ordering online .
M	the despatch time is amazing , on both my orders they were despatched within about an_hour of the order being placed .
M	their points reward system is pretty generous too !
M	for the orders i have placed , ups was the chosen carrier and they provide tracking_info too .
M	as i said at the start , every_step of the transactions was spot on !
M	i can ' t recommend this company highly_enough !
M	i ' ve used loads of different online bookies over the years and skybet is the only one i ' ve stuck with for a long period of time and used regularly .
M	never had any_problems with anything and any time i ' ve had to get in touch with customer_services i ' ve been sorted out straight_away .
M	can ' t see me leaving skybet for a rival bookie any time soon .
M	their products are well made , while being of a cost level that anyone from amatur to profession can use , with the feel of a secure , professional product that will not fail you or your expensive equipment
M	i decided to ' bite - the - bullet ' and get a canon_0d , for at_least £_000 cheaper_than a uk version but still with a 0 year_warranty ( albeit via digitalrev rather_than canon ).
M	the alternative was a 000d ... but in my opinion 0d > 000d although based on much older technology .
M	checked out the feedback on the website from other customers and went forward with the purchase .
M	waited for the item to arrive with baited breath ...
M	delivery was tracked throughout , prompt and arrived on specified day with sms updates .
M	item was wrapped in maybe 0 - 0ft of bubble_wrap - and nestled safely was the canon_0d box plus a few extras i ordered .
M	so far i have not had any_problems , i am only just starting in the world of enthusiast photography - i am no expert .
M	my only_gripe , ( and it is a minor one ); all the documentation was in japanese - not a big deal since the english pdf can be downloaded from canon ' s website .
M	but when your just starting and a solid bit of kit arrives with a bible - sized manual that makes no sense to you the reader , it can feel intimidating .
M	to date not had any_issues or problems , so i am unable to comment on digitalrev aftersales / support .
M	i have no_regrets following this purchase and i am very pleased with the product and service from digitalrev .
M	now , photography community what ' s all this rumour nonsense about a 0d mk0 and where can i get one ??
M	?
M	the problem came after i decided i needed to return the jeans on the day i received them , after i posted them back they never refunded me .
M	i paid on paypal and and could not set_up a dispute as i waited too long for promised refunds which never happened ...
M	be_careful dealing_with this company
M	i flew for manchester uk to nyc .
M	there were no_problems or any delays and service on board was excellent .
M	i wanted a boiler and wanted it quick , needless to say at boilers0go their boilers really are 0go .
M	thanks guys
M	amazon are brilliant they make it so easy to buy .
M	i without_doubt will be ordering again
M	i have been with t - mobile for 0 years and never had a problem upgrading or with their customer_services
M	i bought from the leeds store and the guy who serviced me was pleasant and helpfull
M	price was unbeatable
M	top_notch company
M	they are really good although they are taking longer time .
M	i , like may other people will do , looked for the cheapest price on the internet for my makita dk0000 kit .
M	secondly i looked for the company with the best reviews .
M	power_tools uk ltd beat other prices by a long way and now i can see why there feedback is so good .
M	a large bulky item delivered to my door within two working_days for £ 0 . 00 .
M	all items in the kit working as they should and in perfect_condition .
M	i would definitely_recommend to anyone .
M	i will_definitely be using power_tools uk again .
M	this web_page is very good because the help people
M	to unlock their iphone and the price is very good
M	great , have never had any_problems with this at all
M	always manages to produce great hostels at competitive_prices .
M	wouldnt go anywhere_else to book a hostel ,
M	well good , bought a ' 00 lp reissue there and ordered online several pedals ... absolutely fantastic all_round ...
M	better_than andertons , especially for service !!!!
M	real nice guys , always looking to give you a good deal :)
M	very happy overall .
M	the price was good and very competitive .
M	let_down at first in regards to having to pay for delivery for a standard game that cost me £_00 .
M	a quick phone call sorted me out though , after_speaking to a very friendly and helpful representative in the call_centre i was informed this charge was incorrect and reimbursed .
M	the one downside i had to my purchase was gameseek ' s choice of delivery partner .
M	unfortunately gameseek use royal_mail who are notoriously terrible in my area , and took 0 days to deliver the item .
M	but i understand the late delivery is no fault of their own .
M	will use again in the future .
M	i just hope that you will consider a better courier .
M	chemical - records is a great music store with a cheap delivery over the world .
M	it ' s simply a true .
M	i would like to say thanks to andrea on live_chat for amending some details on my order .
M	thank_you !
M	best website for saving money ,
M	saved_myself a total of £_00 . 00 for the same hostel , same dates , same dorm capacity just by using hostelbookers instead of hostelworld ,
M	im travelling with 0 friends for the next 00 month , and will use this site no matter what .
M	booked through chilli sause , had a great experience .
M	communication was fantastic .
M	prices very reasonable compared to other_companies .
M	their website is really simple and not cluttered like some others couldnt fault them at all .
M	exactly_what it says on the tin
M	smart it support was a great partner at my previous company .
M	upon starting elanguage , i looked for a professional software development partner to work with us on some of our products ; the choice was simple .
M	they have the people and the expertise to consistently deliver a quality product .
M	they show a great commitment to customer_satisfaction and it is a pleasure to work with them
M	i ordered furniture for bedroom set from home kandi .
M	we received excellent customer_service from them from the online order .
M	great service and reasonable_price of bedroom_furniture , they also have discounts .
M	i will use them again soon .
M	thank_you ali for your follow - up on my order ..

M	first_class product and service .. all is good
M	that ' s really good i used many time there service .
M	all is very very interested .
M	thanks
M	i ordered a £_00 flower_arrangement and paid extra to have them delivered on mothers_day .
M	they ' ve taken the money but no flowers have arrived .
M	i called the number from the website which now says they are no_longer taking calls on the number and recently noticed the number has disappeared from the website .
M	what an awful company .
M	they never made it clear that i could not use this without a vpn .
M	as normal you guys just use vpn to download then switch to normal again .
M	fantastic products , great service would deffo_use again !
M	!
M	ordered a longines conquest sport from iconic_watches and very happy with the product , service and discount .
M	will_defiantly use them again .
M	only wish i had found them before i bought my omeag seamaster aqua terra !
M	fast delivery , competitive_prices , and customer reward_scheme to keep loyal_customers going back .
M	after keying all payment details when booking flights got a processing transaction message for two minutes followed_by an error_message .
M	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
M	they sent email with a link to sagepay to pay for flights .
M	as other_users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
M	you need to seriously look at improving the payment process as i ' m sure its crucial to your customers , as well as your company .
M	also - just realised , after spending some time on the internet and booking through this company , money is taken straight_away , but tickets not issued until 00hrs later , and there is no guarantee you will get the tickets at prices quoted ( see their terms and conditions ) so there is a chance you dont get tickets at all .
M	if you dont want hassle and peace of mind , book with someone_else and pay that little extra .
M	ordered phone on 00th_august which was in stock on web , out of stock after ordering .
M	spoke to ' steve ' from customer_services told him to cancel order over phone .
M	not actioned .
M	emailed customer_services , order cancelled , received no notification or refund .
M	emailed back and they have now said it will take 00 days to refund , thats a total of 0 . 0 weeks before i can get my money back !?!
M	?
M	totally disgraceful .
M	great communication .
M	i was emailed when they had received the phone and payment was transferred into my account the same day .
M	the guys at go0smoke are spot on !
M	even if they don ' t have what i need they order it in .
M	came fast too .
M	good effort !
M	highly_recommended !
M	a ****

M	they have an excellent range of cable , patch panels , switches and racking equipment .
M	order dispatch is always fast and delivery is prompt .
M	i recommend comms_express to anyone and everyone who needs anything network related .
M	wow !
M	i was expecting it would take 0 - 00_hrs before i can get a confirmation that my phone is unlocked but to my surprise it took only 0 hour !
M	thank_you soooooo much !
M	you ' re highly_recommended !
M	two_thumbs_up !
M	i ' ve been a repeat customer , and have never been left wanting .
M	prices are almost always the lowest around , and if not , they match .
M	even if the item was the same price , they ' ll take 0 %_off anyways .
M	the selection is top_notch , the website is a 0 out of 00 to navigate , and the item is shipped promptly .
M	must better then the other options out there .
M	thank_you , sw . com !
M	i made a mistake filling out information for a parcel i am sending to usa .

M	they have a wide_range of products !
M	the delivery is fast including the cheapest option .
M	every time ive ordered ive got the product the day after they posted it and that ' s choosing the cheapest option .
M	great communication as well .
M	just order from heinnie_haynes
M	this site is simply awesome .
M	the games are aost half the price than other_retailers what can go_wrong .
M	you get your cd_key in next to no time !
M	will be back to buy again !
M	i order products of scan . co . uk and dpd is their man courier .
M	i received a text that my delivery would arrive on the day between 00 and 00 .
M	around half 00 my parcel arrived what more can i say !
M	perfect_timing !
M	arrived within two days , despite it being after the christmas last - delivery date .
M	i ' ve bought both big and small items from merlin , ranging_from some inner tubes to a frameset .
M	each time , the price has been great and shipping almost unbelievably fast .
M	when i ' ve had occasion to speak to them on the phone , they ' ve been friendly and efficient .
M	i use orbitremit every month and have never had a problem getting funds through in good time .
M	the rates are good even with no fees .
M	i have never_experienced any major problems when using the p0g service either nationally or internationally .
M	i had a small blip this morning , when i could not see or access a customers order for the paperwork i needed .
M	after about 0 minutes with a very pleasant operator named ashley t , i had the paperwork emailed to me and the order was ready for dispatch .
M	thank_you ashley for a quick , easy and pleasant resolution to my problem
M	i was in desperate need of a worktop before_christmas .
M	my problem was time , being available for delivery , not having much money and being a fussy b * stard !
M	- the worktop was the cheapest " proper " one i could find
M	- the 0 man delivery meant my wife could take delivery ...
M	- after a 00 min notice courtesy_call
M	- the quality of the worktop is spot on
M	- the wide width wasavailable from stock
M	- driver was friendly and helpful
M	if i had to find fault , the order didn ' t go through correctly online but the lady on the phone sorted this straight_away and advised me on the best delivery option .
M	would recommend !
M	thank_you for helping me sort our trip to cyprus with this easter !
M	searching for the right place was easy and hassle_free leaving more time to plan what we will be doing whilst there - this will also be easier as our accomodation is in such a good location !
M	top website , will be using again
M	i found the website very intuitive - you can see as much information as you want all on the homepage , without having to click away to other pages ( and wait for them to load ).
M	it has current trends so you can see straight_away what is popular , and is very simply laid_out , making it clear who their partners are , so it is not hidden away at the bottom of the site map .
M	it is also very easy to save / share a page , which is very useful as most couples looking at holidays will be doing it separately at their respective desks .
M	it also has great social_media integration so you can boast about where you have just booked up for next year !
M	just one of my fav online stores .
M	google now is one of the most_popular brands in the world .
M	very reliable search_engine ... and also does other thing like the operation system android , google_maps and so on .... but i remember my lecturer said once that if you are not focust in a particular area sooner or later you fail .
M	time will tell ...
M	it is really good experience using easyjet .
M	i am flying with this company 0 - 0 times a year myself and also buying tickets for my family and friends .
M	they are providing reasonable prices and good services .
M	the only disadvantage that comes to my mind now is the long waiting time for the gate number to appear on the information screens and after that before getting into the plane .
M	it always takes more time than it should .
M	in general low - cost carrier that i would recommend .
M	so , the laptop is really great as_described .
M	it arriver for 0 working_days .
M	i received a few confirmation massages for the payment , the day when is going to arrive and also the time which was quite impressive .
M	i am really satisfied with the service and would recommend the website .
M	there is only one disadvantage that on the very far top left corner of the screen there is a death pixel in red colour which is not a dig deal for me .
M	i believe that i received a great value for my money .
M	a friend_recommended me to this site & i must_say im impressed with the savings ive made & my house sold quickly great value will use again .
M	when i search for flights through kayak i ' m usually linked to ebookers with the cheapest offers .
M	the site is easy to use and stores all your flights / activity past and present .
M	nothing to complain_about .
M	my glasses were really well_packaged and the free next_day delivery is bonus !
M	thanks
M	i ' ve used supplement_warehouse for a few_years now for all my supplemental / nutritional_needs .
M	they offer a wide_variety of brands and products .
M	they even take 0 %_off an item if you find it cheaper on another website !
M	you can ' t beat that , so give it a shot and see if they have the supplements you take .... which they will
M	the information available about my headphones , the updates i received about my order and the speed with which it arrived all mean i ' d be very happy using this company again .
M	in a nutshell i found some ink for my printer on their site , it was very cheap so i took a punt and ordered it .
M	the ink arrived next_day for no extra_cost and it has been printing flawlessly for the last two week .
M	can ' t get much_better_than that .
M	i have been using ebuyer since july_0000 and have to say they are still my favourite online supplier of technical products .
M	they have a great range of products , quick , easy delivery and good customer_service ( although i rarely use it !).
M	as with every company , i have had the odd one or two items that needed returning but in 0 years i can ' t ever remember a time where they have not dealt_with my orders or returns with anything other than quick , professional service .
M	thank_you ebuyer .
M	i have hired various vehicles from kendalls in guildford and they have always been very friendly and welcoming .
M	their prices seem to be the best in the area and unlike many other_companies they include vat and insurances in the quote so there were no_hidden_costs .
M	would highly_recommend .
M	we accidently found this little cafe on our way down to cornwall and had the most pleasant lunch .
M	beautiful barn , great food and wonderful service - it is now definitely our place to stop by choice whenever we make that journey .
M	highly_recommend .
M	great prices for great products
M	i called to check if they had a nokia e00 in stock before ordering .
M	i was told yes , and ordered it immediately before 0pm and paid for next_day special delivery .
M	after 0pm the following_day i called to ask why i hadnt received the phone and was told i ordered late , which i know i didnt , and that the phone would be sent out the following_day .
M	the following_day , the phone was not delivered and when i called to enquire why , i was this time informed the batch they had had failed testing and it would be anther couple of days before i would receive the phone .
M	i explained i was travelling hence_why i ordered for next_day delivery .
M	i was offered an accessory pack and a refund on my special delivery charge and assured i would receive the phone after 0 days and the manager would call to confirm despatch .
M	i did not receive a call .
M	however when i have received the phone 0 days_later than_expected , the phone was in relative good condition , with a very old battery and to make_matters worse the wrong nokia charger .
M	the big style rather_than thin pin charger was sent making me question the quality of their checks before despatch .
M	also no accessory pack was sent .
M	i ordered a new battery and charger from ebay for a fiver , delivered without problems .
M	will not be ordering from refurb again .
M	the communication regarding the despatch and delivery of my parcel was great .
M	i knew where it was at all stages and i knew when it was going to be delivered .
M	it came next_day as i requested and it was really in - expensive in comparison to most other couriers , especially next_day couriers .
M	i would recommend yodel again and again .
M	good place to shop
M	the best place for ur tikets
M	dont like it it sucks
M	i love dell
M	now i relly love there pizza
M	i love there phones
M	the best serch page
M	best to shop
M	good place to buy
M	i booked my summer holiday through away 0 and could not recommend them more !
M	the holiday was for me and my girlfriend and from the start we where unsure of where to go .
M	the staff at away 0 made numerous suggestions of locations specific to our needs and was able to quote us prices on a range of hotels and all where competitive .
M	we changed locations a number of times and away 0 was always understanding and where more_than happy to get us another quote and make suggestions of other hotels that may suit as best .
M	booking the package through them has saved me a lot of time and hassle as well .
M	live_chat very helpful and delivered next_day on a saturday for free .
M	nice job
M	customer_service is what seperates this place from the rest .
M	got a call immediately after_placing the order to inform me item was not in stock .
M	if that wasn ' t enough , they also emailed me just to make_sure !
M	offered a suitable alternative , which worked out to be slightly more dearer but they gave it to me for the same price as my original order .
M	granted , it was only £ 0 . 00 , but who does that ?!
M	got the tap within 0 days !
M	awesome !
M	food was in poor condition !
M	stick to purchasing in store !
M	big_mistake !
M	travelled first_class , love the amount of room provided and the unlimited food and drinks available throughout the flight .
M	stewardesses and stewards were very attentive and the seat was very extremely comfortable .
M	a really easy was of organising everything and really helped think of events we would never have considered .
M	brilliant help from the staff and def recomend people to use a company like chillisauce to take the stress away
M	really good easy to use fast just what i wanted will_defo use again a *
M	i ' ve bought thousands of pounds worth of musical_equipment from gak over the past decade or so , and never had a problem with a single item .
M	not only that , but their staff are some of the most helpful , and well informed i ' ve spoken to .
M	as reviews have said before , since using musclefood . com , i will never buy meat from the supermarket again .
M	high_quality , well_packaged foods at low_prices .
M	their service is especially good for any person who_wants to look after their body and knows what nutrients that requires .
M	i only hope business for this exemplary company goes from strength to strength .
M	great prices for a wide_variety of quality products , and delivery is always prompt .
M	after using one or two other_companies , i ' d wholeheartedly_recommend them in a jiffy .
M	customer_service is excellent , and free_gifts are regularly thrown in .
M	superb .
M	the diet whey blends well , and tastes great ( choc mint ) it fills you up and works as a great pre / post workout supplement or meal replacement .
M	i recently_bought a pair of oakley gascan sunglasses and not only is the product fantastic , a snug fit not tight , perfect_condition etc .
M	but the delivery time from cycle store was under 00_hours with special delivery at no extra charge !
M	i will_definately_recommend both the product and the site and will certainly consider_using them again
M	booked cardiff stag_do for myself and 00 mates .
M	had a quality time on quads and clay_pigeon shooting .
M	the hotel and its breakfast were nearer 0 *.
M	nothing but good times with chillisauce ' s help .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	great service .
M	rapid delivery !
M	cheapest prices around
M	had my first purchase with ziip today and can ' t give them anything but complements .
M	normally i ' m unsure_about non - mainstream online shops but there is no need to doubt this company , 000_% genuine .
M	great prices , first_class phone comms .
M	what more can you want ?
M	i ' ll will definetly be back for more purchases !
M	:)
M	finding myself short of money recently , i decided to sell a pair of old htc_desire hds that i had lying about .
M	as they were both in full working condition , complete , and devoid of any scratches , i was confident that i ' d receive the full_amount offered - £_00 . 00 each .
M	i wrapped them both thoroughly in bubble_wrap and stuck them in the envelope provided , before sending them via recorded_delivery .
M	a couple of days_later , i was very surprised to receive a message_saying that they ' d tested the phones and discovered that the back cover of one of them was missing , and that i ' d have to accept a £_00 deduction for this .
M	i chose not to accept nor decline the offer at this point , as i ' d already paid £ 0 for delivery and would have been charged a further £ 0 - 00 for the phones to be returned to me , one of which would now be missing its back cover .
M	instead , i sent an_email querying the missing cover , explaining that they must have mislaid it whilst unpacking or testing the phone .
M	after several days with no response , i sent the same email again , to which they replied claiming to have " placed an investigation " into what i ' d said , and that they were " getting together " the results of this .
M	two days_later they debited £_000 . 00 to my bank_account - £_00 less_than the amount i was supposed to receive .
M	i ' ve sent another email asking about this but it ' s been a week and i ' ve still received nothing .
M	=== update ===
M	thanks for the response .
M	there is absolutely no way that i mislaid the cover prior to sending .
M	before packaging the phones , i removed the back covers of both in order to remove the sim and memory_cards and replaced the covers immediately afterwards .
M	i definitely would have noticed if either cover had been missing it when i was wrapping the phones in bubble_wrap .
M	what i suspect must have occurred is that the cover came loose as you removed the phone from its bubble_wrap , and that the cover was then discarded along with the bubble_wrap .
M	my method of wrapping - which i suspect is quite common - was to encase each phone in several layers of bubble_wrap by passing a strip of it laterally around the phone , taping it up tight , and finally taping the top and bottom ends to form a parcel .
M	given that the back cover of the htc_desire hd is removed by sliding it downwards , it would be quite easy for it to be pulled off the phone if the top of the bubble_wrap parcel was cut open and the phone pulled out - rather_than removing all of the tape and unravelling the packaging .
M	i appreciate that data_protection and privacy is an issue when checking cctv footage , but would it be possible for you to confirm that the cover was not discarded along with the bubble_wrap as in the above scenario ?
M	furthermore , your response does not address why the payment went_ahead without my permission .
M	your email states : " if no response is received within 0 days , bozowi will automatically process payment for the specified downgraded amount ."
M	given that i responded via_email twice within the 0 day period to raise my objection to the downgraded offer , the payment should not have been automatically processed .
M	despite the fact that i sent my phone off a bit late , and that it had some minor_scratches on the screen , mazuma still paid me very promptly in full .
M	you ' d be hard pressed to find similar service elsewhere .
M	the mazuma website was easy to navigate - explained everything that was going to happen and even showed me how to clear all personal info from my old phone .
M	the transaction was fast , with the pre_- paid post bag supplied making everything trouble free .
M	money was in the bank fast - couldn ' t be_happier !
M	i don ' t order from anywhere_else .
M	with the price matcher and selection of products i can always get what i need without breaking the bank .
M	my first time ordering i placed my order on a friday_morning and had my order by saturday_afternoon .
M	i would definitely_recommend this site to anyone !
M	ordered my first item , a set of ski - poles , from facewest after waiting for them to come back into stock .
M	my package arrived very quickly and well - packaged .
M	absolutely_faultless and would definitely use again and recommend .
M	i bought a phone and 00qiud credit .
M	i haven ' t got 00 pound more_than 0 months and i haven ' t got the refund ...
M	came 0 times to the shop , 0 times called but no sort it out ...
M	rubbish provider ..
M	i got this company from the internet and then i just topped_up £_00 .
M	my o0 balance was deducted £_00 but i couldn ' t receive my balance on topupnow . co . uk .
M	my balance still £ 0
M	i have tried for contacting the customer_service but they didnt do any help .
M	i still lost my money .
M	:-( :-( :-(
M	so avoid the company .
M	fast delivery , great customer_service .
M	bought a bud ego starter and a month later one of the batteries stopped charging , dropped them an_email and within an_hour i got a response telling_me to return it for a new one , cannot_fault them !
M	had an issue with double_charged items and the customer support helped_me quickly and efficiently , a + for that , also pre_- ordered call of duty mw 0 and came day early !!!
M	best online shopping since e_- bay ;)
M	my phone was 0 months old and worked_perfectly .
M	i sent it to mazuma in a bubble_wrapped envelope , inside the normal postal envelope they send .
M	then i get an_email_saying it does not charge , then try ripping me off for £_00 less_than the offer they made me .
M	bunch of con_artists i will be reporting to trading_standards .
M	i would have tried to talk to them but there lines are not open .
M	couldn ' t be_happier with the service that aria has provided over the years , they remain competitive with their prices and their deals , and offer all_round exceptional service .
M	they use the courier dpd which , in my opinion , is the best courier in the uk , hands_down .
M	item was dispatched very quickly and arrived next working day as due , i ' m happy to pay £ 0 . 00 shipping flat_rate for dpd over citylink ( what they used when i last purchased in 0000 ), any day !
M	well_packaged item and given that it was an external hdd , that was very important .
M	not much more to say really except thanks for the amazing service :-)
M	tpexpress wanted to charge me £_00 for a return ticket to london .
M	thetrainline only charged me £_00 , that ' s a saving of £_00 !
M	couldn ' t be_happier !
M	amazing prices and very competitive !
M	( friendly on twitter too !)
M	:-)
M	wow , in all honesty , i wasn ' t expecting too much .
M	i went for their free business card option where you use ' one of 00 templates ' ( there are other options too ) with a little_bit of branding text on the back and only paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
M	ordered wednesday_night , was despatched thursday and arrived through the letter_box on friday .
M	you simply can ' t go_wrong for the price !
M	the printing quality is great , the cards feel high_quality and even came in little plastic boxes to make it easy to carry them round with you without them getting damaged .
M	couldn ' t be_happier all in all :-)
M	thanks for your service !
M	when i see that a parcel i ordered has been dispatched with dpd , i ' m almost jumping for joy !
M	every experience i have had with dpd so far has been a great one , and they are my preference over any other courier .
M	every time the driver has been friendly and within the 0 hour time_slot .
M	talking of the 0 hour_timeslot , as well as the driver tracking , dpd is far ahead of competition in the courier business as far as i ' m concerned .
M	:)
M	absolutely great service game , and i couldn ' t be more thankful !
M	a great company with a great customer_services team that handles situations really well , thanks for your services !
M	highly_recommended :)
M	p . s .
M	no , i do not ' work for them ', my personal overall experience with game has been great .
M	no network is quite like this , the value is epic , perhaps not as good as some other_networks , but when you factor everything in ( which you will steadily learn when you join giffgaff ) it just cannot be_beaten !
M	!
M	not really much else to say , although i don ' t agree with some peoples reviews based on my experience , it ' s nice to see a balanced opinion , and this place really works hard to fish out the fake_reviews !
M	very easy to do , looks_like a trust - able company .
M	they have the best prices i could find for ps + codes , and had no problem in redeeming , or in getting the codes .
M	oh , and instant delivery makes it even better !
M	if you are looking for a place for your digital goods , look no further !
M	the cheapest place that i could find ps0_games , they keep you up to date , and when you select the 0 - 0 day delivery option ... that includes delivery , which is royal_mail first_class !
M	:)
M	they offer great prices with great service , package their products well and overall the whole experience purchasing from them ( for the first time ) has been incredible .
M	certainly will be shopping with you again in the near_future !
M	thanks !
M	:)
M	[ edit ] second experience even better_than the first one !
M	ordered sunday_night , got an_email monday 0 :_00am to say it was being dispatched , arrived today , tuesday .
M	i chose the 0 - 0 day free option too .
M	absolutely incredible !
M	:)
M	absolutely great service .
M	got key quickly through autokey , had to get an sms to confirm account to prevent fraud , however that was quick and easy .
M	everything was handled quickly and nicely !
M	:)
M	i ' ve used ebuyer several_times and now use it for all of my tech or computer_components , prices are always competitive and delivery is top_notch .
M	i ' ve never had any_problems with their service or products .
M	i always recommend to my friends and family .
M	supplementwarehouse . com is all you need to know , everything else just a click away .
M	i always use williamhill for betting on footy games .
M	can ' t go_wrong , easy to use system and takes seconds making deposits through paypal .
M	only_downside is some betting sites give you winnings + what ever was betted , these just give you the winnings .
M	i purchased some website traffic expecting it to take days to start ( couldn ' t find reviews ) but it came through after 00_hours .
M	very impressed so far .
M	other online companies could learn alot from simply_games !
M	the game was £ 0 cheaper_than many online stores .
M	ordered sunday_evening and have just received it through the post ... and free delivery !
M	the game is in mint_condition due to the excellent packaging sent in .
M	have never used your company before but i certainly will again .
M	i normally use play or amazon and wait days / weeksfor delivery , but now after getting such great service from you simply_games will get my custom from now on !
M	will be recommending you to all my friends and family .
M	was well worth purchasing my 0d mk 0 from digital_rev as they were so much cheaper_than the alternatives in the uk .
M	the camera came perfectly on time , but unfortunately the battery grip i ordered was missing part .
M	however digital_rev quickly resolved this via emails and instant chat , sending me out a replacement straight_away .
M	their customer_service staff were very helpful and polite !
M	will_definitely be using them again .
M	they hold your money and final decision my arse like i sell threw my website and have 000_% customer feedback .
M	but paypal held 0 transactions totaling over 00 , 000 gbp and still 0 years later zero money because they r not uk_based they are not under uk law so customers have protects i have no money to cover it now they keepo charging my business account the paypal business fee and virtual card but its suspended i cant close it yet they let you add funds or cards and accounts yea right this need to be stopped
M	this is an amazing place , its and great for food and drink and every_penny made her goes towards the feufield trust ( feufield animal sanctuary ) the staff here are friendly and will help you and give you a warm welcome .
M	the cafe is on high_street in biggar and it is worth a stop on your way through even for some amazing coffee or even a superb afternoon_tea or superb salmon & creme cheese begal .
M	feufield also have the animal sanctuary just outside symington lanarkshire .
M	highly_recommended place for food and a warm welcome .
M	help them help the animals .
M	i bought 0 items through theyre ebay page , never recieved any thing they still have my money , dont answer phone , no reply to emails or complaints .
M	i had to involved police and trading_standards for defrauding customers out of money through deseptive means .
M	they know its not in stock but still take your money it takes weeks and weeks for ebay to deal with them and still many other customers each day are negitive them with exact_same problem , beware
M	i loved how much cheaper the products were at supplementwarehouse .
M	first time purchasing anything here so we will see how everything turns_out .
M	so far so good .
M	the only thing that i had a slight_issue with was the website .
M	just seems to me that it could be cleaned up and organized a bit better .
M	rather_than scrolling endlessly through products make it able to seperate pills from liquids to capsuls to herbs .. etc .. maybe since i used the search bar for names of products i was using was my problem idk .
M	but other than that great experience so far .
M	company called offering me £ 0 for 0 months - i did not receive one single enquiry .
M	they automatically renewed the subscription without an_email advising they would do so !
M	avoid at all costs they are a rip_off and produce no results
M	they obtain money by misleading promotions and then just take your money without authorization
M	luckily for me they took it from a company credit_card which requires a purchase order so i ' ve taken it up with the credit_card company
M	regardless of the specifics ... this is a very misleading ploy which relies on people not reading their emails or remembering to cancel the pending subscription .
M	the larger " proper " companies who advertise holiday homes don ' t employ such misleading offers and promotions , why ?
M	because they don ' t need to .
M	the proof of their pudding is in the eating .
M	pure holiday homes offer is just a way to tie people into a campaign with them with no success .
M	i would like to note that i ran more_than one advert with them and did not receive a single enquiry in 0 months !
M	not a single one !
M	i receive 0 a day from home away holiday rentals .
M	speaking as a consumer i strongly_recommend using one of the more reputable_companies .
M	yes i am going to post on as many forums as i can find as i feel that i have been cheated into paying for a service that not only is not fit for purpose but a service that i simply do not want .
M	as usual hostelbooker was perfect .
M	the hostel we booked in , x hostel , was one of the greatest i have ever stayed in , and i ' m someone who had 00 holidays in the last 00 months .
M	it was truly amazing .
M	thanks :)
M	awesome place with great moneyback
M	they lose an item that is paid for on a 00 hour service and the .
M	have no customer_service at all to help .
M	ordered 00 days ago and still nothing .
M	wont be using lp again .
M	utter garbage .
M	so slow to post out , delivery can take forever .
M	and its clear i am not the only one unhappy !
M	i ordered and within 00_hours had my items .
M	all as_described and great quality .
M	viovet let me know the stage of my order by email at every_stage .
M	i would shop again for sure !
M	cheapest , quickest , easiest and most reliable place around !
M	i will always recommend checking here first !
M	easy to use , price was better_than other_sites i searched for .
M	i would definitely use them again .
M	always receive what i order in good time .
M	had a lovely_lady on the customer_service number .
M	will be using this site regularly now .
M	my delivery didn ' t turn_up on the monday that it was due .
M	although i have asked for proof they turned_up ( they didn ' t ring the doorbell or leave a card ), i didn ' t ' receive any after i asked 0 times .
M	their customer_service systems seem to freeze or not work a lot so when you call , you can ' t get an answer there and then even_though you have patiently_waited after calling their 0000 number in peak time .
M	apparently i should be grateful to have the delivery refunded as a gesture of goodwill .
M	apologising but having an attitude in your voice doesn ' t really constitute a satisfactory apology .
M	and the other day , one of the customer_service people told me that you had had a few problems that morning with drivers so it is a bit pointless making your customer come away feeling dejected when you know you have a problem with your delivery people anyway .
M	poor service , i would never recommend you and out of all the people i spoke to at your customer_service , there was one really nice girl ( on monday_morning unfortunately i didn ' t catch her name ) and the other people just had attutude .
M	i was slightly put off by the site design i . e .
M	are they legitimate , this only because i have been stung before .
M	very happy with the result .
M	who knew ?
M	with parcels 0 go you can send your packages efficiently and at good value .
M	and more_importantly if you need help with the service ( or anything_else life style wise ) their team is there to help .
M	emma saved the day .
M	placed my order on thursday at about 0am , the effects pedal was in stock and the shipping was reasonable however it was a very small extra charge to upgrade so it was be delivered on the friday .
M	woke_up today being friday and the parcel is here as predicted .
M	fantastic prices and fantastice service .
M	what else could you want - the reservations are there in store within_seconds of making them , believe me i ' ve tried it .
M	easy to use site .
M	thanks
M	order some san launch on 0th aug and it came on the 0th aug , cant_fault the website , keep it up guys ... hope you bring in more brands ..!
M	!
M	fast delivery , quality service , very helpful , even provided discount_code ...

M	wtf its there fukin foult !!
M	its un fukin believable what the world has come too ...
M	i have been purchasing supplements from bb . com for quite some time , the prices at sw are way better !
M	but the shipping can be killer .
M	prices were very good , bought them online and had them fitted locally next_day even_though i live in a very remote area ..
M	i was surprised they could deliver them so quick !
M	i ' ll definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone thanks to their great service !
M	ordered flowers for mothering_sunday knowing my mother would be in .
M	picked prestige because they claimed to deliver that day .
M	arrived saturday .
M	found in porch in full view of passers by .
M	wilting and dying by next morning .
M	cost was £_00 . 00 before delivery .
M	bouquet nothing like advertised its pitiful .
M	absolutely_disgusted .
M	always send flowers .
M	never_experienced anything like this .
M	totally ruined day for both of us .
M	if only i had read all the reviews from various sites before .
M	i don ' t know how they are getting away with it .
M	i had a great time and assistance .
M	found everything i needed for great prices .
M	hope to comeback soon .
M	was very pleased with the service printerland gave us .
M	we have ordered a printer and some spare toners on separate_occasions and had no troubles .
M	delivery was next_day as promised and when we called them for a general query they were very helpful and we didnt have to wait on hold for long either .
M	all in all a great company , will_definitely go back in the future .
M	recommended for all your printer needs home and office .
M	items as_described and packaged well .
M	good job
M	customer_services extremely friendly and very helpful .
M	thank_you guys the goggles are great .
M	a lot of accurate information on the site helped in my purchase .
M	doing a good job keep it up !
M	many_thanks
M	my new 00 " hu0000 arrived in great condition .
M	was totally hyped for it .
M	got it at an amazing price £_000 cheaper_than currys were selling it for on the day .
M	definitely_recommend using crampton and moore
M	forsvarligt pakket ind , hurtig_levering , alt som ønsket .
M	hvad kan_man ønske mere ?
M	fik bogen hurtigt , og_den var pakket forsvarlig ind .
M	havde det drejet sig om en mere skrøbelig bog , havde jeg nok sat pris på lidt bedre indpakning , men her var det fint .
M	var pakket i stor kasse med flamingostjerner som isolation .
M	den ankom et_par dage_efter bestilling , og indholdet var i perfekt stand .
M	personalet gav grundig , kvalificeret vejledning hele vejen .
M	jeg_er_en ret grundig ( krævende ) køber .
M	i have nothing negative to say .
M	swift delivery , pack was safely sealed and we got exactly_what we asked for .
M	this is easily the best app , if you ' re on the fence and can ' t decide all i can say is give it a shot , you wont_regret it
M	000 . com has been great for me so far , and i ' ve got luck on my side too !
M	it ' s easy to use and keeps the fun in the game , i ' d definitely refer my friends here
M	i have played bingo for years and this site is easily my new favourite , so easy to use and focused on fun , i cant_wait to finish work to play again !
M	i bought a ticket for an event which is tomorrow and i have still not gotten my tickets and not even a reply to my emails to viagogo !
M	what ' s the point of putting a phone number on the website if you don ' t intend to have human_being answering them ?
M	and if you can ' t deliver the tickets , then have the courtesy to tell me early enough so that i can find ticket elsewhere ( and obviously not through your website again !).
M	wonder_why viagogo is still in business ?
M	!
M	excellent all_round service by daniel :)
M	bought a brand_new tissot watch worth £_000 .
M	the watch became_faulty within 0 days .
M	informed them and they said return for inspection .
M	did that and then told we are sending to manufacturer and it will take 0 - 0 weeks for repair .
M	a brand_new watch being repaired !
M	thats uncalled for and simply unacceptable .
M	they violate distance_selling rules and have now filed a paypal case against them .
M	the haae stopped_replying to my e_- mails .
M	a useless company with absolutely_useless customer_services .
M	if you ' re looking for reviews helping you to determine whether first_utility are a good company to be with , you ' ll be looking for a while .
M	i switched my energy supply to them nearly two months_ago in order to get a cheaper deal .
M	i wondered why i ' d never_heard of them before , and why their rates were so cheap , and so i searched for reviews .
M	i really wish i ' d done some research first , as the feedback was vastly negative , but i went and cancelled my registration on the same day .
M	my suspicions were raised when i didn ' t receive confirmation that i had cancelled .
M	i sent a message to them via their website asking for them to confirm , which they did within a few_days .
M	eventually , i even received the automated confirmation i thought i would have had when i cancelled it on day one .
M	you see , first_utility mentioned in their e_- mails that with a sudden influx of customers , they are having difficulty keeping their it systems updated , and that any responses to customer queries were taking up to four business days .
M	this is also the problem that caused me to lose money .
M	over the next few weeks , despite cancellation , i received e_- mails telling_me about joining first_utility .
M	i responded , telling them i wasn ' t joining them , and that i was switching to edf instead .
M	i probably sent a couple of messages during this period , making_sure that my registration had been cancelled .
M	they confirmed that it had , and told me again about their problems with it systems , and the influx of new customers .
M	again , despite this , i received a direct_debit confirmation a few weeks_ago , for £_00 .
M	this really agitated me , so i e_- mailed to their customer_service department .
M	i was also frustrated as first_utility ' s messing_around was interfering with my switchover to edf energy .
M	this received a quicker response , within a day for some reason .
M	they aplogised again for the e_- mails .
M	it systems .
M	new customers .
M	argh .
M	and lo and behold , last_week they actually took money from me .
M	i was furious .
M	just in time for christmas too !
M	i cancelled the direct_debit with my bank , and i plan to block first_utility from taking any more money .
M	i sent another , more angry e_- mail this time , but i ' m still_waiting for a reply nearly 0 days_later .
M	if you ' re on the fence , don ' t bother .
M	they are a shambles of a company , and the only reason they can offer such amazing deals is because of the complete_lack of customer_service .
M	beware !
M	they organise everything , with you just picking what you want to do and when .
M	probably cheaper to arrange yourself but its easy for them to do it .
M	i ordered off [_link ] who they advertise through .
M	the deal seemed too good to be true but it was all there , took printscreens to prove it .
M	i purchased it , a few_days_later i got an_email_saying something along the lines as ' the deal isnt for the 0 games and controller ' instead it was for one crappy game not worth anywhere_near the price , even_though they knew i was ordering the bundle they still sent the game ( surely they would of asked ) few_days_later i recieved it and straight_away returned .
M	poor communication , poor customer_service , just poor .
M	ordered a set of 0 pirelli online without an issue , arrived at the garage early to get them fitted and the whole_process was finished within 00_mins .
M	very pleased with the service from the garage ( jet garage in orpington ) and the website for black_circles was easy you use .
M	i will without a doubt use them again .
M	ordered a case from them for a very good price but item took longer then expected to arrive and also case was damaged on arrival , not badly but still damaged , thankfully does not effect the working of it or the aesthetics .
M	i did not contact customer_services to get this replaced as it was fun and games enough trying to find out why it took so long .
M	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
M	i wouldn ' t order from them again , rather pay the extra and order from another company .
M	jeg_havde et forløb hos shark gaming hvor min computer gik i stykker meget kort tid før jeg_skulle udrejse fra danmark .
M	her ydede jasper fra shark gaming en kæmpe indsats , der gik langt ud over hvad der kan forventes af_en timelønnet medarbejder .
M	grundet hans indsats og serviceniveau kan jeg_ikke andet end at give min fulde anbefaling til virksomheden .
M	fast processing , great products and quick delivery .
M	very happy with bulkpowders products and their prices .
M	very good and very professional !
M	we turned to vts design for web_hosting and a dedicated_server after continual let downs by our previous_supplier and i can_honestly say the service has been first_class .
M	from day one , the service has been easy , quick and problem free , from transferring our site and database to their servers to offering assistance with our various integrations and even help solving our own internal website issues .
M	all this , combined with some of the most competitive_pricing available means that we ' ll never have to look around for another web_hosting and design company again .
M	no answer to emails / phone_calls .
M	still showing as order processing after 0 weeks despite offering sameday despatch .
M	even terms say goods will be delivered within 0 working_days .
M	spoke to bank to initiate a chargeback .
M	i ' m very trusting when it comes to buying online , probably too trusting .
M	i will make_sure i read reviews on here before thinking of buying from companies i ' ve not heard of before - as well as letting everyone i know never to buy from these_clowns
M	i was very impressed with the service i received at power body .
M	buy all my supplements from here .
M	brilliant .
M	very good value and very quick delivery
M	recently got my new beautiful music man sterling bass from these_guys - despite having one in stock , they were happy to take my custom order to my spec , took care of ordering & dealing_with ernie ball usa while it was built , and kept me informed_throughout - not only that but they smashed everyone_else on price !
M	on the times i ' ve called these_guys , i ' ve spoken to someone who is actually out there gigging , using the gear & knows what they ' re talking_about ( instead of some no - playing sales douchebag ), and the service has been awesome .
M	add in that the website is mega easy to browse & the delivery is free , and you have a very dangerous combination after a few beers !!
M	!
M	long live rad indie music stores & especially nevada_music - cheers_guys !
M	dispatched same day and arrived next morning despite harsh weather_conditions via ups .
M	plenty of emails regarding order progress .
M	product very well_packaged which for me is extremely important , no one wants their expensive gear to arrive in a dented box .
M	headphones ( 000 ) are also brilliant :-) * 0_stars .
M	my wife and i planned our trip using priceline and it was headache free .
M	it was so easy to use i couldn ' t imagine a better or easier way to do so .
M	0 - they reply to any email inquiry in 0 days although in the automated_reply it is 00_hours .
M	0 - the reply is always implicitly guiding you to call the call_center as they wont answer anything or address any issue by mail .
M	0 - no toll free number you have to pay a lot of money just to hear the waiting tunes mainly coldplay myself everytime i hang_up when it turns that i ve been waiting for 00_minutes of international call to listen to music .
M	0 - the information on the itinerary on the website is not always available .
M	this is my first time i book with expedia and my last time for sure .
M	0 days after booking and paying our deposit in the beach rang to say they had over booked our flight so our holiday would have to be shifted a day forward and our return_flight would return to a different airport !
M	but oh well .. we received out new paper work with the new dates for hotel and return_flight but the outward flight had not changed so we immediately called onthebeach to query this .
M	they said it ' s just an error and will be fine when we get to the airport .
M	we had rang and confirmed this 0 or 0 times before we flew .
M	low and behold we get to the airport to find onthebeach had not changed the flight and we had to pay on the spot £_000 each to fly that day !
M	after_speaking to the customer_service agent for monarch airlines they say this happens often with onthebeach clients !
M	now upon returning to the uk we have contacted onthebeach and they say they are looking into what happened !
M	0 weeks_later and still no reply !
M	so it looks_like we will have to contact trading_standards about it .
M	so in summary onthebeach does exactly_what it says on the tin book with them and you more_than likely will end up sleeping on the beach !
M	ordered a coleman extreme cool box , not only a great price was delivered very quickly .
M	was kept_informed with regular_updates by email on the progress of my order .
M	all_round a good experience would certainly look at taunton_leisure for any of my camping needs .
M	very easy to use website , extremely fast_shipping and well_packaged .
M	good job !
M	horrible customer_service , alarm_bells rang as soon as i realised they only answer the " sales " line and not the " support " line .
M	00 + emails sent , with no reply , followed_by almost daily phone_calls and i am still_waiting for a replacement a month down the line from initial purchase .
M	i spoke to the same chap on the phone every_single time i rang and he acted as if it was the first time looking into my issue every time .
M	" i will get it sorted for you right now "
M	yeah_right !
M	stay way , way clear of these_guys , the service is horrific .
M	i recommend chilli_sauce to anyone planning a stag or hen_party .
M	they take the effort out of booking your weekend , but keep you in control .
M	everything we had booked was ready for us and all the activities / clubs / restaurant were as if the people at chilli_sauce had experienced them first to give their thumbs_up .
M	thank_you for your help in making our weekend a great one .
M	cheers !
M	item arrived_promptly and as_described .
M	will use site again as prices are also competitive compared with other online stores .
M	well - designed website , very quick delivery , lower prices than other similar suppliers .
M	truly great customer_service .
M	i honestly have no_idea about their proce competitiveness or anything like that but everytime i ' ve called their service people about account things or techy things they have been great .
M	i searched around on the best price for a nikon_d0000 .
M	simply_electronics was cheaper by around £_00 and had 0 in stock .
M	many other_retailers had none in stock .
M	i ordered , they debited and then magically it was out of stock .
M	i gave up after 0 weeks and cancelled the order and now they are stalling on a refund hanging onto the money which they have had for nearly two months and over a month since cancellation .
M	it seems like they put out a low price and hang onto payments .
M	thanks excellent quick servicewith reasonable fees
M	quick and easy will do again when i upgrade :)
M	brought bcaas , thurmopure and there new electric shaker .
M	bcaas are an okay price but you know your getting good quality and no fillers .
M	thurmopure cannot rate as such because taking other fat_burners and cortisol inhibitors .
M	the new electric shaker ( mp hurricane ?)
M	well i ' ll score it 0 / 00 because you can only really mix mp impact_whey_protein and not other brands like weight gainers but you can ' t fault it because its running on 0 aaa .
M	it looks great and a good quality 0 / 00 looks 0 / 00 and for the price 0 / 00 great overall could do with a bit more power but looks cool when mixing .
M	mp then silvered the items on the next_day with free standard delivery great 00 / 00 for mp .
M	i brought 0x weight gainers in chocolate ( low gi carbs and good protein ) and they came very fast and tasted great couldn ' t find the same weight gainer any where else .
M	good company and will be using again .
M	shopto from my experience is the best around games are always cheaper_than any other site and mosy of the time arrive before the release_date even when games have been lost in the post the problem has been sorted straight_away would highly_recommend
M	phoned the store to ask for some advice on supplements as there ' s so many to choose from and wanted to get the right ones for me , once we worked out what ones would be best , i made my purchase and received my goods the next morning :) thanks !

M	i am very frustrated with ebay as recently i went to buy an american football jersey .
M	i had put in the winning bid and the bid had been accepted and the money was taken out of my account .
M	after not receiving the item we contacted ebay where we were faced with a long back and forth phone conversation with the final result being ebay could not do anything so i had lost my money and didn ' t receive my item .
M	>:(
M	facebook is fantastic its easy to use and means u can keep in touch with friends and family .
M	one thing i would like to know or see is recently a friend of mine was at another friends house and his friend used his account as a laugh and blocked me without my mate knowing but know we cant seem to unblock each other .
M	maybe there could be the option if the blocker wants to unblock someone they could do that .
M	apart_from that its a gr0 social network :)
M	what can i say itunes is gr0 everything you want you can find .
M	prices are resonable .
M	easy to use .
M	:)
M	amazon is fantastic the delivery times are quick , prices are cheap and can find everything i need .
M	good job amazon keep it up :)
M	routeone is where i buy a lot of my clothes .
M	i find it a very easy website to use and the service is brilliant .
M	:)
M	i ordered a sony hvr - v0e camcorder a few_days before_christmas and with all the mayhem that must be happening with postal deliveries slrhut came through managing to deliver my camera just before_christmas_eve .
M	we received a phone call from slrhut who where very helpful in giving us information on what we where buying and offering us special deals .
M	the camcorder is brilliant and shoots in fantastic quality .
M	i will be using slrhut for all off my equipment from now on .
M	thank_you slrhut :)
M	very cheap and they match competitors prices if you find it on sale somewhere cheaper .
M	i ordered some bench glasses and i was unsure at first whether online prescriptions would be correct so i only opted for the cheaper lenses .
M	i was very suprised with the quality and look of these glasses and will_definately be buying more !
M	!
M	i ' ve bought quite a few items from sportbikeshop now , and i tend to order 0 item at a time rather_than a bulk order , but each time the item has been shipped correctly and quickly .
M	overall a great shop and excellent service that i ' ll continue to use .
M	ok , do you like games ?
M	do you want them cheap ?
M	do you want them delivered the very next_day after you have ordered ... for free ?
M	if like me , the answer to all 0 is yes , then quite simply , use shopto .
M	one more note , you get points just for ordering items , my last purchase was £_00 , but when i got to checkout it asked me if i wanted to use my available points ?
M	i said yes , and suddenly my purchase went down to £_00 !
M	!
M	the best gaming site , simply has no equal !
M	keep it up shopto
M	what a joke company .
M	tried to get phone unlocked , had 00 . 00 , spent 00p by_accident , need 00 . 00
M	in order to get it unlocked .
M	they wouldn ' t let me top up £_00 just in case this happened , i now have to top up another £_00 to get it over the 00p limit .
M	what can i do ?
M	nothing but bend_over and take it , will never use them ever .
M	wouldn ' t let me cancel my course prior to it ' s beginning , even considering it was a self taught online only only course and it had yet to start .
M	was told different things by different staff_members and my case was handed about like a hot potato .
M	although a lovely user_friendly front end website that makes payment seamless and easy , the back end learning system feels antiquated and muddled .
M	a bizarre experience from beginning to end from a school of " marketing ".

M	what ' s happening to the royal_mail ?
M	in the face of new and upcoming competition they aren ' t working to be more efficient and a better service , they are just putting up prices and closing branches ??
M	?
M	i had to pay £ 0 for a small light parcel today , a year or two ago that kind of thing would have cost only £ 0 . 00 .
M	how the hell has the cost doubled in that time ?
M	i had to ask the counter lady the cost twice because i was genuinely astounded .
M	i ' m angry that i went_ahead with it anyway but i was in a rush , held to ransom by time and these now crooks .
M	i sent a small letter special delivery the other day , that was £ 0 , up from just £ 0 . 00 a year or two ago , again .
M	basically , i won ' t be using royal_mail anymore for any parcels and i won ' t send something special except in the most dire of circumstances .
M	with the ongoing branch closures and spiralling prices this once great and highly reasonable mail service is drawing it ' s last breaths .
M	we used codepack after using their sister company , okidirect , for a qr code reader for a clients marketing project .
M	they helped_us pick out which was the right product for our needs , were competitive on price and got it delivered fast .
M	great service .
M	i bought a small oki c000dn from these_guys for general small office use .
M	was a good price , delivered next_day , can ' t complain !
M	i recently_purchased a costume from these_guys and their service was a class !
M	they were nothing but helpful and got my order out same day so i had it in time for a party the very next night .
M	would highly_recommend and would definitely use again .
M	keep up the good work guys !
M	have used paypal for many years .
M	very useful service but customer_service is generally pretty bad .
M	they can also be a pain if you are a seller on ebay , with holding payments until they are satisfied you aren ' t fraudulent .
M	innocent until proven guilty anyone ?
M	i ' ve used amazon for over 0 years .
M	i ' ve never had a problem with them .
M	they are a class outfit and know their business_model well .
M	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	paid for item and next_day delivery .
M	delivery was left " at wrong depot " even_though website said it had been completed .
M	submitted webform .
M	no response .
M	emailed , got a reply next morning " blah_blah apologies will send out today or tommorow maybe " (?!!)
M	emailed back to confirm date and not for it to be friday_morning .
M	got no repsonse .
M	low and behold friday_morning it arrives .
M	fruit is fresh but the customer_service stinks !
M	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	seemingly my case was a one off and hopefully the holes in there customer_service are being addressed .
M	i can ' t fault a business that is prepared to offer a full_refund when it feels it has not measured up to it ' s own standards .
M	a decent basket for the price .
M	i have had a few orders from the watersports warehouse and every time the entire service has been incredibly good .
M	the lady who dealt_with my orders over the phone was very friendly and helpful and went out of her way to have my order with me by the next_day at short_notice .
M	all in all a very well run business with great customer relationship , a pleasure to do business with .
M	highly_recommended !
M	spot on !
M	bargain , gd for business and recommended
M	bought several keys from this store in the past_year or so , all the minor problem i had were solved faster then on other online stores .
M	prices are low but sometimes not the lowest , still it ' s worth pay a bit more and get a good support some times .
M	overal a real good store and a good costumer_service .
M	keep the good work .
M	i found this website today after looking for a place that does cheap and instant ms points and at first i was a bit_sceptical but after seeing the reviews i gave it a go and i ' m_glad i did as it was cheap and fast .
M	i will defently come back here when i need more ms points or to renew my xbox membership .
M	don ' t trust argos at all , all you will get is poor customer_service and a complete_lack of information .
M	i bought a hoover from them 0 years_ago , plus the additional 0 - year in - store warranty .
M	all was fine till the hoover stopped_working , i brought it back , no problem getting another one .
M	the only problem is that i accepted to have the money refunded on a gift_card instead of the cash given back to me , so i got my new hoover through the gift_card .
M	when the new hoover stopped_working properly after only 0 months , i brought it back asking for the same one but no more in stock anywhere_near my area .
M	i then asked for a full_refund but they would only do it on my gift_card , not on my bank_account .
M	so i had no choice but to get something from argos again .
M	i asked how long to wait for the same hoover , i was told 0 weeks , left my name and number and they said they would let me know .
M	after 0 weeks still nothing , so i went back to the same store to speak to the same man , just to be told that the item had been_discontinued !
M	no information whatsoever given before i went in myself , i probably could have waited for a year , clearly no one bothered to find out what was going on .
M	and i will still have to buy at argos , because of that stupid gift_card which is nothing but a nasty trick designed to keep you buying from them .
M	this is obviously the last time i will give them any of my money , and anyone reading this review is strongly advised to stay_away form argos .
M	you have been warned .
M	the properties they have on offer look fantastic but unfortunately for at_least another 0 / 0 years i will not be stay if any over their properties as the party i go on holiday with ( which is mostly family ) are all under 00 .
M	i was extremely disappointed that after finding the penthouse , pearl 0 in newquay on their site paying the deposit ( twice ) to be told that as the majority of the party was under 00 , the management of the property had stated they would not accept our booking , when i queried why i was told it was because previous parties at their properties that were of our age group had caused a " substantial " amount of damage .
M	i understand they need to protect the property owners but with all due respect the security deposit they were asking for was in excess of £ 0000 . 00 which we were happy to pay and following reading their t &_cs it also states they can take up to £_000 . 00 extra off your card for damage .
M	if this isn ' t a big enough security deposit for the owner to accept a wider market of customers then surely they need to make the security deposit even higher or increase the amount it costs to stay there !
M	i mean last_year we stayed in the ritz new_york , no deposit required but a much higher nightly rate at no point did they ask for our ages .
M	from a service point as well how take they take the deposit from us before confirming the booking then tell me they have cancelled it when i can quite clearly see they haven ' t cancelled the payment fully as i work at the bank where the payment was intended to come from .
M	also to say it is in our t &_cs about group bookings for under 00s , which i do not dispute it is but it is at the very bottom and states that they only decline bookings where all party member on under 00 , not majority of the party as when i asked if we are accompanied by one our parents ( baring in mind the majority of us over 00 anyway !)
M	would they accept the party they again stated they wouldn ' t .
M	i am truly gutted we couldn ' t go the property we wanted as it would have been my sister in laws dream birthday , i would not advise you use this company when looking at bookings for more 0 adults if you any of you are under 00 .
M	a fantastic website , good communications and speedy_delivery .
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	same product at a better price .
M	that being said ; they should offer free shipping on orders over $_000 or more not the $_000 or so it is now .
M	0nd time using epcc guys and we are absolutely thrilled with our new tees .
M	the placing / size was spot on and the turnaround time was excellent .
M	we have taken our clothing to various stores and now are set to be stocked in various places in the south west of england .
M	great pricing / great communication / ordering again very soon .
M	i always buy from here .
M	it ' s way more affordable than anything you can find in a physical store .
M	i ' d recommend to anyone interested in supplements .
M	they sent me an_email_saying they had missed me , they wanted me to order something else so i did .
M	they also sent me a unique code for a 0000 alpine stars hat .
M	the delivery time was fast , can ' t complain .
M	i had no issues what so ever .
M	i ' d highly_recommend these people .
M	thanks !
M	very impressed with the whole service and especially the quality of the tags
M	best price i could find ... including several top online_retailers !
M	great delivery too .
M	thanks
M	having booked and paid for a reservation through them , the agent refused to rent me the car because i did not comply with their policy .
M	the agent said no money had been transferred to them and rentalcars . com was responsible to refund me .
M	rentalcars . com has refused to give me a refund on the grounds that the supposed ' cancellation ' had been done after the pick_up time !
M	even_though i had not cancelled and was refused the car !
M	this is a scam and they should be held accountable for it !
M	really informative website .
M	the company ' s product review rated the item ( soundmagic pl00 ) very highly , yet the headphones still turned_out to be even better_than_expected .
M	significantly better_than the denon ' s , originally costing twice as much , that they replaced .
M	good price .
M	faultless communication_throughout .
M	delivery via_royal_mail within_00hrs .
M	and yes , finding a lollipop at the bottom of the parcel did make me smile !
M	bought a nintendo ds lite for my daughter when i received the item the box was damaged and the packaging fell_apart .
M	the touchscreen was very unresponsive there where finger prints all over the screen within 0hours of my daughter playing this system the screen froze and went a bright purple colour .
M	i sent the item back because it was faulty stating that i want a refund but they refused because they said the packaging was damaged .
M	so i would have to buy new packaging to send to this company in order for me to get a refund on a faulty product or i would have to pay them to send me this faulty product back to me .
M	the manager was rude and unhelpful he basically just wanted me to get off the phone .
M	my advice is to avoid this company at all costs they will say anything not to give your money back !
M	!
M	ordered nearly 0 weeks_ago and was told that there was a stock shortage two_weeks_later after i contacted them to find out what had happened .
M	nearly 0 weeks_later , still no order , no refund , and they ' ve stopped_replying to my emails .
M	stay well away !
M	the service was absolutely great , it was very easy to find what i was looking for and order it and then the delivery was very fast and the product i bought was exactly_what i wanted and in perfect_condition !
M	great service , surprisingly quick delivery time !
M	i was skeptical ordering flat pack furniture , but i had no reason to be , delivered within days assembly quite easy ( when you read the instructions that is , assembled it the wrong way first time round thinking i didn ' t need it )
M	all the peices just lock in place , no tools required , sofa can be taken apart back to flatpack if you move , very comfortable too .
M	we bought a sofa from them just over 0 months_ago now , and still very happy , many people have commented on the quality of it , often surprised when we said it was a self assembly item .
M	will be looking to buying more with them in the future :)
M	this company is the only company i could find online that will sell topupvouchers for your pay as you go phone without charging extra , they have a bit of an annoying security system , the first order you make you have to confirm its you with your land_line , they phone you , give you a 0 digit_code , that confirms who you are then you can order as much as you like from them , once thats confirmed ordering is very fast , quick email codes for your phone too , they also give you a 00_%_discount for your second order :)
M	ordered from chilled pc , i only live around 0 miles_away and they let me pick_up the goods same day , always excellent prices , very friendly support .
M	they have a community built forum , members are always happy to help you out , and its not as childlike as many other web forums of shops i ' ve been to ..
M	have a look at some of the case mods in the forum too , some truely excellent work ;)
M	bought a tv for my nan for chirstmas , after a few_months the tv was acting up , at first i thought itwas my nan going crazy as i had a look at it and it was fine , then for no reason tv wouldn ' t turned on , after a bit of playing around it was the powerpack that failed .
M	no problem , thought i ' d returned it , packed it all up ready to go back , filled in the online rma request , strangly after about 00_minutes had a phonecall from ebuyer , they told me no need to send the entire tv back , and they ' ll ship out a new powerpack for the tv , 0 days_later recieved new powerpack free of charge , was quite impressed with how quick it was , i ' ve had some returns take months to get back !
M	used dabs quite a few_times over the years , and figured i should start rating companies i ' ve only had good experiances with !
M	generally buy clearance or used stock from dabs to save money , well if the option is there , and everytime has been excellent , so far i ' ve had one motherboard fail on me under_warranty and had no issues returning the item , obviously its not there fault it failed , but it was quick and easy to replace it , so no_complains , always one of my first choices when buying new hardare
M	i bought an alternator for my volvo s00 , ok it was a very good price £_00 delivered , but i still expected it to work , upon fitting it sounding like metal grinding against metal , not like the bearings had gone , as if the insides were properly grinding against itself , anyways i thought no_worries got a 0 month warranty , contacted ' new city parts ' as thats who 00 / 0 directed me to , the phone number was always busy and after 0 minutes i would get a message_telling_me to try calling back later and would hang_up , for 0 months i tried to contact them , so in frustration i turned to 00 / 0 spares , emailed , tried to find a phonenumber but couldn ' t find one ...
M	incidently after double checking the part numbers , the part did fit my car , but it was from the pre facelift model , i ' m sure its the same part but they insisted it was from a facelift model car .
M	will avoid in future , and have learnt to just buy new instead of trying to save , at_least , buy new if your local scrappy doesn ' t have it ;)
M	used the website to ask what was happening , was told someone would get back to me , that was a week_ago , using paypal to try and get a refund , would stay_away from , i knew there hsould of been a reason their site was so cheap
M	i placed the order on tuesday , the postage bag arrived on wednesday and i posted the phone that afternoon , email to say it had arrived on thursday 0pm , £_00 im my bank at 0 . 00pm on thursday_night .
M	sweet .
M	this is our 0th time of doing_business .
M	gamola are always helpful , fast and with a great selection of quality products .
M	i particularly like the fast website and the fact that gamola take paypal , so no_messing_about with credit_cards over the phone .
M	i plan to keep_coming_back .
M	had never_heard of go - electrical until they appeared in a google shopper search .
M	they were the cheapest for what i was looking for so i ordered from them crossing fingers that all would be well .
M	great priced product (~£ 00 cheaper_than everyone_else ) and no rip_off postage fee either .
M	order was picked_up by them on wednesday_morning , had it delivered to us on the friday .
M	00 / 00
M	would definitely use again .
M	thanks !
M	the laptop description was accurate , the purchase process fast and the delivery efficient .
M	nothing to add , excellent .
M	a great website , great products and good communication .
M	dispatch and delivery was quick too .
M	will_definitely use again
M	ordered at 0pm , received the next_day while still being cheapest for that particular product online .
M	cannot_fault !
M	the product arrived really quickly and was awesome , great value for money also !
M	:-)
M	i am one of the first adapters with parcelbright and i was previously with parcel0go and parcelmonkey .
M	i have to say that i am very happy with their services since they have good rates for dhl next_day as well as customer_services .
M	daniel , who i believe is my account_manager always deal with my query in a timely_manner and update me throughout the process .
M	i haven ' t lost or damaged a single parcel yet with them and hopefully they will keep their services at this level :)
M	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company formations 000 instead of the one my friend_recommended me .
M	a bit disappointed to be honest .
M	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .
M	afterward they will tell you what add - on you can purchase however you have already made the payment .
M	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
M	i would like to point out that the intention for " registered office service " is to protect the director ( buyer ) home address however if the services address is made public and you have to pay extra to protect it .
M	it makes no sense to have a registered office address where the public can just find out where you live from the services address .
M	and this should be explained clearly in the package page and also they should not take the payment until the final step .
M	other then that everything was smooth and solid hence the 0 star_review .
M	if you need to transfer money overseas , this is the easiest and most cost efficient method out there that i ' ve found .
M	give it a go .
M	it ' s simple , it ' s quick and you only have to pay a 00_% deposit .
M	works for me !
M	i placed 0 orders in tailor0less :
M	0st order : one shirt .
M	it arrived in less_than 00 days , both fabric and measurement were above expectations
M	0n order : one jacket .
M	it had small problems in the sleeves length measurement .
M	i brought it to a local tailor , he fixed it and then tailor0less returned the cost of adjustment .
M	great service !
M	we visited nottingham on a stag_do in april_0000 that was run by chilli_sauce , first time with this company but have been on many other stag dos .
M	great hotel , clean , great breakfast .
M	all restaurants and night clubs we visited on our list were super , got straight in on the guest lists even_though there was a large_group of us lads .
M	also the go carting was one of the best tracks and experiences we had .
M	they have everything i could possibly want at a fraction of the price .
M	for years i went to the big chain stores ( gnc , complete nutrition , vitamin_world , etc .).
M	one day a friend of mine mentioned this website to me .
M	i went home and scoped it out that night .
M	once i saw the prices and great variety , i was sold !
M	i no_longer have to burn extra cash on my supps .
M	and they always have free_samples to try new things .
M	i could not be_happier !
M	i recommend them to everyone , whether a bodybuilder , athlete , or just looking for everyday vitamins .
M	you can ' t go_wrong !
M	!
M	brilliant place .
M	genuinely cheap_smells compared to other_sites .
M	cracking delivery too , told me to expect 0 - 0 days , it arrived in 0 !
M	brilliant website , i ' m just disappointed it ' s taken me so long to find it .
M	they have it all and it ' s all very competitively_priced , ease of ordering and customer_service is second to none .
M	my order arrived on time , in perfect_condition all very discreetly packaged away from prying eyes , not to mention the free gift that was included unexpectedly .
M	will_definately be using twisted miss again in the future .
M	great price , communications and delivery from the firm .
M	would have no_hesitation using again .
M	no_hesitation in recommending - the clothes i ordered are of excellent quality , fit and look really good !
M	delivery was also fantastic - ordered yesterday morning and here today !
M	used the site to purchase a 0 different items at once .
M	site was easy to navigate and find out the information needed to make my choices .
M	delivery came exactly at the time promised - contents were well_packaged and all intact .
M	will_definitely be using again .
M	great product , good functionality , minor glitches here and there but usually ironed out pretty quickly with regular product updates .
M	highly_recommended !
M	great selection of clothes and fast delivery !
M	top quality product at a good price , well_packaged , fast delivery .
M	krill oil is an excellent product at a superb price .
M	service at health spark is top_notch .
M	great customer_service
M	willing to negotiate and say what they mean and follow through .
M	would definitely use again !
M	!
M	printerland is a very helpful company , with competitive_prices !
M	i would use them again and recommend them wholeheartedly .
M	great !!!!!!!
M	really good job .
M	i ' ve been waiting ten_days , but now , my iphone is unlocked !!!!!!
M	thank_you all of you officialiphoneunlock .
M	good team .

M	nothing was too much_trouble !
M	last_minute requests included !
M	keep up the fantastic work martin - we love you ; o )
M	ordered a samsung rl00gpgbp 000 litre g series fridge_freezer with water dispenser in black , was promised by lawrence at call_centre a time_slot if i called 0am mon ( yesterday ) and packaging taken but failed on both counts !
M	called inga 0am yesterday , said delivery guy would call 0 hr prior to delivery , they arrived 0 . 00am , left polystyrene mess both outside my flat and inside and not taken packaging !
M	!
M	would not recommend electricshop . com to anyone .
M	will be buying from curry ' s next time even at higher price but at_least they provide a better delivery service and adjust levelling feet on fridges for you ...
M	ordered tickets to see_beyonce at the o0 ... was scared as i ' v never used a site like this before but the reviews sold it to me and they werent wrong i emailed customer_services a few_times panicked they assured me everything was confirmed tickets arrived proptly and required a signature the seats were amazing directly infront of the stage .
M	if you ever need last_minute tickets dont hesitate to book through these_guys .
M	highly_recomended a +++++++
M	supplement_warehouse offers the best prices , selection , and they are hands_down the best seller of supplements !
M	i ordered flowers for my wifes birthday but they did not arive when i contacted the company i was assured they would come the next_day ( the day after my wifes birthday ).
M	this again did not happen .
M	the live_chat is terrible with advisors who obviously have no clue about customer_service .
M	i would stay well clear of this company , i will apparently recieve a refund in 0 - 0 working_days however i am left with a dissapointed wife and no flowers !!
M	!
M	item appeared to be in stock until i ordered it .
M	does not reply to emails .
M	not sent until a month after ordering ( ordered on 00 jan , sent on 00 feb ).
M	however the item itself was new and in excellent condition as ordered .
M	i have quite a few apple products ;
M	a second - hand 0000 00 ” white imac with a magic mouse ,
M	a new 00 ” mid 0000 i0 imac .
M	a fifth gen ipod_nano .
M	and they are all of superior quality .
M	i recently_purchased the fuji finepix hs00exr and it is by_far the best bridge camera out there .
M	play is the next best thing to amazon , in fact in someways they are better as they always have free shipping .
M	a great online seller , with a broad selection of products and fast_shipping .
M	great prices for working and non working phones , fast delivery of sales pack and cheques .
M	can not fault them in any way .
M	highly_recommend !
M	i have been a customer since july_0000 .
M	just recently i needed help with porting a number across to soho00 .
M	andy in the support_team has been fantastic - his prompt , helpful and patient replies to a long email thread helped_us complete the process swiftly .
M	this really sets the bar for customer_service .
M	i have been wearing knox armour now for 0 years , i ride in british superbike , i use their gloves which are the best protection gloves i ' ve ever wore , so much comfort and protection in one .
M	i also use there under suits " cool and dry " which do exactly_what they are called ..
M	i use they ' re in leather armour , chest and back armour , and i have to say it is second to none as i have tested it to its full potential and it ' s never left me with broken bones ..
M	if i can keep using armour for the remainder of my career , i would certainly like to do so as it is top stuff .
M	i purchased xbox_live subscription , and i am really pleased with how fast cost_effective and painless the process was .
M	i will be recommending this to all my friends and family and plan to be coming_back again in the near_future .
M	great service .
M	thanks
M	they had a great selection of laptops , and the customization was the best part .
M	i don ' t need windows , and they were the only seller willing to give me an windows free pc .
M	what ' s more , i needed the item delivered in the uk , but the payment would be made from my dad in south_africa .
M	they were really friendly and helpful with sorting_out the shipping , and invoice info -- catering to every whim of our bank .
M	the laptop arrived well ahead of the estimated_delivery date , and it worked_perfectly with gnu / linux .
M	even all of the fn - key functions worked right out of the box -- a rare occurrence for a linux user .
M	best .
M	store .
M	ever .
M	this was a great experience .
M	the product was way cheaper_than the closest alternative and arrived real fast .
M	i used it to clean a dishwasher in a volunteer run bar that smelled like a cat died in there .
M	after two washes it smells like fairy farts and roses .
M	i would definitely use this company again .
M	a very wide_selection of products , with a promotion every week .
M	i got an £ 0 shaker for free with my order .
M	it arrived within two days , even with the slowest shipping option .
M	no payment hassles and the delivery instruction were followed to the letter .
M	i am impressed
M	they kept me informed of my order , and i even had a delivery time to the exact hour given to me on the day my guitar arrived .
M	will buy from them again in the future .
M	ofrece todo lo_que otros antivirus ofrecen , pero la diferencia con los otros es que no consume muchos recursos , no se vuelve lenta la computadora , aparte detecta los virus al instante
M	i would recommend these_guys any day !
M	they pay the price quoted online , and paid me the same day they received my phone ( one day after posting it !)
M	they offered me a better price than most of their competitors , too - only one company beat them , but i needed the cash fast , so mazuma was my choice .
M	highly_recommended , will_definitely use again at the end of my contract .
M	great place for a stag night !
M	i recently_bought 0 sofa ' s from the isme website .
M	i say recently , but i actually ordered them in early september and was told they ' d be delivered 0 weeks_later .
M	not ideal , but at_least they were honest about it from the start .
M	when i called closer to the delivery date to confirm it was still arriving on the date mentioned 0 weeks prior , isme customer_services had no info for me and told me to call the delivery company .
M	this is where it got messy so i ' ll sum up in bullet points ...
M	* finally got a text telling_me my delivery date ( times were ' between_0am and 0pm ) and was told i ' d get a call 00_mins before delivery , so i booked a day off of work to be home for it .
M	* at 00 : 00 i get a text_saying they tried to deliver and left a card .
M	this was a flat out lie and i suspect as it was already late in the day , the driver coun ' t be bothered to do another drop_off .
M	i received no phonecall , and to leave a card , they ' d have had to ring the flat buzzer to get into the block and then drop it through my door ... of course there was no card .
M	* called the delivery place and got fobbed_off and told to rearrange the delivery ... so i requested it be delivered on a saturday this time .
M	* again , i recieved no call 00_mins before delivery but knowing it was unlikely i would , i awoke at 0am on my saturday and waited_till the early afternoon for the delivery .
M	* when they did finally arrive i went down to find them as they couldn ' t find my flat .
M	there they took one sofa off the truck .
M	as soon as i mentioned there should be 0 the driver seemed to take an attitude with me and just kept saying " there ' s only one , call the company if that ' s wrong " ( despite the fact that the packaging clearly said item 0 of 0 on it ) in a tone that left no doubt he was a moody ... moving on ...
M	* called up the company who said ' whoops ' and said the other sofa would be with me on tuesday and that i ' d get a call 00_mins before they arrived .
M	* i reluctantly booked another day of annual_leave from work .
M	got up at 0am and waited all day .
M	again ... no phone call .
M	sofa finally arrived in the afternoon .
M	the items were fine and a good price , the service left me wanting to make someone suffer .
M	i ' ll never use this company ( or any of it ' s associated retailers ) again and next time will pay the extra to get it else where ... most places would have delivered the next_day ... not 0 weeks after paying for the item .
M	it ' s just not worth the hassle and stress of having to deal with these people .
M	i sent an_email to them complaining directly but that was weeks_ago and as they didn ' t respond , i figured i ' d share my experience with you and let you decide if it ' s worth the risk and headache .
M	website was a pleasure to use , simple and saves configurations so u can build various set ups before_deciding .
M	wide_variety and prices are clearly_stated and updated .
M	prices were the best i could find whilst researching a place to get the pc and reviews dating back a few_years were all good ( wish i ' d known about them last time i bought a pc ).
M	recieved the item just over a week from the day i ordered and was kept_informed_throughout by one guy who was quick to respond to queries and knew his stuff .
M	machine runs perfectly and when i need a new one cyberpower will be where i go .
M	i ordered my sign last thursday and got standard delivery as i did not need the item until today , however sat at work the following_day it turned_up .
M	outstanding service and a very easy site to use also .
M	would recommend and use again .
M	rob
M	thanks banana_fingers !
M	!
M	rapid , awesome service as always !
M	ordered a rope , came the next_day with free postage !
M	cheers :)
M	they went out of their way to get hold of the products in my order and sent sent them very fast .
M	great service , thanks ellis_brigham !
M	posted phone thursday , full_amount quoted in my bank_account by saturday .
M	fifty notes for an old phone with minimum hassle !
M	[_name removed_] took over £_000 of my money and has given us nothing !
M	website looked good so ordered some engraved glasses .
M	comunication was great up until i sent money , then ignored my emails and never answers the phone , when he did answere gave me excuse after excuse for delays but still nothing ..
M	i had ordered engraved glasses with another company who turned_out to be a fraud , so i contacted promo gifts .
M	i ' m so please to have discovered this company .
M	their comunication , transactions and products where excellent .
M	the glasses arrived in time for our event , even_though i hadn ' t given them much notice , and they looked great !
M	had an issue with parcel being collected on wrong day courier went to collect !
M	thought i would have to pay again but ( emma ) sorted it at no cost !
M	brilliant thank_you
M	and very good value as well .
M	i have used these_guys a few_times now and every time perfect service even next_day delivery 0 days before_christmas which surprised me massively , top_notch work here
M	easy to use site and very prompt payment .
M	i paid for an origin key , this is what was advertised on the website and what it shows on the paypal confirmation page , what you actually get however is not an origin key , it is an amd ' promotions ' code which may or may not work .
M	the link they give sends you to an amd page to ' redeem the code ', once you click this , you are told to make an account , giving amd all of your personal information , then it comes to a screen to enter the code ... but wait !
M	it also asks for ' manufacturer ' and ' reseller ' as the code is not an origin code , it is some kind of amd video card promotions code .
M	i have tried to contact support and get an actual real origin code but they keep telling_me to go to the amd site and it will give me a code .... i have even had to take screenshots of the page which pops up and still no code i paid for , i am going to be forced to contact paypal and say i did not receive the goods i paid for .
M	terrible terrible support from cjs .
M	i ordered a sofa which arrived broken in august ; i was assured it would be fixed within a week !
M	a called , emailed contacted head_office about 00 times and im not even exaggerating .
M	i was promised it would be fixed everytime .
M	eventually in the end of november i had them collect the sofa and refund my money - surely it would have been easier to just fix the sofa or even sent me a new one in that amount of time !
M	no one ever apologised and i felt_like it was a complete_joke !
M	do not order from furniture_village ( honestly don ' t ) - so much stress and time wasted for nothing ( just got our new sofa from dfs delivered in 0 weeks and the service is much_better just check out their review !)
M	i sent my phines in on monday and the money was in my account tuesday_afternoon !
M	wow that was quick !
M	also the prices are the best vie found online .
M	took advantage of alfred sargent free shoe tree offer , ordered 0 pairs over a couple of weeks , all arrived within 0 working_days .
M	mike small and his team are a pleasure to deal with , and sure to purchase more pairs down the track .
M	ordered 00 quid worth of flowers for v day yesterday , ordered them a week before hand .
M	not delivered , says order was cancelled on website login on the day .
M	not email , not phone call and the number they give is a dead line .
M	taken the money out of my visa , no sign of a refund and i am angry !
M	not to metion the gf who was upset !
M	someone report these scamming twats and take them to court !
M	the online service i experienced with pleasance & harper was second to none .
M	the website was clear and easy to use , the prices were more or less the best i could find and the free next_day delivery was unbelievable in that it actually was free and actually was next_day - unlike some other_sites who make these bold claims but fail to deliver .
M	the item was well_packaged and arrived_safely in mint_condition .
M	i have already_recommended this company to several friends and will certainly return to pleasance & harper when i next need a new timepiece .
M	very impressive all_round .
M	thanks would buy from u agin very good time on delivery and a grate price thanks ones agin
M	about four years_ago i bought a golf trolley from pro rider because they were the cheapest quality trolley of the time .
M	it still goes strong and i recently sold it second_hand so that i could upgrade .
M	i looked around again and they are still the cheapest , it ' s amazing .
M	i then ordered the lithium battery one and its arrived today .
M	i ' m not playing til thursday but if this one is anything like the last one its going to be great .
M	i couldn ' t get over how small and light the battery is too .
M	i can ' t wait to use it now .
M	overall good , customer_service lacking though
M	xile clothing have a good selection of clothing but beware .
M	i bought a jacket last month with the intention of wearing it this weekend for an event .
M	upon_receiving this i emailed a query through to customer_services advising that the product arrived with no tags but i received no response .
M	yesterday i tried the jacket on again and when i tried to tighten the jacket using the drawstring this has a hole in it !
M	xile clothing have clearly sent me a product that has already been used in my opinion .
M	no tags , hold inside the jacket and the collar smells of aftershave .
M	not a pleasant_experience at all and i certainly wont be using xile again .
M	dude this place is great for scrapping any unwanted computor .
M	and they give you a quote .
M	no strings attached .
M	guitar fx direct has a nice selection of great pedals to affordable prices .
M	they provide good services and replies quickly whatever questions you might have !
M	if i can ' t find what i ' m looking for , then it ' s because i haven ' t checked guitar fx direct !
M	i most certainly recommend you to go check out their website !
M	received key for crysis 0 00_minutes post - payment .
M	have good faith battlefield_0 will arrive on time at release .
M	solid service , would recommend to friends .
M	previously purchased battlefield_0 from them and again they were flawless in delivery .
M	great prices , delivered both_times within time_frame - no reason not to use them .
M	so let me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
M	however , the company took my payment as soon as i ordered and did not ship the product for 0 days !
M	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer_service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
M	i didn ' t see this possible .. on friday i checked again and to no surprise my product had not been shipped ..
M	i contacted them again and this time i finally received a different service rep !
M	he guaranteed my product will be there by monday , and it did arrive on monday .
M	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
M	i do not recommend this company .
M	definitely would recommend to a friend , nothing to complain_about .
M	i found everything i was after for cheaper_than i was expecting to pay and had the products safely delivered within days of placing the order .
M	only concern that they may have been to careful with the packaging to make_sure none of it got damaged ;)
M	what more can i say to elaborate the heading !
M	my first experience with this company was quiete shocking .
M	when i arrived to their office i realiyed that i could get the car for the same price only if i want it without insurance .
M	seriously who would hire a car without insurance ?
M	so , of course i needed to pay than i booked the car .
M	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
M	due to my job i use search_engines quiet a lot and google is by_far the best i have ever used .
M	it is so simple and give the accurate information in only seconds .
M	great service i ordered on a friday and it came the next_day , when it said it wouldn ' t arrive until the 00rd so thank_you for being so quick :)
M	considering everything is online i have no_complaints .
M	the process of building my laptop was transparent , they managed my expectation with regards to how long it would take to build my laptop .
M	i have no_complaints .
M	i was initially a little_dubious_about using cjs_cd_keys .
M	i then read a couple of reviews and decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly_surprised by how quick the service was .
M	most of all i was encouraged by the sms / text_message authentication service they use which added to my impression that i was dealing_with a legit company .
M	i have now purchased my cd_key which works great .
M	five_stars .
M	i have now subsequent to the first review also bought_battlefield_0 and again no_problems .
M	they are quick to reply to my service requests so i am very happy all_round .
M	like i said above , sells what i want and delivers fast .
M	also they appear to have a wide_variety so there is a lot to choose from .
M	never had problems with delivery .
M	i spent a lot of time researching online companies from which to purchase my canon_eos 0d and ef 00 -_000mm l usm lens .
M	considering the large financial outlay i wanted to make_sure i was buying from a reputable company .
M	i found other_companies with marginally cheaper prices but they all looked dodgy and suspicious ( online reviews of them were not convincing and many people expressed concern ).
M	eventually i found hdew cameras and after a little online research discovered there were many other satisfied customers so i took the plunge .
M	i was very impressed with the service .
M	i was able to call into their offices in surrey and the service and help was exceptional .
M	i even got a callback from shaun once my items were dispatched .
M	i would highly_recommend hdew cameras and will certainly be purchasing more camera_equipment from them in the future .
M	price wise they are exceptionally competitive but the excellent customer_service and the fact that there is a number i can call and a human i can speak to tipped the scales for me .
M	there ' s not much to say when ordering a compact flash card , it arrived quickly and in good order , and of course it works as expected .
M	the best online customer support for any pc manufacturer ive never found an easier site to get on with , easy to find driver updates and easier still for downloads
M	probably one of the worst search_engines ever its constantly getting problems like " dns doesnt exist " or " couldnt find webpage / could possibly be expired " honestly its crap
M	obviously im going to be a little_bit biased about o0 as im an o0 customer but they are still one of the better network_providers
M	the best search_engine ever
M	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
M	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it ' s not always trustworthy .
M	i ' ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
M	this is not good for someone trying to learn the language .
M	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
M	everyone seems to correct exercises differently and a guideline for those marking exercises would be useful .
M	busuu lacks in one major area which is grammar lessons .
M	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
M	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
M	it would be beneficial for busuu and it ' s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it ' s service .
M	i believe a lot of small improvements can be made but the it team ( if they use the site ) should be able to recognise most of these .
M	a new feature i would love to see is classrooms .
M	this is where users from the same native language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
M	this would be much more beneficial than trying to speak to another member to help with your chosen language that doesn ' t know your own language .
M	people in the class can speak to one another and help one another progress .
M	you can proceed to the more advanced classes when the tutor believes you know enough to proceed and are consistent with using correct grammar and vocabulary within the unit .
M	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
M	in summary_:
M	i believe busuu is a great place to make contacts with natives in the language you are wanting to learn which makes it a valuable resources .
M	without grammar lessons , as it stands busuu isn ' t comprehensive enough to actually learn a language from using it alone .
M	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
M	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
M	used workwear_express 0 times now and i honestly don ' t know what made me use them again ( apart_from them being at the top of google and the actual ordering is a relatively easy process , providing their website is working correctly !)
M	my first service was very slow to say the least , didn ' t get our items when promised but wasn ' t kept_informed , i only knew how long the delay was going to be because i kept calling to check .
M	then i needed a couple more shirts the same but had to order over phone as their website would not add the logo ' s correctly .
M	this time they arrived only a day late or so but with one of the logo ' s missing !
M	so i had to get them sent back and wait again !
M	not only was the inconvenient for us but when i called about a week_later to check when we would get the shirts back with the second logo on ... they had actually not even started as they ' forgot ' they had received them back from us !
M	now on nov 0st i placed a new order for work wear for an open day event , the other day i called up to check on my order ( as their website says 0 day turn_around ) turns_out they are not even going to be dispatched until the 00th !!!
M	as they don ' t have stock !
M	if you are happy to wait more_than 0 weeks then great but if you ' re looking for the express service you think you ' d get or the ' 0 day turnaround ' they advertise and promise do not use workwear_express .
M	customer_service is actually appalling , couldn ' t care less either time , no %_off offered or anything , i hardly even got an_apology !
M	my company wouldn ' t be in business if we provided customer_service as bad as theirs !
M	i don ' t know how they are still in business when all 0 of my orders was an awful experience !
M	learnt my lesson now .
M	will not be back !
M	we bought 0 pcs from this birmingham based company and when they came the internal parts like motherboards , ram and power units were not as_described .
M	we were sent £_00 motherboards instead of £_000 ones and the ram was not even paired .
M	do not buy from them !
M	they may be competitively_priced but you will not get what you think you are buying inside your pc !!
M	of course they did not want to know at all and ignored all contact .
M	avoid
M	i used gak twice , and both_times the order was fulfilled and delivered the next_day .
M	packaging of the goods is very professional and the items arrived in perfect_condition .
M	highly_recommended !
M	ordered a guitar case and all went perfectly_fine .
M	i really liked the option to fast checkout without registration , paying with paypal .
M	great supplements great pricing and no headaches .
M	awesome job !
M	i love the speed in which you provide the unlock .
M	it ' s unbelievable compared to other services i ' ve used , and i ' m very satisfied with the results .
M	i hope this service stays running for years to come !
M	very very very fast_shipping , great prices that on one can beat .
M	i love them !
M	i will come back again and again !
M	excellent - only thing was delivery but it was easter so i understand .
M	this is the first time i ' ve used printing . com and the guys in cheadle , the design the guys produced and the quality of the leaflets were excellent and i am very happy with the job .
M	i will_definitely use printing . com again and would recommend them to all .
M	due to the cash injection i can now grow the business as required , thank_you funding circle
M	ordered extra large bouquet of gerberas with chocolates to be delivered for the wife from the kids on mothers_day , no chocolates delivered , wrong flowers , what i got was disgusting , no value for money and when i spoke to customer_services i was told they ran out of flowers and substituted the gerberas for thistles and it was their right to do that , my wife was horrified at what i ' d bought !
M	done not use , get a £ 0 bunch from tesco ' s garage its a better value for money !!!!
M	!
M	i ' m always very sceptical of reviews .
M	were they written by the company ?
M	will it be ok for me ?
M	well , i had no_problems whatsoever with mazuma .
M	i looked at several sites , some of which offered a fair bit more money .
M	but since mazuma has been well advertised and seemed more ' legit ', i went with them .
M	valuation was easy .
M	the bag came the next_day .
M	i popped my phone in and sent it off .
M	the next_day i had the money in my account !
M	bosh !
M	easy_peasy .
M	i ' d have no_qualms about using them again .
M	product was delivered straight_away by email and was as advertised .
M	very quick and easy .
M	recommended !
M	i ' ve placed many orders with tredz over the past few_years , and every time their service and delivery times have been second to none .
M	almost every time they have been at_least equal to the cheapest cost of products compared to elsewhere , and delivery is free .
M	i ' m at the stage now where even if they aren ' t the cheapest , i ' d prefer to pay a little_bit extra and get it from tredz as i know what i ' m getting .
M	i only order from companies based on their reviews so it ' s only fair i play my part .
M	prices for the items i ordered were the best online , and the delivery was reasonable still meant they were cheapest .
M	quick delivery so it has to be a five_star_rating from me .
M	i ' m not usually one for leaving reviews , however since i usually rely so heavily on using reviews others have left i thought in this instance i should make a contribution .
M	pvgc0 are yet to have a review showing through google_shopping , but such was the service i have just had they deserve my time to write this review which i hope will convince others to purchase .
M	instead i found myself reviewing this website and looking for other evidence of them being a reputable company ( new facebook_page ).
M	no need i received top service at a good price , could not be more happy with the transaction .
M	i ' ve only ordered the one item . it was delivered very swiftly .
M	the site was so easy to use .
M	a first_class service
M	very easy to process , got the key within 00_minutes and with no_problems what so ever
M	was looking to buy civ 0 to play over the summer holiday and i was shocked to see how much steam ask you to pay for it .
M	then i found this site , cheap and i reviewed the code within 0 minutes .
M	i ordered a book , through amazon_prime , to arrive today .
M	however after waiting in all day , no parcel .
M	amazon are moaning about dpd , i will never use you again .
M	royal_mail
M	i was a bit_skeptical_about cjs at first , so before buying anything i carefully read the description and comments and then finally bought_battlefield_0 in a split second i got my key , and to my surprise the site was actually legit .
M	just a couple days ago i bought two copies of saint row 0 and i literally wasted the whole day playing that awesome game with my brother .
M	cjs seriously offer great prices and fast services overall , i recommend .
M	i made an order 0nd july on some shoes .
M	they werent in stock but were supposed to be shipped to golfstoreeurope within 0 - 0 days .
M	it has gone 0 working_days and my order havent been shipped or taken care of .
M	i ´ m waiting ...
M	i ' ve sold a couple of phones to mazuma and have had brilliant service both_times .
M	the reply package arrived within a couple of days of placing the orders and the money was in my bank_account within a day of them receiving it in their office .
M	seriously , i have have never bought a game and 0 seconds later been able to play ot , you always have to wait for hours and / or days to finally get it but cjs_cd_keys are amazing .
M	i ordered my game today and literally 0 seconds later the key is there and ready to use .
M	it is so easy to setup an order and no waiting is required !
M	!
M	from now on , i am buying most , if not all of my games here !
M	thank_you cjs_cd_keys !
M	i was a little concerned when i read the small_print , that when they receive your phone they may not pay the full price if they find any_issues with it .
M	however , i needn ' t have worried as i received the full quoted amount .
M	the whole transaction was so easy !
M	they sent me an envelope , i popped the phone into it and posted it to them .
M	they emailed me to tell me it had arrived .
M	they emailed me again to say that they had processed it and would pay me the full_amount on a specifed date via my chosen payment_method , paypal .... and they did !
M	perfect !
M	i would definitely_recommend to anyone .
M	we are an online_retailer .
M	we send over 0 , 000 parcels a week a large proportion of which are sent via interlink_express .
M	others are sent via tnt and royal_mail .
M	over the years we ' ve trialled pretty_much every_single next_day small parcel national courier company operating in the uk ( ukmail , city_link , dhl etc ) so i feel that what follows is a qualified review .
M	perhaps moreso than the ( understandably ) aggrieved recipients of parcels delivered by interlink who ' ve been unlucky enough to experience poor service on the sole occasion that they ' ve come into contact with interlink .
M	for starters , no one is perfect .
M	interlink lose parcels too , but — from a retailer ' s point of view — they really work hard to resolve the issue and have retained a personal approach despite growing significantly over the last few_years .
M	for example , if we have a missing parcel case that can ' t be resolved by tracking online then we make a call to our local_depot who are able to contact the delivery driver directly to get further information , regardless of location .
M	this has frequently enabled us to resolve missing parcel cases in a matter of minutes .
M	just to put this into perspective , if we have a missing parcel sent via tnt then we have to contact a national call_centre and speak to a customer_service rep who opens an investigation and promises ( on a good day ) a call back within 0 hours .
M	if we ' re lucky_enough to receive a call back within 0 hours , it ' s usually only to tell us that they ' re still investigating .
M	tnt are slow and impersonal by comparison and it leaves us twiddling our thumbs while our customer gets more and more angry .
M	i know interlink is francised so i ' m not sure how our local_depot service differs from other areas but i trust that interlink are established enough to ensure that standards remain high amongst all their francises .
M	on the rare_occasion that interlink has completely lost one of our parcels ( just once in the last 00 months ) we are able to make claims for the loss quickly and easily .
M	by comparison , we also send a large volume of parcels via_royal_mail tracked which , despite being a tracked service , results in a much larger number of missing items .
M	we currently have 00 outstanding claims with royal_mail dating from november ' 00 to january ' 00 and the claims process for royal_mail is unbelievably complicated and undoubtedly designed to put most people off from claiming for missing items .
M	the number of things required to make a successful claim from royal_mail is utterly mind boggling ; we ' re talking supplier invoices to prove product purchase prices as well as copies of all scanned collection manifests and evidence of posting .
M	royal_mail then send a letter to our customer asking them to confirm that an item they ordered has not been delivered .
M	the customer needs to respond in writing to confirm this .
M	of course , in the mean time we ' ve sent out a replacement item to ensure that the customer is happy and , as such , the customer will likely disregard the royal_mail letter .
M	if royal_mail don ' t receive a response from the customer , they don ' t pay compensation to us .
M	it ' s an utterly ridiculous situation .
M	the best thing about interlink however is their technology .
M	next_day parcel delivery is a competitive business and all the big players are constantly raising the bar by introducing new parcel tracking features that make it easier for our customers to know when to expect their parcel .
M	interlink are top of the pile in terms of this technology though .
M	our customers get emails and text_messages with estimated_delivery times to within 0 hour .
M	customers are able to rearrange delivery for another day or ask the driver to leave with a neighbour all via their phone or computer without having to contact us .
M	customers can even track the delivery van online to see exactly when their delivery is due .
M	whilst the majority of the big courier companies are aiming towards this level of service , i don ' t believe that any have so far achieved what interlink have done both in terms of features and implementation .
M	all our customers receive nicely_designed responsive html delivery notification emails from interlink that contain our company logo and details of tracking_number and delivery time .
M	i ' ve seen what ukmail and city_link are doing by comparison and it ' s nowhere_near as smooth .
M	in summary , i would strongly encourage retailers to trial interlink .
M	been with sagepay since january_0000 .
M	more and more often the service is going down which leads to failed transaction after failed transaction .
M	incredibly damaging to our business , not because we lose the immediate sale but because we lose the confidence of the customer altogether .
M	the service failed in early march , it ' s now failed again ( mid march ).
M	as i ' m writing this i ' ve watched over 00 failed transactions rack up via our admin panel .
M	take mine and everyone_else ' s advice here .
M	don ' t use sagepay .
M	we ' re moving to a more reliable payment provider as soon as possible .
M	i was very happy with my order , the protein is at a great price and the taste is great too !!

M	it gets a 00 from len .
M	and a 00 from me .
M	all perfect , as it should be , nice and simple
M	excellent , fast and reliable service .
M	product arrived well_packed and quickly .
M	nice one !
M	this site rocks , i ’ ve ordered lots and keep_coming_back too and never been let_down yet , if i order early enough i get it the next_day , forget about the nobs who complain_about delivery not getting to them with 00_hours , be realistic man !!
M	dpd email you with an_hour_window and if that don ’ t suit , you can rearrange , simples , what more could you ask , also mine came this saturday too , top mark guys keep up the good work .
M	prices always cheap , and always fast delivery
M	great selection of quality products , and a fantastic service by knowledgeable , helpful and friendly staff - seemingly very rare nowadays !
M	beats your average dixons , currys etc .
M	hands_down .
M	great prices and bargians i love the fact i always save when i get on here by buying in bulk and i can never have enough shaker_cups
M	excellent service !
M	was as_described and of a very high_standard quality .
M	i did next_day delivery and had my cummerbund and tie in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
M	... with a quicker_than_expected turnaround .
M	the amount in which these_guys have moved forward in the last 0 years ; from the time i ordered my desktop from pcspecialist to almost a month_ago now , if i find myself needing more machines , i ' ll come here .
M	i have on my lap a balanced , powerful machine for a particularly affordable price .
M	easy site to find all the latest mobile phone deals on .
M	wouldn ' t recommend this lot to deliver anything ever again .
M	reason being we ordered 0 days before the selected delivery date to an international address for a birthday_present .
M	to my horror , the flowers did not arrive .
M	looking on the order tracking from dpd , the order was picked_up in the evening before the selected date and arrived into the country being delivered to at 0pm that day .
M	the flowers then sat in the warehouse all weekend .
M	the customer_service response refused to accept anything of their wrongdoing and blamed it solely on dpd with the message attached being , ' we don ' t guarantee international deliveries '.
M	having looked into the order tracking more closely .
M	the flowers were sent on the most basic option dpd offer , which on the dpd website specifically state that all deliveries will be made within 0 - 0 working_days .
M	considering the flowers departed the point of origin late_afternoon the day before , there wasn ' t a hope in hell the flowers arriving on the date selected .
M	when trying to explain that point to prestige_flowers , the person who responded couldn ' t quite grasp the obvious and still refused to accept any liability .
M	i asked for a manager to call me to discuss my complaint and i ' m still_waiting for that response .... 0 days and counting .
M	the matter has now been raised to trading_standards and raised a dispute on the payment via my credit_card company .
M	lesson to be learnt - prestige_flowers can ' t be trusted and with the standard of customer_service received , don ' t deserve to be in business .
M	love this matress , very comfortable , nice and thick , love the zipped cover , and now i get great nights_sleep , also good value for money
M	great quality , massive detail difference on my seperates hifi , more powerful bass , mid and treble , would recomend to anyone .
M	having looked around for ages for halo : limited_edition i found coolshop for the very first time .
M	they had a very good price considering most other_places were charging shocking amounts of money .
M	fast delivery , very helpful customer_service via live_chat .
M	would use again .
M	great site , great prices .
M	really fast delivery especially when they didn ' t have my ram instock !!
M	would defo use it again !
M	just generally good !
M	keep it up !
M	:)
M	not allot to say really , posted my spec on the forum , they suggested a few changes and then i ordered it !
M	came on time and i could see what stage it was at threw the process !
M	had one slight_issue wit me sending it to my mate ' s address but one email and a phonecall it was all sorted !!
M	excelent customer support !
M	!
M	helpful , good quality products and good services .
M	i recently_purchased a preowned omega_seamaster planet ocean 0000 . 00 . 00 from watchfinder . co . uk .
M	it took me a lot of time to commit to an online company to buy such and expensive item but after looking through loads of forum sites i decided on watchfinder .
M	all i can say is from start to finish the service was brilliant from my initial_enquiry to the dispatch of the watch .
M	the watch came as good as new with a replacement bezel and glass fitted and all the things included that you would expect .
M	i dealt_with jade mainly and she made the whole experience very easy .
M	all in all a reputable company that i for one will_definitely be dealing_with again .
M	all items were delivered very quickly , even_though i had a problem with one of the amps hifi - towers were really apologetic and gave me a small refund as a gesture of good will and delivered my replacement amp in the same week !
M	amazing !
M	there customer_service is top_class and will_defiantly use them again !
M	thanks so much !
M	went well .
M	no dramas .
M	i don ' t want to start on a bad note , as the product quality and fitment of what we bought from hillarys was very good , but during the installation unfilortunately there was accidental danae caused by their engineer .
M	mistake was that he moved the bed without really checking it , which_resulted_in one of the support beams breaking .
M	we promptly contacted hillarys to let them know that this unintentional mistake was made by one of their employees , and that it where it all went_downhill ...
M	after 0 phone_calls explain that there was no way that this damage was there prior to their visit ( the bed was 0 weeks old , brand_new & hand assembled by myself !!!)
M	and 0 emails , they were denying to the absolute that they were not responsible .
M	so the products that hillarys sell are not why they got 0 star , it is the awful way they dealt_with a situation caused by them , and in that on it ' s own is why we would never use , recommend ... or even deal in any way shape or form with hillarys and encourage anyone who reads this to do the same !
M	!
M	ordered quite a few products from oakfurnitaureland over the last few_months , and have to say that the quality and promptness of their service was first_class !
M	when our bed developed a fault a few weeks after receiving it ( not the company ' s fault , but a defect with a knot in the wood , but defects with handmade products aren '' t a massive surprise !
M	), but the way that oakfurnitureland dealt_with the matter was great .
M	we were offered either a fairly sizeable compensation package , or a replacement , which we opted for the latter .
M	so all in all , oakfurnitureland , you ' ve done a great job , and keep it up , because it ' s so hard to get good service from these large businesses nowadays !
M	i ordered 0 items from shopto . net on 00th_july and i found it very unreliable i received 0 item and when i tried to query 0 missing items after 0 weeks i found it very difficult to contact them .
M	i had to submit a query under the wrong subject to get a response from an advisor .
M	i don ' t think the advisors were very understand because i explained 0 item was received in 0 days and you claim they all got dispatched at the same time / place so why wont you investigate this as lost items .
M	then they had the cheeky to advise me to buy an instant code from them instead in the mean time ( so buying the item twice in effect until they refunded me )
M	i would recommend shopping through amazon because they have competitive_prices and are always reliable .
M	hostelbookers is very easy to use and a little cheaper_than hostelworld .
M	will be using for booking all our hostels .
M	quick and safe transaction .
M	fast delivery .
M	well informed .
M	i ' ll be back by the end of the month
M	found this site via google .
M	had a look , gave it ago .......
M	fantastic !!!
M	!
M	no problem , no hassle , legit
M	i will recommend to anyone having doubts about this site .
M	ordered the pump on friday_morning and it arrived monday .
M	it arrived in the actually pump box which was mis shaped , when i opened up the pump had been rolling around in the box due to cardboard holder in side being lose .
M	probably wouldn ' t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
M	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
M	being in the heating industry and wanting to find a new supplier , i tried plumb nation , ordering was simple , products came on time .
M	since then i have placed a further two orders , both orders again on time .
M	brilliant service keep it up .
M	low_prices and ships next_day
M	i used the images on web_page to chose the tread pattern i wanted for my snow tyres and also the description and mytyres ´ own review / opinion of the tyres .
M	very pleased with my purchase and the price i paid with the added_bonus of free and fast delivery .
M	had an issue with the first cable i ordered but gemma had a replacement sent out which i received the next_day .
M	highly_recommend kenable .
M	i recently went to spain and managed to tot up £_000 of roaming charges ( unknown to me , some how ).
M	when i got back and found this out i explained the situation and they let me off ( thank_god ).
M	they aslo told me next time i go abroad i should get texts letting me know when i hit certain spends on data .
M	great service 00 !
M	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
M	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv ' s usually go for around £_000 ... who_cares ?
M	not exeptional service but by no means aweful .
M	maybe if i were a more anal person i would be concerned_about my tv bracket being a couple of days late .
M	it ' s cheap , it works , who_cares ?
M	we ( kpp search ) recently engaged with pd to re - desgin our website .
M	their level of service throughout was excellent .
M	specifically , we always had the comfort that pd ' s design team were available for feedback and a quick_turnaround on our requests .
M	i wish the team at pd continued success .
M	i ordered a skin for my ipod_touch ( 0th gen ), xbox 000s and controller .
M	very quick service .
M	very good designs and easy to application .
M	i ' m not very good at applying these sort of things but theres no bubbles in these .
M	very happy !
M	i ordered a rare pair of ray_bans for my girlfriend which i couldn ' t find anywhere instore and i even called ray - ban direct .
M	i searched the internet and found them at blaze !
M	such a result !!
M	the customer_service and prompt delivery were an unexpected surprise too , browny points for me and big browny points for blaze - so shopping here again !
M	awesome recommend shiply to everyone , just make_sure you read peoples feedback , use the shiplys payment system and you cant go_wrong !!!!
M	!
M	they talk you through each_step of your order from when payment is taken to the time they post it out .
M	with a huge_range of quality clothing and other accoutrement i can ' t hesitate to recommend military_0st to anyone_looking for the sort of items they sell !
M	cheapest place i could find who were stocking the winter_tyres i was after .
M	however the price is in no way reflected in the quality of service which is top_notch !
M	an easy to use website , simple ordering system and good communication_throughout !
M	will_definitely be using again and would recommend to anyone_looking for parts for their bikes !
M	was a bit_wary of this place as i hadn ' t heard of it before but after seeing all the postive views and the excellent price for arma 0 compared to steam i decided to go for it .
M	sure enough got my steam_key for the game within just a few minutes of ordering .
M	excellent stuff !
M	i chose viagogo over seatwave ( because a friend of mine was at the company ).
M	i purchased tickets for a concert .
M	royal_mail did not deliver the tickets due to " incomplete address " but would not tell me what address was entered .
M	viagogo promised to call me back to resolve 0 times over a month long period .
M	eventually , viagogo refused to provide a refund even_though the seller entered an incomplete address .
M	this is a scam .
M	people who do not have tickets simply claim to have a ticket and then send an empty envelope to an incomplete address .
M	they get their money and the buyer is held_responsible with no refund .
M	never again .
M	waited 0 days at home for my package and everytime tracking shows " no one to receive card left ( loughborough service centre )"
M	no card left at all .
M	i called the customer_service and i was told they will try again tmoorow for last time !!
M	are you kidding you can ' t even fine my home
M	delivered a replacement parcel to wrong_address then asking me to collect it from the wrong_address myself .
M	imagine knocking on some strangers door and ask them for your parcel !!
M	!
M	this site is very simple to use , everything i wanted happened .
M	same day money transfered , good communication to summarise it up excelent site highly_recommended .
M	after having just completed another order with echo_supplements , i decided it was time to leave my opinion on their service .
M	my experience of dealing_with echo_supplements has been outstanding .
M	they have a wide_range of products to choose from at prices that are very competitive .
M	delivery is very quick and the e_- mail / sms updates of my delivery status , takes all the frustration of guessing what time the delivery man might appear out of the equation .
M	as i am a frequent buyer of online goods , this is a welcome change ( i wish every company i bought goods online from did this ).
M	not to mention the next_day delivery is included free of charge when you spend more_than £_00 , which i usually do anyway .
M	the hand_written compliment and free_sample is always a nice little touch .
M	many_thanks to the people at echo_supplements , keep up the good work .
M	every time i have needed to contact thetrainline . com , i have not been left feeling disappointed .
M	booking tickets is easy , and booking a bicycle space was just as easy !
M	ordered some trousers yesterday , delivered today !
M	just awesome service , couldn ' t ask for anything better , thank_you guys :)
M	the suplements i get here at supplement_warehouse are 00 to 00_% cheaper_than gnc .
M	i was just there to see if there prices droped , yea im surprized that gnc isnt out of bisness yet .
M	had the best price on the market for the reel i wanted , and delivery was very quick .
M	will be using again !
M	felt i had to comment as i was that impressed with in particular how fast i got my product .
M	i ordered mid day and first thing the next morning it was delivered , also it was nearly the cheapest i had found the product aswel , not quite , but with the incredibly fast postage i was more_than happy with my decision .
M	will be using them again no doubt in the near_future .
M	such a good way to keep up with friends and family .
M	just opened in gillingham and the deals are incredible .
M	fifa_00 rrp 00 quid and in asda its 00 :) big store with many products
M	it took 0 days for a custom strung racket to arrive , incredible delivery time .
M	the product itself is one of the nicest rackets i have ever hit with .
M	ordering off tennis nuts all the time , its just an incredibley good website :_d
M	great prices + free p_& p on most items .
M	one of the best on - line bike shops they are .
M	use them all the time .
M	superb service , everything is explained in detail .
M	very nice site .
M	recommend it to all .
M	my parcel was very fast to be delivered ordered on tuesday and came on thursday no_complaints .
M	this is on of the most efficient companies i have had the pleasure of dealing_with on the internet , in my opinion the service is vastly superior that of amazons and the prices are very competitive to boot
M	after having trouble with other larger internet companies services and pricing , i came_across this great company .
M	they offered a great price and had excellent reviews and i am very pleased that i purchased from videogamebox .
M	great price , fast delivery , in addition they kept me up to date on the status of my order .
M	what more can i say ?
M	i bought a hp nc0000 laptop a + refurbished machine , and it is exactly in the condition stated on the web_site - it ' s in a superb condition .
M	the delivery was excellent , too .
M	one fact sometimes can describe the overall condition of the machine .
M	in my case it ' s the following : when i connect a usb device , it clicks in the usb slot .
M	that ' s like new .
M	and all parts are in the same condition except for the battery , but that was stated on the website , so i was expecting this .
M	i can get a replacement battery for around £_00 , so that ' s not a big deal .
M	i ' m a heavy laptop user , but still don ' t want to spend a lot of money on a machine .
M	i achieve good performance on these machines by using linux on them .
M	sometimes it can be a good trick to install the latest ubuntu for instance on an older machine .
M	it ' ll feel_like a contemporary machine with the latest windows , for the fifth of the price .
M	-- at_least this is what i ' m doing .
M	this company is an excellent place to get the right machine for this purpose .
M	i would recommend them to anyone .
M	we now buy all of our consumables from printerland as they arrive the next_day everytime we place an order .
M	we have bought 0 printers over the last month as they are the best price at printerland .

M	received damaged item and the returns_procedure was hell !
M	calling the returns line cost me around £_00 in calls .
M	they answer straight_away on the new order line but will quickly forward you onto the returns line to rinse you entirely .
M	disgusting .
M	they use collect_plus who seem to ' lose ' the majority of their assignments .. so that didn ' t go well .
M	eventually got refund about a month after this order .
M	wouldn ' t recommend to my worst_enemy !
M	- get_rid of premium_rate number
M	- get_rid of collect_+
M	- actually employ some humans for the returns line
M	thieves .
M	cheap prices , easy to find what you want and you get it fast !
M	i was in the market for a pair of shoes and found a combo deal of almost half price and free delivery on a great option .
M	following the suggestion to go up half a size i ordered a size i would not normally go for and would not have known had rock + run not mentioned it in the information .
M	the shoes are great and fit_perfectly !
M	in short : an unquestionably disappointing online store , with poor management , inefficient team and misleading advertising .
M	i placed my order more_than 0 weeks_ago and should have received my glasses by now ( as they have stated it takes 0 - 00 days ).
M	i emailed them on so many occasions , expressing the urgency because i ’ m leaving the country , yet i did not get any email from their customer_service nor the management team ( as they have stated it takes maximum 00_hours to reply ).
M	it is absolutely frustrating when dealing_with this store as they don ’ t have a contact number on the website nor they are efficient in replying to emails whatsoever .
M	i don ’ t even know whether this company exists or not .
M	they give you their words but they fail to deliver their promise .
M	there is nothing wrong with the whole purchasing process taking more_than 00 days , but they should not advertise themselves as capable of delivering the goods to the customer ’_s door within 00 days when they clearly cant .
M	saying its peak season or what ever reason is not a good enough reason because they should have taken that into account .
M	consider i ordered 0 pair of glasses last_year from 0 different websites , this is absolutely by_far the worst experience i ’ ve had so far .
M	since they are not replying to any of my email , i am giving them this review to give them 0 days to reply and update me on my purchase / giving me proper arrangement .
M	if not , i will consider further actions .
M	i broke my iphone and ipad in 0 week , they collected it on the monday and i had both back to me by the thursday .
M	i was incredibly happy with what i received back and would recommend them to anyone i know .

M	it seems as if the vast_majority of people have the same experience with first_utility .
M	i can not stress enough that you should not use them .
M	we had to use them when we moved in to a new build flat in march_0000 , and i can_honestly say that since then we have to phone them about twice a month , which costs money every time as they do not have a freephone_number and the minimum time on hold every call is about 00minutes .
M	nothing which they have done since they started supplying us has been correct .
M	and do not fall in to the trap of thinking that because you have spoken to someone on the phone and agreed something that this will be acted on or recorded in any way .
M	and do not worry_about emailing - they will not reply .
M	i can not begin to list all of the issues we have had as there has been so many - it has caused endless stress over the last 00 months .
M	there ' s always little problems with energy suppliers but this has been nothing but constant problems since we have been using them .
M	you have been warned .
M	well , what can i say .
M	the branded version of fluconazole , canesten , retails at around £_00 for one capsule , and the un - branded version around £ 0 .
M	i got three for £ 0 . 00 including delivery from pharmacy first - amazing !
M	we had already decided to replace the flooring throughout our new home when we purchased as it was a mix of colours and textures , some of which was 00 years old and threadbare in places .
M	although my partner and i are thrifty , upcycling and doing work ourselves , we would never recommend scrimping on carpet and underlay as it is not something one would like to be replacing on a regular_basis .
M	we read reviews of various underlays and decided to go with the ' cirrus ' by cloud 0 .
M	when we spoke to the store that was supplying our carpet , they told us they could supply cloud 0 ... great , we thought , until they told us the price was £_00 sqm !
M	we knew carpet underlay shop was able to supply it in complete rolls and cut lengths which worked out to under £ 0 sqm , a rather large saving i ' m sure you ' ll agree .
M	they even had a promotion running which included a small pack of gripperods ... fantastic as we found the rear of the lounge was missing them for some reason .
M	the whole_process from ordering to delivery was smooth and we would certainly do custom with carpet underlay shop again as and when we require .
M	we ' ve already_recommended them to family and friends , and we highly_recommend them to the public as well !

M	i ' ve been using american sweets ( aka the stateside candy co .) for quite some time now and i ' m sorry to say my general feelings towards the company have become rather negative .
M	the major issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
M	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it ' s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it ' s expected contents missing .
M	next in line is that the price of clearance items can drop quite sudden and dramatically , and i have contacted them about this before after i placed an order only to find that three items had been reduced in price by 00_% overnight .
M	their response was simply " your parcel has been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
M	finally their customer_service skills are lacking somewhat .
M	i ' ve contacted them several_times over the year and the tone of the e_- mails ( usually responded to by emma baker ) are rather abrupt , that is if they ' re not ignored completely .
M	from reading the reviews of this company by other customers , it seems that all have complaints of a similar nature , and i would highly advise the director to take these issues onboard if they wish to keep customers .
M	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
M	i came_across the evaq0 website whilst looking for ' hot cans '.
M	i must_say i ' m suitably impressed by their range and highly competitive_prices ( they were at_least £ 0 cheaper ), not to mention their delivery prices were reasonable too and weren ' t inflated to recoupe any difference in product prices .
M	at the time they were offering free delivery and their customer_services were second - to - none when i couldn ' t get the code to work .
M	i would highly_recommend taking a look at this company !
M	youtube offers a wealth video clips that range from informative , funny , helpful , all the way to down - right weird !
M	i personally love the informative side of youtube .
M	if there ' s anything you ' ve ever wanted to know more about out , or how to do , you can find it here .
M	for example , we ' re currently renovating our home and found multiple videos which explained how to plaster - skim walls , which appeared simplier in video that it read in text .
M	my partner and i booked a diy holiday for may this year , and after much internet trawling we booked the flights and car_hire via ebookers despite reading mixed_reviews .
M	everything went well at first until we received our itinerary via e_- mail .
M	upon inspection we noticed that the ' special meal ' that had been ordered for one of our travellers had been assigned to another traveller .
M	this , we thought , would be no problem to amend , and with the details provided by ebookers we should be able to login to our flight booking through the airlines website and make the changes there .
M	we were able to login to the airlines website , but soon realised that the ' special meal ' was not the only error .
M	they , ebookers , had jumbled up the passport details for each traveller and so we had to go through and amend all the details .
M	we thought that was the end of this , however , soon after we received an e_- mail from ebookers stating that we needed to provide them with passport details .
M	we responded to their e_- mail stating that this had been done following the booking and that we have had to also amend them via the airlines website .
M	ebookers responded stating that we must give the details as per their policy , of which we did , but ... a month later after a routine check or the airlines website , we found that ebookers had jumbled the passports details and ' special meal ' again !
M	this happend three times before we travelled , and in addition to this , the airlines scheduled departure times changed and ebookers failed to update us with this information .
M	it was only due to checking with the airline that we were informed of these changes .
M	the hassle that ebookers caused was certainly not worth the £_00 per passenger that we saved .
M	therefore we can_honestly say that we will not be using ebookers in the near_future , sorry .
M	there is nothing more to say other than i love google .
M	it has remained my preferred search_engine ( and default homepage ) since i first discovered it .
M	the reason_why i love google is because of its minamilistic homepage and the innovative use of the ' google ' logo at times , speed of search_results , and integration with various applications i use .
M	ebay is a fantastic way of selling your unwanted items , and has a treasure trove of items that you may just want to spend your new income on .
M	the process is easy and there are numerous ways of which you can send / receive payments for items ( the most common being paypal ).
M	ebay , of course , do request a percentage of your items revenue for using their services and there are add - ons to enchance your listings at an additional charge .
M	having recently sold items on ebay ( after a few_years abscence ) i must comment that the charges seems to have been increased significantly ( around 00_% of final auction price ) and this did come as a bit of a shock .
M	i ' ve collected a fair amount of ex - contract mobiles over the years , and having seen the catchy mazuma_mobile advertistment on tv i thought i ' d give the service a try .
M	i must comment on how extremely easy the whole_process was from start to finish , and how mazuma_mobile send you regular e_- mail updates as to where you order currently stands .
M	i would definately use their services again .
M	this website was very easy to navigate and had every thing i need .
M	i really_appreciated the information that came along with the products and the coupons that they make available to us !
M	great overall !
M	first time customer of ray grahams , i bought a milwaukee m00 fuel compact cordless percussion drill 00 volt m00cpd - 000c , great service 0 days to deliver from ireland for free .
M	very competitively_priced and exellent quality drill .
M	fast service
M	my laptop hard_drive had died on me and i was in need of a replacement fast , as usual i checked aria and all it ' s competitors for the best replacement product and found quite a few of aria ' s competitors had the drive i wanted , all priced similarly .
M	however , i choose to go with aria as they offer free next_day delivery with dpd for loyal_customers , this was the first time i had used aria ' s new carrier and they did not let me down .
M	i got the replacement on time , undamaged and it worked a treat .
M	to add the price was one of the cheapest out there .
M	i would definitely_recommend aria again as i ' ve been shopping with them for over 0 years now and they have not let me down to date , infact they get better each time :).
M	has all of the major_brands at great prices and if you shop around and find a lower_price they will easily adjust theirs to keep you happy by just entering in the website and price .
M	will_continue to shop here as this is my third order .
M	sunce that scumbag american football player died of dehydration after taking a crapload of ephedrine and didn ' t drink enough water , this lively supplement has been banned or terribly hard to find in the states .
M	they have it here .
M	i ' m ecstatic .
M	my job depends on my weight and athletic ability and you just can ' t top ephedra supplements .
M	i ordered a rabbit run at 0 :_00pm and it arrived the next morning at 0am !
M	absolutely outstanding service and item was cheap compared to other_sites .
M	i will_definitely use again .
M	thanks !
M	this website is the best if you want cheap games and if you dont want to wait for them long
M	after searching the web for any possible way to unlock my iphone i came up to this site .
M	i wasn ' t sure if it was the real deal or just another fake .
M	i gave it a try and the result was an unlocked at & t iphone_0s the next_day .
M	the only_downside is the cost of their service in for some carriers .
M	i will surely be using their service again . 0000 % positive .
M	it is really , unlocked my iphone 0 that was locked to swisscom version 0 . 0 . 0 . very good job thank_you recommend to everyone .
M	brilliant service and products
M	super_fast dispatch
M	cant find fault with the website ..
M	secure and did the job what it is build for .
M	ebookers is an awsome website .. and is so easy to use and completely user_friendly ..
M	ordered a rhodia notebook as an_alternative to moleskine .
M	the paper is more prone to ink smears but better quality , so i have just changed pen and for the price is really a good deal .
M	always is also good to support competitor brands
M	i had talk_talk and when moving in to a new flat i was enticed by my landlord to have virgin_media , " as a reconnection with talktalk would be to expensive ".
M	later i found out the the jerk got a 00 £ credit on his virginmedia connection so he could sat all day masturbating .
M	when setting_up the contract i haven ' t read anywhere that by asking for a phoneline service , i would also need to buy a phone .
M	i bought a regular one , that didn ' t work , and customer_service tell me it should be a virgin phone , i didn ' t bought it .
M	oh yea , and if you don ' t have a virgin phone service (+ virgin phone ) you will be burning parts of your brain and wallet , frustrating with customer_service , since the thing looks set_up to make it really difficult : the machine asks for area code , some 0 or 0 passwords , and some more shit , " to make the service faster ".
M	true to be said , i have wasted more that 00 £ trying to cancel the phone service , which i couldn ' t so i had to stick with it for 0 months .
M	now , let me tell about the broadband in one word - its shit .
M	i mean , i never had a service who blocked so many websites , i had to learn how to counter act this with proxys and other it technicalities so i could download what i wanted ( yes i know that copyright infringement is though for the companies to accept that has its own benefits ).
M	the connection was good and reached the speeds that they sell lets say .. 0 times in one year .
M	on prime time , i couldn ' t even watch youtube .
M	also i had 0 periods of 0 hours straight with no connection .
M	yes i could spent other 00 £ phoning them to fix it but i chose to wait , you can guess why .
M	oh , and the letters they send , so funny .
M	" we noticed that you like to download , specially in the evening ".
M	is that really a good marketing move on your clients ?
M	first , its really great to feel being spied on .
M	second , i can ' t even watch a 0min video on evenings , not to talk about downloads that i can ' t even reach the websites to make them ...
M	and last but not least ...
M	i changed house again , and wanted to bring virgin along with me since i had 0 months left in the contract ... and i find out that if i wanted to bring them with me ( yea , romantic i know ) i would had to re - contract for more 00 months , and pay some fees ..
M	i chose to disconnect , and i was also asked to pay for a disconnection fee .. lol .
M	today i find out that they are charging me for paper handling fees , when i signed_up for a direct_debit to prevent them for sucking more money out of me 0_0 it has reached a point that is incomprehensible to me .
M	by the way virgin_media ...
M	i ' m using your service that i payed to write this .
M	and i will also prevent everyone close to me to spend 0 cent with you .
M	this is actually a thing that i can do with your connection , type text .
M	wow .
M	im going back to talktalk again , not sure if its the best but at_least i had nothing to bother when i had it .
M	and fuck you virgin , honestly .
M	found all the information i needed from the website to make a decision on what product was best for me .
M	rang the technical department to check i ' d made the right choice !
M	all staff i spoke to were helpful and when i placed the order delivery came quickly and well_packed .
M	have used the product now for my garage floor and it looks excellent .
M	top_marks all_round .
M	always great buying from tiger fitness !
M	just ordered over $_000 worth of supplements for $_000 with shipping !!!!
M	amazing !
M	!
M	this site is extremely easy to use and cheaper_than every site i went too looking for this game ( assassins_creed iv black flag - special_edition ) would definitely_recommend it !
M	when i have to order supplements online , i always go to supplement_warehouse .
M	they have pretty_much every supplement on the market and the best part about it is that they let you price_match their competitors !
M	aside from that awesomeness ....
M	they ship right away and the service is excellent !
M	i bought ipad through group on deal .
M	i been advised it has been despatched on 00 / 00 by email but no track no been provided when i did not received my item and phoned them , been advised they cannot track and will send me declaration for form so they can investigate .
M	they sent me emails twice without declaration form .
M	i have phoned them few_times no reply from customer_service .
M	one day luckily been able to speak to one agent who said they have issue with system and will send me form manually .
M	i have received form and send them back on 00 / 00 but still no reply .
M	i am phoning them everyday but there is msg we are very busy and been on phone around 00_minutes everyday fro last few_days but no reply .
M	i bought this for someone as christmas_gift .
M	no reply from them please avoid to buy any item as you have to spend lot of money on phone to know where is your order .

M	i always use this website i got mobile_app and its so handy one of my fav app i can check trains time within sec i will def recomand the mobile_app to everyone
M	if you need a good phone and decent price go with htc

M	htc one x is one of the best phone around rite now

M	bought a rolex with 00_%_off when using gift_card via this website .
M	cant go_wrong
M	i cheekily sold my 0s the day before the announcement of the 0 and even after the prices dropped , they paid the higher amount when i sent my phone in 00 days_later .
M	prompt payment as well :-)
M	exactly_what it says on the tin .
M	speedy service , polite customer_service even when i changed my payment_method and good pricing .
M	always excellent .
M	the best communication i ' ve received from any delivery company .
M	text and allocate a sensible delivery window with a range of additional options .
M	quality .
M	failed to deliver the first time .
M	i contacted myprotein and arranged a re - delivery .
M	again no product .
M	contacted myprotein again and was assured a refund would be processed within 0 - 0 working_days .
M	nothing .
M	myprotein now no_longer responds to emails , and if you ' ve tried getting through via the telephone - good luck , it ' s a full time job in itself .
M	used to be an ace company but no_longer .
M	real_shame .
M	delivered as scheduled - to the minute in fact .
M	great product and very good customer_service ; unlike myprotein they deliver , answer the phone and respond promptly to emails .
M	great stuff .
M	tried to deliver twice , then inexplicably decided to return to depot - thirty miles_away - rather_than drop_off at local post_office - 00 metres away .
M	i then completed the form asking for the parcel to be re - delivered to my local post_office .
M	didn ' t arrive .
M	this was my first order from aria since they changed delivery company to dpd .
M	the service is so much_better now and lets you know when the delivery will be arriving .
M	one of the items which i ordered was out of stock at the time so a delay was to be expected , but the cs_team kept me updated on the progress of the order from start to finish .
M	a truly top_notch company .
M	greetings my fellow trust_pilot friends .
M	used double0tickets for the first time for a wireless_festival ticket after the site was recommended to me by a friend .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	snappy service and good price .
M	can i ask for any more ?
M	p . s rihanna winked at me , made my day !!!!
M	!
M	fanatastic service , good price , quick delivery and well_packaged .
M	what more could you ask for .
M	i purchased couple of cricket equipments from barrington_sports recently and the service received was brilliant and hassel free .
M	i had to return 0 item and then i noticed that it was free to do so via click and collect .
M	this is an amazing service and takes care of all that additinal expense of returning your product if it is not suitable which happens when it comes to internet purchases .
M	delivery of the product and refund of the item returned was done promptly so no_complaints there .
M	overall a great shopping_experience .
M	people have started making money out of everything .
M	even if it means by selling your personal details .
M	this is one of such sites .
M	i have faxed them to remove my details ( it is very hard to get through to the fax line ) and still they haven ' t removed my details off the website .
M	i was informed that if you don ' t opt out while updating the electoral register these companies buy your details and sell it to whoever pays the money .
M	they provide your
M	name
M	address
M	other occupants
M	electoral roll
M	length of occupancy
M	neighbours
M	property price
M	of course for a fee .
M	don ' t even bother buying this product manufactured by this company as it is such a waste of money .
M	i purchased this 0 years back and registered for warranty .
M	first 0 months went well then the problems started .
M	console was changed 0 times as it kept on blowing up .
M	first they told me it is the adaptor i am using and when i informed them i purchased the adaptor from them they didn ' t have much to say .
M	after the third blow out they finally decided that there is a problem and send out an engineer .
M	i had to wait for 0 months for engineer visit as the parts were not available due to a warehouse move .
M	after the engineer visit i noticed that the right pedal cracked .
M	i reported this fault to the company and a very rude lady from their customer support ( icon health and fitness ) informed me it is my fault .
M	i called back after couple of days to complain and one nice gentleman was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge when the other staff_member i spoke to was ready to charge me £_00 for the same .
M	i tried to fix the pedal when i realised the welding connecting the leg of the machine has come off and at this point i gave up .
M	dismantled the product and dumped it in a " ecofit " way .
M	£_000 down the drain .
M	please don ' t waste your money join a gym or buy a better equipment which works .
M	please_note that you need to register for extended free warrenty else you will miss out plus end up paying more for repairs which will happen for sure .
M	emirates is an airline which stands out from others .
M	their long_haul and short haul flights have excellent facilities , entertainment and service .
M	i have travelled with them many_times and each time had a great experience .
M	competition is tightening up in the industry and they have to start keeping up with qatar_airways .
M	a000 is an amazing flight with two decks .
M	first_class and business class facilities are amazing and the economy is not bad at all .
M	extra legroom and better entertainment system ( ice ) serves you well .
M	first change ( unless you are travelling on a specially discounted ticket ) is free and chargable after that .
M	this has come in handy couple of times but i should mention that airline is very accomadating .
M	wish most of the airlines provided similar service .
M	i was really happy with the service i received from currys .
M	i went into stevenage branch of currys to buy a cheap windows 0 laptop but walked out with and apple imac .
M	sales_person was really good .
M	credit where it is due .
M	he had good product knowledge and he did convince me to try out imac .
M	i was completely new to snow lepord and i have never used it before as i was a big_fan of microsoft ( till the day i started using imac ).
M	imac was pricey but you get what you pay for .
M	coming_back to the point of service it was excellent .
M	since then i have visited currys for other purchases and also recommended couple of friends .
M	it is nice to see that service provided by this supermarket is great .
M	staff is friendly and helpful .
M	they also have a price_match and voucher scheme which works out great .
M	strong contender when it comes to fuel prices as well .
M	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
M	las_vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals i was getting during the time .
M	recently i booked two days break for dublin and that experience was interesting .
M	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
M	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
M	i got through to an overseas call_centre and managed to find the deal i was looking for .
M	i explained to the agent that we were a party of 0 and the money will be paid on two cards .
M	i admit that agent was very accommodating and explained the first card payment will be 00_% of the total and the second will be 00 %.
M	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .
M	all prices and flight times were agreed and booking continued .
M	when it came to processing payment whatever i explained about paying for 0 people on one card went out of the window .
M	she quoted 00_% of the charge .
M	as we were back to square one i explained what i wanted again .
M	agent informed me that it should be done as 0 booking .
M	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
M	before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission .
M	i agreed as everything was correct .
M	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
M	i was a bit confused and questioned it .
M	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
M	i informed her that i am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed amount .
M	she informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help .
M	i informed her that i was disappointed with the service but " i cant do anything was the reply ".
M	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
M	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
M	while entering the details of the passenger i noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which i was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later .
M	i entered correct information and continued with the booking .
M	once the booking was at payment page .
M	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
M	i noticed that the difference in price was only £ 0 per_person which the agent failed to mention .
M	on the positive side we didn ' t end up paying extra to change passenger spelling .
M	personally i feel that they should have adjusted the fluxuating rate after the price was agreed which would have been the real expedia experience ( they would have gained that additional 0_stars )
M	positive
M	easy to use website , good deals , no credit_card charge .
M	negative
M	overseas call_centre was a let_down both on quality and service .
M	rates can fluxuate so until last_minute you wont know how much you are paying .
M	we booked a hawaii cruise and las_vegas stay with this company and to start with everything was fine .
M	we got a reasonable deal and the agent was helpful .
M	i requested a call back over the weekend to put down the deposit but agent asked me to call back .
M	i was surprised that agent didn ' t try and secure the deal like other travel_agents i spoke to on the same day but took it as a positive of no pressure sales_tactics .
M	i called them back after the weekend and put down £_000 deposit .
M	all details were taken down and booking went through fine .
M	as mentioned earlier agent provided all the necessary details and his experience reflected in his answers to my questions .
M	please_note that agent and the company did make it clear that if i decide to cancel my holiday i will loose the deposit so they have done this by the book .
M	after couple of months i had a family problem and couldn ' t travel on the dates .
M	i called the agent up and he informed me that he can possibly try and rearrange the cruise if i choose the same liner or can work out some deals for another cruise if i choose a different liner .
M	again i was asked to find a deal instead of the agent looking one for me .
M	i didn ' t think much of it and couldn ' t find anything great .
M	i called the agent back and informed that i cant find any other cruise itenary with the liner and checked about a new booking which a cruise and stay deal from hawaii .
M	agents response was " it has been ages since i looked into a flight to hawaii but leave it with me and i will get back to you within couple of days ".
M	he asked me to email him holiday cancellation letter which i did on the same day .
M	the impression i got from the conversation was he couldn ' t be bothered to look around for another deal but i was happy to give him benefit of doubt .
M	i waited for a week and heard_nothing from the agent or the company .
M	after two_weeks i had one of the accounts staff call me from the company asking about rest of my holiday payment .
M	i explained that i have cancelled my holiday and emailed the agent about it .
M	i also informed the staff_member that the agent promised me a call back but i haven ' t heard_anything .
M	the staff_member informed me that she will speak to the agent and he will call me back .
M	till this day i haven ' t heard_anything from the agent or the company .
M	low_prices could be a result of many things ( special deals , off season etc ....) so before you jump in please check whether the weather and tourist season for the month you want to cruise .
M	things to check while booking :
M	whether the deal is cruise only , fly cruise , cruise and stay .
M	transfer etc ... included
M	tips on board ( this is something you may be able to pay in_advance or have to pay on board )
M	hidden_costs ( in the deal we got we had stay in las_vegas and had to take an internal flight to los angeles .
M	there is a additional charge for baggage which you have pay on check in and it is not included in the price ).
M	positive
M	reasonable deals
M	negative
M	poor after sales service , hidden_costs
M	i am a big_fan of google .
M	i use it every day and havent gone back to using any other search_engine since i was introduced to it 00 years back .
M	would definitely_recommend this company and use again .
M	we ordered very late on a tuesday and received our order early on wednesday monring , very fast delivery .
M	on every occasion the staff have been very helpful and the product we have received is of very high_quality .
M	never had bad quality food in my life , chicken quarter pounder look like all the cheap cuts have been put in a blender to make it in to a paste then moulded in to a burger shape .
M	it was tastless and taste resembled pork .
M	tried the bbq ribs that was like chewing plastic .
M	iceland should be closed_down , i would rather eat hospital food .
M	love these_guys .
M	great range of organic products for quite cheap .
M	keep going !!
M	!
M	these_guys are awesome !
M	saved me a fair few_quid on purchasing a nintendo wii last_year .
M	will be using again
M	just stumbled_across this in search of some supplies for an upcoming show .
M	prices beat all and shipping is fast !
M	the service was quick and the game ordered delivered in excellent condition .
M	ordered new filter media and it arrived when stated and in a good condition .
M	the compan also keeps you updated on dispatch , progress of order etc .
M	the delivery is always fast , and the online help knowledgeable and helpful .
M	my 0kg of protein came packaged in a different bag , and they quickly explained why ..
M	inside was the right stuff .
M	great shop with superb customer_service .
M	responded to my every email within a few hours and the sunglasses were delivered within_00hrs with fedex .
M	check out their facebook_page for a discount and to see how active and approachable they are .
M	will shop again .
M	why is amazon using these clows is beyond my comprehension .
M	one of the delivery horrors went like this : i was told that my item would be delivered on monday , and it wasn ' t .
M	on tuesday i call the office of hdnl and ordered for my item to be delivered on wednesday , when my gf had a day of and would be in .
M	they agreed , but the item wasn ' t delivered !
M	my gf wasted a whole day waiting .
M	so i called on thursday asking why , and they said that the item was actually taken from the base today , a day later than agreed !
M	they phone operator couldn ' t tell why but it was .
M	so i gave them another chance - please deliver tomorrow , on friday .
M	they said yes , and again they didn ' t even take from the warehouse on friday .
M	absolutely_shocking , almost farcical and bordering on intentional .
M	i called the office again , and surprise_surprise - the operator again couldn ' t explain_why the driver would not take the item out on the correct day .
M	please amazon , stop using these bunch of incompetent scamsters .
M	being initially comprehensive about a new shop for contact_lenses i rung them up and had a very informative and pleasant chat .
M	i bought my lenses immediately after and they were delivered soon .
M	will be using again .
M	i picked the cheapest delivery option and my item was delivered in 0 days , brilliant .
M	great price too .
M	recommended shop .
M	i thought they were fantastic , best price online for both items ( washing_machine and tumble_dryer ) and on top of that we got a further discount for buying multiple items .
M	a good delivery window rather_than having to wait in all day .
M	also deliver on sundays which is great !
M	highly_recommended !
M	0 pairs of pull - in underwear ordered and arrived the very next_day !
M	awesome underwear and an amazing service .
M	will be back for more when these are dirty !
M	after debating which company to chose to fit my windows , front_door and french doors i decide to get a quote and chat with safe style , i booked in an_appointment for 0pm on a thursday_afternoon , 0pm on the dot that thursday and charming salesman came round and went through everything , and i mean everything , there was no question he could not answer and was not only informative but understanding and helpful .
M	i decided to chose safe style and after locking in my final price , i had booked my fitting date that day .
M	i was kept up to date with everything that was happening and even managed to bring the installation day forward by 0 weeks .
M	on the day of fitting i was told 0 - 0 men would arrive between 0 - 00am , at 0 . 00am they turned_up and went straight to work .
M	all 0 men were friendly and polite and have a very professional work ethic , they went about with the fitting with minimal disturbance and a friendly smile .
M	once all the windows , front_door and french windows were fitted i was given a check over them all before signing off on the job .
M	the finish was stunning !
M	an easy 00 out of 00 , i could not be_happier with them , straight_away on the first night i could feel the difference , my house looks 000x better felt 000x warmer and not only am i very proud to have them fitted but i feel so much more secure and safer at home .
M	i would jump at the chance to recommend safe style to anyone who ' s looking to replace any windows or doors , you would not be_happier with the overall job .
M	total pleasure !
M	to be honest if you get 00 / 00 vision from laser_eye_surgery than brilliant but sadly i did not , though i still have to keep paying for another 0 years on a service that was not completed !
M	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
M	all the staff were amazing and very friendly , sadly though once it was all over and the surgeon said no to a touch up laser i was left in the dark , no options given or offered .
M	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
M	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
M	in my opinion the best best uk game shipper out there .
M	always deliver on time if not earlier .
M	cheap , reliable and trustworthy .
M	over took shop . net in my opinion
M	i don ' t see what everyone ' s problem is .
M	for me they we ' re fantastic .
M	they do exactly_what they say .
M	no hiccups for me .
M	cheap reliable ahd happy overall .
M	seeing as they decreased the cost of the product by over £_00 i am very happy :) it did take a little while for them to respond , but i ' ll put that down to the fact it ' s an australian company ( i ' m british and ordered in what would be the early morning down under ).
M	the site was easy to use , once ordered the company kept me informed of my oder status and the product was fantastic
M	i had no_problems to fing required ferry till i ' ve to the point of cancellation of my booking .
M	for cancellation they charged me £_00 instantly plus lost processing fee and period for refund nearly 0 weeks .
M	direct ferried ok to use it as search_engine but still cheaper to go direct to companies , at_least you are not paying processing fee and sometimes you can find good promotion deals .
M	i ordered a nice bottle of wine to be delivered to a friend as a surprise gift , in baltimore .
M	despite requesting ( as per their delivery instructions ) to send my friend an_email with delivery details , i received an_email_stating that the ordered had been delivered ( 0 weeks after the order ).
M	however , upon_checking the tracking_details , it was signed for by someone completely_different .
M	my friend confirmed that they had not received the wine after i reluctantly asked .
M	so as well as the surprise being ruined , my friend then had to get involved with the dispute with wine . com , who promised to investigate and ring us back .
M	after one week they hadn ' t phoned or emailed either myself or my friend , so i had to chase , where no record was found of the missing item .
M	this has now gone on for over a month ... wine . com are insisting that they need to speak to my friend to verify the address , despite her having spoken to them twice .
M	on top of all of this , they had the audacity to charge me over $_00 subscription fee !!
M	now i can ' t get hold of anyone in customer_services .
M	absolutely_shocking service , the worse i have ever_experienced with any company .
M	avoid them .
M	the best of the best , forget the rest ....
M	we had been struggling with our magento stores for several weeks , with site performance struggling and our server crashing two or three times a day .
M	it affected our business locally as well as widely online .
M	we were originally with simple servers , who couldn ' t get to the bottom of the issue and kept suspending our service , then switched to heart servers with similar results ... all very frustrating .
M	until my brother ( after much research ) found tsohost .
M	after_speaking to their team he was tentatively convinced ( after hearing it all before ) that they could not only get to the bottom of the issue , but optimise the server to ensure optimum performance for our magento stores .
M	their ethos : " part of this customer - focused attitude involves listening to customer comments , suggestions and concerns and acting on these wherever possible "... needless to say , they have stuck to their word and not only delivered , but gone well beyond the call of duty , answering phone_calls up until 00pm and working into the depths of the early hours to not only resolve issues , but implement changes to improve our sites performance .
M	it has without_doubt been the best customer_service i have ever_experienced .
M	i am extremely anal in my own business about delivering the best customer_service possible and must_say the tsohost team have gone well beyond my own expectations .
M	i worked for john_lewis customer_service for six_years and can say that these_guys even top jl for service .
M	don ' t hesitate to use them .
M	thank_you seb , adam , darren , dom and craig ( and the rest of the team ) for your outstanding service .
M	if carlsberg made managed servers ....
M	supplementwarehouse . com is my favorite site to order from .
M	i would recommend this to anyone_looking for supplements .
M	a +++ company !
M	item arrived in a timely_manner .
M	opted for basic delivery and it arrived within 0 days
M	booked a long weekend with this company , the price was the cheapest around , the website was simple to navigate , and customer servis was on the ball .
M	just booking my second trip fantastic .
M	you dont expect big company ' s to give such a personal servis but this one does allways happy to help and very reliable .
M	called bt to talk about my bill , all i got was a woman that could speak hardly any english and didnt understand what information i was asking for
M	could not fault them in any way , they wher easy to use , quick on delivery and good with payment .
M	00 out of 00
M	the prices are great compared to stores .
M	i used to shop certain stores for all my products and now i know what i need i shop 000_% exclusively with supplementwarehouse . com .
M	great job guys !
M	got me the bench designer_glasses offer and they are fantastic value i couldnt even get bog_standard glasses from the opticians anywhere_near the price i paid for these .
M	plus quick delivery and all in perfect order .
M	0 * service .
M	i have ordered some networking tools and was surprised that even the order was placed late in the afternoon they still delivered next_day .
M	can ' t recommend zopa enough .
M	great site .
M	simple to use .
M	great rates .
M	good guys and useful ' my account '.
M	happy days .
M	great idea .
M	saving money for little effort .
M	always happy to help with questions or problems .
M	no_brainer .
M	sign_up .
M	bought some golf shoes for an amazing price and they ' re perfect , have recommended this site to may people as prices are cheap and its legit
M	very helpful and well knowledge about the products they sell .
M	please dont buy from them
M	so many things were wrong with my order it was a joke .
M	firstly , their turn_around time of 0 weeks means nothing i waited 0 weeks for my computer before contacting them - just to be told it would take another week and they hadn ' t even started to build it yet .
M	now 0 weeks had past , i called again ( having to be on hold for about 00_mins at my expense ) just to be told they were still working on it .
M	0 weeks_later i called up and was finally told my pc would be here within 0 days .
M	and sure enough 0 days past with no pc .. 0 days_later however the pc finally arrived .
M	the pc was well_packaged , but that ' s the only positive comment i can make about the whole experience .
M	the hdd wasn ' t properly connected
M	the ram wasn ' t installed .
M	was given the wrong cooling system
M	who ever installed the water_cooling had no clue_what they were doing , which meant i had to take it apart and put it back in properly .
M	their technical_support was useless and made me feel_like i was wasting his time .
M	i gave up calling their technical_support because of having to wait on hold for 00_mins just to get no help .
M	i am never going to use this company again , and i urge you to find another company !
M	you can rely_on xupes any day , the communication is prompt and clear , they are customer oriented .
M	i recommend xupes as an a +++ seller .
M	i bought a new orange ' sidney ' from argos - one problem after another and very poor support - hours on the phone which at one point i was being charged for .
M	basically , the phone number on the message it sent me as the mobile number started with 00 not the uk 00 and somehow this has caused a glitch on their system - they acknowledged it was their fault but it has taken an enormous amount of time to sort this out - and still actually not !
M	passed from one call_centre staff_member to another listening to lengthy ' option ' lists at the end of which you sometimes get cut_off or told to dial another number .
M	frustrating beyond words , i also have a tesco mobile and when i had a problem with that it was one phone call to an english call_centre where they immediately understood what i was talking_about and sorted it at no cost to me .
M	the indian_call_centre staff are polite but it is huge mistake to think any money is being saved when simple queries take multiple calls to sort out because of difficulties with the finer points of language and rather strong accents .
M	i will be sticking to using my tesco mobile as my main phone in future and really could not recommend orange at all .
M	hostelbookers made it easy for us to see exactly where we wanted to go and find places within out budget .
M	excellent
M	i don ' t know the technicalities of why it is so , but three is the worst network when compared to ee ( 0g ), t - mobile ( 0g ) and and vodafone ( 0g ).
M	there is a mast within a mile of our office ( which is a portacabin so hardly some lead - lined fariday cage ) yet i step indoors and lose all connectivity to the outside world - often receiving texts and voicemail notifications several hours_later .
M	it ' s a shame i opted for the 00 month rather_than monthly offering as i ' d be off like a shot .
M	as many people have said , they are great on price , but their service offering leaves a lot to be desired .
M	buying our new bed hasn ' t been the best experience , but the staff at mattressman have done what they can to help .
M	i placed an order for a super king bed_frame and mattress and thought nothing more of it .
M	i received notification that the delivery would be made within a couple of days of placing the order and again thought nothing more .
M	when the order arrived , the driver had a helluva time getting it in the house - to be fair , i think a two man delivery would have struggled with the beast i ' d ordered .
M	as well as the challenge of getting the order in to the property - it turned_out the frame had been damaged in transit .
M	i now had two problems , a damaged order , and after getting home and evaluating the size of the mattress for myself , a mattress that was too big for the house .
M	i called up mattressman to discuss - the issue of the damaged bed was handled swiftly and a courier arranged for the following_day to deliver the spare_parts for the damaged bed_frame .
M	the lady i spoke to ( and i ' m annoyed with myself for forgetting her name ) then set about solving the problem of the massive mattress .
M	she suggested i swap the super king for a " zip and link " mattress but the ones they had on their website were 0 - 0 times the cost of the one i had ( and that wasn ' t cheap ).
M	she offered to speak to the manufacturer ( the british bed company ) to see if they would manufacturer a zip and link mattress for me ( as they didn ' t do them as standard at that time ).
M	i was overjoyed to hear that the british bed company had agreed to make a zip and link mattress for us , and the premium was only an extra £_000 .
M	the courier turned_up today with the new mattress ( es ) and i managed to get them upstairs with no issues - i ' m still_waiting for the courier to return to collect the behemoth sat in my lounge then this stressful ( nothing to do with mattressman ) event will be over .
M	i want to thank the staff at mattressman who went above and beyond to sort out my problem , and also to the british bed company for effectively creating us a custom mattress .
M	edit_: i ' ll write a product review as soon as i get my head down .
M	we bought a leather - style dog bed off amazon in 0000 and only when i needed to replace it did i research the manufacturer .
M	it turns_out that zippyuk are a british manufacturer of products for your pooch and sell direct to the public as well as via other channels such as amazon .
M	one of our dogs recently developed a nervous incontinence condition so ended_up spoiling the bed we ' d originally bought so having found the name of the manufacturer i put in an order for a new bed .
M	i emailed the company for an order update and was told they were in the process of making my order and that it would be despatched soon .
M	to my delight , the order turned_up the very next_day .
M	the contact i ' ve had with zippyuk has been courteous and helpful and the two products i ' ve had from them have been of the highest_quality - all the better knowing they are a british company too .
M	this bed will probably see our dogs out but if not , i wouldn ' t hesitate in using zippyuk again .
M	not much to be said here , ordered some new trainers online and they arrived very within a couple of days .
M	the best companies are the ones who just get your stuff to your door with no_fuss - nike are one such company .
M	many_thanks .
M	i ' m really surprised to read such negative press about a company and it compelled me to post something positive as that ' s our experiece of mothercare .
M	we ordered a load of stuff back in may and opted for " collect at store " delivery .
M	the order was despatched and arrived at the store in about 0 days , collection was easy and that should have been the end of our dealings with mothercare .
M	fast forward two months , mum - to - be unpacks the crib we ' ve bought only to find the leg was snapped .
M	at this point , you start to doubt if the company you bought from would be that bothered seeing as we ' ve had the product for two months ( albeit being in storage ).
M	a quick call to mothercare customer_services ( not sure what all the noise is about finding their telephone_number , it ' s hardly hidden !)
M	and within 0 minutes we ' d been offered a replacement ( a more_expensive one at that as the same model was out of stock ) and had a courier booked to collect the damaged item .
M	the courier turned_up next_day to collect the broken item and a day later the replacement crib arrived .
M	although many may view this as the least they could have done , it was the speed , efficiency and courtesy with which they dealt_with me that left me feeling they had gone above and beyond .
M	it ' s a shame to admit that had i read the reviews before ordering , i might have thought twice , but my experience of mothercare has been a positive one and i wouldn ' t hesitate to use them again .
M	edit_: got home tonight to find my wife had built the crib ... only to find the mattress didn ' t fit ( despite asking and being told it would ).
M	shame but another quick call and the right mattress will be with us on monday .
M	very helpful once more .
M	i looked at many sites when it came to choosing my blinds but based upon on fast they delivered my samples ( within 00_hours of ordering them ) i decided to place my order with made to measure blinds .
M	the site makes it very easy to get the measurements for your blinds correct , and guides you through each_step with ease .
M	there were a vast_array of colours available which i believe can all be ordered as samples for free ( a limit to the number of samples ordered applies which is fair_enough ).
M	we paid about £_00 delivered which was around £_00 cheaper_than most of the other_sites we looked at .
M	the blinds were delivered by city_link within about 0 days of ordering ( i say " about " as they were left with my neighbor who didn ' t come round with them straight_away ).
M	the blinds were well_packaged in a reinforced cardboard container , and packaging material was used where required to protect the blinds during_transit .
M	fitting was extremely easy and everything required was placed in a little plastic_bag .
M	a very pleasurable experience and one which much larger retailers could do with taking note of .
M	thanks for the great service !
M	i have been with netcetera for around 0 years now i find there services second to none , their professionalism is unquestionable
M	their staff are friendly helpful and polite , i have had no_problems with there service or their staff in the entire time i have been with them , no_complains at all , in my opinion i rank them no 0 for their services and staff i would say experts in their field , i would hightly reccomend them to anyone with first_class service and staff available 00 / 0 you cant go_wrong
M	i order my flowers for both my gf and mum weeks_ago .
M	nothing has arrived , no email apart_from order confirmation .
M	have been trying , unsuccessfully to get in touch with them since this morning via live_chat , they have no phone number ... completely in the dark !
M	!
M	i just want to know the tracking_numbers to reassure myself that the flowers will be delivered !
M	never ever again !
M	p . s .
M	it seems their livehelp site has just crashed ...
M	lowest_prices i ' ve ever_seen .
M	even with their shipping and tax you ' re still getting the lowest deal around .
M	plus they have lots of cool free_stuff to go along with your order .
M	can ' t get any better_than that .
M	just a happy customer !
M	after missing the 00_%_off sale for titanfall on origin , i began to look around the interweb for origin_keys to purchase this at a discount and soon finding this nifty little website .
M	i purchased the game happily and now proudly own a copy of titanfall for a slice of what the price now is on origin .
M	thanks for providing this great service !
M	!
M	not had an issues in any of the orders i ' ve placed and always prompt despatch .
M	no_hesitation in recommending .
M	i can ' t explain how refreshing it is to be able to ask for advice and get solid no nonsense answers .
M	i spend a fair amount on supplements every month but i don ' t want to be fleeced .
M	i feel so comfy using echo that it gets my highest praise and a full quota of stars !
M	i also spoke to andrea on the chat service whilst going through the process as i was using them for the first time , she was very helpful and guided me through the whole_process .
M	the total cost was an astonishing £ 0 . 00 cheaper then what royal_mail wanted to charge for a package worth only £_00 . 00 !!!
M	!
M	will_defo let friends and family no about this site cheers :)
M	i was redirected to the hipay site to make the payment for £_00 worth of goods .
M	i have a paypal card ( mastercard ), which i used for completing the order .
M	upon submission it showed me a message_stating that the transaction had been declined .
M	i was then redirected back to the merchant ' s website .
M	i thought i may have entered the wrong details so i tried it again but to no_avail .
M	the same_thing happened , i . e .
M	declined transaction -> redirected back to merchant ' s site .
M	i therefore gave up and used my hsbc visa_debit_card instead .
M	this went through without a hitch .
M	i then checked my email to confirm that the order had gone_through correctly .
M	waiting for me in my inbox were 0 emails from paypal confirming that i had sent 0 payments of £_00 each .
M	therefore i ' ve now made 0 payments of £_00 ( 0 from paypal , 0 from hsbc ).
M	i find it completely_unacceptable that a payment solution such as hipay can ' t even implement a system which correctly identifies when a payment has gone_through .
M	i will now have to waste time reversing the 0 additional payments .
M	i will not be using hipay again .
M	we ' ve been with pipeten for a while now and they have never let us down .
M	server uptime is great but where i personally feel they shine is their outstanding support .
M	each and every time we ' ve had a query they ' ve responded very quickly with helpful answers .
M	would definitely_recommend pipeten to anyone_looking for hosting !
M	i needed to order some costumes for my friends stag_do .
M	i left it a little late so was worried there maybe a risk of not receiving the package on time .
M	luckily i found escapade .
M	their prices were competitive and they shipped the item very fast !
M	thank_you escapade !
M	riga was a great place for a stag .
M	party on wayne .

M	product was good and cheap
M	delivery was fast and on time
M	i ordered a wing collar shirt with next_day delivery - duly arrived the next_day in good time for the bash .
M	very nice comfortable shirt it is too .
M	from placing the order to receiving the goods , it was really slick and very easy .
M	customer_service : rang up 0 times on separate_occasions and each time had a different employee on the other and but always they were very rude , blunt and uninformative of any information i was asking
M	pricing , the prices i found were ridiculous , i went to other sources and found higher specification parts with a cheaper price_tag
M	smoothness , i thought to my self , i may as well give the order a go so i ordered some components for a friend , they took 0 weeks to get here , it said 00 in stock , get an_email 0 days_later saying it is not in stock and they said they would issue a refund , i accepted the refund but it never showed up , lone behold 0 weeks , 0 days_later the components arrived , but not only very late , they were faulty !
M	very upset with service and would not go near this website
M	where to begin , order went through very smoothly , got an_email the next_day around 0am ( basically starting time ) saying my order is on its way to the courier , so postage was insanely fast considering i didn ' t pay a penny .
M	customer communication is fabulous , they work very well within the customer_service department and have such a friendly service .
M	great unbeatable_prices , everything i wanted i could get on here but around 00 - 00 gbp cheaper .
M	so to sum it all up , the company is amazing and do not listen to other reviews !
M	no issues .
M	good , easy online system .
M	helpful email_updates about dispatch and delivery .
M	according to recipient the flowers were well_packaged and " really beautifull ".
M	would recommend to all .
M	we all had a really good time in the places that had been organised for us , and we had no trouble in contacting chillisauce on the day for questions .
M	hotel was even better_than expectations for the price with a lovely breakfast , quadding was amazing , night life had good choice of venues , never laughed so much in my life !
M	this was for my mates_stag , i would definately consider chillisauce in the future !
M	i had not heard of this website before but found them on google when searching for the best price on the headphone cable i needed .

M	emma was a great help , couldnt have done it without her !
M	great spot for nutritional_needs !
M	!
M	samantha has been amazing , i have been trying to book a courier to brazil for days !
M	one agent couldn ' t help me yesterday , samantha talked me through each_step , she has easily been the best agent i have spoken to on here , it now makes my decision clear !!
M	i will always use parcel0go for all my couriers just because of samantha !!!
M	!
M	gave great customer_service and offered the best price
M	great price , definitely the best value for money .
M	the cookies and cream flavour tastes great too .

M	highly_recommend their service .
M	i give you 0 gold stars !

M	we receive over 00_% of our new business through our website .
M	we have made a return on our investment hundreds if not thousands of times over since we launched our new website .
M	i had a few questions about parcel delivery prices .
M	i used livechat service and was connected to jessica .
M	she was very polite and patient .
M	jessica answered on all my questions with every detail i needed .
M	having such a great service i am sure that i will place an order soon .
M	i have just visited kwik_fit stevenage and recieved absolutely fantastic service .
M	the team fitted me in at very short_notice and on a bank_holiday .
M	they have saved me a large_amount of hassle .
M	the team were not only helpful , but also incredibly friendly .
M	the manager michael cooper was fantastic , and i will be sure to send any of my friends to him and the team at kwik_fit " stevo "
M	many_thanks ,
M	sincerely ,
M	one satisfied customer
M	we arrived in las palmas airport about 00_minutes earlier_than_expected , so i rang the central number and they rang the driver to arrive earlier for us .
M	we had the same driver both ways , he was very friendly and helpful and the car was immaculate .
M	this took a lot of hassle out of our journeys and was good that we had paid in_advance .
M	i would recommend the service to anyone , it was quick and easy and i liked the updates to my phone and email of the flowers progress .
M	i couldn ' t believe_how easy this service was to use , fully working iphone_0s couldn ' t ask for anything better , put new sim in and automatically unlocked , thanks guys !
M	supplement_warehouse is the one stop_shop i love it .
M	leisure car_rental not only provided possibly the most competitive rate but they met us with the car at the airport and were happy to let us drop it off in marigot - what service !
M	in addition , the car was nearly new , immaculately clean , and easy to drive for someone unfamiliar with the roads .
M	i would absolutely recommend leisure car_rental to any visitor to st . maarten .
M	absolute just as its state on orange website , really fast service , money straight into your account within 0 days , spot on with communication via_email , really impress , thank_you team orange you are just doing a great work , highly_recommended and its a 0 star from me .
M	ordered hampers from iflorist / ihamper for christmas_presents .
M	hampers were meant to be delivered on 00rd_december .
M	didn ' t turn_up .
M	called on 00th was assured they would be delivered that day .
M	they didn ' t !
M	i then had to rush out to buy more presents !
M	which is not what i wanted to do on christmas_eve !
M	when the office finially reopened i was told they had to do an investigation with the courier !
M	i called multiple_times a weeks for over a month being fobbed_off time and time again !
M	i have finially been told the item had been delivered so i wouldn ' t get a refund !
M	i didn ' t recieve the items and am over £_000 out of pocket !
M	don ' t think it should be me out of pocket due to a delivery driver taking it to the wrong place !
M	customer_service is shocking !
M	never any one in charge to talk to when you call up and they have put the phone down on me multiple_times !
M	awful company !
M	will be sending letters to paper , watchdog , etc , anyone who will listen !
M	i had not heard of ballicom before using them recently to purchase my new asus sabertooth z00 motherboard but my first experience was a good one .
M	they had the lowest_price for this motherboard by_far , and included free 00 hour delivery through parcelforce .
M	i placed my order late on a sunday_night , it was dispatched monday_morning and arrived tuesday , you can ' t complain_about that .
M	it was well_packaged , product in good condition .
M	i cannot review the returns_procedure as i have not used this .
M	thank_you ballicom , i will use you again .
M	i orderd a silent night orthepedic mattress from this company , i ordered late at night so knew it wouldnt come the very next_day and so it was delivered 0 days after ordering .
M	the delivery men were very friendly , the mattress plastic packaging was slightly_damaged but only as you would expect having been transported to and from vehicles .
M	very pleased and will_definitely use again .
M	fast postage and the item exactly as listed .
M	i didn ' t have any of the problems listed here .
M	i bought a rockband midi adapter and had it within a few_days .
M	excelwmt website , easy to find what i was looking for .
M	even_though i wanted very specific set_up found it very easy to order .
M	price matched on anything i wanted .
M	correspondence from the company to let me know exactly when i ' d receive my goods , as had to be ordered in from manufacture was top_class .
M	would highly_recommend to anyone and will_defiantly be using to buy from in the future .
M	bought a powerkaddy freeway digital + late sat night .
M	their price was the best i found online , by at_least £_00 , i also found a discount_code online for an extra 0 . 0 %_off .
M	even_though it snowed constantly sat and sun it was due to arrive first thing tues morning .
M	however this was inconvenient for me so they rearranged it for first thing wed morn , within an_hour delivery slot !
M	snaiton golf centre will be my first choice when buying golf equipment in the future .
M	can ' t speak highly_enough of them !,
M	tesco mobile network customer_services is really crap . i have been with them for full year and gone_through hell of loads problems .
M	0 ) the calls were being drooped whilst on a call
M	0 ) signals keep disappearing , say no signal and very poor reception
M	0 ) phone provided kept freezing while ending calls
M	0 ) phone was not allowing me to attend calls on certain occasions
M	0 ) i used to receive text_messages with delay for example , after one or two days
M	0 ) i used to receive voice - messages after one or two days delay
M	0 ) on certain days there was no signal all day
M	0 ) i was not informed by tesco that they do not support call waiting
M	0 ) i was also informed after questioning i have a restricted data package to 0gb when i was first informed it was an unlimited_internet package
M	00 ) i was advised wrong information on customer_services on many occasions
M	00 ) i was advised that i can upgrade to unlimited package at any stage of my contract but later was not allowed
M	i wrote them in detailed complaint about the the issue no one wrote back i am taking them to ombudsman as they do not know what they are doing to be honest . i will never recommend any one tesco mobile go for some one well_known in the market like vodafone etc than tesco mobile which claimed to be paired up with o0 but there service not same as o0 .
M	i love nevada because they are good value , great quality goods ; they are always delivered quickly and unharmed .
M	great store !
M	second time using mazuma and still no hitches posted phone on friday payment has been made today
M	i ' ve used outdoor_kit several_times over the last 00 - months , and every time i ' ve found their pricing to be very competitive , especially when they ' ve got one of their 00_% sales on !
M	delivery has always been very swift , with no_problems at all .
M	would highly_recommend to anyone_looking to use them .
M	ordered table and 0 chairs on a 0 day delivery , have confirmation by email of the delivery address .
M	first day they attempted to deliver to somewhere 00 miles_away , second day delivery was of the table and a roll of material which wasnt ordered and the chairs were delivered to lockerbie almost 000_miles_away .. many phone_calls , days off work and still no resolution .
M	office furniture online do not like sending you the goods you have bought and paid for so far sent to two wrong addresses , still not received and wont refund .. disgusting company with the most apalling customer_service when something_goes_wrong .
M	it is now two days since my order should have been delivered , paid £_00 for a day of choice delivery and arranged someone to be present - no sign of order and numerous_attempts at contacting this company have failed .
M	after sales care just cuts of , no message .. spoke to sales_team who were uninterested , did not care and downright rude .
M	will never use this company again and now have to claim the money back from my credit_card company .
M	all promises kept , half the price of others , great quality product .
M	great service fantastic prices il use website all the time now
M	i am very pleased with the goods i have purchased from littlewoods and quality and service are excellant
M	i have used the protein_works on numerous_occasions and have referred my friends and clients to the protein_works supplements .
M	their pricing , product range , quality , delivery and customer_service is absolutely awesome , any_problems i have had in the past have been delt with quickly and efficiently .
M	i have every faith this company for its outstanding trusted service and product quality .
M	keep up the good work guys
M	the equipment , technology , game zones , tactics , simulations and training is all years ahead of its time .
M	ive been attending for a few_years and not once have i ever played the same way as another visit .
M	the staff are skilled and tutored in wargaming and most_importantly health and safety better_than any other field in the uk ( trust me ive been to all of them )
M	the added_bonus that these_guys utilise working military vehicles in some games , plus ive had the chance to ride in a tank and a usmc humvee during my games day ..... no where else will you ever get that !
M	value for money is their key and you get it when you look at what they do and what you get and the stuff they have is beyond anything_else anywhere_else .
M	they have been used for cod games launches in london year after year , work with ubisoft , work with film and tv_shows , also not to mention bodyguard training companies , ex - special forces on staff and the owner dave is approachable and down to earth and has always gone above and beyond to help me out if ive had a problem .
M	if you haven ' t been to warfighters your missing out on a real_life war experience ... ive got tons of storeys to tell in the pub !
M	trustpilot please_note :
M	some idiot reported this post as fake so please look up my order number from my corporate bonding day .
M	please dont let gremlins take over trustpilot .
M	order number : ws000 - 0000
M	great prices , great range of products , great postage speed , well_packaged and a free gift ... its why i returned again
M	with price_matching and fast_shipping this supplier can ' t be beat !
M	you can match the price so you don ' t have to order from 0 different places to get the deals you are looking for .
M	the shipping price isn ' t bad once you add up all of the shipping prices you would have spent ordering from multiple suppliers .
M	easy ordering_process , no apparent hitches with the payment process and fast delivery of the correct items .
M	you give them money and they send you whiskey .
M	seems too good to be true , i know !
M	quick , well_packaged delivery .
M	they deliver whisky to your house .
M	it is wonderful .
M	so i ' ve only used bananafingers a couple of times , but the items have been delivered very quickly and exactly to spec .
M	i ' ll be using them for any climbing related stuff for the foreseeable_future .
M	excellent service .
M	i have used the book_depository for several years now and have been constantly and happily impressed by their response time , book range and service .
M	the range is truly outstanding , covering almost every book i have ever considered buying ( the only exception i have found is a rather old , quite obscure academic book that is out of print ).
M	the service is swift and precise and i have always received my books in a timely_fashion .
M	especially good given the free delivery .
M	excellent service , good site .
M	no cons from my perspective .
M	i must mimic the notes of all the previous reviewers on here - the money was taken from my account and two_weeks_later no item has been delivered .
M	i must_say i wish i had checked for reviews such as these before confirming the order .
M	complete cowboys who have simply taken the money with no apparent intention to deliver .
M	order from a reputable retailer .
M	i haven ' t ordered anything from gear0music before and was a little_bit_dubious_about ordering due to normally only ordering from sites which friends recommend .
M	how wrong i was .
M	excellent communication , extremely fast delivery ( ordered item monday_afternoon and it was on my doorstep 0 . 00am tuesday ) and exceptionally well_packaged item .
M	will_definitely be recommending to everyone !
M	a *
M	well impressed with mazuma , sent my phone monday , they recieved it tuesday .
M	checked it was working and sent my cheque late that day and i recieved it wednesday .
M	top_class work , well impressed .
M	cheers
M	mazooma
M	shopto far exceed the standards of any other online_retailer .
M	without_fail i have recieved my games within 00_hours of clicking order !
M	and if the quick service isnt enough , they are also able to charge around 00 - 00_% less_than your typical computer game retailer .
M	pointed to them last_year , and never looked back !
M	terrific service all_round and will be continuing this relationship for many years to come !
M	cheapest price i could find .
M	excellent delivery and packaging .
M	received the order the next_day .
M	will definitley use again .
M	very happy with the service .
M	my tele got delivered in 00_hours
M	the order arrived fast and efficiently , was exactly as_described and was extremely good value .
M	would definitely buy from box again .
M	i picked_up two copies of saints_row : the third for less_than £_00 .
M	i chose to have the steam_keys instead of actual hard copies .
M	only an_hour after making my purchase i received an_email with scans of the keys , all ready to be entered into steam and redeemed .
M	great stuff , and a good vendor =).
M	sent my phone into them perfectly_fine .
M	they send it back saying its faulty .
M	check my phone and the screen is completely damaged .
M	no compensation or anything .
M	joke of a company .
M	avoid
M	i ordered a korg pitchblack tuner for a fairly reasonable_price .
M	the minimum delivery charge was £ 0 . 00 which isn ' t so cheap but it arrived two days_later ( one day after dispatch ) so it was money well spent i guess .
M	i was very happy with the service , i would gladly recommend them .
M	i need to remember to write_reviews for good companies as well as bad , and this is one company i would definitely use again .
M	postage was uncannily fast , and the prices are always competitive .
M	great store for your music purchases .
M	can only recommend with 0_stars .
M	i am sure if you have no_problems with this company , a good cheap holiday can be found .
M	but if you ever have to deal with their customer_service , you will regret it beyond_belief .
M	due to the country our holiday was being booked in being declared unsafe we called expedia to find out what would happen to our holiday .
M	we were told we could cancel it outright but only in 0 weeks .
M	- 0 weeks_later we called , and they said we had to call back again in 0 weeks .
M	- 0 weeks_later we called back again , and we said we need a refund urgently as we can not go to our holiday destination as it is not allowed by government , can not get insurance and there are no planes flying there .
M	we were than lied to .
M	expedia told us that the planes were flying there from our airport , and that we can get insurance through allianz ( which is funnily_enough our insurance company , so i knew it was a lie ).
M	they asked my wife to pay €_000 there and then for complete insurance inc cancellation .
M	i had my doubts so advised her to wait_until we spoke with our insurance man .
M	he confirmed our fears that we wouldn ' t be insured for medical in the country we would be going to .
M	we contacted the plane company to find that they were not flying to the country of our destination .
M	the only way their was by indirect flights through other countries ( which we had paid for a direct flights )
M	we called back again to point this out and ask for a full_refund .
M	we were told that we would be getting a full_refund on the phone .
M	an_email 00_minutes later was sent to us , confirming that we would have a full_refund , but would have to call them to confirm this .
M	we called the same day , and it was agreed that we would be getting a full_refund , and that all the details would be in the post .
M	0 weeks_later we still had received nothing , so we called expedia .
M	they advised us that our holiday was not cancelled and was still valid and that a system error must have occurred .
M	we were assured that it would be cancelled and a full_refund given .
M	we asked to be given an_email to confirm that within 00_hours .
M	they agreed to do that .
M	0 week_later , no email or contact .
M	we contact expedia again ( after waiting 00_minutes on the phone !!!)
M	to be told that flights should be re - opened for august and so that there is no refund available .
M	the plane company is still showing no flights to the destination , and i have confirmed with the airport that there is none .
M	this company is the biggest bunch of liars and you are ever likely to find , and if i had the time or energy i would take them to court for their contempt for law and in trading practices .
M	you have been warned by many other people on trustpilot ( check out expedia . com or expedia . co . uk reviews as well ).
M	this company is a scam company that hopefully will not be around for much longer .
M	this company accepts credit_card ( and charges a small surcharge for the pleasure ) but breaks every credit_cards rule in dealing_with them .
M	i paid for the product , and it was shipped very quickly ( at first this was going to be a 0 * review , despite the item being faulty ).
M	the item sent was faulty , but also the quality of the product was below expectation so i decided to get a refund rather_than a replacement .
M	the company agreed with the fault of the product ( it had a manufacturing defect ) but would not refund my credit_card i had paid to use .
M	instead they would only refund to my english account ( despite then picking_up transnational charges , exchange charges meaning i got less money ).
M	such a method is against mastercard ( how i paid ) rules , as well as all other major credit_card companies .
M	i was advised strongly by my bank not to hand my details over to this company , and they insisted this company was acting either negligently or fraudulently .
M	i emailed get . digitial multiple_times with my bank ' s response , and each time they said ' reversing credit_card transactions is impossible ' which is 000_% a lie as made clear by my bank .
M	in the end my credit_card company reversed the credit_card transaction which was a hassle that wasn ' t needed .
M	not worth your time , buy from amazon or another similar company with infinitely better customer_service .
M	said the item would take 0 - 0 weeks on website and phone , arrived in just 0 .
M	best price for said item ... what more can i say !
M	after messing_around with a lot of other charlatans in germany , this company proved to be refreshing .
M	danke shoen
M	fast postage , great service , bought a few items already from the . de site , and as usual , everything is perfect .
M	an asset to the online community .
M	prices aren ' t the cheapest ( although much cheaper then high - street prices ) but the service and aftersales is worth it in my opinion !
M	bought a kenwood fp000 blender , 0 - 0 days delivery .
M	00_hours after purchasing the item i looked online ( as i had not received a delivery message ) and the item was showing as 00 weeks till delivery for new purchases .
M	i tried_calling this site ( but the phone line directs you to email contact only !!!)
M	i emailed besserepreise saying will it be 00 weeks ?
M	if so please cancel my order and refund immediately .
M	the email was answered over 00_hours_later , stating that the item would not be available to me on time and that i would be refunded immediately .
M	payment was made via_paypal as company had no credit_card or debit_card system ( bank_transfers only or paypal ) paypal refunds are instant , and no refund was made today .
M	this company ' s invoice did not show :
M	delivery time originally stated
M	delivery time expected etc
M	also the company made no attempt to contact me with a problem with this delivery .
M	will never use again , and will advise strongly against to anyone_looking to buy from this place .
M	i ' m sure the money will be refunded , if not i will add to this review and inform paypal of a fraudulent sale .
M	took my new watch to them to have a couple of links taken out .
M	came back later and took the watch .
M	on my way home i noticed they had scratched it in a couple of places ( nothing to bad , but it was an expensive and new watch !)
M	when i put it on at home i realised they had only taken the links of one side of the watch so it was unbalanced .
M	i called up , and the guy said on the phone that he had taken them off equally on each side ...... even_though i was holding the watch right there in my hand !
M	i said to him i have the proof right here that you didnt , but he wouldnt accept it .
M	after a little argument he said he would look at it again .
M	i shouldnt have given it back to them , after the scratces etc , but it was more out of principle to be honest as id paid £ 0 to have a quick and easy service to be done , and they had completly ballsed it up !
M	in the end the watch was sorted but at the cost of another small scuff on the face of the watch !!!
M	!
M	would never use again , and if i had the time and energy would have taken them to small_claims court for damage of property while under their care !
M	you have been warned , dont give them your watch !
M	maybe their shoe repairs and key cutting service is better ..... i dont know .
M	lufthansa always offer a slection of papers for free ( every flight ) unlike_other airlines , and ive always found the staff curtious and the flights trouble free .
M	the prices are very reasonable .
M	quick dispatch , no_probs !
M	this is the company that actually may havemade me midly xenophobic against indian_call workers !
M	after calling up about a problem with one of my bills , i ended_up talking to an indian who was telling_me lies and not listening to my problem .
M	even after telling him 00 times , he kept on reading from a script or repeating the same_thing .
M	in the end i was passed to another person .
M	this person was either taking the mic with me , or had the strongest accent ive eveer heard .
M	i didnt understand a word he was saying ( sounded_like facejacker ).
M	i lived in thailand for 0 years , im used to strong accents , which makes me think he was just fooling me .
M	after 0 minutes of saying " pardon ?
M	i dont understand you " i hung_up , and recalled to speak to someone_else .
M	the person who answerd was again indian , in an indian_call_centre .
M	he was clearly watching_tv , and every 0 seconds there was either canned laughter blurting down the phone ( or maybe genuine laughter from the office workers watching a tbv program ??.)
M	the guy was not interested or following anything i was saying , so i assume he was watching_tv ( it was very very loud , so must have been on his desk or bery close ).
M	i hung_up after 00_minutes ( after waiting 00_mins to be put through in the first place .
M	i then called customer complaints to complain_about the lack of english , understanding , the tv , etc etc .
M	guess where the complaints line goes too ?
M	india ......
M	the person i spoke to sounded exactly like one of the people i was speaking to earlier .
M	after 0 minutes of strong accent i gave up .
M	i have asian friends , from all over the continent , so im not complaining becuase of racial issus , i couldnt care who anwers my call as long as its done professionally .
M	but to have people who cant be understood , people watching_tv instead of listening to you , monkeys with scripts rather then intelligent autonomous people is just a joke .
M	but the icing really is your complaints ... complaints should be english people ... complaints should not be some poor muppet in india with a script that can barely_speak the language , it should be a well versed uk person who understands the situation and can deal with each case on an indivual basis .
M	bt is the worst support ever , period , and i was almost in a rage by the time i had finished with this waste of around 0 hours of phone_calls .
M	if what i experianced is normal for the company there really should be an inquest !
M	not being_able to speak to someone who i can understand , who speaks my own language to deal with my problems for a telecoms monopoly would be illegal no doubt .
M	can ' t wait_until this company changes or bites the dust as it slowly looses its monopoly grip on our telecoms .
M	shame on you bt !!!!
M	!
M	got my summer wheels sorted out , great service ;-)
M	stuff arrived bang on time , great item , great communication by the people working there , very satisfied in deed
M	firstly , i am lactose intollerent so brought their muscle_milk which was advertisedsquire clearly as lactose free , affter waiting in all day it arrived and there was no mention on the packaging of it being lactose free like there was on the picture so to be sure i called them and they said ' oh that flavour isn ' t lactose free but some others are !'
M	when i questioned why it was advertised so they didn ' t explain just said sorry and they would send me a new one that was and some " samples " of other lactose free products and i would recieve them the next_day .
M	i waited in the following_day againtwo days_later the protein arrived .... on its own !!
M	i just ignored it and put it down to a bad company .
M	then whilst away i asked my fiancé to order me some protein , unaware of the company i had problems with she ordered from dolphin_fitness .
M	paid extra for next_day delivery and waitied in for it to be delivered .
M	she then called them to see if there was a rough time it would be in as it was the afternoon and nothing had come , the woman on the phone said ' oh_yeah there ' s non of that flavour left , would u like something else and we can get it to you tomorrow ?'
M	they couldn ' t give a crap about you , they just care about the money they are making , if you question anything they don ' t have the answers and if you complain they couldn ' t give a hoot !
M	i would never use this company again !
M	thank_you very much for the fast factory_unlock ( o0 uk premium ) keep up the good work !
M	i ordered two items for christmas on the 00th of december and they arrived within plenty of time .
M	really couldn ' t ask for more .
M	:-)
M	i like shopping
M	this is now more_than 0 years i ' m using amazon , and i must_admit i never had anything to complain_about : to me , they are the more trustfull online company i know .
M	if you havent tried it yet : do not hesitate !
M	i ordered a tent from them with two other small items , and received shortly_after a confirmation saying that : " in the unlikely event that any item you have ordered is temporarily out of stock we will ship the available items to you and the outstanding items asap ."
M	after 0 weeks i hadn ' t received the tent yet .
M	i had to call them and someone told me that " the tent was out of stock and they forget to tell me about it ".
M	they added i could chose an other tent from their site as a replacement .
M	the thing is : the tent i was in the first place interested , in was apparently available on their site again , but at a different price : higher_than the one i agreed for on my order .
M	i explained the situation through the phone to someone who after not beeing very comprehensive , told me she will call me later in the day to tell me what to do : i never get this call back !
M	i had to call them again 0 days_later , and they couldn ' t yet give me an answer by phone !
M	finally , i got a mail saying i will not get my tent for the price i was suppose to pay , and if i really want it , ( because they had it !)
M	i will have to pay something like 00 £ more !
M	so in the end : i ' ve wasted much time with this people who are unable to comminicate quickly and whose way to sell thing is just disrespectful of any commitment .
M	be really carefull with this company !
M	i was a little_sceptical about buying contact online but i needn ' t have been , i simply chose the lenses i wanted , for my prescription and it was as simple as that .
M	their prices were cheaper_than my local_optician and they came 0 days after i ordered , will be using again !
M	great website , awesome product , very fast delivery , and a lollipop thrown in too !
M	i would recommend to all my friends
M	fantastic website !
M	no issues from chilli_sauce , put_together a good itenary , communication was spot on .
M	thanks
M	hostelbookers is one of the easiest ways to find great deals on hostels all over the world .
M	easy shopping and purchase experience .
M	you can book with confidence knowing that you have most_likely gotten the best deal with all of the appropriate information to make an informed_decision .
M	i have ordered yamaha hs - 00m speakers , they arrived very quickly .
M	speakers are perfect , smooth communication with guitarguitar , they are very friendly and helpful .
M	definately recommended to everybody .
M	had some posters needed done very quickly .
M	i had no_idea about design but the team at printing . com sorted it out in double quick time .
M	cant thank andy & amp ; his guys enough - they were more_than helpful and left me with a really professional poster which was truly great value .
M	a company well worth sorting all your printing_needs and the prices are so reasonable .
M	thank_you again .
M	ziip gaming store has been one of the my biggest guilty secrets in gaming ever since they started .
M	whenever i have wanted a game but not liked it ' s price_tag by the original retailer .
M	i just pop down to ziip . co . uk and check if it ' s in stock and if it ' s cheaper .
M	i always find out that it is cheaper and making the purchase is as easy as just buying the game on steam .
M	thank_you ziip games store for being in us gamers ' lives .
M	all the prices are already low , but if you do find it cheaper they match the price and take 0 %_off no questions_asked .
M	what an amazing company !
M	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day for my partner .
M	when i initially purchased them i recieved confirmation stating the flowers would be with her on the 00th feburary .
M	this was not the case at all !!!
M	the flowers came today ( 00th ) at around 0 . 00pm , when she had already left !
M	after waiting till_0pm on valentines evening i then had to go to a local_supermarket and purchase a bunch of flowers which i should not have had to do at all .
M	plus , considering the time i had to go , as you can imagine these were the left overs that nobody else wanted .
M	the payment of £_00 . 00 was already taken from iflorist and the time and date that their payment was agreed for was not met .
M	this is an_absolute let_down for both my partner and myself .
M	especially with her travelling back to university today .
M	she did not and will not even get to see the flowers .
M	i have sent an_email to support stating my issue and have still had no response as of yet .
M	i have also logged an online ticket and i am still_waiting to hear back .
M	i expect a full_refund .
M	my key was with me instantly and worked hassle_free , this is one of just many_times i ' ve used the site now and it never lets me down , i ' ll be back once again for anymore keys i need in the future =]
M	i love this place .
M	they always have the latest products at the cheapest prices .
M	most of the time even before they price_match .
M	true shipping can get pricy , but i will pay for good service and great products .
M	booked a room through olotels for a stay in london ( reservation number 0000000 ).
M	the booking was non_refundable .
M	at the time of travel , i feel ill . understanding the hotel was non_refundable - i contacted the hotel directly to ask if they would be willing to allow the agency ( olotels ) to move the reservation without penalty .
M	the hotel were fair , and agreed they would allow olotels to move the reservation to a future date free of charge .
M	i was delighted .
M	i sent olotels an_email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
M	the hotel wanted olotels to formally request the change in an_email , and they would agree to it .
M	i sent 0 emails chasing this up , each time i got an_email_saying ' we will update you shortly '.
M	one time i even called and the agent said she would call back in 00_minutes - and didnt !
M	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an_email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
M	what a fiasco !
M	when will it end ?
M	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
M	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone call .
M	so angry .
M	i would avoid them .
M	**** update 00th_december_0000 ****
M	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
M	if they acted upon what the hotel offered ( to move the full reservation ) i would not have lost out on one night .
M	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
M	i feel as though the frontline customer care let olotels down .
M	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
M	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
M	booked twice with alpha_rooms , both_times the hotel has become unavailable after a day or so .
M	the most_recent booking the hotel showed ' immediate availability ' and turns_out this is not the case .
M	they operate a premium_rate customer care line and do not have adequate resource to handle the calls .
M	this is an inappropriate way to generate revenue .
M	there is always a wait when you call .
M	their agent '[ private data_removed ]' was monotone and dry .
M	he showed no basic customer care skills
M	alpharooms website showed immediate availability .
M	when the booking confirmed it simply said ' your booking is not confirmed until your bank approve payment '.
M	no warning to say the reservation was on a request only basis .
M	this is the second time alpharooms has done this to me
M	alpharooms agent [_private data_removed_], and business process , expect a customer to send various emails to get a fair price for alternative_accommodation .
M	alpharooms do not empower an agent to resolve this there and then ( the alternative_accommodation offered was offered at the same price - even_though it was a cheaper property !)
M	[_private data_removed_] tried to pass me to a manager and couldn ' t , he asked me to ' keep calling to try to catch one '.
M	this is such a shady business practice expecting me to call a premium number repeatedly when trying to give them over £_000_+ revenue
M	[_private data_removed_] promised to refund the payment and didn ' t
M	i had to call again to chase a refund that was never processed
M	i have to send this email to request a refund .
M	if this was the case , why was i not told in the first place .
M	i used to love alpharooms - always managed to get amazing prices .
M	after this i strongly doubt i will use them again .
M	shame - because they seem to have good reviews on here .
M	update - just called them today to see where my refund was ( after sending the lengthy email to them as instructed ) and guess_what - it wasn ' t processed .
M	shocking service from a shocking company ***
M	reference efxrrkr
M	*** sorry but not , everything is not sorted now .
M	your complaints team have not even acknowledged my email let_alone replied .
M	***
M	much_better_than insuring with the network direct ( similar policy for around half the price ).
M	easy to buy .
M	perfect !
M	very good choice of products at very competitive_prices .
M	delivery was fast and free !
M	also got a free_sample of usn whey which i wasnt expecting so that was nice surprise !
M	highly_recommend .
M	i am so glad i chose to order some supplements from echo !
M	for a start the deal they were offering on the product i wanted was excellent , i couldn ' t find a better price online .
M	there was a slight problem with the delivery but this was my fault for putting in a bad address when ordering .
M	a guy from echo phoned me up to explain the problem and was very helpful and made sure everything was sorted .
M	my order then arrived the next_day !
M	also received a sample packet of biox whey for free which i wasn ' t expecting !
M	cant recommend them enough !
M	i phoned up to get advice for a new treadmill i wanted to buy for my home .
M	the staff were really helpful and gave me great advice .
M	the payment process was quick and easy and i ' ve started burning calories on my brand_new treadmill .
M	thanks new level !
M	thanks for your continued reliable service .
M	since i have not been driving , i have used your online service and never had a problem .
M	food is always fresh and to a good standard .
M	thanks asda .
M	thanks jones & son for your great bird spikes product .
M	birds were nesting on my roof for months and the steel spikes have stopped them nesting or trying to return to my roof .
M	the strips are great value for money - would highly_recommend to friends or businesses that need the bird spikes solution !
M	many_thanks !
M	very professional , so happy to have switched supplement providers .
M	prompt and reliable with competitive price .
M	i would love to give this company 0_stars .
M	however their choice of delivery partner is dismal .
M	0 orders and 0 problems with yodel and myprotein customers services seem be happy to brush this off as not there problem once order has left them .
M	it seems customer_service and valuing business needs to be improved
M	great selection of parts and i found exactly_what i was after within_seconds at a great price !
M	great service until you don ' t meet the minimum_spend criteria as an account holder .
M	we were penalised around £_000 in one invoice .
M	great service for receiving and sending parcels but avoid_avoid_avoid setting_up a business account unless you are absolutely certain you will meet the minimum_spend criteria !
M	if you ' re looking to get your glasses in a timely_manner , and actually have contact with the customer_service department when you call , the speckyfoureyes is definitely not worth looking at .
M	i placed my order over 0 and a half weeks_ago , and still i am waiting .
M	also , i have contacted the number of their website , which seems to be directed to a satellite office where you ' re told that someone will call you back , which is a joke .
M	i contacted them around 0 times , and they only managed to contact me once , via text_message , talk about a personal_touch !
M	!
M	next time i order glasses , i ' ll be sure never to consider them again .
M	great service .
M	have used regularly for 0 years .
M	very convenient , friendly and well_priced .
M	definitely_recommend .
M	we were fed_up with using some of the aggregators out there and so we entered into a working relationship with txtnation .
M	it was the best decision i made to use txtnation .
M	they are very helpful when dealing_with issues or setting_up new connections .
M	they will_continue to get my business going forward and i will not have any problem referring them to anyone .
M	after a long time of using my iphone as an ipod now it is ringing again really thank_you and i recommend it for all .
M	have used these_guys many_times , and have had absolutely nothing but praise for them .
M	i have recently ordered t -_shirts in the wrong_size , and also got a mug with a hairline crack along the bottom , causing it to leak droplets of water , but within 00mins of emailing , i received a response .
M	they even sent out a replacement mug and told me to the keep the old one , and also the same for one of the t -_shirts i had bought - that ' s £_00 they saved me , and for absolutely no need , i would have happily returned it .
M	amazing , will recommend !
M	great prices , with the debit_card reduction it ' s a good overall price .
M	delivery was only 0 or 0 working_days , best i could ask for seeing as i went for free delivery !
M	i ' m sure the ' very good ' reviews on here are fake , half of them cant type in english but they claim they are from newcastle etc !
M	we bought 0 bottles of persume and they took payment through paypal , but we didnt even get an order confirmation , no reply to emails , nothing .
M	currently hoping toget money back from paypal .

M	i purchased serious sam : bfe cd_key , for £_00 . 00 and it ' s already been used , avoid this company
M	when i first started dealing_with the company i had a bad_experience but this wasn ' t their fault .
M	every other time i have ordered has been fantastic i couldn ' t recommend them enough .
M	i purchased a drift hd stealth at the end of last_year .
M	it developed a fault .
M	after some internet research i found out this was a common problem .
M	i contacted lemon digital though ebay and wih in a week a replacement is on its way and should be with me tomorrow .
M	that ' s just 0 days since i first made contact .
M	i was dealing_with dan who gave great service .
M	great products great price !
M	the goods were with us pretty quickly and no_complaints with the product , we will be using gbics . com again !

M	printerland never let you down ; they are always friendly and helpful .
M	without_fail , they always have what you need in stock and delivery is consistently fast and reliable .
M	they also offer good value for money and boast a very wide_selection of products so you can source all of your printing_needs from just the one place .
M	i would recommend printerland to anyone .
M	i ' ve ordered on several_occasions from tshirt_studio now and they ' ve never let me down .
M	the quality of goods is superb , the price is excellent and the delivery is always speedy !
M	( even on the free delivery !
M	).
M	if you need custom things - this is the place to get them from !
M	absolute_joke , snails deliver fast .
M	never get the games you want !
M	avoid !
M	treated my girlfriend like dirt and smirked at her asking questions .
M	talking too her like she was dumb because she was female .
M	avoid kids .
M	took an extra £_00 out of my bank for two loans .
M	said i didn ' t have funds which i can prove were in my account .
M	received no miss payment calls , texts or emails .
M	even signed into my account online the day the loan was due to check everything was okay and it said " no current loan active ".
M	give me my £_00 wonga !
M	be_careful people .
M	misleading website !
M	got my ps0 today .
M	the dhl box was crumpled like someone had been throwing it .
M	the ps0 box was also damaged .
M	you also havent sent the wrong ps0 bundle .
M	the one advertised with the phone contract was a ps0 killzone bundle which includes : the console and cables , killzone , two controllers and the camera .
M	( since complaining_about this and ignoring my emails this has been corrected on their website )
M	i received the bundle with one controller and no camera !
M	value difference of £_000 !
M	(£ 00 controller and £_00 camera )
M	should be shut_down by ofcom .
M	im paying for things that im not getting !
M	off people in towns were they supply no signal .
M	they have been withholding my money for nearly 0 weeks .
M	lied to me numerous amount of times .
M	still no money back .
M	be_careful people .
M	avoid them .
M	spend your money somewhere safer and reliable !.
M	got a gaming headset from them which was sent with parts_missing & a faulty microphone & expected me to front the return costs !
M	avoid these rogues & stick with amazon !
M	was searching for a mfp , was totally unsure as to what model to buy so ordered what looked the best to me .
M	was contacted by printerland and they advised of a better more economical model for my needs .
M	can ' t fault printerland at all , if you need a printer there is no where better to go !
M	thanks !
M	last_year ( june_0000 ) i bought a diamond platinum engagement_ring for my fiancée .
M	diamond_geezer made sure everything was perfect from start to finish .
M	i hate buying anything online - tian smith ensured that he accommodated for me every way possible .
M	i must ' ve phoned him at_least 00 times before buying the ring - and by the time i placed the order - i was very short of time !
M	they made sure the ring was with me before my special occasion .
M	i promised diamond_geezer that i will be back to buy our_wedding_rings .
M	last month i bought 0 wedding_rings - clive & luke were sooo helpful is was unbelieveable - there was never any pressure to buy anything .
M	my finacee ' s engagement_ring was a difficult one to match with the wedding_ring - within no time diamond_geezer provided me with a cad image of how they could make the rings fit together !
M	delivery was also very fast !!
M	defo would recommend to anyone anytime !
M	!

M	raygrahams has the best online store i have ever used ( and ive used a few ) i am a joiner by trade and ordered several powertools from them as there prices were cheapest i could find online .
M	i had a few questions which the friendly and experencied staff answered_promptly and to top it all i had the tools delivered on site within 00_hrs .
M	would highly_recommend and certainly use again .
M	keep up the excellent prices and service cheers
M	ordered a new lens and very happy with the service .
M	the lens was well_packaged , delivery came very quickly and had tracking_information all the way through .
M	also like that the follow_up email sounded a bit more human rather_than a robotic " thanks for the purchase , insert review here ".
M	it might still be an_automated email but at_least it ' s with a bit more effort and thought to presentation .
M	[_name ] resolved the issue of a rebooking !
M	fantastic service as always by parcel0go .
M	credit due where possible .
M	[_name ] was polite and promptly resolved any outstanding issues .
M	0 *
M	the colour and print were exactly how i wanted .
M	made a great hoodie for my fiancee , brilliant work by the guys at tshirt_studio .
M	delivery was spot on too , would definitely use for future gifts .
M	brilliant selection of strings when it comes to gauges and for people that use unusual gauges its perfect .
M	really good prices and good service .
M	been purchasing products from amazon for over 0 years now , very highly rated , items arrive within their estimated arrival date .
M	unknown company , found via reference , first time purchase with them and it couldn ' t have went more smoothly , would rate this company and would re assure people that they will receive the best of service .
M	thank_you .
M	extra bag booked on inbound flight rather_than outbound so had to pay for extra baggage twice .
M	promised refund at gatwick by ba desk staff but told to email to action the repayment .
M	emailed only to be told refunds dealt_with by phone , i was abroad so had difficulties with this .
M	dealt_with 0 members of staff in total having to keep explaining the situation only for my refund to be refused !
M	flight was fine but on principle will never fly with ba again .
M	for the sake of £_00 they should have refunded me and apologised for their error .
M	found my way around the website with ease and the item was delivered in no time .
M	had a minor printing / quality issue so i telephoned .
M	the customer_service team ( anne ) sorted things and gave me instructions on ordering a replacement .
M	mistakes_happen and they showed great customer_service and the product is excellent .
M	easy and efficient transaction .
M	best price for the product ordered .
M	frazer & kevin were my technicains .
M	i could not fault their service , they were very friendly and made sure my car was looked after .
M	the service i recieved was second to none , and im sure i will be using this service again .
M	best regards
M	mr buxton
M	i placed an order with sunglasses_shop for some fairly expensive custom oakley_sunglasses , something which this website informed me would take on average 0 days before being dispatched and would have a trackable delivery .
M	weeks_later i had received nothing and heard_nothing .
M	i asked and was grudgingly told that it was taking longer_than normal .
M	as such i did not have the glasses for the trip abroad i had bought them for .
M	on my return , they still had not been delivered and i was due to move away from my property for an extended period .
M	i asked the shop to give me an eta .
M	they said check the ups site but gave me no tracking_number , so i had to ask for this separately .
M	i realised that the order ( now unapologetically about a month late ) was not going to be delivered in time before i left so i requested a change of delivery address .
M	sunglasses_shop processed this so slowly that it was too_late .
M	i had moved away for two months .
M	when i returned i found no sunglasses waiting for me .
M	examination showed that they had been delivered , and allegdly signed for , by some complete stranger , not even someone who lives in my building .
M	obviously this defeats the point of a signed for delivery .
M	however , by the time i had confirmed that this was the case the window for complaints had closed .
M	i was shunted between equally incompetent members of customer_service , each one apparently too lazy to read the previous emails in the thread .
M	the upshot of this is that apparently it is considered ok by this shop to fail to deliver their products to the customer , regardless of circumstances ; that keeping the customer informed of what is happening to their order is distinctly optional ; and that requests by the customer will be dealt_with lazily .
M	i am now £_000 the poorer for having dealt_with this store and they are apparently guilt - free for never having fulfilled the most basic requirement of selling something .
M	placed an order , made a slight error on my account creation , on my email address , which was my fault , submitted a ticket on which i was advised what the problem was and then it was all sorted .
M	i would suggest that you add an additional box for confirming your email address on account creation , this would help stop people from making typos and reduce support traffic for you .
M	delivered promptly and the order was correct .
M	also much cheaper_than other_sites .
M	yesterday , after browsing the net for a while , i found your cnm catering equipment uk .
M	it was easy to navigate , clear and understandable .
M	everything was organized in a logical fashion .
M	i am absolutely_delighted with the site and also with your excellent service .
M	well_done to all your staff who are involved in that process !
M	have bought multiple items from wineware .
M	they have a great range ( albeit site could be more navigable ).
M	the after sales service is great .
M	delivery is prompt ( and free over £_00 ).
M	packaging is high_quality to prevent breakages .
M	handled one instance where stock was not available in the uk extremely well - highly_recommended .
M	sportspursuits had some great deals on camping_gear ; with a good range of products from top_brands .
M	service and price were great , although the wait for delivery means it doesn ' t work so well if you need something instantly !
M	overall a great place to upgrade your kit and get a bargain in the process
M	i found ziip in the past , well over a year_ago , and have used them since .
M	an excellent service , with great prices , and a very quick_turnaround on digital products .
M	i ' ve recommended them to friends and they like me have been completely_satisfied .
M	thank_you ziip , you have a very happy customer :_d
M	i ' ve been a customer with zfast since 0000 , and have always experienced the best support possible , the reps dan & lee will do everything to make_sure your problem is solved .
M	my most_recent problem was effecting my business and this was solved in less_than a few hours .
M	highly_recommended uk web host for your website .
M	yodel delivered my package on time and the delivery driver was very friendly when delivering my package .
M	they should be congratulated on such a superb service .
M	will be definitely using again !
M	i ordered from wrappz . com a few_times now and every time i have , the service has just been brilliant !
M	the skins i have ordered are of the highest_quality and the website is so easy to use .
M	wrappz is the best company out there to provide your phone case or skin .
M	i ordered what i wanted and it delivered as per the website .
M	they ' ve got a really good selection and prices too .
M	i originally used drive dynamics to find an instructor for another area of edinburgh when i lived there .
M	the first 0 lessons for £_00 ( with 0 lessons added to when you take the test ) seemed like a good offer , and the first instructor was called scott and was great .
M	he was extremely skilled , calm and never cancelled a lesson .
M	he was adaptable and even ended_up giving me the rest of the lessons without leaving any at the end .
M	he was the best instructor i ever had , but also the last good one .
M	when i moved back to london , i was put with an instructor who kept cancelling and reshuffling lessons , although taught well .
M	things were fine until he decided to stop returning my calls or refund my 0 lessons ( not including the introductory lessons ).
M	drive dynamics did nothing to chase him up and took_ages to match me up to another driver .
M	they had passed me back and forth_between customer representatives and all of them made me false yet convincing promises to phone back or deal with the problem , but it only ended_up prolonging my matching me up with another instructor .
M	they had lost contact with this instructor and did not have any way to chase him up for money .
M	they did not even bother to tell me this when he left the agency to warn any customers of their inability to deal with the problem .
M	this instructor ' s name is steve benjamin .
M	then desmond , the next driver , cancelled the 0nd lesson on the day after i had been waiting 00_minutes with no word and after texting and calling him .
M	then he moved the lesson to the weekend and was 0 hours late on the day again when i told him to call it off .
M	he has still not refunded the other two lessons + three lessons ( for when you take your test ) despite my asking him .
M	i doubt if drive dynamics have chased him up or did anything useful , even_though the customer representative promised to do so .
M	they matched me , took their fee and did their minimum to help me out and passed me from one representative to another .
M	finally , they were trying their best to make me not phone them again because chasing up an instructor doesn ' t make them money , at_least that ' s what it seems .
M	i have only a few_months until my theory will run out , but now i am so put off from learning to drive , i don ' t think i ' ll bother until the next time i feel_like being messed_around by driving instructors .
M	all i can say is that i ordered two dvds and i got them in their estimated timeframe .
M	no hassle .
M	also , fairly competitive_prices , especially as i didn ' t have to pay for postage and packaging .
M	great service and range of products from the guys at function 00 !
M	a one stop_shop for golfing and skiing gear .
M	will_definately be using them again !
M	i ' m a very hard hard guy to please , and i ' m extremely quick to complain - not needed with mpb .
M	okay so the prices on some things may not be as much as you get selling it privately but when you take into account free postage ( they send a courier next_day ), lack of commission / any other fees and waiting for a buyer to be happy etc ... quite reaosnable .
M	staff are all polite , knowledgeable and very quick to respond to emails .
M	top_notch service .
M	everytime i have booked a room through travelodge they have wanted in excess of £_00 . 00 .
M	lets get this straight first of all - they are a cheap motel , nothing else .
M	they have no public facilities , lounges , bar , restaurant etc , just a reception and very basic rooms .
M	so why am i paying prices that a 0 star hotel charge ?
M	then there are their 0 websites running side by side .
M	use the one that starts www0 as the other is woefully slow and doesn ' t work correctly with firefox or google_chrome .
M	the customer_service over the phone is reasonable although they are limited on the information they can give and also remedial methods should the website break mid transaction and mess up your booking .
M	after much coverage in the media about cheap airlines hidden_charges , ryan_air still insist on adding the charges only after you ' ve decided which destination / time / date to fly .
M	pyut them up at the start them we can compare easily as the flights i went for were cheaper at ba , klm and air france .
M	it is staggering that this company still allows anonymous reviews by anyone and everyone regardless whether they have eaten at x restaurant or stayed at y hotel .
M	the vast_majority of negative the reviews are unqualified and written by people with a grudge and the vast_majority of the superb reviews are written by people who are either related to or actually by the owners of the businesses .
M	even trip advisors own ceo says that the reviews posted should be taken with a lightly at best .
M	then there are trip advisors staff who are under so much pressure to ensure negative_reviews are posted and stay on , in the words of their own marketing manager , nothing sells quite like negative stories - hence their ' horror hotels ' emails to all their users .
M	if you want actual reviews by genuine people who stayed at hotels , then visit laterooms - they can only leave a review there if they have actually stayed at the hotel .
M	i have used envirofone several_times now and have never been disappointed .
M	great service !
M	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
M	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer_service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
M	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren ' t able to follow the changes in the charges .
M	we ' re happy with the windows but when we replace the future ones i ' m not sure we will use ventrolla as the experience was not a pleasant one .
M	i ' ve been shopping with amazon for many and i ' ve never had any_issues with them .
M	yes they may not be the cheapest but they sure do make up for it with fast delivery times and excellent customer_service .
M	i ' ve bought items in the past where the price has dropped a few_days after , only to be sent an_email with the price difference back .
M	likewise when an item went missing there was no_hesitation and they sent out a replacement straight_away .
M	i ' d recommend this site to anyone - i was able to find the fossil watch i wanted with pretty_much the lowest_price online .
M	the watch was delivered within a couple of days well_packaged and with the official fossil presentation tin .
M	brilliant .
M	i ' ll be back .
M	i just purchased a new onkyo - dali system from exceptional av and i can ' t rate them highly_enough .
M	they really know their stuff and the guy i was on the phone to was able to recommend a slight adjustment to my order based on newly_released products .
M	i live in northern_ireland , yet the system still arrived the next_day - that ' s pretty_cool .
M	i noticed a minor item had been missed off the order , but a quick email to them and it arrived , yet again , the next_day .
M	they don ' t sell rubbish - only quality systems and i couldn ' t beat their prices anywhere .
M	my advice - do your research and then get on the phone to speak to them directly .
M	i found them really friendly and extremely well informed .
M	once i new what i wanted the ordering_process was quick and easy .
M	seriously impressed and i ' d recommend them to anyone_looking for a serious audio system .
M	if you ' re looking for a good quality accessory for your mobile phone ( especially current , top - end models ) then do have a look at mobilefun . com .
M	they ' ve got a great range of products , most of which are good brand_names and good quality products .
M	their website contains lots of details and nice pictures of the products and it ' s easy to browse .
M	on ordering they provided lots of detail about delivery estimates and the product arrived well within the advised dates .
M	this is a very professional , quality service and i have no problem in recommending them to you .
M	the towel radiator arrived within a couple of days and exactly as_described .
M	it looks stunning and the values that were recommended on the website are a perfect match and were packed neatly inside the main box .
M	to top it off , it was a decent price even once delivery to northern_ireland was included .
M	i ' d absolutely recommend a look .
M	bought a jacket , ladies trousers and child carrier .
M	prices online were as good as anywhere_else .
M	delivery was efficient , and when the trousers went back because they didn ' t fit , their returns_policy and refund was very prompt .
M	phoned the order through , rather_than using online to get advice and talk to the salesman .
M	advice was good , and friendly .
M	would use again .
M	i have used my protein . com numerous_times over the past few_months .
M	their product is always top quality and at a price that few other_websites can compete with .
M	all produce is always delivered in a timely_manner with no_fuss or problems .
M	can ' t recommend them highly_enough .
M	stumbled on across simplygames through an app on my iphone and i ' m always quite dubois when ordering online through a provider i ' ve not heard of .
M	so i took the plunge and ordered and to my amazement and happiness the ordered was processed at great speed and delivered at an even faster speed .
M	simplygames is now one of my go - to websites when ordering video_games .
M	i ordered bow_tie , cummerbund and handkerchief : only chose standard delivery but the goods turned_up next_day !
M	great value , well_done .
M	stumbled_across this website by chance tonight , fantastic online help team , willing to tell you anything you need - purchase was hassle_free and very convenient , highly_recommended !
M	purchase - fifa_00 serial_number
M	anyone_looking for an_alternative to the rip - off prices that high_street opticians charge for your contact_lenses , look no further !
M	lenstore . co . uk has everything you need , at amazing prices !
M	!
M	i got my 0 months worth of contacts for under £_00 including delivery and it was here the next working day ,
M	i would definitely_recommend this site to all of my friends and family !
M	it really doesn ' t get any better then this .
M	every product you can think of , easy search options and will beat any internet price you can find .
M	not to mention free_stuff !
M	i will being doing all my business from now on right here at supplement_warehouse !
M	this company organised our recent stag_do and did an exemplary job .
M	from the very initial_enquiry they were efficient and keen to help and they dealt_with all our changing requests without any hassle .
M	thier website and payment system is ideal so one person doesn ' t have to foot the bill and claim it back off friends .
M	would not hesitiate in telling people to use them as they were brilliant and i will take my business back to them with any future events like this i organse .
M	funny how this review site has over 00 , 000 reviews for a website with 000 twitter followers while a massive company like amazon has a little over 0 , 000 .
M	maybe if they spent less time setting_up fake accounts and giving glowing praise to their rubbish service and more time actuallly sending the orders people have been waiting over a month for .
M	they are thieves , they are liars and they don ' t deserve your custom .
M	first time user and there were very helpful with my inquires .
M	loving my new trousers too .
M	have had virgin now for 0 month , recieving promised internet speeds + more at all times ( alough they do limit torrent ports through peek times ).
M	phone is spot on and so is tivo box .
M	was a customer of orange broadband and was recieving speeds of between 0 . 0meg and 0meg when all my neighbours were getting 0 - 0meg .
M	when ever i called it was an offshore call_center and they make you go through a massive list of things to check which are the same no matter what you problem is ( strange ).
M	in the end i have changed to virgin who up to now ( 0 month ) have been awesome !
M	!
M	they make there prices look like a good deal with free p_& p then drop you into a amazon checkout with one of there new ( and probably soon to be deleted ) accounts where you have to look really close to see that there charging £ 0 standard ( 0 - 0 working_days ) delivery for a sd_card !!
M	!
M	adjusrt the quantitys and the delivery charge almost doubles ( funny that ).
M	stay_away from them in my opinian .
M	i did some research for some light weight sun glasses as my last pair finally gave up on me so i though i would splash out .
M	i went for a pair of the carbon fibre frame less ray_bans .
M	fashion eyewear had the cheapest i could find at the time + i got myself some cashback via topcashback . co . uk .
M	delivery time was a little longer_than_expected but i wasn ' t in a hurry ( we have snow and no signs of sun ).
M	ordered a sofa set online monday and was contacted by phone on tuesday with delivery date .
M	i had a call from the driver about 0 hour before he was due to arrive which gave me plenty of time to get back home to accept the delivery .
M	the quality was exceptional was very dubious_about buying a large furniture item online but featuredeco was brilliant .
M	i also found out that they had a showroom so i have had a look at some of the beautiful sets they have to offer .
M	i have already_recommended to my friends and family .
M	thanks to a brilliant team effort .
M	easy booking process and well managed service - will use again
M	all i wanted to do was cancel my mobile_broadband .
M	i don ' t use it .
M	it was a great price , but if i don ' t use it , its still expensive !
M	!
M	the cs person talked over me consistently , claiming she had regulatory information to tell me which was nonsense - she was just saying i ' ll not get the discount back if i come back and ask for it .
M	i don ' t want the discount - i just want to cancel the bloody thing !
M	!
M	given how hard it was to actually do that , i would seriously doubt i ' ll ever go back , but if i do it will be based on a decision in the future , not her trying to convince me not to cancel !
M	so .. waste my time on the phone , get a bad review on trustpilot .
M	seems a fair trade .
M	visited the showroom and looked and touched at the watches before ordering over the internet .
M	stunning watch arrived quickly and well_packaged , all handled with the professionalism that is lacking in most places these days .
M	item was as in the despription and shipment was very fast .
M	a +++
M	i highly_recommend them .
M	quick delivery and excepional service
M	only company i know that offers 00 day no_fuss swap on games .. soo annoying when you shell out 00 quid and the game turns_out to be rubbish
M	best service ever .
M	gave me a great price for my old phone .
M	posted phone back on friday and money was in my account on monday_morning
M	this was the first time we used printerland . co . uk however won ' t be the last .
M	we ordered a brother mfc - 0000dn multi - function printer which is of great quality .
M	the price printerland . co . uk sold the unit for was much cheaper_than our usual hardware / it reseller could get and free delivery to boot .
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	gav hughes
M	my technician chris was a top lad .
M	service was excellent and turned_up a few minutes early .
M	will_definitely use this company again !
M	not only where theflightcasecompany . com the cheapest company for my ac00 flight case they also delivered on time .
M	the case is self is a exactly_what i need , soft on the inside and hard ( as nails ) on the outside !
M	no more worries about that my combo is going to look like when i pull it out of the back of the van !
M	i paid a bit extra for next_day delivery so i can ' t say what the normal free delivery would have been like but for me the service was stellar !
M	they texted and emailed me when the item was at each_stage to confirm to me that it would get there and even gave me a delivery window which was accurate , really impressed !
M	i like the website and way you can search for what you want by specifying manufacturer , price , screen size and especially features !
M	i would certainly buy from these_guys again !
M	in fact i am telling everyone about the good deal i got and sending them here . i bought a dell adamo onyx laptop for £_000 and am just endlessly impressed with it .
M	i just cannot_believe that a machine like this could be so cheap !
M	00 second boot time , full metal 00mm design is the best i have ever_seen .
M	doesn ' t get too hot from surfing and decent battery_life ... oh and a backlit keyboard ... it ' s insanely good !
M	!
M	in fact the only thing that could be improved about the website is the ability to review individual products like this to help others make purchasing decisions but i wont remove a star for that .
M	after several bad_experiences with other cheshire based bike shops .
M	i gave global bike a try and have never looked back .
M	they are efficient , well stocked , knowledgable and very competitive on price ( often cheaper_than wiggle and crc ) and are a top bunch to boot !
M	the team there have a great mix of experience and race competitively in all cycle walks of life i . e .
M	xc mtg , dh , freeride , road , time trial etc .
M	i now buy all my gear from global and have any repairs i cant do / haven ' t got the time to do carried_out by their excellent mechanics .
M	i would have no reservations in recommending global bike to anyone , beginner or pro , in any cycling genre .
M	i like chain_reaction cycles and have used them for years but will not be using them anymore .
M	i ordered several products that say " in stock " on the website on several different occassions only to find after calling coustomer service that they do not have them and / or have discontinued items .
M	crc need to increase proactive communication .
M	sorry crc but i ' ll be going elseware from now on .
M	never had a bad_experience using this service , have placed four tenants so far .
M	traditional letting agents ' days are numbered !
M	exactly as requested , delivers fast , lowest_price .
M	can ' t fault .
M	very quick delivery as always pleasure doing_business
M	thanks for a great service : efficient communication , quick delivery .
M	very happy with my purchase .
M	ordered the audio_technica ws00i headphones .
M	we had to change change pick_up to delivery - no problem , different day for delivery then pick_up - no problem .
M	everything went smooth and people on the phone were polite and efficient .
M	used for a long time , always bitcoins within an_hour , ( mainly_due to blockchain but that can ' t be helped ) once the transaction didn ' t go through in 0 hours but they sorted it out for me without any input and i had my bitcoins a assume as soon as the account holder woke_up
M	was able to have no os so i could put my own on , very well_priced base unit , all the bits i wanted to put in it , delivery was excellent , all_round great service .
M	cjs is a fantastic company that offers competitive_prices on games and associated products .
M	the prices are unbeatable , and so is the service .
M	fast payment , fast delivery , fast satisfaction .
M	highly_recommended !
M	i ordered a 0ds game ( professor layton and the azran legacy ) to be delivered on release day .
M	not only did i receive my order on the correct day ( unlike past experience with other_websites ) but the order was well_packaged and the price was the cheapest around .
M	will certainly order again in the future .
M	i am so furious with paypal words cannot describe it !!
M	i run a very reputable company which requires me having paypal , so every now and then i need to pay for services / goods to my suppliers .
M	anyway cutting the story short - i opened a business account with paypal , which i then linked my business account to it , only to find out after 0 days that my account has been refused - with no explanation why !!
M	now , my money that i initially transferred is blocked for 000 days !
M	!
M	absolutely nonsense !
M	!
M	brought a old skool nokia_0000 for my dad as that is the only phone he could use .
M	searched through ebay an amazon trying to locate a good possible deal .
M	saw a few offers on amazon but whilst on there came_across refurb_phone .
M	fortunately they had a number i could call them on .
M	they picked_up almost straight_away ( very impressed ) .
M	i asked them all the relevant question .
M	the lady on the phone was very pleasant .
M	taken in by her charm i ordered the phone .
M	some how she managed to persuaded me to take additional items .
M	anyway received the phone the next working day an i must_say i am surprised .
M	the phone was boxed with all accessories an looked absolutely emmaculate .
M	my dad is going to be very pleased indeed .
M	will_defo_recommend
M	nothing special and then found thing i brought was cheaper when we arrived !
M	got a three year_old dyson but a couple of small parts broken by wife !
M	managed to replace just the parts for £_00 - thought i was going to have to buy a new one for considerably more - perhaps that is what she wanted .
M	part arrived two days_later so she could finish hoovering :)
M	despite popular opinion that pimlico_plumbers can be more_expensive than many outfits , i booked an_appointment anyway finally having had enough of the useless excuses for ' tradesmen ' that had darkened my door up until now trying to fix an ongoing plumbing problem .
M	steven osbourne arrived bang on time at 0am , despite me only having called their london office 00_hours before .
M	he was professional , friendly and efficient .
M	identified the problem immediately , picked_up the parts and completed the work within 00_minutes .
M	the whole experience was a complete breath of fresh_air and well worth the hourly rate .
M	the piece of mind and sense of relief i felt from finally having the issues fixed by someone whose judgement i immediately trusted was most welcome .
M	well worth every_penny , and having discovered a company with a service head and shoulders above the rest , i would not hesitate to book them again for future jobs .
M	i ' ve used tyre_shopper a few_times , always one of the cheapest and i can then choose a local fitter .
M	to give you an idea of price i purchased 0 goodyear efficient grip tyres for my 0000 honda civic .
M	i checked reviews and the tyres were highly rated .
M	i got a code for tyre_shopper for 0 %_off and paid £_000 for the 0 inc fitting , disposal of old tyres etc .
M	they were fitted at national_tyres .
M	national ' s price for one of these tyres was £_000 .
M	same product and fitted at the same location .
M	tyre_shopper are superb .
M	i love this site .
M	they basically have every supplement you would want , then some .
M	i hate how the more commercial websites like gnc and bodybuilding always seems to stop carrying my favorite supplement because it was " discontinued " and supplement_warehouse always seems to have it .
M	everything was already well_priced and an online discount_code made my new oakleys a fantastic price !
M	they came well_packed and arrived very prompt :)
M	i had a slight_issue with a parcel not being collected on monday , which was the fault of the courier company , not p0g ( remember that these_guys are facilitators and not courier ' s themselves ).
M	however , i used their online_chat tool to speak with george in customer_services and i have to say that i was thoroughly pleased with the service i have received .
M	george was extremely_helpful and rearranged collection immediately , reissued collection notes and uprated the delivery service to ensure my parcel still arrived on time .
M	parcel was collected today .
M	great service and will_definitely be using again - especially with their facebook discount_code !
M	definitely the best way to unlock your iphone , mine is a 0gs at & t and it takes only 0 day .
M	now i ' m really happy with my cellphone and i can use it with any carrier .
M	thanks !
M	!
M	a company that , over time , has become complacent in relation to not only the service that they claim to offer but customer_service also .
M	forever sending out sim ' s that don ' t work , taking money from you for payment but not adding it to the account for some time ( can be up to a day at times if not longer )
M	numerous outages , misleading marketing strategies , where do i begin ?
M	i shall be leaving them at the end of this month for sure .
M	parcel0go save a fortune posting anything over 0kg - and they collect from your door
M	have good xmas
M	i ordered branded usb pens and when they arrived they were much_better quality than_expected .
M	will_definitely choose to use them again in the future .
M	vast choice of hostels to choose from , well - laid_out website , and no booking_fee !
M	i ' ve used hostel_bookers before , and i ' m sure i will again .
M	i was amazed at the speed at which i was able to sell my phone to mazuma .
M	they sent me the bag and documentation within a day .
M	i then sent my phone the following_day .
M	i was kept_updated at every_stage , via e_- mail , about the progression of my order .
M	before i knew it , the money was in my account .
M	would definitely_recommend to everyone .
M	great stuff .
M	having used northern_parrots for almost 0 years i have always been very pleased with the quality that the items arrive in and the speed that they arrive ( normally the next_day after i receive my dispatch email ).
M	having had to return an item due to damage in transit i got to see how well the returns team handled my request and i think they did a fantastic job , my replacement arrived within only a few_days of me emailing to say i had to send the other one back .
M	keep up the good work and i will be using you for many more years =)
M	what happened there ?
M	!
M	i chose lovefilm to watch viking .
M	season 0 was released , but there ' s only 0 episode .
M	it is completely rebranded , i feel_like like i ' m on amazon supposed to shop some shit where i only want to be in the good old love_film planet .
M	but it ' s gone now ...
M	i was very happy with the service that i got .
M	000_%
M	the order arrived when they said it would .
M	all good !
M	going to shop there again
M	i read a lot of reviews , mainly negative , of cyberpower before placing an order with them .
M	from start to finish i have had very much pleasure and confidence in them as delivering what i asked for .
M	i was even a pest after_placing my order and requested a few upgrades , which was not an issue to them .
M	the ship date was stated in the website for the 00th_dec 00 , i didn ' t receive the rig until 00rd_dec 00 .
M	although i wanted the pc the day after i had ordered it , i knew i would have to wait a little unless i wanted to pay for fast track .
M	because i ' m tight there was no chance in that .
M	one thing i did pay for was saturday delivery , due on 00st dec 00 .
M	this didn ' t happen , although it was dpd ' s error not cyberpower ' s .
M	they are a very unprofessional outfit after numerous_calls to them , i even offered to collect from the depot - all of my solutions to my failed delivery was declined .
M	a reason of ' no keys for access ' was given - i say bollocks , it ' s all down to the depot manager not taking responsibility for his personnel ' s mistake and rectifying it to a suitable compromise .
M	would definitely not recommend this courier due to the unprofessionalism of the depot and poor complex handling of the manager .
M	cyberpower has since apologized on their behalf and refunded the extra fee paid for this failed saturday delivery , a refund that was processed very quickly .
M	another good point on cyberpower ' s part !
M	my rig ( no overclocking );
M	corsair 000r case
M	gigabyte sata iii motherboard
M	amd 0000 six core 0 . 0gig
M	amd radeon r0 000 0gb gpu
M	kingston 000gb ssd
M	kingston 0x 0gb blu hyper ram
M	corsair 000w psu
M	certain reviews complained of the case being too ' open ' and ' fans sounding like an aircraft taking off '.
M	i prefer my components being cool rather_than an uber expensive fan or cooling system that i need to worry_about working .
M	i use my pc for gaming and use a headset so i can ' t see the noise problem ever bothering me !
M	overall the machine works_perfectly , my brother in law is very jealous of my machine .
M	it shows very good value for money .
M	i will do business again with cyberpower and will_definitely_recommend to anyone_looking to buy !
M	thanks and compliments go out to all involved in my purchase .
M	you have made a nearly bald man a very happy one .
M	hope you all had a good christmas and enjoy your new year !
M	kind_regards
M	chris
M	i paid for my new pc to be delivered on a saturday , at a cost of £_00 . 00 .
M	i kept logging onto their website to check on the progress of delivery .
M	from first light on the day of delivery the status was advertised as ' enroute to local_depot ' ' delivery will be before 00pm .
M	i waited in all morning and logged in on a number of occasions to see if there was an update to no_avail .
M	i had the upmost faith and trust in the company to deliver as i had paid a very good price to receive the parcel 0 days early from the normal routine .
M	around 0000am i started to feel a bit_concerned as to the no show .
M	i then logged in only to find that the system had been updated to say that there was a problem with my parcel and they would be unable to deliver it until monday .
M	i did not receive a phone call nor even an_email to appraise me of the ' problem ' my parcel had encountered .
M	i called the customer_service centre and spoke with some lovely people , in particular patricia , who showed the upmost sympathy and seemed to attempt to resolve my issue .
M	after she liaised with the local_depot ' manager ', i personally wouldn ' t describe him as a manager as he did nothing to compromise or negotiate to get my parcel to me .
M	instead informing_me through patricia that he was unable to access the ' trailer ' it had been incorrectly stowed within and secured .
M	he didn ' t even give me the respect to call me and discuss himself !
M	unacceptable behavior towards a customer in my books .
M	as i was due away for the next few weeks for operational reasons , i offered to attend the depot for pickup , that was refused .
M	i offered to look through the trailer myself for my individual parcel - apparently ' thousands of parcels ' are secured on it , that was refused .
M	i asked how he would get access in case of a fire or other emergency if there were ' no keys for the trailer available ', no excuse received !
M	i understand mistakes_happen , but it ' s how you rectify them to make it up to the customer that counts - on this one dpd has failed massively .
M	after_reading other people ' s reviews here i now understand that delivery problems with this company is a normal thing joint on to this is bad excuses !
M	i will not be using this company again , if i need to pay more to buy items from other_companies then so be it .
M	it ' s not worth the hassle trusting these !
M	i have recently_bought a new rolex explorer 0 from iconic_watches for my dad .
M	i must_say that they are my jewellers for every watch i bought in the past and will also be in the near_future .
M	the sales and customer_service team is awesome and so helpful .
M	once again thanks team iconic_watches .
M	regards
M	mian
M	i ' ve been using juno for a decade or so , in which time i dread to think how much money i have spent !
M	my sagging bank_balance is testament to juno and their excellent service !
M	if it says it is in stock it is .
M	orders placed by mid - afternoon ( nearly ) always arrive next_day .
M	when i have had a handful of problems they have been sorted painlessly , juno covering any return_postage_costs .
M	the back in stock , artist and label alerts are great and ensure you never miss anything from your favourite labels and artists .
M	the focus had widened from the original " dance music resource " tag , reflecting increasingly eclectic tastes .
M	this broader remit hasn ' t affected quality in terms of service or stock carried .
M	i would ( and do ) recommend juno widely !
M	cheers !
M	received my order quickly .
M	everything was packaged carefully and the sweet with the order was a great little touch !
M	i ' ve been in the customer care game for 00 years and i am impressed .
M	you ' ve gained another customer here !
M	many_thanks !
M	used chilli for a stag_party of 00 in chester .
M	lots of options when booking , tailored to our needs .
M	venue was excellent , chester is awesome !
M	well_organised , well set_up , ran very smoothly , no_problems , no hitches , everything in place as we asked for , perfect for a stag_do .
M	would use again no problem .
M	i ' ve been using shopto for over a year .
M	i can_honestly say i ' ve not had one problem , just discounts and fantastic delivery and general service .
M	so i say why shop anywhere_else when you can shopto . net ?
M	this site is good
M	i was " unlucky " to get the item of the wrong_colour from this online store , but the way they responed to my problem was most pleasing .
M	not only was the item replaced with a correct one , but i also got a refund for the return shipping .
M	responses to my messages were fast , accurate and polite .
M	overall - the best online shopping_experience i ' ve had .
M	it ' s that kind of situations when you can see if the store is worth returning to .
M	this one - definitely is .
M	have been with this company for too damn long and have had a wide array of problems over the years .
M	my connection used to drop completely on a regular_basis requiring a manual reset of the router .
M	this problem continued for a while but seemed to get better in the last_year ... until about one month_ago .
M	speeds have been dropping since .
M	they gave me a replacement router which has been performing worse than the one which was at_least 0 years old .
M	i regularly have to deal with speeds which are 000 times worse than what is being paid for .
M	that is not an exaggeration either , literally 000 times worse .
M	ping is often incredibly high meaning going near an on - line video_game is something that i cannot even consider any more , and streaming youtube_videos has become a chore rather_than a form of entertainment .
M	on top of all this , their customer support_team have been fairly useless : they take forever to respond to emails , they respond to tweets quickly ... but there tweets consist of " fill out this form so we can email you ", they are very blunt and rude over the phone , and they leave you praying that odin rides down to earth on his eight legged horse to batter you in the face with his spear .
M	( not a euphemism ).
M	would love to leave the service but can ' t as they force you to pay a large fee for every month left on the contract .
M	recently switched to fibre broadband and had an issue with the connection .
M	was transferred to 0 different people and spoke to them for 0 hours - useless !
M	ee management are absolutely incompetent - there seems to be very little proper training .
M	oh and not to mention the fact that they completely forgot to connect me to the landline service , but expected me to pay !
M	ha !
M	jokes .
M	a little_sceptical at first , mostly due to the many unprofessional looking promotional links floating about !
M	... but after dealing_with cosmeparadise , i can say that they are a truly reputable company who offer competitive_prices and quick delivery ( although longer_than usual due to coming from hk ).
M	i ' d definitely use them again ; a very quick and easy service .
M	prices competitive and lots of clubcard_points to be had !
M	i ordered gta 0 about a week before_release day and paid for it straight_away though paypal , then i saw online that rockstar had said no online_retailer is to dispatch the game till the 00th of september lucky i picked dpd to delver and got it on release day .
M	now i will use shop to all the time
M	great customer_service a ++++++++++++++ company
M	having shopped with myprotein and bodybuilding . com in the past , i feel bodybuilding_warehouse offers a fantastic range of their own supplements and foodstuffs as well as stocking some of my favourite_brands such as gaspari and bsn .
M	the service and delivery has been faultless every time and this , coupled_with very competitive_pricing , makes for a company that i would recommend to anyone and will be using time and again .
M	fantastic !
M	the service was very quick and straight to the facts .
M	i compared the price offered to other comparitable websites and mazuma_mobile was by_far the best .
M	personally i used the bank_transfer method of payment and only had to wait a couple of days .
M	i would absolutely recommend mazuma to anyone .
M	steve jobs made this company the business that it is today and it shows throughout everything they make and sale .
M	love this company to bits and wish that every business would look to what this company stands for - true innovation =)
M	sorry , i ' ve been an ebay buyer but also a big seller and the fees are crazy .
M	on ebay , i first pay insertion , then final value fees of over 00_% and then paypal fees of 0 %.
M	it ' s complete madness but since they have such a grip on this sector , we have no - one to choose .
M	great for buyers , horrible horrible place for sellers !
M	!
M	very slow when processing orders , i know you are a big company but make it faster so i can be a happier customers !!!!
M	!
M	got a compatible ps0 controller for £_00 . 00 delivered to my door , excellent price and excellent service .
M	would highly_recommended , good chaps to deal with and answered all my queries .
M	thank_you again guys , very happy customer =)
M	light / smoke machine was exactly as_described .
M	delivery was quick and i was able to track the progress of the delivery .
M	would recommend this seller as service was a0 .
M	great service , fast and smooth delivery , excellent product , really good price , cheaper_than ebay .
M	thanks
M	great service , fast and smooth delivery , very good tires cheaper_than ebay or any other website by_far .
M	will use again .
M	thanks
M	csaba
M	very happy with this service it was cheap and fast and will b defiantly using the service again
M	this a very outstanding company , i will be continuing to order from them for a while !
M	!
M	i always get a good deall on my supps !
M	!
M	a huge thanks to oak_furniture land for their fantastic products and flawless customer_service .
M	we ' re absolutely_delighted with our new dining_table and chairs - which wonderfully match the solid_oak sideboard we bought from them earlier in the year .
M	the quality is excellent for such a low price_tag and free delivery was a bonus .
M	we spent_ages researching furniture companies before_deciding to buy from oak_furniture land back in feb .
M	it was our first time purchasing furniture from an online company and naturally we were rather cautious - however after_reading nearly every_single review available , we decided we were in safe_hands - and evidently so , since spending over £ 0 , 000 with oak_furniture land , i haven ' t got a bad_word to say against them .
M	we received emails and text_messages to confirm our order and booking details ... we were given a 0 hour time_slot and the drivers even phoned me 00_mins before they arrived to let me know they were near .
M	they were both extremely polite and helpful - nothing seemed to be too much_trouble for them !
M	so thanks again , oak_furniture land - i expect we ' ll be dealing_with you again soon !
M	i ' ve bought several books now from the book_depository and have been impressed with their customer_service each time .
M	they are quick to respond to emails and delivery was tip_top - v . quick .
M	i highly_recommend this company .
M	mary at catered ski chalet was amazing .
M	she answered all our awkward questions always got back to me straight_away , was always patient with me getting in touch with all my group and did not hound me about getting back to her straight_away .
M	we had an awkward number of 0 and she was excellent at giving us the best prices for empty bed supplements and basically did all she could to ensure that we got the best for our money .
M	then finally when we did book she emailed me to say that she had managed to get the options we wanted even cheaper_than we had agreed by adding some offers .
M	cant_wait to go on our holiday , if it is as good as the service mary gave us then we are in for a perfect week .
M	a free game every day plus exciting prizes and free chat games to be won .
M	what more do you want , think im addicted .
M	the hosts are wonderful and brilliant .
M	if you gamble sensibly youll love virgin games .......
M	its been a month since my flight was cancelled and expedia will still not refund my money .... circa £ 0000 !
M	they never called back when promised and they now tell me that they can ' t help and to contact the airline directly .
M	i thought it was supposed to be customer_service ?
M	feel_like expedia will use any excuse to never give me back my money and this was compounded when i read in the guardian an article about how they stall on refunds , google it .
M	will never book through expedia .
M	ordering was easy and was contacted very quickly to confirm order .
M	was advised of eta but watch came before that via a pre 0pm saturday delivery which was great .
M	am absolutely over the moon with my new watch and would definitely use swd again .
M	i did have reservations_about ordering a high value item online but saw previous reviews and read up on this company and very pleased with the end_result .
M	tried others and was not impressed but mazuma was a no nonsense effecient way of going about selling my old phone .
M	will recommend and use again and again .
M	worst . company . ever !
M	no joke i would never use these_guys , no help in a dispute from a buyer point of view and even worse for holding_onto your money as a seller .
M	i know they work close with ebay but they should not be legally allowed to handle money !
M	every experience makes me more and more certain they don ' t give two hoots about its user ' s , and i thought the uk banks were bad ... paypal take the biscuit , im taking a case to the financial_ombudsman as we speak , after that i am closing my account and will never use or have anything to do with paypal again .
M	avoid at all costs .
M	i have always received my orders in a timely_fashion , plus they have an instant compare pricing tool that instantly saves you 0 % and you can always google and find a $ 0 off coupon .
M	now we get to the closeouts and samples portion , wow .
M	from free shakers to pill dispensers , not to mention tons of $ 0 -$ 0 items great to try out things you ' ve been thinking about , and sometimes , full serving sizes ( yes thats 00 - 00 multivitamins , libido enhancers , etc ).
M	i have zero complaints , and don ' t forget to visit their facebook_page often , they are constantly doing free giveaways featuring incredible supplement packages .
M	even_though i ' ve never won , i will always support them !
M	sw for life !
M	they already have the lowest_prices you ' ll find on high_quality supplements , plus they ' ll drop it even lower_than websites matching that price .
M	extremely fast free shipping , free giveaways , free_shaker_cups w_/ every order -- can ' t be beat !
M	cut a long_story short : needed to send a package to the us .
M	went to the local post_office and they asked for silly money .
M	decided to go to parcel0go and spoke to a very lovely assistant called catherine who managed to get me a good price .
M	really made my day :)
M	thank_you
M	a cracking stag_weekend and katie our organiser was fantastic throughout the booking process .
M	several options we offered and when we selected our weekend we were able to customise it to individual needs across our group .
M	the activity centre chosen for shooting , assault course and bo - carts ( go - karts in mud ) was fantastic too .
M	well_done and i would not hesitate to recommend chillisauce for anyone_wishing to book a stag_weekend .
M	after spending millions on a redesign , the new beeb site is top - of - the pops in terms of usability .
M	design and layout imho
M	i ' m caught in a search filter bubble , seeing different resutls from everyone_else due to my ip_address , despite disabling personalization .
M	not a happy_camper .
M	the site is updated every 00 seconds with results from all of the major and minor soccer leagues worldwide .
M	the site gives good detailed_information on each match , including goal / card / times , who scored or was sent off and so on .
M	always use feel good for my contact lense solution , their prices are always the best on the net & their delivery is always really quick !
M	will_continue to use again & again .
M	my order arrived super_quick , i chose my protein as when compared to other_websites their vitamins were of superior quality and cheaper , what more could you want .
M	will def be re - ordering .
M	thanks so much !
M	at less_than £_00 for 0 people for a years cover inc winter sports look no further .
M	the winter sports package inc damage and loss to equipment .
M	mega .
M	just bought a jet boil from them .
M	cheapest price out there .
M	had it in less_than 0 days .
M	emails from start to finish .
M	will buy again from this store .
M	great service right from the start .
M	kept_informed all the way by email .
M	i ' ve used parcel0go now several_times and will_continue to use them in the future , it ' s a fantastic service and the prices are extremely reasonable .
M	you get to pick the courier you wish to deliver the parcel and some can just be taken to local drop_off points so it saves waiting it all day for someone come collect it .
M	i ' ve also now used the live_chat as i made a mistake with the post code , [_name ] sorted this instantly and new labels were emailed to me within 0 minutes !!!
M	faultless service with a very polite attitude .
M	i hope i get [_name ] again if i ever have to use live_chat :)
M	we booked chillisauce based on their glossy website .
M	firstly , the activities ( quad_biking , hovercraft and rage karts ) were a total rip_off - less_than 0mins driving for £_000 !!
M	it was a joke and people were really disappointed , many having travelled from abroad .
M	their representative jamie was extremely rude and did not want to know as soon as we ' d paid the deposits .
M	between the group of us we must have tried to phone him over 00 times and he ' s never available and never returns calls .
M	he was rude to the stag ' s aunt who phoned from abroad trying to pay for her husband and hung_up the phone on her .
M	when we tried to add extra people a few_days before the event he said " this event has been too much hassle , i ' m not letting anyone extra come ".
M	he made mistakes on the names and said it was too confusing that they shared the same surnames ( cousins / brothers ) and he couldn ' t figure_out who had / hadn ' t paid .
M	on the day we had to take bank_statements to prove that we ' d paid since jamie would not recognise that people had paid and their names should have been on the list .
M	we tried to complain afterwards but chilli_sauce have no_complaints process and we suffered verbal abuse from jamie accusing us of being disorganised (!?
M	).
M	in addition he organised a hen_night for my wife who was lead bridesmaid for her friend .
M	this was a shambles too with them repeatedly trying to call him and confusion when they arrived at their hotel .
M	again their activities were a rip_off , only a few minutes on each thing despite paying alot .
M	avoid chilli_sauce .
M	in particular avoid jamie - its a disgrace .
M	fantastic customer_service .
M	after royal_mail losing my parcel , jokers_masquerade displayed an unprecedented level of customer_service to help me sort out the problem and i cannot thank them enough , in particular jessica for her help and understanding .
M	thumbs_up !
M	and thank_you so much .
M	very happy with purchase .
M	a wide_range of glasses and excellent service .
M	would recommend to everyone .
M	definitely use them again .
M	thanks
M	i buy from these_guys everytime i need supplements .
M	i only online shop @ amazon . com " except my supplements " only supplement_warehouse has the bang for the buk ... thx
M	very professional company and would definitely come back
M	i ' ve had cause to ask lcn a number of queries and every time had fast and excellent responses .
M	very high_level of customer_service .
M	good product selection and fast delivery
M	00 enquiries in 0 days .
M	very impressed .
M	i ' ve ordered lots of things from amazon over the years from a few_quid to hundreds of pounds .
M	i never had an issue , the 0st time ever i had a faulty item a few weeks_ago and i ' ve sent it back to get a refund , they even paid the postage for it !
M	i also have to add that the item has been purchased on the website but not actually sold by amazon and i trully believe it was a genuinely faulty item .
M	so much so , that i might order the same_thing again , when i get my money back .
M	newlaters can be a bit of a hassle , but if you don ' t want to read it , you just delete it .
M	i built my computer recently and ordered parts from a few different websites .
M	box had the best communication ( text_messages , etc .
M	), fast and free delivery without minimum spending .
M	and the best price for the item in question .
M	i would surely recommend to anyone .
M	i needed to re - book a collection a number of times and sam at parcel0go couldn ' t have been more helpful .
M	i contacted parcel0go via their facebook_page and the issue was resolved v quickly .
M	i got a highly professional service so would definitely_recommend !!
M	!
M	cheap get aways ... thanks
M	i was shopping around for creatine .
M	i ' ve used supplement_warehouse in the past and it has always been a site i checked when shopping and checking prices .
M	i ordered con - cret caps and it was a buy one get on free deal .. and the one i had to pay for was still cheaper_than any other site ' s .
M	i really recommend shopping with them .
M	was very easy to order and set a delivery date .
M	thanks
M	would recommend .
M	... and they were very quick to delivery tv , two days window appointment .
M	but decided to cancel and it just took one simple phone call and it was done .
M	didn ' t even ask why i wanted to cancel but seemed strange !
M	!
M	.. from my order .
M	ordered a pc_components to build my own pc .
M	took delivery and started to build my pc that day i took delivery .
M	everything was going fine until i came to installing the drives and noticed that the dvd - rom is missing from the order ???
M	?
M	i lived alone then , and contacted them and i was told that i might have misplaced it shown where ???
M	?
M	anyway , they finally_agreed to meet me half way and i was told that they are willing to send me a dvd - rom drive if i was happy to pay half it ' s price plus postage which seemed really unfair .
M	if you get an order from scan , make_sure you check everything or they will scam you !
M	you ahve been warned !
M	faz
M	.. network_provider , love them .
M	thanks for the excellent customer_services you ' re providing .
M	faz
M	... money collected and validated , then suddenly , they ' re out of stock .
M	completely_unacceptable .
M	i placed my order on the 00th_dec 00 as tv was shown in stock , my order was processed and validated and money requested from cc company and when i was tracing the progress of my order , they were out of stock and have received an e_- mail to say that the manufacture will send them more on the 0nd jan 00 and if not happy then i can cancel my order .
M	this shows how much they really_appreciate your business .
M	it ’_s like they ’ re saying “ either wait_till when ever and get lost ” this is not a way to do business .
M	i placed my order based on your stock_availability according to your website , if your website is not shown the true stock count then fix it and get a decent website up .
M	so i cancelled my order and cancellation was processed as it was confirmed by e_- mail .
M	shortly_after , the tv was shown in stock again !!!!
M	a minute later , it was out of stock again !!!
M	properly when i cancelled , they ’ ve updated their website so another customer orders , they take their cc details down and then e_- mail them that the tv is out of stock .
M	seriously , you need to get a decent website and try and keep your customers rather then push them away and lower your delivery charges , £_00 for delivery is a daylight rubbery .
M	thanks
M	faz
M	found this site 0 weeks_ago , book marked it to keep tabs on a specific item i wanted that appeared to be out of stock like everwhere else ( asus infinty 000 tablet , with english dock !!)
M	i emailed gogodigital and was assured re - stockig was quite regular , and with a better price than any other uk retailer i was happy to wait , 00hours later , item in stock , following a simple hassle_free online purchase and with next working day delivery , well_packaged , this item works_perfectly with all the promised upgrades and warranty ( i ' m super happy and using it right now ).
M	with the autumn approaching and my old coat no_longer up to the task i thought it was time for a change .
M	i contacted 0 shops for advice , the 0st one got back to me with a recommendation of a £_000 jacket , that on checking was absolutely no good for me at all , as it was just a thin pro shell , probably better for their sales than me .
M	white and bishop however hit the nail on the head with the north_face atlas tri - climate jacket - quickly delivered the jacket is amazing , warm , dry , 0 - 0 love it to bits .
M	my wife who hates spending money loved the coat so much i had to order her one in gravity purple along with 0 sets of north_face etip gloves , pair for me and pair for her .
M	super service throughout with a team who put your needs 0st , you would be crazy to go elsewhere .
M	now looking at a pair of hiking shoes also !
M	took roughly a week to dispatch a ' in stock ' item ..... then had to wait 0 - 0 days for product to arrive .
M	tried to contact through website ..... no one bothered to reply .... although conveniently a day after i sent message product was despatched .
M	product was stated as new but missing xbox seal and was poorly shrink wrapped .... looked like a bodge job .
M	disc was loose inside case ... rattling around in there .. wasn ' t seated properly .
M	was actually really dissatisfied .. but i do not know why i bothered writing this review as simply_games won ' t actually do anything about it .
M	bought many things from ebuyer over the years , never had a problem with delivery and always found some cracking deals .
M	really easy to use service , very quick delivery and cheapest online around for a limited time only .
M	would use again !
M	overclockers uk have amazing customer_service , quick delivery and a very decent forum website should you need after care .
M	never had a problem ordering from them and they are one of my best trusted retailers for online shopping .
M	i bought guild_wars 0 ( cheapest anywhere online !)
M	key was with me in 0 mins , worked_perfectly !.
M	the site is very easy to use could not recommend higher .
M	i found the website to be very easy to use , and greatly_appreciated the 000 free business_cards offer .
M	delivery was very quick . the cards are of great quality and are just what i was looking for .
M	i will_definitely be using easyprint again !
M	greatcompany .
M	fast delivery
M	great company with great deals and quality shipping times !
M	excellent service , excellent communication .
M	sent immediately and arrived next_day .
M	had a change of address and they gave excellent communication and had it redelivered .
M	the dinner jacket and trousers were great quality too .
M	watchshop delivered the wrong item .
M	watchshop delayed sending the correct item until receipt back of the wrong item , therefore missing my christmas deadline .
M	slow reply to emails .
M	no answer by phone .
M	terrible !
M	neanderthal royal_mail postman couldn ' t fit the lenses package through our standard sized letterbox , even_though i somehow could .
M	easily .
M	three re - delivery attempts later with the same incompetent result i had to go and collect from a delivery office in the middle of nowhere at expense to myself .
M	great service .
M	in future i will buy lenses from my local_optician , where i can pick them up easily and not be forced to be at the mercy of criminal stupidity .
M	absolutely amazingservice .
M	i received an e_- mail at every_step and there we no_problems whatsoever .
M	really good next_day shipping .
M	the delivery tracking thing was really useful and easy to use .
M	i received texts to confirm when my package would be arriving .
M	well_packaged and wrapped .
M	product arrived in perfect_condition .
M	definitely one of the best online shopping experiences .
M	stress - free and faultless !
M	köpte en soffa portugal för en tid sedan .
M	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
M	men jag antar att man får vad man betalar för :-_d
M	i ordered the incorrect remote , emailed a total of 0 times to all 0 email addresses shown on their site , 0 email addresses bounced back .
M	called their phone number several_times , but kept giving message only open between_0am to 00 . 00am and 0pm to 0pm despite me ringing during their so called opening times .
M	i also contacted via the message box on the order details page .
M	they then shipped the order out despite my many emails that seemed to go through .
M	won ' t be using again
M	i did not receive my items and terence paul was not interested in helping in any way luckily i got my money back through my card i would never use them again
M	even when several people complain to sage pay that a company is taking money for products that they have no_intention of providing , sage pay are happy to keep providing that company with the means to continue its dodgy business_practices .
M	good service good signal not all the call_centres are in asia and you can actually understand the people you talk to
M	excerlant company defonatly sell more phones with you
M	do not use this company .
M	we bought 0 club level ( executive ) tickets for the arsenal v man u game on the 00nd jan . we paid £ 0 , 000_pounds for the five tickets .
M	tickets were only delivered on the friday_afternoon before the match and when they arrived they were not even club level tickets , they were regular tickets priced at £_00 each and were located in the away side .
M	onlineticketexpress promised to refund the difference but after several emails and phone_calls we have still had no response or any type of refund .
M	cheaters & criminals
M	no special_offers , no loyalty_points , no tokens > they don ' t need it everything is already at the right price , tryit !
M	a weekly_shop in aldi is about a third of the cost in the major supermarkets .
M	i then go to marks for my " bits " .
M	best of both worlds
M	bunch of bandits !
M	try and buy one yoghurt or one pizza , bacon , sausage etc - there ' s always offers to make you buy more_than you could ever eat before it goes off .
M	all they do is try increase the amount you buy .
M	why not just make the price for a single item cheap so we can choose how many we want to buy and not you .
M	what a great web_site !
M	evrything in stock , everything delivered packed well .
M	you get your stuff next_day and when i phoned up there were actually people on the phone who packed my order !
M	terrific !
M	they knew all about homebrew as well as could answer my questions !
M	even th eemail replies were quick and helpful .
M	i have no_worries about them and you won ' t either !
M	its service is not really bad .. but some times it delays the delivery too much .
M	but in the end my product reaches safe to me ..
M	oh man .
M	what an awsome site .
M	look at all the products .
M	its really amaizing .. good work people .
M	keep it up .
M	this is an average site .
M	there is not much latest material .
M	the privacy settings are really awkward now as its harder not to share everything with everyone ... i dont want my feeds to be public , so take that little globe icon away , mark zuckerberg !
M	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
M	facebook should be for sharing with who you want .
M	the fact that usernames cant be changed more_than once means that people can look me up by my username if they cant find me in public searches !
M	p . a . n . t . s
M	the online customer_service provided instant and helpful advice !
M	!
M	no_problems whenever i use this company .
M	good communication , quick enough delivery and reasonable prices .
M	i never have any issue with ordering or the products from my protein .
M	they are not always the cheapest but thye have agood range , are no_frills and keep a tight delivery and communication schedule .
M	i will use again .
M	i ordered protein from firstchoicesuppliments as it offered the best price for a bulk purchase that i could find anywhere on the internet .
M	it arrived very quickly but unfortunately the contents had suffered some damage .
M	i contacted firstchoice and they remedied the situation with replacement products the very next_day .
M	i am very happy to see this level of service which is definitely not the standard offered by lots of other_companies .
M	definitely_recommend their services and would use them again .
M	i can ' t recommend fd plumbing enough - they turn_up when they say they will , do the job quickly and efficiently , leave no mess behind and charge very reasonable rates which are quoted before the work takes place .
M	it shouldn ' t be remarkable to find a company who keep their promises and get the job_done properly , along with being friendly , easy to deal with and honest ; but it is !
M	i ' m very happy with all of the work completed so far , and will_definitely be using them again in future .
M	contact earlier in the week to return my glasses require a rma_number .
M	automated emailed received then nothing .
M	emailed again still nothing .
M	they say their customer support_team aims to respond to your query within 00_hours , monday to friday .
M	the website says
M	" we provide a high_level of after sales service , which includes a guaranteed return_policy ."
M	service received has been very poor and still no contact from anyone regarding the rma_number which is needed to make the return .
M	this company seems to be one of the cheapest on the web , however once you place your order it will remain as processed for many days .
M	when you call their customer_service ( which you cant call from a mobile ) it will state that your in a que and approx wait is 00min .
M	i still havnt received my order ( a digital_camera ), and it seems impossible to get in touch with them .
M	never use this site , pay a bit more for piece of mind .
M	this , from start to delivery was perfect ,
M	the web interface is intuitive , easy to use and provides all the alignment tool you could want .
M	especially like the fact it will warn you if the uploaded picture is a low resolution and not suitable for printing .
M	from submitting my print i was kept_informed of the dispatch and delivery and was amazed that it was with me in less_than a week
M	if you want a canvas_print , these are the guys ( and girls ) to do it
M	although it took a couple hours more_than the 0hours stated b / c of issues with the carrier , i was happy that the company kept me informed of the progress .
M	they promptly unlocked it and notified me accordingly once possible .
M	very happy customer .
M	jolly good service - very impressed with the speed and no_fuss service / delivery - if only every supplier would be the same
M	dont waste your money with any other provider as the platform and service will not be as good as feedoptimise .
M	if you know how to turn on a pc , launch the internet and create an account with these sites ... then don ’ t waste your money .
M	the social_media blue print is definitely not for companies who want to attract new business , all the tutorials tell you is what each social_networking site does , it has no depth what so ever .
M	made a reservation a week before needing the vehicle , phoned 0 times during the week to confirm booking as i needed it for house move .
M	each time they confirmed the booking but they did not fill me with confidence that the van would arrive .
M	on the day of moving_house it came to 00 :_00am when the van should have arrived at 00am so i phoned and they said the vehicle had engine problems and won ’ t be delivered .
M	unbelievable not even a phone call to say the vehicle wouldn ’ t be arriving !
M	also they refunded the money less £ 0 !
M	avoid this company !
M	thanks guys that was really easy to do
M	welcher alternativ vorschlag soll den das gewesen sein ?
M	sie haben mir keine alternativen angeboten welche als alternativ in betracht kommen ,, ( legendlich mit aufpreis )
M	der flug ist bezahlt ,, und somit wird er durchgeführt und zwar im angemessen rahmen .
M	wenn sie ihrer verpflichtung nicht nachkommen ist das ein vertragsbruch ,,
M	ich kann nachweisen das der betrag bereits bezahlt war bereits bevor ich kontaktiert wurde .
M	das zweite gespräch am mittwoch ist mittendrinn abgebrochen – die nummer die mitgesendet wurde war nicht erreichbar .. eine wiederaufname des gesprächs hat es nicht gegeben ,,
M	in der unsicheren annahme ob ich jetzt einen flug habe
M	am donnerstag um 00 : 00 wurde eine mail von mir geschickt in welcher stand
M	die verbindung ist gestern abgebrochen ,,
M	kontaktieren sie mich nochmals ,,,
M	wenn sie mich umbuchen dann werde ich nichts aufzahlen
M	und die flugzeiten müssen am abend ( reisezeit zwischen 00 und 00 uhr ) sein wie jetzt auch ,,
M	des weiteren ist eine reisedauer pro tag von mehr als max .
M	0 , 0 stunden ( derzeit 0 , 0 stunden ) nicht akzeptabel .
M	schicken sie mir die details ,, am besten per mail .
M	ich hab weder die zeit noch die lust das ich hier diskutieren werden .
M	mfg mario königshofer
M	auf dieses mail kam die reaktion .. weiter unten .
M	das timing der mail gesendet : freitag , 0 .
M	juni 0000 00 : 00 war so gewählt das man nicht die gelegenheit hatte , da anzurufen da die hotline ja nur bis 00 uhr
M	offen hat .
M	zufällig ist heute natürlich kein entscheidungsträger anzutreffen der den aufpreis von 0 euro zur übername entscheiden kann und darf .
M	und aufeinmal sind ja auch 000 euro aufpreis zu bezahlen die man dem kunden der seine bezahlte leistung nicht in anspruch nehmen kann
M	heute hat es mehrere gesprächsversuche mit der dame gegeben – die nichts entscheiden darf und einem permanent ins wort fällt
M	auflegt – keine direkte mail adresse von dem bewerdemanagement oder der geschäftsführung .
M	und man kann nach dem bisherigen verlauf einfach nicht davon ausgehen das das callcenter diese mail 0 : 0 in einem angemessenen zeitrahmen ,,
M	( montag flug ) weiterleitet .
M	jetzt gerade das dritte gespräch um 00 : 00 meinte die dame auf einmal das sie mich nicht hören kann .
M	ich hab genauso wie sie gespräche zur beweisvorlage aufgezeichnet .
M	auch das 0 te gespräch ist nicht zufriedenstellend gelaufen die dame hat wieder mal aufgelegt .
M	in summe kann man sagen ich hab was bestellt ,, eine flugbestätigung erhalten ,, bezahlt ,,
M	am montag am 0 . 0 . bestellt und bezahlt
M	am mittwoch 0 . 0 .
M	nachmittag wurde ich angerufen von einer nummer die nicht zurückrufbar ist ( keine einigung )
M	am donnerstag 0 . 0 .
M	mail geschrieben .. keine antwort ,,
M	am freitag 0 . 0 . nach 0 , 0 h nach schluss der hotline kommt eine mail in der steht das ich anrufen soll bei fragen
M	am samstag 0 . 0 . beim anruf wird man vertröstet das ja heute keiner mehr da ist ..
M	ich versuche seit fast 0 stunden das zu regeln und da es ich jetzt seit 0 minuten wieder in der wartschlange hänge und um 00 uhr wieder die hotline ausfällt
M	wird das heute auch nichts mehr ,,
M	jetzt nur probleme ,,,
M	noch keinen flug
M	sehr viel zeit und nerven investiert ( unbezahlbar )
M	und einen geschäftsausfall welcher im zuge dessen auch eingeklagt werden kann .. genauso wie mein zeit sollte ich am montag nicht fliegen .
M	in diesem sinne sollten die sie ihr personal schulen und etwas kundenfreundlicher werden .

M	shame on you .
M	quick service on the website .
M	fast and informational .
M	going to use this website for all my supplement_needs !
M	i have come back now multiple_times and i really love this website .
M	highly_recommended !
M	i needed a convertible to drive from vegas to san_francisco via los angeles , most companies gave me ridiculous quotes as the drop_off location was different from the pick - up but these_guys came up with the goods .
M	i was told about this site from a friend of mine and when i got to it , i was amazed .
M	the closeouts , cheap prices , selection ... definitely beat the big name stores .
M	i ' ll be using this site from now on , might as well throw_away my gnc card !
M	!
M	excellent service my phone actually took longer to arrive and my sale date was over by a few_days even_though my phone had dropped in price by this time i still got the full_amount offered originally !
M	ordered my pc using the 0 day fast track service ended_up having some slight delays which lead to my pc been dispatched in 0 days rather_than 0 , got a full_refund for the fast track but still got my pc super_quick !
M	:)
M	overall the service throughout the process was excellent and the end product is amazing not a single complaint .
M	finally a london cleaning company that delivers perfect results every time .
M	housekeep has exceeded expectation in every respect and in particular in relation to the high_quality / reliability of the cleaners and the exceptional levels of customer_service .
M	i have personally recommended housekeep to all my family , friends and colleagues .
M	i had the chance to us 00days . com and it was a great experience .
M	it is a completely hassle_free service that helped_me to get_rid off my grandmother potteries and rise some money .
M	just great !
M	i ' ve been using hostelbookers for a long time now , and prefer it to hostelworld because of the lack of booking_fee .
M	there has never been any_problems with any of the bookings i ' ve made .
M	incredible !
M	less_than 0 hours and my iphone was unlocked !
M	i strongly_recommend it !
M	thanks
M	i had a delivery arranged for valentines_day to deliver to my partners work address .
M	i had her wait there until 0pm but unfortunately the flowers didn ' t arrived until after this time ( this was a friday_night and so they were not picked_up until the monday ).
M	not only were they delivered outside of the agreed delivery time but office security told my partner they were thrown inside the door without any care by the courier .
M	needless to say i was very disappointed .
M	i tried_contacting them via the ticketing_system and weeks_later no reply except for them to close the ticket as resolved .
M	the delivery issue is something they need to look at with the courier but the lack of customer_service is unacceptable especially_considering the cost of the flowers .
M	myprotein offers a wide_range of products in different flavours and sizes .
M	the prices are very competitive and in particular the protein is comparitavley cheap .
M	there is a good level of information and atricles to provide much needed knowledge and the customer reviews help balance opinion .
M	finally there is a wide_range of delivey options that generally arrive very quickly .
M	i have made 0 orders from here so far and both have arrived very quickly with no issue at all .
M	first order was for a 000 chrome angled drip tip adaptor as after buying 0 boxmods i needed an angled tip but i ' m not fond of the knucklehead type ones .
M	second order was for 0 batteries after i purchased the itazte vtr from another vendor ( batteries much cheaper here ) i purchased 0 batteries here for the same price as 0 cost on another site so definitely got it right .
M	look_forward to further use in the future .
M	very easy to use site and has quite a good selection of mods available from beginner to more experienced vaper .
M	i have ordered 0 times from here .
M	my 0 orders are as follows
M	0

M	victory bcc 0ml tank by vision blue
M	victory bcc 0ml tank by vision black
M	000 - to - ego adaptor by uk ecig store
M	unitank by kangertech blue
M	decided that i wanted some new tanks so purchased the above ones and also purchased a new drip tip as i haven ' t bought a new one for a while .
M	used the 0nd_class signed for delivery option for this as i was in no rush , still arrive in the same time as usual 00 / 00hrs after i ordered .
M	i have also had a discount_code i have used for each order saving me a few_quid each time and better still , with every order i have made i have received a 0ml bottle of eliquid to trial ( different flavour each time ) free of charge of course .
M	i will_continue to use this company as i have had no issue and i know many people that use them with no issue also .
M	sorry to read the bad_reviews on here from other people tho as it is never nice having a bad_experience .
M	i ' ve bought many different eliquids from here and always had a quality product arrive , packaged well and always comes on time .
M	i ' ve gone back several_times for more as the prices are tidy as is the service .
M	from buying to refunding and general technical help , overclockers . co . uk are exceptional , i ' ve been shopping with them for 0 years now and since caseking . de took them over their service has gotten even better .
M	if your in the market for anything related to computers then ocuk should be your first step .
M	my first order from powerbody was my usual supps list , animal pack and kre - alkalyn but cheaper which i was happy about , delivery was very fast , early next_day , the staff are very helpful as they themselves are passionate_about training and bodybuilding and their forums are a great place to share and get knowledge with the community :)
M	first time user of printerland , i ' m an it consultant and a customer asked me to look_into reducing their printing costs , i started researching it myself an called printerland for a quote , i was surprised to find that the sales_rep was very knowledgeable and willingly gave a lot of advice and recommended the same printer that i had singled out .
M	service was brilliant and product arrived within 00h .
M	couldn ' t ask for more
M	i found this site and thought it was sketch at first with the low_prices of a whiteline roll kit priced 00 - 00 bucks below everyone_else .
M	i then did some research and found this site is legit and tried them out .
M	i got my tracking_number quick and fast .
M	then got my products in the mail in just under a week .
M	vr is my new site for parts !!
M	highly_recommended !
M	!
M	order number : 0000
M	realy good service and good postal service
M	i have previously purchased products in the superdry store , but this was my first online purchase .
M	the product arrived within 0 days of ordering and the product was exactly_what i expected .
M	really pleased with the service .
M	i recently_purchased " hitman : absolution " from one of the bargains as it was the cheapest price at the time of purchase by almost 0 £ which to me is a bargain for such a good game .
M	i ordered the product on the 00th_june after the usual dispatch time so i didn ' t receive my dispatch confirmation until the 00th_june , but it arrived on the 00th_june .
M	this is a next_day delivery and i am happy with the service provided , this was also a first time purchase .
M	i ' ll be glad to order from them again !
M	great service , great deals and fast delivery .
M	i bought a twin pack of " army of two : the devil ' s cartel " arrived exactly when i expected and nothing was wrong with the packaging .
M	i couldn ' t believe_how cheap it turned_out to be with first_class delivery .
M	getting both games at a modest price of 00 . 00 £ it worked out so much cheaper for me and my friend .
M	i ordered a chair but what i got was two rods due to some misslabeling but tackleuk fixed this promptly and sent me a new chair and allowed me to keep the two rods for free !
M	great and fast service !
M	one of the best for eliquid
M	i believe they have bogus bidders that get you to pay a deposit by paypal that can never be returned as paypal always settle a dispute in there favour as it is an electronic none tangible service !!
M	!
M	use them at your peril .
M	ordered a jacket they had in stock on the saturday for next_day delivery ( arriving tuesday ) now over a week has passed and no jacket no reply to my 0 emails and no reply to my 0 voice_mail messages .
M	they make out on there web_site that there is a sales desk between 00am and 0pm mon - sat straight to voice - mail all week !!
M	!
M	there are definatly more trusted and reliable sites !!

M	they made a special effort to get my package to me on a saturday next_day delivery , i wasn ’ t expecting that and was very happy .
M	the loyalty_scheme is fantastic !

M	i booked a hotel room the day before my stay using the ebookers website and received confirmation .
M	i arrived at the hotel to be told they were fully booked with no rooms available .
M	as i ' m sure you ' ll agree this is very very poor service .
M	how impersonal can you get with serenata_flowers .
M	0 / flowers arrive delivered in a box .
M	0 / left with reception and just left without passing them to my wife .
M	i could have dumped them on reception for that matter .
M	0 / i paid an extra 00 for grandissimo option , expecting beautiful white blossoms to break up the dozen red_roses .
M	nothing , just a bunch or roses , shoved together .
M	definitely not grandissimo .
M	0 / the flowers were wrapped in the most basic of wrapping papers , very disappointed .
M	ive spent far less at flower shops and got a lot more .
M	will never buy from here again or off the internet come to that matter .
M	service doesn ' t exist .
M	just good at confirming your order taken and delivery thats all you get .
M	delivered my parcel to the wrong place , had it signed by someone in the wrong name who promptly stole it and i never got to see it again .
M	no customer_service available at all .
M	this company is literally the worst .
M	never never use them .
M	honestly shopto is my favourite place to buy games .
M	prices are always reasonable but the service is just fantastic .
M	everything i pre order always arrives in time for release day , everything else arrives the next_day always in great condition .
M	whenever i contact customer_service with any kind of questions i always get a prompt , friendly and helpful reply .
M	you usually get a photograph of your parcel within minutes of ordering and their 0 minute dispatch promise actually works .
M	couldn ' t recommend them to anyone enough .
M	great value for money ; a fast , efficient and friendly service ; very good customer loyalty and satisfaction ; brilliant weekly deals and most_importantly of all , it is great , tasty , healthy food .
M	you ' d be mad not to try it if you like healthy , tasty food !
M	really good range of smells for guys and all at very good discounts for the brands that they offer .
M	the delivery came within a few_days of ordering in the original wrapping and packaging which one always has to question when you ' re not buying a product from its original source - absolutely nothing wrong with this one though .
M	in terms of the scent , i bought acqua di gio for the summer and i ' d very much recommend that for a guy who doesn ' t know what he wants but wants something fresh and that will turn heads !
M	love onnit .
M	aubrey has smart people doing a great job and his open mindedness will keep this company prevalent until the big volcano blows .
M	times are tight right now for me .
M	i have been trying to get the most nutrients out of food to avoid buying supplements .
M	but with an upcoming competition , i have to suck it up and go to the place i trust .
M	they are very transparent .
M	they give free_stuff every time i order .
M	low_prices on little extra things .
M	people complain that they charge for shipping but i don ' t expect a free hand job after a complimentary massage .
M	sorry , that ' s the only analogy i had .
M	i wouldn ' t pay for one either .
M	they are competitive in business and i am competitive in life .
M	respect .
M	applied for a free water saving bag to go inside toilet cistern .
M	was delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
M	great easy site to use and order groceries , turned_up on time within the agreed time_slot .
M	ordered a shed , turned_up on time , no_problems with using website , nice and simple .
M	really happy with this service , great selection and excellent delivery .
M	will certainly use again .
M	great selection and fast delivery , pleased to have found this place .
M	perfect service , fast delivery .
M	i have made a couple of purchases from facewest . co . uk and i just wanted to tell that facewest will always be my favorite shop when buying my outdoor_gear .
M	muy conforme con_el servicio , fue practico , simple y eficiente .
M	saludos !
M	everything arrived on time , with minimal effort on my part .
M	the money was in my account with a week !!
M	great service that i would recommend to anyone .
M	etyres offer a fantastic service and have great prices too .
M	so much easy as they come to you .
M	i have nothing good to say about bt as a customer for the last 00 years .
M	rip_off_merchants plain and simple .
M	signed_up with hma and was constantly disconnected , contacted customer support who through some correspondence was unable to rectify the issues with this very buggy software , then told no refund offered as under the term and conditions i exceeded the 000 connections ?
M	while being encouraged to do so by customer support as a diagnostic procedure , a very cunning piece of advice , opened paypal case and got a refund as case went in my favor .... please read the terms and conditions before committing , my experience is just avoid this company as there are much_better and cheaper out there ..... on the whole a very bad_experience .
M	cheers paypal
M	i used music magpies app on my iphone which was quick and easy to use !
M	( so far so good ) after accepting a poor offer on what was a outstanding collection of dvds ( in top nick ).
M	i then boxed up my dvds incl .
M	0 game which was worth £_00 .
M	the courier picked_up my boxes ( yeah a random bloke in a normal car ) who gave me a slip to say he had collected them .
M	00 days_later they showed up at the warehouse as ' under quality checking '.
M	then i got an offer of under £_00 .
M	this was because apparently the two most expensive dvds / game on the list were either ' damaged ' or ' not sent '.
M	i know for a fact all items were send and all in top nick !
M	i have still not heard_anything by day 00 and they have not replied to either of my 0 emails sent 0 weeks_ago which they say response time is 00hrs .
M	in fact the second email i sent stated i would review they ' re company on every website if i don ' t get a response ( obviously not a big deal for them then ).
M	this company does not hold the customer at the center of its values and will rob you of higher priced dvds !
M	i recon that the people below that have rated this company as 0 * are not actual people but the company itself !
M	it has to be !
M	my friend at work has also had this same problem as me and we done it the same time .
M	i urge you all do not use this company !
M	i would recommend ebay .
M	i know it ' s a pain but you will make 000x more money .
M	take my advice people , thanks :)
M	sign_up process was super easy to follow .
M	got all my things in the cart and shipped out to my door is less_than 0 days !
M	= o i ' m shocked at how fast this transaction was .
M	and how low the prices are !
M	i can ' t believe this guys make money at all from selling so cheap !
M	kudos on the fast delivery .
M	nice job on the excellent service .
M	great team you ' ve got there .
M	authentic items , carefully packed by a worker named frank .
M	thanks for the free toffee candy as well .
M	the customer_service and quick_turnaround of product for towelsrus was superb .
M	i purchased excellent quality towels & bathrobes and have been very happy with them ever since .
M	thank_you .
M	i have had two experiences with cjs_cd_keys and both_times i have been felt cheated one way or another .
M	first was with bf0 , ordered form them as their site said it was in stock , it was not .
M	a week_later i had not received my key so asked for a refund which was an uphill struggle in itself .
M	second was ordering a 00 day game time card for starcraft 0 , thought heck £ 0 . 00 for 00 day trial is decent i will go for that , ordered it and turns_out its 0 hours of game time in a 00 day period .
M	a small detail which is nowhere on the products page , unless you read the one review at the bottom which i noticed only after i went scouring the page to see if it said anything about this but it does not .
M	( except for the review )
M	so year , some may say its a harsh rating but not in my book .
M	had a great departure flight great holiday .
M	then the return_flight set off 00_mins before_departure with no name call outs and left me and my girlfriend stranded .
M	the manager didn ' t care and had a really poor attitude .
M	apart_from this , jet0 . com was really good , but the return was awful , awful service !
M	not likely to use them again !
M	i was slightly dubious as fonehub were offering by_far the highest price for the phone , ( nearly £_00 more ) which rang alarm_bells for me .
M	i read some reviews though , and they seemed fine .
M	so i sent the phone off , via special delivery , and requested the payment by cheque , rather_than bacs .
M	the phone was in brand_new condition ; i had won it in a competition earlier in the week .
M	fonehub emailed to say they had received the phone as soon as it arrived , and then sent a cheque out to me the next_day .
M	they paid the full_amount , as promised .
M	in summary ; by_far the best price , and paid quickly .
M	great prices .
M	kept up to date with delivery times .
M	quick delivery .
M	perfect .
M	i would recommend to anyone .
M	nice easy to use website with a good product range .
M	the trainers i ordered came in just a couple of days .
M	will use again .
M	i ' ve been hosting my websites with tso for over 0 years now and have never looked back after skipping around a load of other " cheap " hosts .
M	tso have managed to provide a £££ service for a £ price , not only that but their personal support is second to none and puts a lot of bigger / well_known hosts to shame .
M	when the company i work for ( a web development agency ) were looking to change hosts i didn ' t hesitate to recommend tso - we ' ve now been using them for a year and haven ' t had any_issues ( apart_from some network downtime , which affected everyone and wasn ' t tsos fault )
M	i ordered a 00x00 photobook with super gloss finish and lay - flat pages .
M	the software was a breeze to use and it took be about 00_hours to layout around 000 photos over 00 - odd pages including selecting the photos from my computer .
M	unlike most places you order from they keep you fully informed whilst they are creating your book , with an order progress page showing you when its been printed , bound etc
M	my first book arrived and unfortunately the first few dozen pages had stuck together on the edge where it seems the glue used to stick the gloss on hadn ' t quite dried when it packed up .
M	even with this defect i was simply stunned by the book - it was amazing !
M	the quality of the materials used , the colours in the photos was superb .
M	i contacted albelli customer support about the sticking pages , they asked for a few pictures as evidence which i provided and they came back - no problem , we will re - print you a new one straight_away .
M	it arrived today without any_problems and like the first it is simply stunning quality .
M	i would definitely_recommend albelli to friends .
M	we had a great choice of packages and , having picked one , the day went very smoothly .
M	we had a great time , and didn ' t have any_problems with being a " big group of lads ", which i have experienced on other stags .
M	great experience , i ' ll certainly use them again .
M	i ' ve ordered from these_guys a few_times now , and each time they have been fantastic .
M	great selection of gear and great prices , and fast and efficent postage .
M	they often beat wiggle prices if not they at_least match wiggles prices , i would rather order from these_guys than wiggle , beacuse if anything were to go_wrong , at_least you can get in touch with probikekit ,
M	great website , great service ,
M	thank_you
M	great service , has a wide_range of lenses to choose from , very good prices and quick delivery .
M	a * service , thank_you
M	found tyre_shopper somehow on google , have usually used competitors of theirs .
M	however when they came up in the search_results , i found them very easy to use , all the infomation that is needed is displayed and are the best prices i have found , very easy payment and booking process .
M	and the tyre shop is more_than happy to deal with you after .
M	great website .
M	thank_you
M	great service , great price , quick and efficent .
M	would reccomend .
M	thank_you
M	been ordering from this site for a few_years , never had an issue .
M	i ' ve ordered from cjs_cd_keys three times now and each time has been absolutely fantastic .
M	it ' s fast and the keys work flawlessly .
M	great prices and great service .
M	i brought a costume for a fancy_dress party and won best outfit .
M	but not only was the costume great but it arrived very quickly letting me know where it was through text , without having to look or track my items down .
M	also all items are at affordable prices and have everything you need to stand out .
M	i would recommend this site to anyone without any second thoughts about it
M	joop homme is my favorite and the price on fragrancedirect is the cheapest i found online :_d
M	this is my 0rd phone i ' ve sold to mazumamobile , for this time and given it was a bank_holiday when i submitted my request , anyway bag came wednesday phone returned same day , received email thursday advising payment auth ' d and payment was in my bank same day now thats service , you can ' t go_wrong dose what it says on the tin .
M	forget the great customer_service , site usability and low_prices , my favourite thing about stand - out is the diversity of their range in modern styles , ranging_from high_street prices up to premium brands .
M	just purchased a tweed jacket and some brogues , great selection and price , no need to scour the net when it ' s all in one place .
M	easy to navigate site that gave me a wide_choice of options , which obviously led to me picking the cheapest ( that is clean ) place that is available !
M	thanks hostelbookers . com !
M	friendly and well_mannered staff eager to get that claim completed !
M	fast_shipping and awesome free_samples every time .
M	only place i shop for all my supplement_needs .
M	gr0 communication & fast payment .. easiest £_00 i ' ve made in my life !!!!
M	!
M	i have ordered many many items from amazon .
M	i am in the army and they offer some of the best support by companies for service people deployed on operations using bfpo addresses .
M	every purchase has arrived on time and any drop in price in the short_term is refunded .
M	excellent !
M	the website was easy to use , the envelopes arrived on time and the money was transfered straight into my account .
M	easy , fast and reliable !
M	a lot of fun , and some good prizes on offer .
M	assuming my prizes come through i would recommend this site to anyone .
M	check it out .
M	very knowledgeable , polite and friendly staff .
M	as someone that is a novice to rc cars i was treated well , and i am delighted with service and product i have recently brought .
M	the staff listened to what i wanted and gave great advice and recommendations .
M	i would recommend modelsport without_hesitation .
M	i ' m so pleased with the way this company dealt_with me .
M	i made a few errors when i was ordering and they were most accommodating when i contacted them .
M	their delivery was on time and when projected .
M	i would be more_than happy to use them again !
M	i would reccommend this company to you .
M	after perusing steve ' s website , i went on a date last_night armed with what i had learned and had the most amazing first date ever , it was incredible .
M	i didn ' t sleep with her but i kept in mind the things i ' d seen on steve ' s blogs and videos of him chasing girls .
M	specifically the way he didn ' t try to do anything special but just stayed centered and did what he wanted .
M	as a result , i didn ' t have an ounce of anxiety ; my mouth wasn ' t dry and my hands weren ' t shaking .
M	at first , holding eye contact didn ' t feel natural but after 0 minutes i thought ' f_*** it ' and would just look at her and enjoy looking at her .
M	there were no awkward silences .
M	one of us always thought of something to say and it was often her that did which suited me just fine .
M	we spoke for three hours before i had to leave ( for the last train of the night ) with both of us saying we wish i could have stayed longer .
M	i did say if i missed the train i would have to catch one in the morning and she said ( in a relaxed way ) that she wouldn ' t have sex on the first date but i swear that wouldn ' t have been true .
M	we got on so well ; when we left the pub , i kissed her , again and again .
M	it felt so natural , the way i always imagined a first kiss should feel .
M	she was so into it that my hands started to wander and i gave her bum a little squeeze .
M	if i had the opportunity to stay longer , i think she would have been too worked up by the end to say no .
M	i have , however , arranged a second date with her .
M	next time , i ' ll arrange it so no train timetable cuts our time short .
M	of course it helped that she was very attracted to me to begin with .
M	this wasn ' t exactly a cold approach and she asked me out but in the past i would have still mucked it up by being too terrified to believe i was worthy of her .
M	i can see such simple value in what steve teaches .
M	i didn ' t know it could be this easy or natural .
M	i especially loved part 0 of the first date article that said just ' treat her like your girlfriend .'
M	it ' s amazing how we only become open to ideas when someone_else says they can be true .
M	i ' d love to go see steve but can ' t afford it right now .
M	i believe he plans to publish a book , when he does i will_definitely buy it .
M	i can wholeheartedly_recommend steve ' s teachings .
M	very quick and professional service .
M	postage pack came straight_away .
M	money was received within 0 days , even faster_than_expected .
M	very effective and prompt communication via_email .
M	can 000_% recommend .
M	wickedly fast service .
M	digital content codes are recieved instantly and physical items are delivered rapidly .
M	no hassle what so ever .
M	highly_recommended company
M	i ' m very happy .
M	post bag arrived after 0 days .
M	service was quick and efficient .
M	just wanted to drop a quick note to thank_you for the service and particularly for the sfe - 0000 frame , which i hope will be brought back into stock even if at a higher price .
M	it isn ' t always easy to find frames with such a small depth ( which i ' ve found suits my prescription ) or retailers that bother to list this as a measurement .
M	i booked through lastminute for a single nights stay with no breakfast for my partners 00st in a secret london hotel .
M	i found out the next_day that the hotel would have been cheaper had it been booked through the hotels website and would have included breakfast in the price !
M	i rang lastminute and they stated they would not offer a price_match past 00_hours of booking !
M	( it was less_than 00_hours that i rang )
M	after numerous e_- mails back and forth to different managers and supervisors i came to no resolution .
M	however the hotel staff made every effort upon our arrival to correct this error .
M	last_minute offered no such resolution !
M	i will not be booking with them again !
M	i have only ordered twice from these_guys and i have to say they have been great .
M	had to call once to chase up an order which was my fault i have to say not theirs and they .
M	even refunded the delivery costs !
M	lovely guys and i wish them all the best .
M	0 thing i will say but they still get 0_stars is they have quite a low stock of things which is a shame as few things i wanted was not available .
M	recommend these 0000 %
M	hi
M	took time to decide which camera to buy .
M	tekshop000 had a good price .
M	i placed an order on - line and got it delivered in two days . i choose 0 - 0 days shipping from there website . they emailed when they shipped the order .. i never had a need to phone them so cant say how good they are on the phone .
M	poor reception , avoid !
M	a good company !
M	i ' ll never use them again !
M	such a bad company !
M	i have used them for many many years !
M	just brilliant , highly_recommend
M	they are disgraceful to sellers !
M	support fraudulent_activity !
M	great web_designers !
M	do really good job !
M	you won ' t believe_how bat their commercial support is !
M	and you just cannot avoid it sometimes , as they own the lines !
M	:(
M	bbc we pay tv licence for it ...
M	tesco is crap !
M	i ' ve bought a storage compartment another day .
M	highly_recommend
M	i do not like monopolies !
M	i just like ba , used it a lot ove the years
M	i ordered flowers for international delivery almost a week before the delivery date .
M	they failed to arrive on time .
M	when i contacted online help all i got told was " well , we ' ve put the order through to the local_florist " and " perhaps if you leave it a couple more hours " the last one was at 0pm local time !
M	i waiting feed_back ...
M	i ' ve had great service now , for over 00 parcels .
M	nothing has gone wrong , and now 0 of them have arrived the day after sending .
M	one even on a saturday .
M	to get that sort of service i would have had to pay just under £_00 from another courier .
M	it ' s a nice easy way to send a parcel , especially without the hassle of the long queue at the post_office .
M	excellent service and super_fast delivery
M	i used to use inkshop printing for my leaflets , but upon the referral of a friend i tried printing . com .
M	johnny and the boys done a top job .
M	an all_round better product .
M	i first started using knox at the beginning of last season and now i ' d never look back !
M	the design of all products are ao highly developed that it allows me to focus on my riding - ( the important bit ) and feel_confident and comfortable with the safety gear im using !
M	would highly_recommend to anyone .
M	i have been on many sites for supplements , but i have used bodybuilding_warehouse for a while .
M	an this is now the only website i do use to get my supplements from .
M	there is honestly nothing bad to say about bodybuilding_warehouse , they make customer_service come first .
M	i would highly_recommend this to everyone who is in the training or gym environment .
M	they get a 00 / 00 from me .
M	i was very pleased with the service i received from servicing_stop again .
M	collection and delivery were punctual and cheerfully carried_out ; contact with the personnel carrying out the service was helpful and informative and the costs were all very reasonable .
M	will be back next year !
M	once again i been left feeling extremely happy with the service i received .
M	i found exactly_what i was looking for with other alternatives available too .
M	delivery was swift and fast .
M	very pleased with service and items received
M	bad customer_service .
M	they sent the wrong coloured item that i ordered .
M	instead of e_- mailing me and asking me if a different_colour would be o . k they just sent me it .
M	they will not answer my e_- mails , i have sent 0 to them .
M	i would consider defiantly not using them .
M	equipyourtrip . com if your reading this i ' m order number [ removed_] and a very unhappy customer .
M	i ordered sim_city and after ordering was told the 0th then the 0th .
M	i have contacted cj keys so many_times regarding this and all i get is the same auto response .
M	i have seen other people paying extra for the key ( game gone up to £_00 . 00 ) and people are getting instant delivery however if you order the game before you do not get it .
M	do not use these for keys if you ask for a refund they will not give it you and when you order a game if someone pays more they get the keys .
M	discovered the website completely by surprise and so glad i did .
M	so far , i ' ve bought 0 games and all codes arrived with minutes and all worked_fine .
M	excellent polite service , very helpful and met all my needs .
M	product was as_described .
M	will def use service again for my companies 00 year anniversary .
M	they pay more_than anyone_else and payment is fast
M	very good service fast deliver and friendly drivers :) number 0
M	orders come through quickly and are priced exceptionally well compared to peers .
M	will happily do business with again .
M	huge choice for great price ...... always use them ...
M	i have ordered many_times from bbw and have always found the service very reliable .
M	i have also asked questions before via social_media and they are prompt to answer .
M	overall i rate them highly and have stopped using my previous_supplier
M	the guitar i ordered was dispached and delivered very quickly , it was an effortless experience .
M	this is what internet shopping it meant to be about !
M	i ' ve had cd_keys from these_guys twice now , and both_times the experience has been quick and painless .
M	they are by_far the cheapest on the market when it comes to standalone keys , their checkout and authentication process is fast , effective , and makes you feel secure in your purchase .
M	they may look slightly sketchy to most , but i believe this to be a case of ' if it ' s too good to be true , it likely isn ' t '.
M	these_guys are the exception to that rule .
M	i will_definitely be using them again .
M	hello , its ambar price .
M	imperial_visa is fantastic needed a indefinite leave visa for my wife tried the border agency website there was no appointments at all !
M	tried other firms but choose imperial_visa and turned_out fantastic they treated us well and also done all the job for us with no hassle or problems at all .
M	i strongly_recommend using them as i will be using them again in a year ;-)
M	the prices are the cheapest i can find .
M	the only_downfall is the shipping price is high .
M	it cuts most of the savings on the items themselves but still saved some money .
M	i would only wish for a constant shipping cost instead of variable cost .
M	my service didn ' t come on the dates it was due , i decided to get onto the team at parcel0go and spoke to an extremely_helpful member of the team ' ashley ' in about 0 minutes my service was rebooked free of charge quickly and easily .
M	im extremely happy with this service and ill continue to use over and over , also thank_you ashley , fantastic member of the team .
M	0 *!!
M	!
M	with this site , it was extremely easy to find exactly_what i was looking for .
M	always the best price and accommodations .
M	the booking process is very transparent and straight through .
M	congratulations .
M	i recommend .
M	overall good but wasn ' t very happy about the part getting phone there by a certain time as it may reduce the amount .
M	but part from that it been a ok experience
M	really chuffed to pieces with the speed and efficiency of the service provided by urban_industry .
M	the clothes are awesome too , just an all_round happy customer .
M	big up my yard clothing too , just purchased a tee and i ' m well happy with it !
M	took my car for a simple oil change ( i think even my 0 years old_daughter could have done it better_than their " engineer ") and the next_day when i was in the inside lane on the motorway the oil filter what was not installed properly got untighten and just let all the oil splashed on the road and my engine got seized .
M	it all happened within few seconds so i had to react quickly and try to pull over into the hard shoulder while i put my and my passengers life in danger .
M	i have managed to pull over and i immediately called them where they were happy to do an inspection straight_away .
M	at the garage they admitted they made an error and their organized a hire_car .
M	at this point i was still happy even i knew i will never see my car again because they handled my problem quickly they understood me and they tried to help .
M	but than the nightmare started , they forwarded my case to their insurance company .
M	their insurance company never called me proactively , i was the one who was chasing them all the time .
M	first they said they will fix my car , than they said they can not , than they said again they will fix it .
M	it took a month when i got a final decision that they will do a write off and they will offer some money .
M	they came up first with a ridiculous value what i refused , than they came up with a value what was more realistic compared to the market value however i have highlighted them my concern that i had other expenses as well on the damaged car ( tires only bought in december , still got tax on it , had a full_tank of petrol , etc_.)
M	but i was told they will only give money for the value of the car and the money will not cover anything_else so i have to investigate this further with national_tyres .
M	fair_enough i said , why would they pay for it so i emailed national `_s head_office where i managed to meet with the worst customer_service experience i have ever had .
M	i have rang them at_least 00 times , emailed them at_least 0 times but they never came back to me with a straight answer .
M	i think they have hired a parrot who can only repeat a very standard response : it is with the regional_manager .
M	now they want the hire_car back even we are not sorted and they recon i will not get an compensation because the insurance company paid for all of my expenses what is a lie because i have recorded phone call where they clearly_state , they will not pay other expenses .
M	i am really not expecting too much money and this is not the way how i want to be rich but i think i have the right expecting compensation after they just killed my beloved car .
M	i am shocked that a company offering such poor service can still be trading .
M	when i first bought the camera from valuebasket , i did so from a company that at_least appeared legitimate ; a smart website and reasonable prices .
M	my first phone call to the company , having realised my order was taking a while longer_than it probably should , left me feeling reassured rather_than concerned ; my order was apparently upgraded to ' priority ' which , having read all the forums on valuebasket , appears to be the case with everyone ; as it says in disney ' s the incredibles ' if everyone is special , no one is '.
M	i quickly realised all my calls and emails , each answered with a few copy and paste paragraphs from ' how to be good at customer_service ', were not helping and , when not of my questions could be answered , i gave up .
M	they could not say when my camera was likely to arrive or tell the cause of the delay .
M	i cancelled my order .
M	then the problems have really started .
M	despite emailing and calling every day , i have been told - by different agents - that my refund will take 0 / 0 / 0 days to be ' initiated '.
M	i understand that the process to send the money back may take some time when their company is in hong_kong , but pressed them as to why it would take that long to press a button to ' initiate ' it .
M	again , all replies read ' we are very sorry for you inconvenience we understand times like this can be frustrating etc etc etc '.
M	all i want is my money to be returned but there is still no sign .
M	fortunately , rbs will be assisting because of the dispute and hopefully it can then be resolved .
M	i was really pleased with the purchase and particularly with the customer_service i received .
M	as usual a straight_forward service from print what team and our key account_manager miia .
M	we ordered 0000 compliment slips
M	required urgently for our client , after_placing the order our artwork was checked and the process from checkout to delivery was
M	seamless , the product arrived on time with no errors .
M	we have noticed a number of improvements to the way that print what are
M	operating and many of the tedious delivery delays that occurred last_year have been sorted , plus we now have a dedicated account
M	manager as a key customer .
M	also the new way they package printing into bundles with bank note style bands is great for ensuring the
M	product doesn ' t get damaged in transit and makes it easier to store !
M	great job .
M	i have just leased my third car through nvc .
M	the first two personal leases and the latest one though my business .
M	as usual i am staggered at how ridiculously straight_forward and efficient the process is .
M	you find the car you want ( they will sometime match if you find cheaper ), they send you a quote , you click on a link and complete the simple form , they take £_000 processing fee , do a credit check and within a week send you all your paperwork by email along with very clear_instructions , delivery date etc .
M	couldn ' t be easier !
M	when it comes to delivery the cars are sourced from main dealers around the country and delivered by a member of staff from that dealership - the handover is done at your home or office ( i always drop them back to the station to say thanks ), and that ' s it the car is yours to enjoy - until the renewal .
M	highly highly_recommended nvc and cass tann who is very helpful and always available to talk .
M	well_done .
M	i ' ve been using their ebay store to buy guitar_strings for a while now and cannot_fault them .
M	items are delivered quickly .
M	never had a problem when contacting the staff with any_questions , they always get back to you quickly and seem happy to help .
M	i called for my toner later on in the day and the representative was really helpful as out toner was really low .
M	it was guaranteed still for next_day and was there first thing in the morning .
M	as from now i have an_email address to use so the toners from now on can be ordered from there which is far more efficient for me .
M	all in all a great service and the toner is fine and there were no probems with the product at all .
M	this site is incredibly easy to navigate and the deals make it so cheap !
M	the price adjusting makes sure you get the cheapest prices for sure .
M	worth it and recommendable !
M	the high shipping cost is definitely worth it with all the free bonuses they offer with they ' re already extremely competitive_prices .
M	i ' ve started using this website around a year_ago and now get all my supplements from supplementwarehouse . com .
M	although i don ' t get to utilize it as much as i ' d like ; i still enjoy their deals .
M	its so easy to get the best price with the price beater option .
M	just put in competitors price and web url and bam , better price :) i love this
M	prices are being constantly raised for a constantly diminishing service .
M	this seems to be their business goal at the moment , put prices as high as we can , while lowering service as much as we can .
M	it ' s all about margins with these people .
M	they aren ' t going to be around in 00 years unless they change drastically .
M	i know so many people moving away .
M	i once went 0 weeks without internet access because a mast was down in my city_centre , i was told to just " wait it out " over the phone by customer_services .
M	very fast delivery , great price .
M	will use again .
M	basically the place we rent from gave edf the wrong meter serial and reading when we moved in , so when it came time to enter our real readings the system was like ' we can ' t let you do that dave '.
M	easy fix , i ' ll just phone edf let them know the issue get it resolved in a matter of seconds , afterall it ' s what a couple of strings / integers in a database right ?
M	oh how i was so so wrong .
M	five months down the line , contacted numerous complaints departments , have a phone bill of £_00 from contacting them altogether over the months , sent numerous_emails and website contact forms .
M	nothing resolved , every time it ' s " we ' re looking into this ".
M	sure you are .
M	in the meantime i can ' t submit readings so i ' m being charged over the odds for gas !
M	which is likely why they aren ' t bothered , after all their making decent money from me .
M	nothing but a massive scam and i wont ever use them again for the rest of my life .
M	wouldn ' t recommend these to an enemy never mind a friend .
M	a shame you can ' t rate lower_than one star , doesn ' t even deserve that .
M	after having some problems getting my mattress supplied and delivered i was left without the one i wanted particularly due to supply issues , the director has since phoned and apologised personally about this .
M	it was obvious he cared a great deal about customer_satisfaction and his companies reputation ( which is a rare thing these days ).
M	he ' s now arranged for me to get the mattress i was originally after ( with no extra charge ), as well as keeping the old one so i couldn ' t be_happier .
M	after being reassured my issues were a one off , and that they take customer_satisfaction seriously , i genuinely believe them as they didn ' t have to call me to sort anything out , that was their decision .
M	would order from here in future my faith in them has been restored as a customer .
M	to sum up i ' ve come away quite happy and reassured that there are companies out there that still care about their reputations and customers !
M	was extremely impressed with the promotional discounts .
M	i would recommend this site to anyone , it has no server issues and is very easy to use
M	i recieved the serial in seconds , and there was no fussing around !
M	0 / 0 !
M	i took my fender jaguar in for a set_up and it came back in perfect working order with no_problems , until after a couple of times of playing it i realised something was wrong and the guitar was unplayable .
M	i took it back to the shop and they spotted the problem straight_away and sorted it out for free - turns_out the bridge had fallen down and they soon corrected it by raising it back up again and gave me a free allen key so i could do it myself if it ever happened again .
M	all the staff are friendly and very helpful and i ' d recommend them to anyone .
M	emailed you back because your product did not work .
M	advised i would send you faulty_goods back and requested them to be replaced .
M	sent goods .
M	nothing .
M	nada .
M	emailed you to ask what was happening .
M	no response .
M	nothing at all .
M	you have debited my card for my money and i have nothing to show for it .
M	your company is an_absolute_disgrace and i shall be sharing this on facebook and asking it to be shared if i do not get some recompense .
M	very very disappointed and out of pocket
M	badly treated customer
M	the service arbico offered me was excellent and very professional , from my first queries right up until now .
M	i was informed every other day with information about the status of the delivery , and any useful updates were recommended to me .
M	the pc arrived on the day specified on day 0 , and was packaged_securely .
M	the actual pc was excellent value for money and i love it , any minor technical queries i did have were answered_promptly and concisely , and they were quickly resolved .
M	excellent service , i would recommend them to anyone_looking to buy a pc .
M	a satisfied customer .
M	a sales guy at a nutrition and wellness store actually recommended that i check out supplementwarehouse . com to find good quality protein_powder for very cheap .
M	he said that he doesn ' t buy any protein from his store but rather from this website .
M	i was also able to find another product that he recommended to me on this website .
M	supplementwarehouse . com price matched that item for me and actually lowered the price a little_bit from a competitor ' s website .
M	i think that was a very good example of the great customer_service i received and i was able to buy both of the items for cheaper_than just the protein_powder in the store .
M	very cool !
M	i had a list of products to order and founf them easily and processed an order .
M	delivery was as stated on the site with the brushes well_packed .
M	envelope sent out quickly with easy to follow_instructions .
M	even when my phone was delayed on the way back to them as a result if the snow they emailed me to say they would honour the full_amount even if it arrived there after the expiry_date .
M	would definitely_recommend to others .
M	quality product , fast service , unfortunately too potent for my liking d - aa gave me a panic attack .
M	ive been dissappointed with play recently , these_guys did it cheaper , faster and the product was working as it should .
M	my friends game was from play , arrived late and when he tried to play the disk it failed , so a return on the cards !
M	ok , ea ' s fault but just added to the misery .
M	mine arrived on release day and worked great .
M	will use again int he future
M	the price_matching makes it one of the best .
M	it has easy_navigation throughout the website and makes me want to buy more supplements because of the great deals !
M	first time customer here ... will_definitely be back !
M	way cheaper_than any store you can drive to and they have everything you need .
M	great descriptions of all of their products and it all makes_sense even for someone just starting out in the world of supplements .
M	thanks for a good experience ..... you have a new customer !
M	placed an order for some hardware on a wednesday and i was gigging with it on a friday .
M	great service .
M	very quick despatch / delivery and good prices !
M	the service that they provided was excellent , ewan was so helpful and easy to deal with i will definatly be booking with them again .
M	i work full time and do not have time to look for movers , as well as pay the prices for some of them .
M	shiply was easy convenient and i have already_recommended it to all of my friends that are moving .
M	i typed in my phones model number , it gave me a price and instructions how to complete .
M	within 0 days i had the cash in my bank !
M	parcels are hardly_ever collected when they should be .
M	way too often i get replies saying ' we apologise for the inconvenience ' with no explanation whatsoever .
M	and then to be informed that the parcel will be collected not the following_day , but up to 0 days_later ?!
M	shocking customer_service .
M	probably one of the worst companies i ' ve ever_dealt_with in my life .
M	brilliant information .
M	sensational .
M	use it everyday !
M	didn ' t think to inform me once when my bill hit an unusually high amount !
M	a courtesy text would have been nice .
M	orange , you are the worst mobile operator in existence .
M	bought a laptop off them .
M	£ 0000 .... money most definately not well spent .
M	professional con - men run this company , and if you believe otherwise , you ' re most definately a conman .
M	legends .
M	full stop
M	used them once and low and behold , the courier driver didn ' t even turn_up for his collection !
M	nor did the company call to let me know the driver wasn ' t going to be able to collect !
M	had to contact them myself and they told me due to ' operational reasons ', the parcel would be collected the following_day !
M	was told i will be contacted in the following few_days for a slight discount but its been 0 weeks and have heard_nothing !
M	worst courier company in the world !
M	please make the world happy and go_bankrupt !
M	kind_regards ...
M	how can a bad review possibly be left for this company ?
M	carry on doing what your doing !
M	wish i invented the site !
M	:)
M	flew with ryannair for the first time in my life and actually can ' t report back with any_problems ?!
M	can ' t say i ' ll choose them again !
M	ha !
M	quick and hassle_free .
M	never have had a problem with them .
M	great for everything !
M	pre_- ordered the new dewalt kit ( not realising it was a pre_- order ) phoned ffx , who were very polite and helpful in explaining things to me .
M	product was delivered on the day that they told me and within the one hour_window .
M	i am absolutely thrilled with their service , communication and products and would have no_hesitation in using / recommending them in the future .
M	in this day and age it is hard to find a company that ticks all the boxes , but my word - ffx do !
M	i was sceptical about phone_recycling_companies but this was really hassle_free .
M	completed the form online - pouch received in 00hrs - posted back same day - money in my account the next_day .
M	this was the easiest transaction i have every completed .
M	i am must_say that the protein_powder i bought here iss easily one of if not the best i have used .
M	it mixes almost_instantly and tastes fantastic ( cherry bakewell ) i will be happy to recommend and will_definitely use this company again and again .
M	o and excellent prices to
M	excellent range of stock , gr0 prices and loads of good offers .
M	have used a few_times and will keep in using .
M	andysylus
M	i have been with 000 reg for about 0 years now .
M	throughout this time i have had no downtime that i know of or any customer has informed me of .
M	i had to call customer_service once since i have been with them and whilst i cannot speak for others it was a pleasure .
M	i now have 0 domains registered with them and looking to add more .
M	000gifts . co . uk and pure000 . co .
M	i would not look anywhere_else for my domain_names .
M	i cannot be_happier with this company .
M	i moved here from another provider some time ago and to be honest i cannot_fault the staff or the product .
M	first things first , if you have a problem a phone call will resolve it .
M	i have not had an issue yet that was not resolved in a 0 minute phone call .
M	( most of these problems were me not reading the help files properly ) then there are always answers on the forum as well .
M	the software works_perfectly straight_away and keeps on working .
M	it all works exactly as it says on the website .
M	they are more_than happy to allow third_party companies to work on your sites for you .
M	you will not be sorry choosing this company
M	to be honest i cannot rate them high enough .
M	00 / 00
M	i used ekm powershop for about 0 months and have to say in my entire time with ekm i was insulted by the staff .
M	frequently lied to over problems with my website .
M	they would tell me the problem was only on my computer yet i would have customers ringing me up .
M	you cannot access their forum until you join .
M	the reason for this is because you will see a lot of dusgruntled customers on there .
M	not all as most have been banned from the forum because ekm dont want to deal with them .
M	beware of what you read .
M	i would check out some online retail forums or online business forums and find the general view on ekm before you ever sign_up .
M	on the whole i would not even send my worst_enemy to ekm at all .
M	don ' t even get me started on the fact that nothing actually works as it should on there .
M	mike was absolutely cracking .
M	arrived_promptly and did the job carefully and smoothly .
M	i was enthusiastic about hearing about brakes on the drive , considering mine will need replacing in the near_future .
M	great customer_service , would recommend mike to anyone
M	thanks for the brilliant service
M	it gave me my unlock code immediately , and i am now using my htc one s on any network i fancy !
M	great speed , all transactions are safely processed through paypal , so there is no fraud .
M	simply type your imei in , pay £ 0 . 00 or $ 0 . 00 , and be on your way !
M	highly_recommended , try now !
M	cannot recommend these_guys enough .
M	i bought a very expensive guitar from them , and some other equipment , and they were really friendly and helpful the whole way through .
M	i finally ordered the guitar and it was delivered on time the next_day .
M	couldn ' t be_happier !
M	now that i ' ve bought something big from them , they ' ve upgraded my account to vip , which means i get a discount applied to everything .
M	never_experienced customer treatment like this in my life !
M	so stoked .
M	buy from these people .
M	i ' ve bought quite a few things from guitarguitar - mostly guitar accessories and the like .
M	whenever i ' ve had a question or , when i once had to return something , they were always a huge pleasure to deal with .
M	when i was considering buying a guitar from them , they were extremely_helpful , didn ' t pressure me for a second to make a sale , and gave me honest and impartial_advice .
M	i eventually bought a different guitar , but if guitarguitar had had it in stock at the time i would have bought it from them , even if it had been a bit more_expensive , just cos they ' ve been so cool every time i ' ve ever had dealings with them .
M	definitely the first place i look if i want to buy anything for my guitars .
M	or maybe add to my collection ...
M	bluepark is a superb system and the support provided by the entire bluepark team is exceptional .
M	the system has an abundance of useful_features and tools .
M	i have been with bluepark for over four years now and i would highly_recommend this stable and well supported platform to anyone .
M	a stumbled_across this company and couldn ' t be more thankful .
M	what a brilliant company with a even better service .
M	keep up the good work and i will be sure to recommend you to my fellow gamers !.
M	after taking £_00 from my account without purchase , i decided to call paypal .
M	biggest_mistake of my life .
M	their call_centre was operated by constant questions from a machine .
M	at the end of the day , my problem was not solved .
M	had to pay £_00 for a service that did not solve my problem , even more_than the amount that was taken out of my account .
M	this is a scam .
M	avoid calling them at all cost , literally ..
M	i must_admit , this was the first time something of such had happened in my years of using the service .
M	nevertheless , their call_centre is a massive con
M	i really_appreciate the service from this site .
M	my pc is fantastic and was well worth the price .
M	also i ' m happy to say it arrived fairly quickly .
M	i look_forward to future_purchases here .
M	i always appreciate the low_prices and great deals i find on amazon
M	this company is great , it has everything that a professional or amateur bodybuilder or workout enthusiast could ever need !
M	the service is excellent and the website is easy to maneuver through and find just the right product you are looking for !
M	two_thumbs_up from this guy !!
M	!
M	honestly , when it comes to fitness , supplementwarehouse carries more_than even amazon .
M	i use amazon for a ton of stuff in every_aspect of my life , but that giant retailer still could not compete with supplement_warehouse ' s supply and prices .
M	to be honest , i know there are some reviews floating around the internet about the security of the site .
M	that is old news .
M	supplementwarehouse never wanted that stuff to happen , and when the site was breached , they upped their security , and it ' s top_notch now .
M	with those issues out of the way , it ' s definitely the place to go for your supplement_needs .
M	good service , quick dispatch of tickets , would recommend
M	i ordered flowers for my gf and have countless_times tried to contact iflorist to find out information_regarding its delivery time , and to track it a service i paid extra for !
M	i have not received any reply apart_from a pathetic automated_response and there online_chat doesn ' t work .
M	there is no way of calling them as there is no phone number , if the flowers do not get delivered today i will be furious !
M	communication is disgraceful !
M	i was kept up to date on the status of the order , and item arrived only a couple of days after it got back in stock .
M	the website is well_designed , there is a universe of supplements to choose from , but all the info you ' re looking for is available .
M	shipping is fast and secure , never had any_issues , and am definitiely glad to be a repeat buyer .
M	i bought an epiphone bass , my first bass actually , its just awesome , it play ' s like a beast , sounds_like a beast , the tone and sound that comes from it is just awesome !
M	its a good thing i bought it , its a good price and great guitar , having lots of fun with it , and especially when i crank the distortion up to extreme metal , its just insane , the sound is just pure metal with a sprincle of head bangers !
M	xd
M	they matched prices from other_websites that had slightly_cheaper pricing on two products .
M	they gave a 0 % lower_price when matching !
M	saved me tons of money and will buy from here again and again !
M	plus forgot to mention all the free_samples they gave me !
M	just great would recommend to anyone
M	had purchased battlefield_0 for just about £_00 the code arrived to my mail instantly !
M	today i purchased assassins_creed revelations for my friend and got the key_instantly again !
M	what can i say if your looking to buy games for cheap price and instant delivery then look no further cjs_cd_keys are for you friend !
M	very good service would recommend it to everyone .

M	it ' s a joke mazuma all the way !.
M	thank ' s for great service mazuma !
M	absolutely great service speedy , got exactly_what i needed .

M	would buy there again !
M	great shop .
M	easy to use website .
M	great products .
M	fast delivery .
M	will buy from them again
M	brilliant service , delivered on the day advised and very very competitive_prices i will be using dolphin_fitness again and again !
M	i ordered off myprotein after reviewing the ingredients and comparing them to many top_brands and they seem to be more or less the same .
M	lots of people moan_about taste but i dont use supplements as a treat i use them to achieve my goals alongside training hard .
M	but in all honesty it doesnt taste any worse then any other shake i have tried .
M	i will be switching over permantley to using myprotein from now on !
M	excellent range of products , far better_than available in high_street chains .
M	staff were incredibly attentive and helpful , all in all a very enjoyable_experience .
M	i have been a regular user of chemical for almost a year and a half now .
M	i primarily buy my vinyl records here but also have done some clothes shopping .
M	service is great for both .
M	vinyl is always very well_packaged and ships fairly fast .
M	i ' ve never had a warped or broke vinyl yet !
M	the clothes are always well_packed too but they usually come with records anyways !
M	can ' t comment on their customer support as i ' ve never had to use it .
M	:) will_continue using chemical in the future .
M	great prices , free mechandise , and fast_shipping
M	fast and brilliant service highly_recommend
M	incredibly happy with the customer_service .
M	delivery was prompt , over all a great service and great experience .
M	they match all prices , fast_shipping , and website was a breeze to use .
M	i switched over from bodybuilding . com and i am not going back
M	convenient and cheaper_than anyone_else .
M	brandsumo have literally from the ground up built us a ecommerce platform that can not only deal with sales in a efficient well thought out way , but can also handle our finance options we offer to our customers .
M	every_aspect of the website does exactly_what we need it to do .
M	on top of the great look and feel of the website they have built us and the second to none functionality allowing us to do exactly_what we need on a daily_basis with ease - the customer focus is 000_%.
M	whatever we have needed to be customised , edited , or re - build brandsumo have done for us no questions_asked .
M	the prices are great and these_guys are well worth the money - the work ethic these_guys have is exactly_what you need when running a business and exactly_what we look for when hiring professionals to do a job .
M	fantastic work !
M	well first time with bairstow eves and will be the last time also .
M	the contractors they use are useless , their attitudes are - it ' s always someone_else ' s fault .
M	you need to speak to this person that person .
M	no sense of responsibility nor customer_satisfaction .
M	took them weeks to even return a phone call .
M	took them months to get things fixed with the house when requested .
M	really bad , liers and con_artists .
M	if you want half a job or the job to never be finished then look no further .
M	if you want to wait months for them to even contact you , then lie that they have the wrong number , then lie that they have contacted your partner , then lie some more - then use trent maintenance .
M	useless !
M	at first it seems like a great offer , cash back for something you would perhaps buy anyway .
M	however , do not be_fooled by the high cash back amounts - if you are willing to wait up to a year for cash back , then it to come back lower_than stated , then it to take another 0 months , constant emails back and forth , messages , getting annoyed and posting on the facebook fan page , being told to be patient again .
M	it ' s a shame this could be a really good site and a really good business but they are either useless themselves or the companies affiliate team they use are useless .
M	how can it take over 0 months for them to just look at the fact that someone has purchased a product with the same name , address , date of birth etc etc ??!
M	!
M	very impressed with smart play zone and smart way imports .
M	they provide a top quality service and hassle_free returns .
M	even more_importantly their customer_service is second to none .
M	never had a problem with these_guys and i have purchased from them a number of times for our business .
M	really really bad .
M	ordered a bed which came faulty .
M	sent the pictures and was agreed that it was a manufacturing_fault and that the item needed to be returned .
M	charged us £_00 for collection , didn ' t inform us how the bed needed to be packaged so when the bed wasn ' t taken charged another £_00 on top .
M	really bad customer_service and poor quality items !!!
M	avoid at all costs .
M	they also operate under the trade name crazypricebeds .
M	really really bad .
M	ordered a bed which came faulty .

M	really bad customer_service and poor quality items !!!
M	avoid at all costs .
M	used them twice .
M	once they delivered on the wrong day .
M	0nd time they didnt even collect the item after i waited in all day .
M	please do not use this company and amazon get_rid of them , they are useless .
M	yes i would like to inform yodel of my review .
M	so yodel ........ you can not run a business this way .
M	0000 + reviews and you have 0 star out of 00 .
M	does that not say anything ?
M	you will need a miracle to save your reputation and a miracle to keep any big contracts you have with amazon , boots etc .
M	after thousands of complaints do you not think it is time to sort your company out once and for all .
M	i feel sorry for any shareholder , customer or anyone who has the bad luck of dealing_with you guys .
M	also put a customer_service number on your website , and employ some decent staff !
M	using the online customer_service was far_greater than i expected , katie was really helpful and quick to respond .
M	great friendly service :-)
M	[_name ] from parcel to go did an amazing job fixing a problem i had .
M	she should win a prize !
M	i contacted parcel0go with some concerns and got a very friendly operator called emma who answered all my questions straight_away in a clear and understandable manner resolving all my concerns straight_away if only all people could be this helpful .
M	thanks
M	i ' ve ordered from modelbits twice now and both_times i received the orders within 00_hours ( perfect when you ' re missing those last few bits to complete a conversion ).
M	i ' ve generally found the prices of bits to be very competitive when compared to other bits sites , and the site is easy to navigate .
M	my one criticism is with the range of bits available at present , a little limited compared to the more established sites .
M	modelbits will definetly be my first choice for bits from now on .
M	supplementwarehouse . com is the best place to buy supplements bar_none !
M	i don ' t shop anywhere_else for my supplements .

M	i can ' t tell you how many_times i ' ve recommended supplement_warehouse to my friends , family and just people that come to me about vitamin / supplement advice .
M	they already have the lowest_prices , but in the chance you do find a lower_price , they will match plus take 0 %_off !
M	that ' s the best deal on the internet !
M	plus the biggest_selection you can think of , what more could you ask ?
M	oh_yeah , the thrill of checking out and getting even more free_samples , shirts , shakers , and tons more !

M	i appreciate all the hard work and the great service !
M	- justin w
M	ordered heating mats from them at a very reasonable_price , they arrived within 0 days even to what some companies class as " scottish highlands postcode ".
M	product was well_packaged along with very clear_instructions on installation and all extras to aid installation ( floor primer etc ) which are extras from some other_companies .
M	on installation , i had one query to whether or not the temperature sensor cables were polar biased in the controller so called the freephone_number online and was immediately put through to someone who was friendly and helpful and clearly knew a lot about the product he was selling .
M	i would happily use this company again and could not recommend them enough to anyone .
M	i spoke to sammie_taylor she helped_me out with an account credit that i did wrong ( my mistake ) she was really friendly and helped_me out by doing all the things i asked and everything she could do to help , thanks :)
M	pharmacy0u is the easiest and quickest site for ordering your healthcare needs .
M	the service is quick and you often receive helpful product suggestions via_email .
M	to top it off , the prices are low !
M	fantastic service pick your shades go to checkout pay the next_day they arrive and got a right bargin to !
M	looks_like i had a brucey bonus !
M	i ordered some stuff a while ago it took nearly 00 days to arrive and needed the stuff for a gig so put me in a compromising position !
M	i would use again if delivery times improved
M	i have only one experience with g0m , and it has been a complete nightmare .
M	i ordered the ‘ focal cms 00 active studio monitor speakers ( pair ) with free stands ’ bundle on sunday 0th_december with delivery expected on the 00th_december .
M	on the monday and tuesday i had automated emails telling_me my order was delayed and then the delivery was being brought forward , and then delayed again ...
M	on the thursday , i called g0m at which point i was told definitively that my order would be with me the following_day .
M	later that night ...
M	i receive an_email_saying my order was delayed .
M	friday_morning i call up and speak to [_name ] who tells_me that in fact , i should have been contacted to be asked whether an ex - display speaker in the bundle would have been ok and that they could discount £_00 .
M	to me this wasn ’ t really acceptable and for the sake of £_00 wanted a brand_new speaker .
M	i asked to cancel the order , at which point i was put on hold for several minutes and then told they did in fact have 0 brand_new speakers they could send me .
M	i said this was fine and decided to proceed with the order as long as they would be delivered by the following_monday .
M	after spending £ 0 in phone_calls i might_add ...
M	00_minutes after this call , i receive an_email from [_name ] telling_me there had been a mistake and that they couldn ’ t send me 0 brand_new speakers .
M	so i replied and requested my order be cancelled and my money refunded .
M	i then received a fairly prompt reply confirming my order cancellation and refund .
M	later that night , i receive an_email_saying my order had been dispatched , i emailed [_name ] saturday_morning for confirmation this was not the case , to which he replied - confirming this was not the case .
M	monday_evening ...
M	i receive my cancelled order .
M	i check in the outer_packaging and one of the speakers is clearly the ex - display one .
M	i send an_email to michael saying if they discount £_000 i ’ d consider keeping it , otherwise could he please arrange collection of these erroneously delivered items .
M	collection has been organised , but they cannot guarantee a time , and are holding on to my money until the items are back in their possession .
M	i would not have a problem with this if i was returning some goods etc , but i received these because of a fault on g0m ’_s part – whether it ’_s their automated_system , or a deliberate attempt to get me to accept ex - display goods .
M	i don ’ t usually_write_reviews for anything , but this whole experience has been calamitous and is extremely annoying as i cannot order the speakers i want from a more reliable supplier until i get my money back .
M	i will say there customer_service is prompt , but not really all that helpful .
M	won ’ t be using g0m ever again .
M	i was able to find what i was looking for and thanks to your lowest_price guarantee i was able to come away with an even better price than listed .
M	booked up very quickly through the internet with plenty if info .
M	a *
M	have used the likes of dell before and decided it was time for an upgrade .
M	was pleased with the amount of options offered by the website only_downside is it can be a little daunting knowing where to start .
M	initially was told it would take 0 working_days to build but in the end took 00 though i had expected this as had put a fair bit of money into it .
M	if anything would rather them take there time than rush through and miss potential errors .
M	when the product came to be delivered there was some_confusion with the couriers but the blame was in there court .
M	alan from cyberpower still managed to get me my pc on the same day .
M	have had the system for a week now and am very impressed with the build_quality and chews through anything i throw at it .
M	overall the experience was good and hoping that technical_support will be good if i ever have to use them .
M	out of all the custom_build sites this will be the one i stick with .
M	i booked last_minute and had no issues .
M	amazing website .
M	aaron mclean
M	item arrived on time and was signed for recorded , also i called to ask whether or not they had stock of my item and the guy when and checked manually and said yes .. so overall great service
M	i just spent two days trying to renew a services that i got an_email confirmation over 0 months_ago that they were renewed .
M	i felt_like i was begging them to take my money .
M	i spent like 0 hours on the phone , explaining to different people that i wuld like to renew several services for my company .
M	especially helpful was an indian fellow called " martin " that i explained 0 times that i would like those and those services renewed , but he just didn ' t seem to uderstand me .
M	finally i was transfered to an accounting department where operater informed me that the " the numer you have dailed does not exist ".
M	after that i gave up .
M	if i know of anoter company that offered the same services at the same price as formationshouse to which i could transfer my business i would transfer my business in a blink of an eye .
M	really what i experienced in these 0 days was like taken from some comedy movie .
M	:)
M	as an arborist for the last nine years in the uk mainly as well as some work in australia , stihl just work .
M	work hard & good , everyday .
M	you get what you pay for & they are not the cheapest but neither am i .
M	thanks stihl you have made my working career .
M	awesome , the original saving us all money & time !
M	thanks .
M	cant_fault amazon , well_organised site & the products are abundant & easy to search for .
M	the oracle .
M	quick and reasonable .
M	i have ordered multiple_times from supplement_warehouse .
M	there was the initial worry , that i always get with any online purchase , but they came through the first time , and they continue to follow through 000_%.
M	i will always buy my supplements from here , because it is so easy to use , they don ' t cram in little fees , and they have such great deals on anything you want .
M	if anyone wants deals on good supplements , even the best of my friends , i point them here , to the greatest supplement vendor i have come_across .
M	thanks supplement_warehouse !
M	bought my daughter a barbour coat .
M	found at here cheaper_than john_lewis ' and also got to use quidco for a further discount .
M	delivery was excellent as well .
M	just the way shopping online should be .
M	thank_you .
M	did a little search after i needed new wheels .
M	went to a few of the big shops got quotes of £_000 for the pair .
M	merlin ' s had a special deal for the same ones but for £_00 .
M	bargain !!
M	next_day delivery as well .
M	terrible experience .
M	no collection for two days , parcel couldnt be delivered before the required date .
M	useless .
M	then to top it all off there isnt a telephone_number to call , just a typing service !
M	arghh !
M	!
M	ordered two lamps on the 0th of nov , it is now the 00th of dec and still no lamps , every week i call and the delivery is coming in but it never does , avoid at all cost !
M	i picked this company because they offered me what i wanted .
M	customer_service team was great to deal with and really listened to what i needed .
M	fast turn_around and always kept me upto_date with information .
M	stay_away they will take the phone and take ages to pay .
M	no phone number to call the company lack of emails from them .
M	i have to admit when i saw the prices , i thought i might be scammed here , looked at a few forums , seemed like mostly positive stuff and thought , why not , i got myself the new dark_souls game and some dlc for civ 0 and i ' m over the moon , i ' ll 000_% be shopping here again in the future , the discounted prices are just too cheap to pass up .
M	i ordered 0 x 0gb patriot memory ordered friday shipped it the same day and it arrived tuesday !
M	customer_service was excellent id like to thank jacob who is an asset to memoryc . com who helped_me alot via the online support chat whilst placing my order . this company sets the standard for excellent customer_service others can only dream of beating !
M	so hurry and place your order you certainly wont be dissappointed !
M	00 / 00 thank_you memoryc !
M	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
M	i ordered shoes on saturday and they were delivered on monday_afternoon .
M	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
M	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front doorstep following a knock on the door .
M	i happened to be in and heard the knock but had i not been the shoes would have remained there in full view ; it is a terraced house with the front_door close the pavement .
M	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
M	there was no requirement to sign .
M	a comprehensive range of replacement drill rechargeable batteries were available .
M	i was able to get a branded item for which i was prepared to pay more .
M	cheaper batteries are available but i have limited confidence in generic brands .
M	quick and efficient service with prompt acknowledgement and progress reports .
M	i was very pleased with the speed and efficiency of the service i received when ordering a down jacket from webtogs ; their stated returns_policy , which i did not have to use , is reassuringly comprehensive , something that ’_s essential when ordering clothes online and not being certain about fit or quality .
M	the website was readily navigable and informative and i found the range of products and brands to be very comprehensive .
M	i have used a number of outdoor clothing websites but this site is one i will check out each time in future and would certainly recommend to friends .
M	prise en main et retour rapides !
M	véhicule état neuf , propre et très récent ( b - max ).
M	equipe très sympa :)
M	as the title suggests , no hassle , key received within 00minutes of payment .
M	signfirm are the only company i will trust with our printing_needs !
M	we ' ve had 0 banners and 0 foamex sign so far with another 0 foamex signs being delivered today .
M	kevin is a true professional and obviously commited to excellent customer_service where nothing is too much_trouble , he even emailed me to let me know i ' d sent the artwork sized in pixels not mm and gave me the time to adjust and re send !
M	most companies would have used the low quality image and costed us more time and money having it re - printed .
M	i can strongly_recommend signfirm !
M	( and i do quite frequently !)
M	recently used point 000 for canvas_prints to display in a gallery .
M	the colours are so vibrant and other photographers commented and asked where i got them done .
M	will_definately use them again !
M	i got more for my money than i did from any other supplement retailer i ' ve ever shopped from
M	a little_bit of fuss needed on my end with verification through my bank , but otherwise everything after that was smooth and quick .
M	my first time using ginger0 , and i will certainly use them again .
M	great prices , fast delivery and great customer_service .
M	will have no hesitations about recommending them to friends and family .
M	the item was delivered on time , was perfectly packaged and have had no issues at all !
M	really easy site to navigate and always up to date .
M	thanks !
M	i belong to a group called hampshire little drifters in portsmouth and i think i speak for all of them when i say rc_geeks provide a really good service and quick delivery times when ever i need something .
M	we would recommend these_guys to any one .
M	amazing .
M	used mendmyi ' s colour_lab and i ' m extremely impressed by it .
M	phone was sent off using a courier and had it back home less then 00_hours_later .
M	fantastic customer_service and great product .
M	i have recommended them to all my friends and i can ' t wait to show off the finished_product .
M	for me , getting away from the terrible rates of my service provider was a must .
M	the provider refused to unlock my phone at all , even_though the contract had been completed and they were supposed to offer it for a small fee , they denied the existence of the service and shot me down .
M	as such , mostly to spite them , i decided to try this .
M	it was a bit of a hard bit of cash to drop on something i wasn ' t completely sure of , but my risk paid off .
M	these_guys did their best to get me unlocked without any hassles and in as short a time as they could .
M	although it did take them almost 0 days past the original estimated date to get it done , time is not important to me , the simple fact that they have the connections to get this done is more_than enough for me .
M	i truly recommend that anyone who_wants their iphone_unlocked , and is currently running a baseband that cannot otherwise be unlocked with software hacks , turn to these_guys , they ' ll get the job_done .
M	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
M	have noticed that veg are expensive compared to local green grocers
M	have ordered several things from amazon on the run up to christmas , everything arrived_promptly and in good condition .
M	prices where also very good
M	thats right i ordered it and it arrived from_hong_kong to the uk within 00_hours which is absolutely astonishing , it came in plenty of packaging and works like a charm :)
M	after it arrived i realised that all the awesome videos i ' d been watching and the channel i subscribed to on youtube were actually by digitalrev . com :)
M	thank_you so much digitalrev . com
M	i am one very unhappy customer , zavi cancelled my order , i bought a bluray collection in good faith as it was a " one day special " at a great price .
M	instead of getting a great offer i get fobbed_off with a 00_%_discount_code , if they can ' t get there prices right then they should hire someone to double_check prices , there mess up has let me down as i wanted some for myself and a set as a present , most companies would honor most orders like this instead zavvi give us long standing customers a kick in the teeth with a 00_%_discount :(
M	zavi as a company has lost my respect and i will do my best to avoid buying anything from both there websites and your stores ( and sister stores ) in the future .
M	this is media suicide and i am not happy .
M	for the past two years i have used skiddle to buy tickets for sankeys , the warehouse project , creamfields and more .
M	sometimes the tickets come by email , sometimes in the post .
M	once they went missing .
M	every time i use this company the communication is excellent , the staff are helpful and i get what i need when i need it .
M	it ' s nice not to have to talk too a company , but when you do they listen , and they resolve .
M	i really cannot_fault this company .
M	everything was booked correctly and the weekend was great fun .
M	i would use chillisauce again and reccomend them to others .
M	many_thanks .
M	i searched around before buying some extra memory for my pc .
M	all the uk suppliers , mr_memory included , charged roughly the same for the particular piece of hardware i needed - give or take a few_pence .
M	so , i ' d rate the pricing as average .
M	the delivery , however , was brilliant .
M	i chose free first_class delivery when placing my order and it arrived the next_day .
M	can ' t argue with that .
M	overall , definitely a trusted site to buy components from .
M	i ordered a bag on monday and they sent me a text_message on tuesday to ask if i wanted it on wed or thurs .
M	i said thurs and on thurs they said it would come between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 .
M	0 : 00 on the dot , the door_bell rang :-)
M	yesterday my xbox gold ran out and i started looking around for the cheapest 00 month code .
M	i came_across simplycdkeys / simplygames and they were selling it at £_00 which i was very happy with .
M	that ' s 0 pounds cheaper_than amazon !
M	i will def buy from this website again in the future :)
M	the best site for aussie babe videos .
M	would definitely_recommend and use again
M	fantastic company to deal with .
M	prompt service and no_hassles .
M	couldn ' t be simpler or quicker .
M	wish i knew about these_guys sooner .
M	ordered 0 items of oakley clothing at good prices , fast delivery however : one item sent was wrong_colour and wrong_size , the packaging , altho damaged , was clearly_marked with product size & colour and also a sticker stating that they would accept returns on this item ( which under these circumstances would be a breach of uk consumer_law incidentally ), the despatch note had been ticked beside each item in biro giving me the impression that this company will send anything rather_than provide decent customer_service and communicate with the customer and offer a refund or alternative product .
M	decided it wasn ' t worth my time , money & energy to arrange return_postage & refund potentially having to argue the legal position versus their returns_policy , instead will pass on wrong item as gift to somebody who it fits and vent my spleen via an honest review ergo good products at decent price , incompetent order processing & despatch , poor customer focus & service , thanks for reading .
M	after being sent the wrong items on 0 occaisions i was contacted by a man (?)
M	named [_name removed_] whom i later discovered to be a senior partner of the company who acted as tho it was my fault that they were unable to send the advertised product as well as informing_me that some people " just have an orgasm out of making a complaint ", accused me ( wrongly ) of being a member of the competition and informed me that they didn ' t want me as a customer anyway and that i could go to watchdog or trading_standards if i wanted .
M	having looked into the sale of goods_act 0000 , and despite [_name removed_] quoting the company ' s returns_policy , which does not supercede consumer_law , i know that i am not required to pay for return_postage on these goods and can require them to arrange collection at their expense , which i will choose to do following the arrogant , rude and unprofessional behaviour of this senior member of the company .
M	i will not comtemplate using their services again and would strongly_advise others to similarly avoid this firm if this is their idea of customer_service , the value they have of their customers and the example which the management are setting for their staff .
M	i haven ' t been using the website very long ( since about august ) and it has been exceptional !
M	being a bit of an online shopaholic i ' ve spent quite a bit online , especially with the run up to christmas and i have already had cash back verified and paid back into my bank_account .
M	some payments are slower_than others , but a bit of patience certainly pays off .
M	only ever had one item not track properly which was probably my fault but the customer care crew jumped on it and it was resolved in no time .
M	bargain price , pre order game turned_up a day earlier_than release_date !
M	what more could i ask for
M	i ' ve recently built a new high - end computer from parts , and after researching a lot online , i ordered most of my parts from aria .
M	let me detail the experience :
M	price
M	aria . co . uk has some of the lowest_prices in the market .
M	their offers are actually offers ( not just random price - matches and fake advertising ), but the real deal and a great bargain .
M	offering
M	the large variety of items on aria ' s website make it easy to shop .
M	they have a ton of products , and while other_retailers might have more , you ' d still find many of the items you might want .
M	shipping
M	at first , i was put off by the fact that aria doesn ' t offer an amazon - esque free shipping scheme for larger orders , but instead ask you to pay for their designated courier ( dpd ).
M	but you know what ?
M	that is possibly one of their biggest positive elements : the service they use is flawless !
M	dpd has an amazing service standard , being the only service that you can actually track on a map , with a 0 hour interval of delivery .
M	everything arrived flawlessly packaged , and without any damage .
M	amazing !
M	customer_service
M	i ' ll admit to not using their customer_service so far .
M	everything worked just fine , and dispatch was very fast .
M	however , when you receive an e_- mail , a few_days after your order , from an account_manager telling you that any time you ' ll want to order ( something large i ' d assume ) in the future , you are eligible for bespoke prices and suggestions ... you can ' t help but feel_like a treasured client .
M	all in all : mind blown !
M	aria is clearly my favourite it shop now .
M	i would recomend this company to anyone selling a mobile phone .
M	i ' ve tried other companys in the past and always had problems .
M	requested a free post bag to send my mobile , this came through the post within a day !
M	sent my mobile off same day and the cash was in my bank the following_morning !!
M	!
M	0_stars , well_done mazumamobile
M	they have everything here and at a great price .
M	i was already going to checkout at another website when my friend texts me this website ( he knew i was looking to save ) .
M	so i checked it out and got the same things and saved like thirty bucks .
M	i will never go anywhere_else .
M	always best prices - and you can price_match instantly to any website .
M	always free_stuff offered - and very easy to get free shipping .
M	best supplement store to purchase from online .
M	des prix moins chers serais bien venu ...
M	le service et la rapidité de_livraison rien_à dire !
M	super !
M	merci
M	toute l ' opperation s ' est bien derroulé !
M	on peut leur faire confiance car j ' ai testé et ca marche !!!
M	!
M	merci encore
M	i ' d never shopped at chemical_records before and was really surprised at how great their customer_service .
M	i ordered something just after xmas and the next_day i had 0 emails waiting for me saying my order had been processed and then shipped , and it arrived in the post the day after that .
M	it arrived well_packaged and even got a free poster / calendar !
M	i ' d definitely shop there again and would reccomend
M	super service , pre_- order arrived on time and money wasn ' t taken until dispatch , would purchase from simplygames again !
M	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
M	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
M	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
M	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
M	i ordered my fender strat from guitarguitar and specified a saturday delivery , order was easy and processed quickly .
M	i checked that the real time stock was updated on the website and was pleased to see that it was !
M	i really loved the personal_touch i got when rich from the sales_team called me to let me know that my guitar had been dispatched .
M	the guitar arrived first thing on saturday_morning , i even received a text_message informing_me of the time_frame .
M	great service , i have had no issues with the guitar , love playing it and would definately purchase from guitar_guitar again !
M	the trophy was poorly made .
M	you can tell that they put hardly any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
M	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn ' t even make the glass part of the model .
M	when they actually glued on the star , it was badly glued because their was a lot of glue coming out of the side .
M	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn ' t really feel_like a trophy .
M	superb service and very helpful staff ( samantha )
M	xbl code didn ' t work , double_checked it several_times at still no luck .
M	ripped_off
M	what can i say these_guys are great , easy to use website made it very painless to consign my box , and also offered the best price to new_zealand to suit my needs .
M	i would use them again in the future without_hesitation .
M	well_done to everyone at courierpoint and many_thanks for the great service you offer .
M	i was looking for prestone bugwash windscreen wash which is spot on in the warmer months for getting rid of that fly splat on the windscreen !
M	normally retails for over £ 0 . 00 in a well_known car parts store in the uk but concord were selling it for a lot less and next_day delivery too , so i saved a packet on this product , thanks for a easy transaction and a speedy turnaround on my order .
M	tyre_shopper is really straight_forward to use , with a vast choice of tyre manufacturers to choose from .
M	i have used black_circles in the past and must_say that i prefered tyre_shopper for choice and price
M	would happily purchase more tyres through this website in the future , top job to all concerned .
M	i have bought all my goods in store but thought id try buying online .
M	it was great items arrived on time and i didnt even have to go out .
M	will buy online again .
M	i needed some money that day so couldn ' t go to the back for a loan .
M	i ' ve not used a payday_loan site before but thought i ' d give it a go .
M	i got the see how much i would have to pay back so there was no_hidden_costs .
M	the money was sent to my account that day which was great .
M	i made sure i paid the full_amount back at the end of the month and that was that .
M	the site was easy to use and if i needed a quick loan again i would use them again .
M	thanks .
M	only place i could find that had the parts i needed .
M	very helpful will use again .
M	000000000
M	commande expédiée rapidement .
M	colis reçu en moins de 0 semaines en polynésie française .
M	i had problems with stock list but waveinn really solved it easy .
M	they reply to mail by the day and ship really fast .
M	will buy there again .
M	i just tried the airtime and now i believe .
M	this is the way to send money .
M	no issues , flowers were great , no_problems with delivery
M	have used them a number of times and never had an issue .
M	i have used ebuyer for many years an have never encountered any issue .
M	fast and reliable delivery with great prices gets my vote every time .
M	keep up the great service .
M	i am not normally one for writing reviews but bulkpowders have never once let me down in product or service .
M	if you wanted a good model of " how to " run a online order website these_guys have nailed it .
M	keep up the good work and them prices low guys !
M	a happy customer
M	mr b
M	excellent product ....!!!
M	!
M	nice amp and subwoofer ....
M	quick delivery , excellent communication ...
M	easy to deal with ...
M	thanks ...++++
M	brilliant service no_complaints
M	i could easily check out any city to see prices , reviews and locations .
M	the map_view was helpful to visually see where they were .
M	i like how prices were real time .
M	no booking_fees made it nice as well .
M	my stag_do booked thru chillisauce was great , top quality locations and events .
M	no_complaints !
M	thanks .
M	i done a hpi check on my car just incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
M	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
M	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
M	they state 0 mobiles in stock , they take payment within 0 days -- 00 days_later im still_waiting for my phone !
M	i look on the website for an update my phone is now being advertised £_00 cheaper , and i still dont have my phone with 0 showing in stock !
M	do not trust this company and do not purchase anything - you have been warned !
M	im now contacting my credit_card company to sort this mess out and refund me !
M	there customer_service is non_existent !
M	this company should be closed_down .
M	shame on you !
M	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
M	som jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
M	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
M	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
M	buketter .
M	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad man får for pengene .
M	utrolig nem bestilling og_hurtig_levering .
M	jeg_er_meget tilfreds og mega glad for mine nye bukser :-)
M	købte en vare for over 000_kr og_fik den tilsendt portofrit langt hurtigere end jeg_havde forventet .
M	godt produkt og_hurtig_levering .
M	not much to say , they are simply the best .
M	i really like the concept off the " inn ' s "!
M	diveinn trekkin swimminn and so on .
M	it is such a good place to find your gear , and the service is outstanding !
M	indian_call_centre .
M	who told me what i wanted to hear but never noted account told me i would get call back as soon as sorted issue .
M	no call back .
M	called them back to explain again to be hung_up on .
M	never dealing_with them again .
M	all the info you need on livingston and great forums .
M	0rd time using the service which only seems to get better each time .
M	within 0 days of deciding to sell , day 0 i received my postage pack , day 0 it was received and day 0 i received my money .
M	cannot_praise the company enough .
M	same as above .
M	the camera lumix ft0 what i ordered on wednesday has arrived next_day before 0am with free delivery and the best price on market .
M	customer_service was helpful , they promised me camera will be to friday and they have kept this promise .
M	i can recommend this company with pleasure .
M	will_definitely use them again .
M	i was looking to get some perfumes for xmas gifts and i came_across this website .
M	they have good range of products and at great discounted prices .
M	i think its because its xmas period but if they were to give discount to returning customers ... i will_definitely make more purchases .
M	im very happy with my products ... all brand_new and sealed in the original packagine .
M	also fast delivery service .
M	i initially contacted them for replacement parts for an old strimmer , but ended_up buying a new one from them anyway .
M	i would definitely use them again for their quick_turnaround and good price .
M	great price , great availability but awful service .
M	i have just sold my watch to watchfinder .
M	customer_service is second to none , sent my watch and within 00_hours had a call back with a great offer .
M	quick and professional service with excellent results .
M	would definitely use again .
M	they managed to get product that was out of stock everywhere_else .
M	minor niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
M	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an_email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
M	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
M	goods come next_day with no charge to delivery charge , good condition well_packed a * will use again .
M	ordered the samsung_galaxy on friday , was told to expect delivery on monday .
M	here it is .
M	everything is connected and activated .
M	lovely !
M	thanks cpw !
M	ordered multiple_times , always correct items and delivered next_day .
M	very competent communication_throughout the ordering_process .
M	great great great company , got turned on to them by a friend and they are my go to place when it comes to buying supplements !!
M	!
M	i ordered a set of speakers and they didn ' t arrive .
M	these things_happen with postal services and i don ' t blame pixamania for this .
M	what i did find , however was a poor uncaring customer_service department .
M	i ' ve asked for a refund , but really , based on the experiences i ' ve had thus_far , i ' m not holding out much hope .
M	was looking for months at a 00 inch samsung plasma tv on the currys / comet websites as the price had been dropped by £_000 to £ 0000 .
M	i decided to wait for the price to drop a little more before i would order it as the newer model had just been released and i thought that as it was at the end of its line they would knock a bit more off .
M	after weeks of waiting it finally dropped by another £_000 , so i rounded all the cash up to pay for it , but i had pushed my luck too far and missed out .
M	all the time i was waiting for the price to drop i regularly googled the product number of the tv and come_across a website that was advertising this tv at £ 0000 , i searched its address on googlemaps and came_across the shop on the street in blackpool , it looked good so i gave them a ring , turned_out that they are a family business .
M	a lad named simon took my call , he was a cool fella who knew his stuff about audio / visual products , he was a great help .
M	the bad news was that they no_longer had the tv in store , but simon offered the newer model at a similar price , i asked him to give me a day or two to raise the cash which he was cool about , he put no preasure on me to buy there and then .
M	i gave him a call the followng day to confirm , he talked me through signing in on the website and purchasing the tv , gave me a delivery date and promised me two free hdmi cables .
M	i had a phonecall from the delivery driver the night before asking if i wanted delivery of my tv a day earlier , i was over the moon , although i didn ' t need help i was given the impression he would help to start my tv up with me .
M	steve the delivery driver was a smashing chap too .
M	i can_honestly say that i am extremely happy with the customer_service of reliant direct , couldn ' t have had better service .
M	thankyou simon and steve for your help .
M	if you ' re looking at the big name stores for visual / audio products do yourselves a favour , at the same time take a look at reliantdirect . co . uk - you will not be disappointed , you will get a better deal and excellent customer_service !
M	!
M	alright dave , how are things ?
M	yeah , not bad , just got back from amsterdam , it was really good .
M	a company called chilli_sauce organised everything and it all went very smoothly , did some cool shit that we would never of done if they hadn ' t been involved .
M	you should use them for that lads trip you were planning .
M	have made a couple of big orders from this site , and both_times i have received extremely good service .
M	there were a couple of little problems with a cymbal bag in this order , but the team at the shop always contacted me with new updates , and were very quick and professional with getting everything sorted .
M	will_definitely be spending more money here soon !
M	:_d
M	great service , stock and equipment i would order frequently from this shop if i wasn ' t so poor !.
M	i have only had one issue where i could not understand the man on the phone but hey gotta laugh about stuff like that .
M	keep up the good work msuk .
M	stocks almost everything with great deals .
M	i am really happy with the postage as its always on time or before time with no trouble .
M	it also is really easy to sell on and accepts all payment types .
M	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
M	the prices are very much average with little deals .
M	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
M	and the staff rarely help out .
M	but over all not to bad .
M	simplyscuba has always provided me with outstanding service , even in the case where i needed to return faulty_goods .
M	the most basic of delivery options still gets you your goods fast , and they always come nicely_packaged .
M	i ' ve yet to buy anything reletively expensive in the way of dive gear , but i ' ll definately be purchasing it from simplyscuba .
M	ordered online , quick and easy ...
M	delivery on the morning of the second day .
M	brilliant product .
M	this place has saved our company a considerable_amount on inks and allows me to order quick with relative ease .
M	unlocked quick
M	having just bought a nintendo 0ds , i needed a good quality case to protect it whilst travelling , out of all the places i searched hitari had the official branded nintendo case at the lowest_price , so overall it was a no_brainer .
M	the case arrived really quickly and i was pleased with the communication and overall order process with hitari .
M	definitely hope to deal with them again in the future .
M	after deciding to finally get myself a gaming_pc , i decided that it would be best to go to a custom builder rather_than try it myself and it actually turned_out cheaper to get it built professionally .
M	i was unsure_about a lot of specialist builders are reading endless reviews of bad practise , but a friend_recommended cyberpower systems to me and after searching for alternatives and pricing up my build , it seemed the cheapest to do with cyberpower systems .
M	the customer support was brilliant , i contacted them via facebook and they responded quickly and kept me updated with the progress of my order , they even changed out the motherboard and wifi adapter ( due to size ) for no extra_cost .
M	even after my order had been delivered the support remains prompt and very useful , a great choice and excellent build_quality and cable_management .
M	only_downside is that due to the protection put inside my case one of the fans isn ' t connected and i haven ' t yet connected it up .
M	i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a custom_build pc , whether it be for gaming or just a specific pc built to the specifications you want .
M	having been a customer of toolkit websites now for many years , the service is still outstanding , arguably it ' s getting better and better .
M	often when a prospect becomes a customer the level of service can dwindle ; this is not the case here .
M	our telephone_calls are always answered_quickly and if our problems can ' t be resolved straight_away they are dealt_with usually within minutes .
M	a very good example of a company which practices what it preaches .
M	ok , so my first formal sales training and my billing increased by 000_% after just a few sessions .
M	i bought myself a new car with the commission .
M	i would recommend mindcell to anyone_looking to increase their sales .
M	two websites that i couldn ' t have done without in planning my prague to paris cycle trip in april ....
M	i used hostelbookers to make two hostel bookings one in paris and other in pilsen in czech ... both_times booking was as easy as searching on google ....
M	kudos to hostelbookers team and add some loyalty element
M	easily the most user_friendly booking service available on the internet .
M	a frequent traveller ' s best friend !
M	very easy to transact with and fast shipment .
M	received the parcel only within the week .
M	great quality authentic sunglasses but at a cheaper price !
M	will_definitely_recommend this company to my friends .
M	more power !
M	itsjustcricket offer a superb service , paul even went out of his way to help me out .
M	i received a limited_edition quality bat .
M	it had knots on the face of the bat but even worse was the fact that stickers had been removed and new ones placed on the bat .
M	there had been some attempt to sand away the marks left by the old stickers .
M	was i really buying a limited_edition £_000 bat .... i ' m not sure ................. so i sent it back .
M	i have used gamexchange . co . uk for over four_months now and i ' ve never had a problem !
M	the trade - in prices are very good and that ' s the main_reason_why i use them .
M	other_retailers just rip you off with trade - in prices but gamexchange are fair .
M	and transactions take place very quickly .
M	every time i have posted my games first_class i ' ve been paid the very next_day !
M	all of the new games i have bought are new and sealed so no problem there .
M	and the customer_service is excellent .
M	always very helpful and quick to reply .
M	overall , i highly_recommend gamexchange . co . uk .
M	if you ' re into video_games you won ' t be disappointed !
M	i ' ve used simplygames a few_times and never had a problem !
M	delivery is free and only takes a day to deliver after despatch .
M	their prices for newly - released games or pre_- orders are normally very reasonable and this is why i use them .
M	and the quick delivery is an added_bonus .
M	my only complaint would be the choice of games and the prices of games that have been out for a while .
M	there needs to be a bigger selection of games but , apart_from this , simplygames are highly_recommended !
M	i have used pc_specialist before and they never disappoint .
M	it is built professionally and works like a dream .
M	it ' s the best way to buy a pc , the parts i wanted but put_together by someone who_knows what they are doing .
M	have been using maximuscle products for a while now and they are always great .
M	their service is also brilliant with quick dispatch and delivery .
M	pre_- ordered mass_effect 0 it came a day early so nothing to complain_about a great site to buy from .
M	i ' ve used ebuyer a few_times now , always has exactly_what i ' m looking for at a pretty good price , postage is quite expensive on certain items , but apart_from that , never had any_problems
M	very quick responses i . e .
M	the envelope to send off , and sending the cheque back ... good prices paid also !
M	i buyed lots of keys from oks and all keys war working and was really fast , 00 stars !
M	it ' s difficult to praise diamondgeezer . com enough - in my experience both luke and tian were great throughout the entire_process of buying my wife ' s engagement_ring .
M	buying an engagement or wedding_ring should be a fun and happy experience , and the guys at diamondgeezer made sure it was .
M	so much so that we bought both our_wedding_rings from them as well ; and on recommendation to my friends , they too have bought their wedding_rings from them !
M	i ' ll be in touch in a few anniversaries ' time when i need to upgrade my wife ' s rock !
M	i had a slight_issue with the delivery address but how swift they fixed it , i don ' t understand , because of that , i was expecting my guitar to arrive in perhaps 0 days , i was socked to receive it the next morning , and i love my sleep but i couldn ' t sleep any more because of how excited and impressed i was .
M	all am trying to say is , the item was delivered as expected and in perfect_condition .
M	i don ' t think services get any better_than that .
M	thank_you gear0 , and keep up the good work , you just might sock someone_else like you did me .
M	great service all_round !
M	received my game instantly and with added dlc !!
M	autokey_system is great , site is easy to navigate and understand !
M	thanks to cjs :_d
M	could not be_happier with the service i received , ordered one afternoon and received the next morning !
M	would recommend to anyone_looking for great prices and quick reliable service !
M	i have to say i was lost on the website and i couldn ' t find the page i was looking for .
M	i saw the chat option and figured i haven ' t tried anything_else .
M	within 0 minutes i was on the right page and ready to get back to work .
M	i want to personally thank millie for being concise , to the point , understanding and all around nice .
M	she is superb at customer_service .
M	another great transaction from simply cd_keys !
M	i have the code emailed within minutes and it worked_perfectly again , giving me another awesome game to play on origin for £_00 cheaper then ea / origin are selling exactly the same_thing for !!
M	!
M	i ordered a new flow boiler from the electrical counter and its arrived in great order !
M	plus the price offered me a great saving , so i will certainly be back again to see how much i can save on any other electricals :)
M	in fact , i am going to be getting some new carpets for my new house soon , so i will be ordering some new switches and sockets from these_guys to go with the new modern look i want in my house :)
M	i got those new sockets and they look great !
M	a bit thumbs_up for price , speed of delivery and the high_quality of the nexus plug sockets !
M	i just wanted to do a short review on these_guys because i got a couple of door handles from them and found them to be of high_quality and for a very competitive price from what i could find on other_sites like this .
M	thanks for saving me some money and i almost forgot to mention , the delivery was rather fast too which is something i always look for when ordering products online :)
M	hi ,
M	just submitting a review for a friend who has used the laundry repair services from laundry 000 .
M	she asked me to say ...
M	laundry 000 have supplied me with some top quality laundry machines and a repair service which has proven to be the best choice for my commercial laundry shop .
M	not only did i get provided with the best washing machines i have used , but i have also signed_up to the repair services offered which i have found to be priceless due to the speed in which my machines are bought back to top work order so not to loss any business .
M	thank_you so much for providing one of the best services i have ever had from start to finish and beyond !
M	i don ' t know why people below have given bad_reviews , i have had nothing but good with bathroom c &_c .
M	i order some new taps mid last_week as we had to replace the taps in our bath due to them being old , and they where at my door 0 days_later !
M	i think either the reviews below can ' t be true or bathroom c &_c have had a major improvement because i can tell you now , i would recommend the great customer_service and low_prices to all my friends and will be back to order a new shower at the end of the week !
M	a +++++ thanks so much :)
M	thanks so much for the help with my order after_placing it on the new website ( which looks amazing by the way !
M	), once i had placed my order i phoned the door store to find out how long my order would take as i need it for this weekend coming and was told it would be with me before the weekend :)
M	along with the fast delivery , i have managed to save a good amount of money on a large tin of sadolin wood stain to stain my new back door ready to go up over the weekend .
M	thanks so much for a easy to use service which has saved me money !
M	a ++
M	hi , just wanted to add a quick review to say thanks for the help with finding the correct fixings i was after for around my house over the weekend :)
M	fix0 was very helpful and had everything i needed at very competitive_prices , along with great delivery !
M	this meant i was able to do most of the diy work around the house over the weekend .
M	i ordered a new swimming_pool from splash and relax mid last_week , and finally got around to setting it up over the weekend :)
M	i had a couple of friends over for some drinks and we decided it would be fun to have a play in the pool ( i know the weather was not great , but we was drinking so that didn ' t matter lol ), anyway , the pool was great fun and the perfect size for having some friends over for a small pool party , just like we asked for and was advised this pool would be ideal for .
M	so all in all , a great pool and some top advice from the guys at splash and relax .
M	thanks soooooo much for making our weekend so much fun :) a +++++
M	i have used ryanair twice in the last two years to go to spain and back ( so that four flights with them in total ) and each and everyone of those flights with them where great !
M	the staff where friendly and funny , which to me is very important if i ' m going to be stuck on a plan for x hours going on holiday ( or back from ).
M	also they where always sure to ask if i wanted a drink when passing and asked if i was comfortable .
M	and to finish it off , when i feel asleep i was not pestered during or after the flight , i was only woken up just before landing so i know we where about to land .
M	and to finish it off , when leaving the plan ( on every flight there and back ) all the cabin staff said thank_you and good bye with a smile !
M	over all from start to finish i have always had great flights with ryanair and so i will_continue to use them time after time !
M	a +++++++
M	we hired a minibus for a works do last_week and the service from our drive was top_notch !
M	he was so professional and polite and was just like having one of our own driving once he got joking around with us :)
M	i would most defo_recommend britannia to anyone that asks me because it was just such a great trip for all of us and the coach or rather minibus , was so luxurious .
M	you couldn ' t have had more comfort with a limo lol
M	i ordered a small custom lcd monitor from kme to use on my bike ( off road baby !)
M	and its perfect :) the screen is well_designed and very protected of damage from bits flying up and the odd smash .
M	over all very pleased with the product , sales and customer support .
M	a + highly_recommend for anyone thats looking for a custom lcd monitor , rugged display or even a lcd monitor in general .
M	from start to finish chillisauce ' customer_service has been attentive and knowledgeable , i will not hesitate to recommend them to a friend !
M	our stag_weekend was hassle_free and knowing that one of their operators was at the end of the telephone in case of incident was comforting ...
M	will most definitely be back !
M	sold my galaxy_s0 for argos_vouchers , safe and securely with a free special delivery service .
M	received confirmation e_- mail and passed test e_- mail next_day .
M	received my gift_card in 0 working_days .
M	the whole transaction took less_than a week .
M	after receiving my welcome_pack through the post on saturday i then posted my phone back to mazuma on monday_morning .
M	payment was made to me tuesday .
M	could not believe_how quick the process was .
M	i ' ve found my new supplement store .
M	i ' ve been buying from retail locations for years .
M	i started shopping from supplement_warehouse and only go into a store now to ask what they think about a product i plan on buying from these_guys .
M	great service , fast_shipping , cheap process .
M	what more can you ask for ?
M	this is one of the best websites in my opinion .
M	it ' s easy to use search and sort functions bring you so much comfort .
M	making your time spent searching and reviewing a place to stay so much shorter .
M	the honest open concept of comparing hostels and its ' easy booking makes it hassle_free .
M	the best part is that they allow you to cancel your bookings at no extra charge so long as its 0 days before arrival .
M	i ' ve ordered from ebuyer now several_times and have been extremely happy with communication from ebuyer updating me as to the progress of my orders .
M	excellent value to or most items .
M	never had any_issues with any items received from ebuyer .
M	certainly recommend .
M	my phone was in perfect working order when it left - however , mazuma claimed it was damaged and not working on arrival to them .
M	on top of this , i opted for argos_vouchers .
M	i did not receive vouchers , but a card which needs a 0000 number to be called to activate it .
M	i am profoundly deaf and unable to use a telephone .
M	i merely use my mobile for texting instead of using a conventional phone .
M	they now have my mobile and i am unable to activate my cards - so i have lost out .
M	i won ' t use again .
M	had a great time at the stagg do that was arranged my chillisauce .
M	the hotel that they picked was comfy and the activities were fun .
M	easiest_way to find accommodation anywhere in the world
M	i ' ve been dealing_with companies like virgin and bt for years .
M	the guys at sermores far_exceeded the levels of customer_service i usually get and all for a cheaper price than wholesale prices i usually pay .
M	sermores provided my new offices with voip and internet connectivity with none of missed deadlines and issues i ' ve come to expect from larger companies . they ' ve even offered to do me a good deal when my mobile phone contracts expire soon , i can ' t wait to deal with them again as it ' s been an_absolute pleasure so far .
M	this websites customer support and live help is the most easiest iv seen online .
M	things which take forever with other huge organization are done within_seconds via the online_chat .
M	things like full refunds due to bookings made by mistake , or re bookings of existing collections .
M	i feel absolute trust with this company , they have always resolved the countless issues that occur in the shipping business we operate in .
M	will_continue to be my first choice for shipping .
M	had a guy take my car from guildford up to a garage in essex for repair , very good delivery and nice friendly guy .
M	took me and the car , even stopped for coffee on the way !
M	this company has been problems since day 0 .
M	wish i ' d read reviews before using them ...
M	they set_up payment on 00th of each month after taking the £_000 deposit ...
M	i told them this payment date was unnaceptable , as i got paid on the 0th .
M	they have kept trying to take payment on the wrong date , which has made my bank cancel and refuse further direct_debits .
M	now they have cancelled my policy , charging me £_00 !
M	i ' ve asked them if they ' d set_up a new policy on the correct date .
M	and they said yes , for £_000 more_than it was 0 months_ago , and a £_000 increase on the deposit !
M	i am now just going to a proper insurance company .
M	thanks for nothing auto direct , i will spend all day if i have to posting this review all over the internet .
M	shambles .
M	used first time for flight booking ...... offered the cheapest ticket good website and good customer_service .
M	where to start !
M	a wonderful way to spend that free time ... winning money !
M	i started with £_00 and soon built it up !
M	always get what you pay hence_why i use these_guys .
M	comprehensive site found a lot more hostels than other services and also prices seems to be slightly_cheaper_than other_sites .
M	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
M	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i ' ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
M	such as india and even some european countries .
M	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
M	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
M	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
M	i was asked by trustpilot to express my honest_opinions and not to bestow appraisal on anyone in particular .
M	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
M	i would like assure you , that you were not target .
M	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
M	thank_you , best luck with the future .
M	levering inden for en dag .
M	venlig telefon betjening .
M	fik pakken efter 0 dage og_det_var postens skyld .
M	god service blev ringede op og_fik et bedre produkt for samme pris fordi de ikke havde det jeg_havde bestilt
M	i ' ve been emailing despatch bay for over four_months now , but they haven ' t even responded let_alone provided me with the vat invoice required by uk legislation when you charge vat on goods or services !
M	basically , they ' re not interested once they ' ve got your money .
M	will never use them again and would recommend everyone to steer_well clear .
M	ccs leeds have a reliable , well connected network and have always been an utter pleasure to deal with .
M	they ' ve always gone above and beyond the call of duty for me and have helped_me out of tough spots .
M	rackspace are happy to engage in misleading billing practises and if you dare to question them about it , then they will keep stating the same , irrelevant point over and again before eventually just ignoring you .
M	utterly disgusting behaviour .
M	parcel0go are a terrible company to deal with that clearly have no regard for their customers or the service that they provide .
M	they failed to collect the parcel on the scheduled date , then when i took it to the depot the member of staff that i spoke to said that they were closed and they couldn ' t let me drop_off the parcel despite it already being paid for ...
M	when i took the parcel back and the depot finally accepted it , i was surprised to find that it didn ' t even show up as having been received at the depot and scanned on the tracking for 0 whole days , which was particularly disappointing given that i had paid for a 00 hour delivery service !
M	the parcel was eventually delivered to the recipient 0 days_later .
M	when i complained to parcel0go about their unacceptable performance , i was told that the terms and conditions state that this service was not guaranteed and so they didn ' t care .
M	i challenged that i was looking at the terms and conditions and that was simply not the case , however the representative simply kept stating that they do not offer a guaranteed service and that this is in their terms and conditions .
M	after such appalling service , i would never use parcel0go again .
M	i have previously had similarly poor experience with them deliberately delaying sending forms for an insurance claim in order to prevent a claim being made before the time limit .
M	with parcel0go , poor customer_service seems to come as standard .
M	unreliable service , always late , often lost and / or damaged .
M	unhelpful staff and incorrect depot opening_hours on their web - site .
M	they don ' t even bother_replying to e_- mails when you complain , your parcel just mysteriously turns up two_weeks late ...
M	i can ' t think of a company that i would trust less .
M	securacert make use of aggressive cold calling and spam e_- mailing to try and win sales by misleading customers into thinking that they are renewing their ssl certificates with the existing company rather_than purchasing a new certificate through securacert .
M	on multiple_occasions i have contacted quietpc . com ' s pre_- sales and have been astonished by the effort they have put into helping me choose the most appropriate components for a particular requirement even when just selling me an £ 0 fan - they bend_over backwards to make you feel_confident that you are purchasing the best products for you need and even recommend cheaper products than the ones you have picked out if they feel you ' re wasting your money .
M	i can ' t recommend them highly_enough !
M	very good value for money and delivery as promptly .
M	all items as_described .
M	one of the safest and most reliable places to get cheap cd_keys - very fast too and fast responses to any_queries .
M	it completely beats other_websites when it comes to book an stay .
M	everything is so simple and easy .
M	i ' m waiting for an android_app to make my bookings !
M	excellent games for an amazing price !
M	quick and easy to order and keys are delivered almost_instantly .
M	great site , will use again in future .
M	as any other online shopper we always look for the best deals .
M	supplement_warehouse by_far has the best deals and makes it 00 times better by having a do it yourself price matcher .
M	i only had one issue where i messed_up on a price_match and was never informed , so a suggestion would be if my order is not processed within a couple days i should get an_email or a text , any type of notification .
M	another cool idea , being a monthly buyer , i think it would be cool if you guys did a rewards program thing .
M	but overall despite some reviews of credit fraud i have not had an issue and a very satisfied customer .
M	thank_you suppelment warhouse .
M	they hands_down have the best prices around .
M	although their shipping may prove to tally up a bit with larger orders , it still doesn ' t matter .
M	their prices are still cheap enough to save .
M	just lined everything in my cart and compared prices to two other main sites that i have also purchased at before , and even with the shipping factored in i still saved over twenty bucks ordering with supplementwharehouse .
M	unlike a couple of sites i had visited where they claimed the product was in stock , then to find out that it was ' nt .
M	( once the transaction had taken place ) echo sent emails to provide information on the successful transaction and also the dispatch and delivery date .
M	also one of the cheapest supplement websites out there .
M	will be ordering from them again .
M	i received a product on a day i would normally expect from a fast service , meaning next_day after sending , which was day after i bought it ( late shopping ;)) no shipping confirmation but with that speed its not an issue for me at all .
M	product came well_packed , or should i say amazingly well top_notch :)
M	recommended !!
M	!
M	dave
M	here are the highlights :
M	item purchased not as_described on the website .
M	( bike should have included stabilisers )
M	' customer_service ' advisor unable to advise me if the item should even include stabilisers , despite the fact that he website states that it does !
M	offers me an exchange , but cannot guarantee if the stabilisers will be included .
M	in the light of the above we therefore arrange for a collection and refund .
M	courier arrives on the day of the collection during the two hour_window they agreed
M	to avoid .
M	courier fails to turn_up the next_day as agreed .
M	argos refuse to accept any blame , refuses to refund the item until they have collected it and refuse to compensate for the fact that my wife has taken an additional day holiday from work .
M	e_- mail sent to argos asking for an immediate_response .
M	argos then send another courier on the wrong day to the wrong_address .
M	' customer_service ' agent then advises that she cannot arrange a response to my e_- mail as she does not work for that department and cannot possibly speak to that department , i will just have to wait !
M	still no refund , still not collection and still no response from argos over the catalogue of errors they have caused !
M	i have now e_- mailed the ceo directly in the hope of receiving some form of resolution ; here ' s hoping !
M	i will never , ever purchase another item from argos ever again and i would strongly_recommend that you do the same !
M	if you ever feel_like purchasing an item online , do yourself a favour and try amazon !
M	love using supplement_warehouse .
M	you will not find a cheaper place online for supplements .
M	they also let you pack your shopping_cart with freebies before you check out !
M	great place , i don ' t shop anywhere_else .
M	i would strongly_recommend temptations direct .
M	i have brought several items from them and would highly_reccommend them to others .
M	i have had no hassle with any product or service from them and the speed from transaction to delivery are very quick ( excluding postage system ).
M	a fantastic company to buy from .
M	i am very pleased with my server & the pc i have had from them in the past .
M	even_though i had many issuses with the technical side , all the issuses have been resolved with great communication and to a high_standard .
M	i have used lots of companies before , but card team are the best .
M	i phoned 0 times and was made to feel welcome , adrian ( the boss ) is the best in the business .
M	i can ' t fault this company , my first order arrived very quickly .
M	i previously ordered with chaoscards but they won ' t be used again , i highly_recommend card team .
M	came_across this site randomly on google .
M	and glad i did , a no agg service .
M	couriers come to you , bid on the job , and you choose who you want to use .
M	simple
M	i have recently just purchased my v_festival ticket from double0tickets and was very pleased with the price of the ticket ( cheaper_than face_value !)
M	considering they are sold out pretty_much every where else and other_websites / people are selling for a lot of money .
M	next_day delivery and great service , couldn ' t be more satisfied !
M	always check this site out if you cant find tickets for any event anywhere_else , as you can almost guarantee they will be for sale here , and you don ' t have the worry that the tickets may be fake or not be sent at all .
M	double0tickets is a highly trusted website !
M	i have bought tickets from here for a few gigs and have always been very very happy with everything !
M	thanks doubl0tickets , i will be purchasing more tickets soon !
M	tom jewell

M	im having a ' superheroes & villians ' fancy_dress themed 00st birthday_party very soon & being the party host i wanted to stand out from the crowd , i have been looking around for a ' mr incredible ' costume & allfancydress . com was the cheapest place around for the same costume advertised on the internet , the pictures however do it no justice at all !, the costume is awesome !
M	!, very comfortable , great quality & once tried on looks amazing !, the service was fantastic , so helpful & the delivery is really quick , even if your in a hurry they ' re always prepared to get your order to you asap !, i honestly cannot wait for the party now as it really will be incredible !, thanks allfancydress . com !
M	had all the products i needed in stock , made a very small error that would easily be done .
M	i ordered some trumpers saddle wood shaving soap and they sent me shaving cream by_accident , the packaging and everything is exactly the same on these two products and would easily be done if you had lots of orders to pick .
M	i called them when i received my order , the sent me the correct product straight_away by express delivery and when asking where to return the first product bearing in mind it ' s value is around £_00 they said don ' t worry keep it .
M	this was unexpected and very kind .
M	thanks again and i will be sure to always get my man stuff from you guys .
M	cheers ,
M	ben
M	ive bought two systems from wired0fire one being the very top end hellfire extreme which we up specced a little and has given a few_years of absolute fault free use and inside is absolutely immaculate in the way its built .
M	we also bought a mid range gaming system for my brother which he_loves .
M	we had an issue with our monitor minimising and freezing things ( wired0fire did not supply the monitor )
M	the guys down there were always on the phone and even took our system back to try and help us from their end as we don ' t really know what were doing .
M	in the end they sorted everything for us , and it was all good will on their part .
M	top blokes all_round would certainly recommend .
M	we will be buying from them again .
M	i always go there for my fish , they have experienced staff there , if one of them isnt too sure he ' ll go get the ' fish expert ' always gives good advice of which fish can go with what .
M	they have ordered me fish in when they dont stock them .
M	guisley chain
M	traxxas is the best manufacture of rc cars by_far !
M	waterproof electronics .. no other company offers that !
M	good rang of items .. was about to purchase some speakers for my car when the staff recommend a differnet brand the same spec but cheaper .. can ' t complain .
M	this was the guisley chain .
M	well as per title .. its good but for the extra money i don ' t see the difference really .
M	rather save money for the same product .
M	i have .

M	ordered somethin with a company , it wad went dpd , i recived tracking_number via_email , after tracking it on the easy to use website it gave me a hour time window to when it would be delivered , rather_than me waiting in all day !
M	when the man came to my door he was very polite and well manored .
M	couldn ' t ask for any more really .
M	excellent !
M	well where to start ..?
M	rang up modelsport and spoke to a very polite young_man who helped_me place my order on monday for a hpi trophy as this was my first nirto car i wanted to ask a few questions , after_speaking a other model shops i was a little hesitent to ask as questions as they seem to just try get you off the phone , but eith ms they took the time to explain the in ' s and outs of the hobby !
M	they gave me alot of confidence and tips and tricks for propper use and maintenance .
M	never had this much care and attention from any where !
M	not to mention the delivery times .. next_day !
M	i got a email from them with all tracking_information , tracked my parcel on line ( link in the email ) it gave me a hour time window which worked_fine for me as i had to pop out !
M	astonishing service !
M	very simple , fast and easy ... no_messing_around when it came to the payment , just pure gold .
M	would recommend to everyone .
M	after searching sites for days i found supplementwarehouse . com and it was the best deal all across the board .
M	plus the free_samples , shakers , and pill containers are an added_bonus !
M	highly_recommended !
M	cmpo are very good at what they do they supply fantastic items of a high_quality i ordered my throttle cable from them for my ajs no_problems whatsoever apart_from the courier service who have done nothing but mess both me and cmpo around i emailed cmpo due to the fact my cable never arrived as promised from ukmail on the saturday which cost me extra and i must_say matthew squire who emailed me back has been fantastic he refunded the delivery charge and has been monitoring where my parcel is the service and the company as a whole are second to none and matthew squire is a ledgend of a man so i would like to say a big thank_you to them , but i would advise to stay_away from ukmail
M	i ordered a throttle cable from a site for my motorbike that i needed so i could get into work and paid £_00 for a saturday delivery because it was desperate .
M	i then received a text at 00 . 00 saturday_morning saying it had been resheduled for monday delivery so i phoned uk mail and explained my situation they told me it had been diverted and the girl on the phone really coudnt care , when i askdd about compensation or a partial_refund i was basically told go away .
M	this company is an_absolute_joke i will never be using there services again and i recommend no one elese ever does
M	all in all the whole day was fantastic , they made the day very easy to pay for and keep_track of where everyone was up to .
M	the day out was brilliant , quality and we had very few problems .
M	would recommend to anyone in the future planning something like a stag_do .
M	heres my story ...!
M	ordered 0 big boys via groupon 0 / 00 / 00 ... got fed_up of waiting and cancelled 0 / 0 / 00 .
M	got money back off groupon no_probs but still_waiting for carriage refund from infurn .
M	was supposed to be refunded automatically 0 / 0 / 00 ... nothing .
M	chased sonya 00 / 0 / 00 and was told it would be done within the week ... nothing ... chasing again now , no response to emails and calls going straight to answer phone !
M	the saga continues ...
M	ordered saturday and received tues morning .
M	excellent communication_throughout , very pleasant_transaction .
M	and the lolly was a nice_touch :)
M	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
M	this resulted_in a significant delay over the quoted arrival time and the villa owners we were meeting had to wait_until the middle of the night to meet us with the keys .
M	further stress was seen when we found we couldn ' t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
M	finally finding out our pickup time proved almost_impossible as it never got put up on the website and after me finally phoning them ( at significant cost to me ) i got it sorted out with them , however the representative was rather snippy .
M	next time i would be booking a private shuttle , however i would still use resorthoppa .
M	i recently_purchased a bluetooth headset from this company .
M	not only they offered the cheapest price , but i also received the item the next working day , though i chose the slowest delivery option .
M	i cannot_praise thomas_cook holidays enough !
M	their direct flights to antalya are so very convenient and you always get a good deal , with no_hidden_charges on their website .
M	the staff is always friendly and helpful .
M	i flew to turkey with ba before_christmas .
M	the plane took off on time and my journey was a pleasant_experience in overall .
M	excellent reception everywhere in uk , great prices on pay as you go .
M	i ordered a laptop with this company and received a confirmation of my order .
M	i paid for next_day delivery and waited all day at home .
M	it didn ' t arrive .
M	i e_- mailed the customer_service next_day to enquire and they told me that they have cancelled my order .
M	my bank informs me that the transaction has been made and not reversed .
M	so i paid for a computer , never received it and they did not even care to let me know about the situation .
M	i hope to get my bank to sort this out .
M	i would not recommend this company to anyone and i started to believe that some of the the 0 star reviews are not genuine .
M	how can a company get either completely terrible or absolutely fantastic reviews ?
M	well tesco home delivery shopping .
M	i can ' t complain i use it every week .
M	its quick very easy to use and best of all you can even change your order up untill a set time which can be on the day of delivery .
M	i would highly_recommend giving them a try and just remember to read the screen and follow the instructions which are nice and easy to see .
M	give them ago its worth it if you have a busy family / work life .
M	i have now used tshirt_studio twice and both_times ive not been dissapointed .
M	free delivery for the item to turn_up two days after ordering ... you dont get that kind of service elsewhere !!
M	!
M	my hoodie is perfect and am now creating an order for more lots more .
M	highly_recommended without even thinking about it , ive now moved tshirt_studio from the favorites menu to the favorites bar for easy quick access as i will use again again and again .
M	brilliant prices , best on the internet !
M	quick delivery and defiantly be order with them next time
M	this place rocks , i get free supps , vitamins , magazine subs and shakers all for free just for buying the same supps i would anywhere_else .
M	only diff is here they cost less and ship faster .
M	if you haven ' t been here to shop , do it !
M	beyerdynamic dt000s arrived when they said they ' d arrive .
M	and even came with a lollipop .
M	braw .
M	in a nutshell ....... everyone should use gameseek !
M	excellent service and great website :)
M	simple shopping_experience from a reliable source .
M	excellent cashback site that offers good rates and tracks very well .
M	it ' s basically free money for something you were going to buy anyway .
M	how can that be a bad thing .
M	echo had the best prices and the delivery was very efficient , i will be using them again .
M	kitout did an amazing job of our banners , they look so professional and the quality of them is amazing !
M	we are forever thankful !
M	- fall against fate
M	my order was dealt_with quickly and efficiently , it arrived when it said it would in the condition it said it would , which was perfect !
M	was a pleasure doing_business with bop and will be a return customers for sure .
M	i ' ve been with quidco 0 years now and had about £ 0000 in cleared funds transferred into my bank_account based on various purchases , such as car_insurance (£ 00 ), window blinds (£ 0 . 00 ), luggage bags (£ 0 . 00 ), phone contracts (£ 00 ), sim only contracts (£_000 ), airport_parking (£ 0 ), car tyres (£ 00 ), plus net internet (£_000 )
M	it ' s always worth checking with literally any internet purchase .
M	most of these purchases i would have made anyway so it really is just extra cash .
M	some people don ' t get why companies would pay you this extra cash , i usually just compare it to the advertising money google would get if you clicked a link after googling something and making a purchase after clicking a google link , or for the really un - initiated compare it to the aa breakdown_cover man that stands in the street selling you cover for £_000 ( he would get £_00 commission ).
M	this is the money you too are entitled to ( through quidco )!
M	service , products & delivery are always great .
M	no unpleasant surprises , generous offer , speedy payment
M	i have been preparing to start a game development project for some time and needed a high spec laptop that would keep me happy for a few_years .
M	i would have gone for a desktop but that is simply not viable with my current living arrangements .
M	i literally spent months weighing things up before settling on pc_specialist .
M	i went with them because they offered the best price , best build_quality and best service , which i deduced from many , many online reviews of all categories as well as word of mouth .
M	my place of work had ordered an optimus for me in recent months and that is still serving me very well .
M	i wanted something that would be comfortable to use , not too flashy or juvenile looking and that i could spec quite highly , so i settled on the vortex .
M	the service was incredibly fast and very professional .
M	i called them to make queries about delivery and part availability and was given prompt and accurate responses .
M	i have seen friends get burned through dell , msi and asus and wanted to avoid that kind of experience at all costs .
M	with pc_specialist , i got my wish .
M	the machine is amazing - super_quick and very powerful , nothing has made it protest or struggle yet .
M	it has a top end i0 , a 0gb 000m and a 000gb ssd and 00gb ram , so it shouldn ' t .
M	i am installing a whole bunch of 0d modelling and animation software tonight and i expect them to run very well indeed .
M	honestly , my brother in law , an architect , has just ordered a vortex for himself after seeing what i got .
M	i would insist that anyone i knew should buy from pc_specialist because i am happy to stake my reputation on theirs .
M	for top end laptops , i recommend them without_hesitation or reservation .
M	ordered a few games from cjs now and every time is has been brilliant .
M	extremely competitive_prices even compared to going direct to places like steam .
M	purchasing is so quick from clicking the one you want to buying it is just a few_clicks and the keys are delivered immediately .
M	even at 0 :_00pm !
M	cjs is very quickly becoming my go to for digitally buying games .
M	if your considering buying a fancy outfit for a party or just for fun use the same place i got mine from escapade , real brill service and quality merchandise , i won ' t be using anybody_else now i ' ve found these_guys
M	i recently ordered a giant talon 0 from the cycle centre , what can i say , delivery rapid , customer_service unbelievable , very helpful , couldn ' t of felt more at home , i will always recommend them to any body wanting a bike whether it be road , mtb or any other bike out there !
M	0st_class company couldn ' t have asked for more ordering on line was so easy and paypal accepted answell and i loved how i kept getting funny updates on there progress . 00 / 00 on every_aspect of the transaction 00 / 00 would recommend to anyone
M	these are the most reliable company on the web for supplements on the web but also keeping the lowest_prices on the market .
M	excellent service and super_fast delivery , highly_recommended !!
M	a ++++++++++
M	i placed my order on wednesday_evening and by friday_morning i was walking around with my very own personalized hoodie !
M	great service and i will_definitely use them again !
M	the website was really easy and helpful .
M	it took literally minutes to sell my old phone and 0 day after a weekend to receive the return pack .
M	will_definately use this service again in the future and will recommend this site to anyone who is selling an old_mobile phone .
M	really impressed with their service since we started using them initially on a trial basis 00 months_ago .
M	since that time we have taken on their services on a long_term basis and also seamlessly expanded the services we had set_up with them initially .
M	full of knowledgeable people who provide a helpful courteous service , particularly our account_manager who has been integral in all discussions since initial contact .
M	irfan ( conrad uk )
M	very good initial sales support over the phone and the operator knew his stuff and didn ' t try to upsell to a more_expensive model of iem given these were a present for my sister .
M	ordered using royal_mail 0st_class delivery and it came 0 working day later .
M	this was especially impressive considering all the disruption caused by the heavy snow , but most_importantly well_done for hifiheadphones getting the order out within a few hours on the same day .
M	website is also aesthetically pleasing and joy to use .
M	will use again when i undoubteldy upgrade any of my cans or buy others presents .
M	i was really impressed , this was my first time using supplementwarehouse . com and they instantly beat a competitors lower_price by 0 %!!
M	i saved over twenty dollars on one item alone .
M	plus loads of free_samples and a free_shaker which is always a plus !
M	thanks guys , be back soon !!
M	!
M	there truly are no words to describe what and awful and misleading company simply_electronics is .
M	i ordered a camera from them due to their advertising of having two in stock as well as free shipping for 0 - 0 business days .
M	needless to say the camera did not get shipped out until 0 days after the camera was purchased and it was being shipped from_hong_kong !!
M	the camera didn ' t even arrive at my home address until 0 weeks after it was originally ordered , and i had already left the country to go traveling .
M	so , i then had to have it shipped to where i was traveling to for another fifty dollars for which i have not been reimbursed .
M	customer_service was absolutely_useless as all of their employees are outsourced and speak very poor english .
M	when trying to email them i got very vague responses from random first name only " customer_service executives ".
M	none of which had any sort of tracking_number .
M	i must of emailed them about 0 times , each time getting a reply from a random " customer_service executive ".
M	how many executives can one company have ?
M	overall it was a terrible experience and i would not recommend simply_electronics to anyone .
M	that is of course , if you want to be lied to and wait around for your purchased goods .
M	amazing customer_services who went beyond the call of duty to ensure that my christmas_gifts arrived today .
M	really thrilled and they have save christmas
M	many_thanks julesb
M	friendly professional technician , brilliant service and value .
M	was shown exactly_what was done to my car and had test_drive with technican .
M	this unlocked the true potential on my 00 focus st . higher boost , 00 hp & 000 nm .
M	more responsive enjoyable drive .
M	have already_recommended to friends .
M	top job quantum
M	so we booked a stag through chilli_sauce who organised what we wanted .
M	we arrived at brighton mid morning and the hotel wasn ' t far from the station which was ideal .
M	from dropping our bags off at the hotel ( check in not unitll 0 ) we caught a taxi to go - karting .
M	it was indoor go - karting and i would highly_recommend this .
M	was a great time and competitive amongst us competitive alpha males .
M	the hotel was very nice overall and pleasant place to stay .
M	just few minor hiccups .
M	the bar service was very slow , sat there for a bout 0 - 00mins till we got served , just fancied quick pint before we went out .
M	secondly breakfast , 0 of us out of 0 weren ' t actually served or asked what we wanted to eat unlike every other guest around us and the 0 other people in our party .
M	apart_from that all good on this front .
M	the nightlife of brighton is amazing .
M	the best i have been to by_far , friends who have previously been raved_about it , now i see why .
M	we had vip for several clubs which was cool .
M	went to most and had a really good time .
M	overall the weekend was really good and really_enjoyed it .
M	would recommend especially as chillisauce sorted it for us so you didn ' t have to be worrying the whole time , you get to enjoy the weekend .
M	thanks chilli_sauce and olivia !
M	i wanted a tank bag for when i go touring to hold the essentials which i will need quickly .
M	however with my bike it was a task to find a bag which suited my bike due to the mix of materials on the tank .
M	i exchanged an_email with the customer serivces and they assured me that the bag can be exchanged or refunded if it didn ' t fit my bike .
M	this reassured me so i went_ahead with the purchase .
M	fortunately the bag fits_perfectly .
M	overall really quick response to my email and the product was delivery in exceptional time too .
M	definetly recommend to others , big_thumbs_up !
M	after moving to our new house and saving for over a year to purchase a dining_table that we intend to be a major part of our home for the next 00 - 00 years i must_say i am utterly_disgusted with the service your company has given us !
M	we visited your immaculate store on numerous_occasions and were given a great service ( obviously because you want the sale ) and decided to eventually order through your website .
M	when the payment failed online we gave your customer_service team a call where they were extremely_helpful and all so happy to help solve our issue ( again to get our sale ).
M	we parted with over £ 0000 and decided to go for the express delivery at the extra_cost of £_00 to speed the process up .
M	so it seems we have had great service , does it not ?
M	?
M	well let ’_s fast forward a week_later when we received our brand_new table …..
M	upon_opening and assembling the table we noticed a knock on the corner of the table so we thought “ ok it ’_s not a problem i ’ ll ring them and i ’ m sure they will be able to solve the problem ”.
M	after providing pictures of the damage and calling your support_team a number of times ( i think the extra_charges on my bill are now around the £_00 mark ) i get a call back from one of your customer support managers and i ’ m told don ’ t worry we will send out a company to repair the damage , now correct me if i ’ m wrong but when you buy a new table you don ’ t expect to be told that it will be repaired , so when i told the guy that ’_s not good enough and i want the new table i paid for he says “ this isn ' t company policy ” so i tell him i want a refund and he replies with these exact words “ you can have a refund but you are not welcome to order with us again ” ( oak_furniture land , if you don ’ t believe this please check your recordings ).
M	as you can imagine i ’ m a little annoyed at this stage and tell him il ring back .
M	after some deliberation and to cut an extremely long_story short we thought we would see what the repair looked like and take it from there .
M	oak_furniture land employ a company called homeserve to assess and “ repair ” the damage and the joiner touches it up , doesn ' t varnish the “ repair ” the same colour as the rest and we are still left with the worry that if the corner was to take a knock it could easily fall away .
M	the homeserve joiner also made the comment that it ’_s not perfect .
M	at this point i ’ m thinking that the homeserve joiners report and pictures will prove the point and we will be provided with a new table .
M	after three days i ’ m finally contacted to be told that the repair looks fine , they won ’ t be offering a replacement or compensation and that if i want i can have a refund .
M	to be honest i don ’ t want a refund i want this table that we paid £ 0000 for and spent countless hours researching and deciding to buy .
M	i can ’ t believe that such a big company like this would have this sort of attitude_towards customers who are willing to hand over their money .
M	i may expect it from an ebay seller …. oh wait you were once an ebay seller and because director [_name ] has worked so hard , has built up an empire that allows him to treat people like this and because he is bringing in such large amounts of money doesn ' t care that some customer will be unhappy and they can shop somewhere_else !
M	as with any service i ’ m sure there are 0000 ' s of happy customers and i can see why they would be happy as you do offer great pieces of furniture .
M	but the level of service we have since received has made us extremely_unhappy and i will be making_sure i can tell as many people as possible never to shop at oak_furniture land .
M	i ’ m not one to make complaints in public and would much rather deal with a company to resolve any_problems i have , but i feel this is completely_unacceptable when you want the item you have paid for but are being told you can ’ t have it .
M	**** update *****
M	sorry this has taken so long to reply to but after a number of calls and a lengthy rant on facebook followed_by loads of friends jumping on the band wagon oak_furniture land finally offered me a compensation deal on my damaged table .
M	i guess it helps and the customer_service i have since been offered was great but i wont be updating my score rating or above review as i really wouldn ' t have expected the initial after service they offered .
M	**** update *****
M	great website and super_fast delivery , will_definitely be ordering again with them and will be recommending to friends !
M	!
M	first of all , i would like to say , don ' t count on that if you buy one of their t -_shirts with customized logo / design / wording , that it will be a high_quality t - shirt .
M	the one you are going to get is the fruit of the loom t - shirt , currently costs £ 0 . 00 on amazon .
M	these are the cheapest of the cheapest you can get , and yet , they will charge you £_00 if you want customized logo on this .
M	this and the fact that the t - shirt they sent us was far too small , and did not match the size they mention on the size charts on their websites , influenced my decision to return it and use their guarantee to get the money back if you are not fully_satisfied .
M	it was 0 weeks_ago when we called them numerous_times asking for a refund .
M	no money was returned and when we called them back again , they told us we need to wait further 0 days !
M	stay_away from these incompetent people , they will send you the cheapest product that is available on the market and if you are not happy , you will wait weeks and weeks for them to fulfill their customer_satisfaction_guarantee .
M	we have not got our money back after 0 weeks and i don ' t know if we ever will .
M	generally a good experience , the items all arrived and i paid much less_than if i had bought things at a supermarket .
M	the delivery wasn ' t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn ' t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
M	i got the order on tuesday but had to wait in all day for it , another company i order from uses dpd and is able to give me a one hour delivery slot , dpd offers this service to their customers for free so it would make sense for sushisushi to make use of it and keep their customers happier .
M	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
M	i initially placed an order with 0gon but as i wanted to ship to my business address i held back after their security policy flagged my order would need to be shipped to my billing_address .
M	after a short email exchange with their support_team they informed me if i placed my order they would happily ship it to my works address , result 0 .
M	i then completed the order and was informed it would arrive in 0 working_days ( this would just be in time for me ) as i was too_late for that days shipment , result 0 .
M	however i then got another email back saying they managed to get the unit shipped and the delivery was now in 0 working day , result 0 !
M	so for not so much time i went from not placing an order to having it placed and the item being shipped for the next_day delivery .
M	fantastic !
M	i ' ve used blackcircles many_times now and i ' ve never had an issue .
M	again blackcircles were cheaper_than anyone_else for the tyres i had in mind .
M	i also bought tyres which were mercedes approved ( i don ' t own a mercedes ) which prompted a call from the support_team to let me know this was not an issue and the tyres marking may indicate mo for mercedes .
M	i also had to contact blackcircles to change my appointment time , again no_fuss and a confirmation_email was received within a short_space of time .
M	what else could you ask for ?
M	great prices , super_fast despatch and next_day delivery .
M	simply put if you want computer games this is the only site you need .
M	first time i have used this service and my key was with me in less_than 0 minute from when my purchase was made .
M	very very impressive !
M	theres not many companies around at the moment that make such an effort , great comuncations everystep of the way , items were well_packed and in good condition ( this is becoming less and less with other couriers ! )
M	will certainley be using again , ffx keep up this standard and you will have many loyal_customers .
M	ordered standard delivery , c my first order hope other orders are the same .
M	i have looked in every store varying from gnc to complete nutrition to the local_stores ex health nuts .
M	i have also looked online and my results are the same .
M	every place i look places are charging more_than supplementwarehouse . com
M	thanks again guys !
M	some issues with royal_mail , but you got these here fast !
M	i spent £_00 , but looking at everything i got you would have thought i ' d spent well over £_000 !
M	see you soon ;)
M	0 months in to my 0 contract , i find myself with the same problem every month .
M	i keep trying to change my bill cycle to coincide with payday , and every month i ' m told it ' s done , i still get cut_off mid - month .
M	this month , they refuse to acknowledge this has even happened and won ' t reconnect me even_though i use the phone for work , and checking on my heavily_pregnant girlfriend .
M	the manager " hannand ?"
M	is incredibly_rude and unsympathetic , see you in court .
M	i am very pleased with the service that i received from dino_pc .
M	i was able to send a few email questions about my purchase of a gallant amd 0000 , and got instant responses every time .
M	the pc itself is perfect for gaming , i was able to customize to my liking for a reasonably cheap price compared to elsewhere .
M	i would recommend to anyone_looking for custom made pc ' s and will be coming_back if i ever need a new pc .
M	yodel deserves a minus star_ratings
M	i live in london and i ordered a laptop through this courier service using a special diamond care package ( mon - fri pre_- 00am ).
M	i followed their service progress through their website and waited for my package to arrive from 0am .
M	to my annoyance , i rang them up to check on the delivery .
M	and the customer advisor was adamant that the delivery would be made in time and if not they will leave a " we just missed you " card .
M	i got none of them .
M	what really annoyed me was the fact that they made no attempt to deliver my parcel and that there clearly was no communication between the yodel depot center and their drivers .
M	the lack of awareness and the lack of care shown by the yodel customer advisors are the least problematic in their rogue delivery system .
M	the whole procedure was so inefficient .
M	i went to the yodel depot center to collect the parcel myself on the same day .
M	although the people who work at the depot can not be blamed for the inconvenience , they didn ' t exactly help the situation get any better either .
M	i tried_phoning the depot earlier to check on the whereabouts of my parcel , but no - one answered my calls .
M	and when i arrived at the depot , i understood why .
M	the people who work their seems nice and friendly .
M	however when their phones rang , they all turned a blind eye to a customer ' s call .
M	and they even joked about it afterwards , branding them " silly people ".
M	i was made to wait for an_hour in front of the reception .
M	when they then told me i had to come back the next_day , because their driver would not return after 0pm and that their depot center closes at 0pm .
M	i am still angry to this day when someone mentions the delivery courier , yodel .
M	the lack of care shown by their entire company is mind - boggling .
M	how could a delivery company who say they are one of the best in the business be so wrong , inefficient and ignorant .
M	if yodel were to do a review of their own service , they really should check on their depots / drivers .
M	the communication between drivers and their headquarters .
M	possibly re - educating the customer advisors that they should be working for their customers to their upmost ability and also be happy and proud to be working for their company .
M	i ordered a hosting_package that didn ' t fully support the . net framework , some of the features were blocked and this wasn ' t explained on the website .
M	customer_services refused to void the contract saying that i had signed_up through a special offer on their website so there was no way to void it .
M	the only way to sign_up was through the offer !!
M	!
M	please don ' t make the mistake of using them .
M	tagadab . com have been brilliant , try them out .
M	can ' t fault the service , they have never let me down !
M	product always arrives before or on the release_date .
M	good prices as well , what ' s not to like ?
M	!
M	really bad_experience .
M	i bought a laptop off them 00 days ago and they sent me the wrong product .
M	i phoned them and they told me i was in a queue and my return would be processed in order of the queue .
M	0 days_later they reply and say they will pickup the product , by this time the birthday i bought the present for has been and gone .
M	day of waiting and the courier doesn ' t come so i have to phone again and reorganise .
M	they claim they didn ' t get the email even_though i replied and sent it to their customer_services .
M	the wrong laptop finally returned they call me to say the listing was a mistake on their website and i would have to pay extra to get the product i ordered !
M	!
M	birthday missed , can ' t return the accessories i bought from another company as its passed the return period and the company will only offer me a refund .
M	oh by that way that takes three days .
M	avoid like the plague !
M	jstyla was very professional in his approach to both the design and implementation of our new website .
M	he took time to make_sure everything was fitting to the company image , looked at our goals for the future and designed accordingly .
M	there were a lot of meetings in which we could pass around ideas and feedback was taken on board for every small detail making_sure we were satisfied the whole way through .
M	good communication and quick to resolve any_issues that arise .
M	would use jstyla every time and would recommend to anyone who needs a new site , who needs graphic design work or a company re - branding .
M	a pleasure to deal with this company .
M	i was given sound_advice on what to purchase , informed on pro ' s and con ' s of each system i was looking at .
M	ordered over the phone on tuesday , received a call on tuesday_afternoon to say my goods had been dispatched and goods arrived wednesday !
M	i even got a call a couple of days_later to check i had set everything up correctly and to see if i needed any further help !
M	i cannot recommend this retailer enough .
M	look_forward to my next purchase with you guys .
M	so digitalrev have given me a canon_00d at £_000 cheaper_than the uk price and around £_000 cheaper_than the newer 00d which is not hugely different .
M	cant thank them enough .
M	dhl messed_around with the delivery but still received item less_than a week after purchase ( and would have been 0 days quicker had it not been for dhl in the uk ).
M	love the fact that the item came with an adaptor to charge the battery in the uk and the only negative is an instruction back in chinese .
M	however love the touch of adding the website to download one in english .
M	havent properly used the item yet but from first appearances and a few photos taken very happy so far .
M	complete_joke
M	i have read through other reviews and was not surprised to see loads of issues
M	upon attempting to purchase an item for £_00 . 00 a prompt was displayed
M	' there was a problem with your payment and your order has not yet been placed .
M	please check your details and try again '.
M	they still took £_000 . 00 from the 0 failed attempts
M	after the fifth attempt customer_services were contacted , they said that the previous attempts had not gone_through , i was told to try using paypal , so ordered again using the paypal and the order was confirmed .
M	this software issue put my bank_account into arrears with the possibility of incurring charges , but for the time had left me with no money from friday 00nd march – wednesday 00th_march , 0days including a pre_- arranged trip away over the weekend meaning no access to spending money and also not being_able to access money needed for travelling to work on the monday following the weekend .
M	was offered a ' good will gesture ' credit to the account of £_00 . 00 which meant i would have to purchase from them again to redeem the credit .
M	but due to all of this stress , even more so now , i do not see how this can be used and be confident that this will not happen again without resulting in the same situation .
M	the money final went back in today but i believe this to be there automated service taking care of this , not by the personel i had asked to help
M	i had made countless calls , 00 + were everytime i had asked for the manager to contact me , was told that my messages where being put through to the managers but i never got a reply .
M	( sorry i recieved 0 from umar but did not help at all ).
M	what was happening to my messages ??
M	why do they not reply to there customers ?
M	umar and aidan both customer_services manager provided very very poor service , i cannot_believe they can treat their customers this way .
M	i have thought about taking this further and glad to see my issues can be backed_up multiple_times by unsatisfied customers .
M	i hope this info is of use .
M	ordered 00 red_roses it is now 0000 still no delivery , i have emailed them no reply
M	i was sent a email with a link to tracking and when i went on it the number i was given didnt match any order , well thanks iflorest you take my money but dont deliver surely they carnt get away with this the least you can do is refund all of us please beware and dont use iflorist .
M	00 / 0 / 00 still no flowers well i florists i want a full_refund it is to late for the flowers now how can you treat people like this i managed to speak to some one and they told me their lorry got stuck in snow wot a load of rubbish refund please .
M	00 / 0 .
M	got flowers today don ' t no wot time i was in all day partner come in from shop and they was on the door_step , i ordered 00 red_roses and upgraded for better and bigger , wot i got was 0 pink dead roses and 0 other nearly dead flowers don ' t no wot they was , they won ' t answer the phone or reply to my emails , sorry forgot to say i got a 0 pound voucher to spend with iflowers as if i will ever use it , i think at_least we all should get a refund you have ripped so many people off you all should learn how to run a company before you start one , thanks for nothing
M	0000 on the 00 / 0 still no reply to my emails so you leave me no choice so i will be contacting tradingstandard on monday and taking the matter_further not happy my order no is p000000
M	just had a email from i florist to say i am getting a full_refund , i will wait and see if i get it
M	it just works .
M	no delays , no faff , they always seem to have everything in stock , they ' ll match prices and it ' s despatched as soon as you order .
M	really good .
M	if you know your size in stuff , there ' s no need to buy anywhere_else .
M	the kit is such good quality and the service is amazing .
M	real people , interested in the stuff you do with it , it ' s more_than just a shop .
M	incredible for an online_retailer .
M	we try and order rabbit litter in bulk , and so many sellers claim free delivery then add a charge over a certain weight and then adjust it by weight .
M	it ' s fair_enough , but no - one publishes the weight of the litter !
M	petshopbowl just had a flat delivery fee , which is terrific as you can quickly work out the cost per bag rather_than faffing with lots of maths .
M	i ' ll definitely use them again .
M	really nice_touch to ask for your pets ' names for your registration , after all it ' s them we buy things for !
M	nice for a pet company to recognise the fact .
M	well , it was really perfect .
M	being a commodore amiga , a very delicade item , cash did a very good job when it comes to packaging .
M	thank_you
M	bought x : rebirth , price cheaper_than other_sites .
M	as it was first order i assume delivery speed was slowed slightly .
M	cdkey came after about 00_minutes activated fine on steam .
M	will try again in future
M	wow !
M	had my package in less_than 00_hours of ordering .
M	very impressive .
M	will_definitely be back for anything_else i want .
M	i would just like to say how happy i am with your level of service .
M	it is so nice to know that prompt service is not dead .
M	if i used phone insurance i would have been looking at a 0 week turnaround at_least and for less_than double the amount of money i get a fully refurbished phone in 0 days !
M	i will be recommending youselves to my friends .
M	never had any_problems , and they ' ve always been cheaper_than the usual sources .
M	no issues at all , delivered as promised .
M	ordered from here during my entire deployment , everything got over_seas on time and is only of the only online places that ship to the military over_seas
M	as a huge football / soccer fan , being_able to watch games all weekend is my " thing ".
M	it ' s what i do , so when my tv continued to act up i decided that enough was enough - i won ' t miss another steven gerrard penalty again .
M	i phoned some of the local companies to find a cost - effective strategy - hey , moneys tight - and chose to use aerialforce because they offered a fair price , and had available slots before the southampton match .
M	the high winds are driving me to distraction so it was nice to be able to just get in and watch the match without constant freezing .
M	the guys at aerialforce were here 0 minutes before they said they would be and were away not long after .
M	i ' ve yet to suffer from a " buffering " sensation on the tv since .
M	quality work , cheers lads .
M	the amount of excellent offers on display made me come to actually view the site properly .
M	i ' d heard of winner through a friend but wanted to visit it myself and see what i made of it .
M	i instantly got a few brilliant startup offers , and this was a nice little bonus .
M	these additions are well worth having on your end , for sure , they make your gambling much cheaper , right ?
M	the entire site is simple to manage , though .
M	no_problems here on my part - it ' s quick , it ' s easy and it ' s got a hell of a lot different features and styles of gambling available .
M	i ' ll be back to use winner in the future !
M	having spent pretty_much all of my time in recent years trying to create my own income it ' s been very frustrating .
M	however , i decided to fire off my cv / resume onto jobs0careers and it ' s been one of the smartest decisions i ' ve made in some time .
M	i have used the engine a few_times now when looking for jobs and it ' s not the usual commission or sales based junk you usually get - i actually got myself some service contracts through the search_engine .
M	i recommended it to a few friends and one of them found a full - time job with a local warehouse company in glasgow , the other two found temporary solutions which is all they were after , so i think it ' s fair to say jobs0careers has given me and my friends all of the help we needed in terms of finding new employment and making some money !
M	i ' d happily_recommend this website to just about anybody who needs a job , whether they are unemployed or are looking for a new direction .
M	the list is huge , the site is so easy to navigate and the companies are reliable and trustworthy firms rather_than your fly by night call_centres .
M	today i was making some work enquirers to parcel0go via the web chat .
M	i was chatting to [_name ]
M	[_name ] was great and helpful .
M	i think she may be the one !
M	i ' m in love with her ....
M	love you [_name ]!
M	xx
M	superb help , couldnt be more helpful with my difficult situation and was pleasent throughout , highly_recommended and would have no_problems in placing my trust for future parcels in sarah_hayes hands as she ' s fantastic and throughly professional .
M	sarah_hayes has brighten up my day - thanks for all your help and good news
M	! 0 out of 00
M	great service , received code within ten_minutes :_d
M	fast payout , no hassle , used many_times before .
M	don ' t use this company .
M	bracket will not fit your tv , even_though they had the model number .
M	sent this back at £_00 cost , no sign of refund , unable to speak to anyone .
M	email contact worse than useless , promises of refund , and contact from relevent " department "
M	please buy elsewhere , hopefully they will go_bankrupt and stop robbing people of their money .

M	having read reviews on which socks offered the best protection against blisters when playing basketball , thorlo running socks came up as a good option .
M	sock shop had a great range of styles and colours available , i order wednesday_afternoon and had them first thing thursday_morning .
M	i ' ll use them again !
M	bought a pair of oakley jawbones from the store in bawtry and the staff were very friendly and offered good advice .
M	recommended !
M	we inherited an adt alarm system when we took over a retail business , in the past 0 years we ' ve had no end of trouble with the cheap alarm system they installed , a total_lack of customer_service and engineers that contradict each other and blame anything but the shoddy alarm system they use .
M	despite numerous engineers being called out over the years our alarm regularly displays error messages and signals false alarms .
M	adt have a habit of over billing , for instance our last call out was due to a technical fault , it took the engineer 0 minutes to identify the problems and 00_minutes to ' fix '.
M	the invoice came through stating that he ' d been here 0 . 00_hours and that it was due to an intruder alert so the work was chargeable .
M	adt = scam !
M	do not use .
M	avoid .
M	000_% rip_off .
M	used william_hill for years for betting on horses and football , lost more_than i ' ve won ( obviously ) but the site is really easy and simple to use .
M	tried other services but just come back to will hill .
M	good service and platform .
M	easy to use and would use again .
M	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
M	easiest , most efficient site out there .
M	end of story .
M	great selection .
M	fast service .
M	unbeatable_prices .
M	you cant go_wrong with supplement_warehouse .
M	they have a good range of sweets , communications , delivery etc were all first rate , my only complaint would be that the delivery charges are perhaps a little high , but not excessively so .
M	grey house furniture ltd . has been setup on behalf of owen arthur mackrell , by his pa ben atkins .
M	owen has owned numerous companies that have been closed_down and cost many people £ 0 , 000 ' s .
M	most noticeably he was the director of mac & mac interiors ( lcc contract furniture ltd .) that was put into liquidation and they still robbed customers of their money knowing they couldn ' t deliver the furniture .
M	google ' mac & mac interiors ' or ' owen mackrell ' to see all of the negative_reviews , he is behind this company too but has had his pa ben atikins set the company up because he has such a bad reputation and can no_longer do business under his own name !
M	!
M	if you don ' t want to lost your money i suggest you avoid this company at all costs !!
M	a leapoard never changes its spots and owen has already scammed people under at_least 0 different companies i am aware of so don ' t expect this to be any different .
M	i have had over £ 00k worth of work come from pph and had a dispute with 0 buyer who was being unreasonable .
M	as i never responded to the buyer within 00_hours they closed my account down .
M	i have tried_contacting their support regarding this for almost 0 weeks now with no reply .
M	they expected me to respond to a dispute within 00_hours , yet havn ' t responded to my own dispute with them in almost 0 weerks - avoid !!
M	!
M	two whole months after ordering my glasses , they still_haven ' t arrived .
M	each time i email and phone they tell me they are waiting for a delivery for my frames .
M	their phone_lines are now " experiencing technical_difficulties "
M	i have sent 0 - 0 emails and phoned 0 times .. twice to get the phonelines are broken .
M	the time i got through the person i spoke to said he ' d go over to the warehouse / lab and find out why my glasses haven ' t been dispatched and then phone me back .
M	he never phoned me back , his name was michael
M	to put my experience into context , i have never felt the need to leave a review for a website before and i ' ve had some pretty poor experiences in the past .
M	.
M	worst company ever , they have not delivered my item for 00 days now .
M	it may be cheap but most definitely the delivery is awful .
M	i think the delivery men left it in front of my house and legged it .
M	absolutely_terrible .
M	as internet user , i usually have doubt against online shop that aren ' t well know for what they do .
M	i tried cartridgeshop . co . uk and bought a brother ink catridge just because they support payment via_paypal .
M	i was not disappointed .
M	thanks .
M	order arrived within 00_hours .
M	very happy !
M	i ordered a dewalt xr 0 pack from tool line .
M	their price was the cheapest on the comparison_sites .

M	the money was taken out on the same day .
M	the flowers never arrived and i have not received a refund .
M	i don ' t live in the uk at the moment and so cannot phone their 0000 number .
M	the " live_chat " service has never been online when i have attempted to us it .
M	i have not had a single response to any of the ten emails i have written .
M	all in all the worst service from any company i have ever received .
M	so far , this is the best game store for me .
M	i ' ve purchased few games .
M	had no trouble to get the keys and the rest of instructions .
M	i ' ll be back again soon !
M	fast and reliable keep it up
M	ive had hosting with a few cheaper web hosts and was always a bit_skeptical_about paying more for hosting .
M	i needed to increase the speed of my website and my hosting was my first stop in doing this .
M	simple servers was recommended by a client of mine , and i am very impressed with the service i have received so far .
M	the transferred my site , and sorted any_issues that came up with the transfer .
M	well worth the money , and it has improved the speed of my site lots !
M	use them , you wont be sorry !
M	the best on - line record shop hands_down .
M	i ordered the handset online with e0save part of a cash back deal but was a bit_unsure as i had not heard of them .
M	the phone arrived about 0 days_later in perfect working order and i got the best tarriff deal i could find anywhere .
M	0 months in to my contract i sent my bill to the claims department for my first cash back claim and about two_weeks_later my cheque arrived .
M	i am now 00 months into my contract and could not be_happier with the whole experience from start to end .

M	excellent advice , brilliant delivery and service .
M	great offers and rewards scheme plus huge choices .
M	never had a bad_experience and the staff are always helpful .
M	have no_hesitation in recommending affordable_supplements to everyone .
M	hassle - free , speedy_delivery of product .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	great service , and great prices all_round .
M	a friend_recommended me to the site and the first thing i found was a pleasant layout , very user_friendly .
M	i have never spent so much money on one thing in my pc but my friend_recommended that the money i had i should buy a gainward gtx_000 ti gold sample .
M	luckily they were on sale .
M	i put down the order using paypal which as anyone who uses paypal knows is quick and very painless .
M	i paid the extra postage for guaranteed next_day delivery .
M	a lovely city_link man arrived and with parcel in hand assured i was happy before leaving .
M	i must_admit i will be recommending aria to all my other friends .
M	i love this company , the prices are almost always superior to all other offers , and the fact that they give express delivery at a very low price is fantastic , i have had no_complaints
M	i found hostelbookers to be the simplest of the several online reservation sites to use .
M	the distance from city_centre feature was incredibly useful as was the many options to filter search_results .
M	also many reviews of all hostels i looked at so i could choose where to stay based on what others had recommended .
M	i have shopped at plenty of places on and offline .
M	most brick and mortars don ' t have the selection or variety .
M	in addition , the prices are often jacked up because of the overhead cost , and commision to the sale associates that work in these places .
M	furthermore , you often need a paid membership to see any sort of discount .
M	the online arena is a bit better , but most online merchants don ' t have a direct source to get the best prices .
M	therefore , you still end up paying for a product that probably been sold 0 - 0 times before it reaches your hand .
M	also , the shipping rates for a lot of these products are outrageous .
M	this is why you should shop at supplementwarehouse . com .
M	they have best pricing that i have seen online and offline , and you can ' t beat the limited time 0 . 00 flat shipping .
M	i have been ordering from the site for the past couple of years and i haven ' t been disappointed yet .
M	went online to check it out one day ..... 0 days_later i received a cheque .... top stuff !
M	hostelbookers was extremely user firendly .
M	it listed all the hostels available as well as provided comprehensive info and reviews there are also no charges for booking , which you get with other_sites .
M	i will definitly be using hostelbookers again !
M	have tried other_companies and always come back to top dollar , unlike_other_companies they are fast , honest and reliable .
M	would highly_recommend
M	sent them phones which they said were faulty and offered me next to nothing for , then charged me £_00 to return them to me .
M	i have used [_external reference_removed_] and [_external reference_removed_] and never had this problem before , will never use bozowi again !!!
M	avoid at all costs !!!
M	!
M	00th_feb - have just received a letter from bozowi threatening to take me to court over my false feedback .
M	everything i said is true and i will now be taking this further !
M	reporting them to trading_standards !
M	how can people like this be allowed to trade ?
M	most unprofessional and nasty company ever !!!!!
M	!
M	so , one week now and i ' m still very very very happy with my car , really nice , fast , funny .
M	i ' ve got friends with got their cars from e_- bay new or second_hand and the are very disappointed .
M	so i do recommend nitrotek if you going to get you model , fast delivery , safe , and cheap price , you can save maybe 00 or 00 pounds at different places , but when you buy a product from a reliable place such as nitrotek you safe a lot of more money avoiding problems .
M	i recommend .
M	fast delivery , quality products , great customer_service .
M	cant ask for any more .
M	arrived in good time , well_packaged .
M	couldn ' t fault them
M	delivered quickly with appropriate packaging .
M	checkout on website was quick and easy .
M	will use again .
M	great for little gifts for birthdays and christmas .
M	i went on event_tyres website whilst i was browsing for the cost of tyres and found that event_tyres were the cheapest for the particular tyre i wanted .
M	i booked it all online very easily to come to my work address ( which isn ' t the easiest place to change a tyre due to parking attendants ) on 00 / 00 /_0000 and the booking was confirmed for the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) between 00am - 0pm .
M	i had a call around 00am to say they would be with me at around 00 :_00am and sure enough they were .
M	it took just half an_hour to change both of my front_tyres .
M	all i can say is that i will be using this company again in the future as they saved me messing_around trying to get out of work to get to a garage .
M	thank_you !
M	!
M	excellent service , received product instantly .
M	delivery was fast and worked_perfectly .
M	awesome company !
M	!
M	always buy my equipment from nevada .... never let me down yet .
M	friendly service and knowledable staff .
M	they ' ve got cheap prices and will always price_match anything i ' ve ever_seen cheaper .
M	keep up the good work guys !
M	!
M	carl
M	quick dispatch , kept up to date with progress , superb over all , and a great official item , can ' t fault at all
M	excellent item , speedy_delivery , a great range of items , what more could you ask for , can ' t recommended this site enough
M	great price_matching feature , plus fast_shipping ( from wisconsin to minnesota ).
M	love supplement_warehouse !
M	i know very little about surfing and the staff in boylo ' s are more_than happy to give you as much as help as you could want !
M	plus i bumped into a couple of guys in there last summer who were champions in some form of surf cup and they were coming to boylo ' s for their gear , so it must be a good place to head to !
M	everything perfect !
M	deal , attention & results .
M	i have only been ordering from bbw for a couple of months now .
M	its a great and helpful website if you want to start body_building .
M	the main things when your buying bodybuilding supplements and sports supplements is the price and bbw prices cant be beat .
M	the other thing that is great is the free delivery .
M	end is the first place that i have found who embrace classic cult brands and new up and coming designers from all over the world , and combine this offering with superb service i only wish i could afford more of their stuff
M	just moved_into a new build home with velux windows but no blinds , so searched online and found loftblinds . co . uk - their website is very easy to use and i became slightly addicted to clicking through the various blind colours so watch the animations !
M	i ordered my blinds in the morning and they were with me next_day , in under 00_hours .
M	i couldn ' t fault the customer_service , and the blinds were much cheaper_than velux prices .
M	so much so i thought they might be cheap copies , but to my delight they were genuine items .
M	all three blinds i ordered arrived in good condition and came with fitting instructions , their website also had a fitting video - fitting took 00_mins and they fitted the windows perfectly .
M	they look like they will last a few_years , but i ' m already thinking about experimenting with other colours !
M	this is my favorite site to buy bulk order from since they have competitive price and they price_match any other competitor online .
M	highly_recommend it !
M	the payment process was easy , the item was good quality for the price and it came 00_hours after the order was placed on standard delivery !
M	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
M	we were told " no bbq today " without any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
M	people who suffer from hypoglycemia need food at regular intervals and a venue that puts people through physical activity for a day with no proper food is irresponsible and asking for trouble .
M	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
M	not a fun experience on a hangover !
M	great company , super_fast postage , amazing prices .
M	couldn ' t ask for better service !
M	to be honest i was a little_worried_about spending £ 0000 online via hong_kong but i have to say i will_definitely use digital_rev for future orders .
M	they kept me up to date via text and email and i was especially suprised at how fast it got here from_hong_kong .
M	john
M	uk
M	canon_0d with the 00 - 000l
M	great service , fast and great package !
M	we use parcel0go a lot and cant_fault it , first time i ' ve needed to use chat and it was spot on !!
M	catherine_corless couldn ' t have helped more , was a pleasure :)
M	yesterday mu iphone was opened by officialiphoneunlock . co . uk .
M	noa using my iphone .
M	thank_you officialiphoneunlock . co . uk .
M	bought a team rc hawk talon v0 cheaper then anywhere i could find with free shipping .
M	arrived on time and ready to fly straight out the box - no_complaints here
M	site is easy to navigate , prices are brilliant and delivery times are excellent .
M	bravo !
M	when buying a none running car i didnt tjink getting it shipped to me would be this easy or affordable .
M	love the way people bid for your requirements .
M	then choose the best one , pay a deposit and the balance goes to the courier on arrival
M	they offered top brass and paid promptly .
M	omg , i thought it was a scam , mailed and complained because was an_hour late , got a response in minutes , now officially_unlocked .
M	fantasitc ,
M	thank_you
M	thank_you
M	thank_you
M	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
M	the problem is that i pre_- ordered cod : ghosts for pc and got some rather mixed messages .
M	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
M	when i try to get my key it says it will be delivered 00_hours before_release - not true .
M	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
M	facebook says keys will come out at 0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
M	key is finally available at 0000hrs
M	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before_release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
M	be honest guys and you will have a customer for a long time ( if you keep the prices this great !
M	).

M	i ' ve used ebuyer . com for over 0 years and would recommend them to anyone .
M	they have a great range of items , from pc_components to printers at very reasonable prices .
M	i ' ve only once had an issue with an item i ordered ( which wasn ' t ebuyer ' s fault ) and they were more_than happy to replace it with no_quibbles - exactly_what you want when ordering online .
M	the website is clear and easy to use and has detailed technical specs for most items meaning you know what you are going to get .
M	even if what you want to know isn ' t listed in the description you can ask them !
M	a great site and my first ( and often last ) port of call for all my tech needs .
M	nothing else to say that it was simple and fast , everything is very clear with a really intuitive site .
M	you can ' t go_wrong here , recommended 000_%
M	good product arrived quickly
M	very helpful and easy to talk to , had issue sorted in mins
M	very fast and got job_done
M	thanx :)
M	very impressed overall .
M	easy and very quick payment .
M	i regularly check other_sites apart_from amazon for price and delivery options but always end up buying from amazon .
M	i have a prime membership which provides me with free shopping on anything i buy directly from amazon and it has saved me a fortune .
M	customer_service is great and always responds promtly .
M	i also own an amazon kindle and it is my favourite gadget that i own backed_up by amazon ' s kindle bookstore all available from the device itself .
M	really good products delivered promptly .
M	any time that i have needed to contact customer_service they have dealt_with my concerns quickly and completely to my satisfaction .
M	could not be more pleased .
M	really useful website , the weekly emails are really useful for finding bargains and great deals on various products
M	ordered an item two months_ago , which was cancelled by zavvi . com .
M	i was told my card had not been charged however came back from holiday and money had been taken out of my account .
M	0 phone_calls and 0 emails over two months and i still have not had the money refunded back to me .
M	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
M	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
M	myprotein offers good quality protein at a hugely competitive price - it is a pity that their free delivery catered for by yodel is absolutely_appalling .
M	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
M	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
M	i was weighing up buying a monitor from dabs , as it had been featured as a hot offer on hotukdeals and after looking around it was by_far the best price on the market .
M	i decided to sleep on it .
M	the next_day it appears as a daily deal on ebuyer .
M	it works out 00_% cheaper and i get free next_day delivery .
M	you can ' t ask for much more_than that and i look_forward to getting it tomorrow !
M	thanks ebuyer !
M	great service .
M	delivery was faster_than_expected and packaging was very secure .
M	i have used double0tickets a few_times now , and i dont even try any other_sites now .
M	i know i will get great service , fast service and the best seats .
M	i dont mind paying a little extra because its always that extra bit special . when you go .
M	i have just purchased mumford and sons tickets , my husband thought they were sold out and really gutted he would have missed them , but as always double0tickets had tickets available , he is going to be so chuffed its his christmas_present .
M	partner ordered a chair for me for my bday 0 weeks in_advance , got told was guna b 0 days then had a phone call saying it was out of stock and b no_longer_than a week ( no_problems , plenty of time to get here for my bday ) actually ended_up being 0 weeks !
M	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
M	next_day delivery and the cheapest tyres around .
M	every year i get my tyres from these_guys and every year they don ' t let me down :_d
M	camera and accessories were priced lower_than most .
M	delivered in 0 days and any reservations_about hong_kong location were unfounded .
M	ideal service with great communication and decent warranty and aftercare prospects .
M	i ' d use them again in a heartbeat .
M	i ' ve been ordering my supplements from bodybuilding - supplements . co . uk for the last_year , and the company is great .
M	quick delivery and really competitive_prices , treats existing_customers well with promotional codes .
M	good experience ordering from them , i have ordered from them on two_separate_occasions and both_times my items were delivered quickly .
M	so i bought some items from asos around £_000 it was all delivered fine .
M	i went to return some things and the was all fine i used collect +.
M	0 day passed and they never contacted me or said a word so i emailed and they said they hadn ' t received it .
M	little do they know i have tracking_number so i show them and they say okay what did you send ?
M	they have no clue as to what it was in the refund .
M	they processed it and well after over 000 emails and 0 . 0 months of waiting the refund hasn ' t gone into my bank_account and i ' m just doing the same_thing over and over again .
M	its a joke and never ever ever use them !
M	this place is top_notch , i needed a game was not prepared to pay full wack for digital_copy and i didn ' t a game for 00 . 00 i got for 00 . 00 .
M	this is what i like to see good price and good delivery .
M	god og_hurtig_levering :)
M	ordre nummer : 000000
M	if you manage to find something cheaper , they price_match .
M	this site is incredible ... and you can get a free_shaker_cup with every order ... whats not to beat ?
M	!
M	i ordered my item from their web store on friday before new years_eve , the lead arrived the next_day , recorded first_class delivery .... not even amazon best these_guys service .... many other internet companies could learn a thing about customer_service from hifix ... will def be back for more !
M	!
M	... for truly stunning beauties dressed head - to - toe in sexy latex attire .
M	what i like about this site is the quality of the models - they ' re all beautiful enough to feature on the pages of vogue !
M	- and the quality of the latex outfits .
M	there are some super sexy dresses with details that i ' ve never seen elsewhere .
M	what ' s also great about latexotica is that the girls keep their clothes on !
M	that ' s why i join sites like this , to see girls actually wearing latex .
M	if i want nudity i can find it for free everywhere .
M	overall i highly_recommend latexotica to fans of both latex and beautiful girls .
M	i don ' t have much to say other than it was my first flight with any airline .
M	it was very easy to do the online checking in and even easier at the airport ..
M	the flight was comfortable and i had an all_round pleasant_experience ..
M	excellent , never had any_issues and i have sent loads of parcels .
M	prices are great and you get full tracking_information included as well as better compensation offered over a royal_mail .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	never had such a simple process of having faulty handsets replaced on contract plans , even when out of gaurantee .
M	next_day delivery by courier at a time_slot of your choice .
M	brilliant !!
M	no taking phone to be repaired like o0 !
M	an immediate next_day solution !
M	rude scruffy drivers with zero manners and the ability of speaking fluent english has passed them by .
M	a shambles of a company that operates in chaos !
M	trust me i ' ve seen their offices in sunderland and they are shocking !
M	great service and customer care .
M	i had an issue with my order due to an it problem and they called me back within a few hours with a great solution .
M	they really do go the extra_mile when you have a problem .
M	as for the food , it ' s excellent .
M	the steaks are delicious and the chicken_breasts are enormous !
M	no loss of size once cooked either .
M	all_round excellent company , just wished i ' d ordered earlier !
M	!
M	speedy process for peace of mind .
M	order was wrong and the items were split , this was clearly visible before packing as the outer_packaging was perfect so was nothing to do with the courier .
M	i have been trying to contact myprotein for 0 week with no definitive response on what they are going to do to help me .
M	very bad start to my dealings with myprotein hope they resolve this soon !
M	our holiday to budapest was excellent the deal we got on the hotel was brilliant as the soho boutique hotel was very nice .
M	the rooms were not huge but there was enough space and the finish was very good .
M	the staff were excellent and lowcostholidays recommended it as one of the best deals .
M	low_cost are up front with all costs and don ' t hide any fees .
M	the website is easy to use and they give you all your info in one handy booklet !
M	ordered a samsung_galaxy tab 0 . 0 00 gb white on a deal that was posted on a daily deal website for 000 . 00 , while it could have been a mistake on their part , that is what was advertised , many people ordered but they couldnt fulfill the order and they blamed their stock system , surely if you tell the system that there are say 0000 items , when 0000 sales are done , the item becomes out of stock and unavailable for further purchase .
M	instead they chose to go_ahead and take the card_details and then a couple of days_later sent a bulk email_saying they had to cancel it , they probably didnt want to sell it on the cheap , offered no apology , no commercial gesture ( ie a voucher or something ) and then cancelled the order .
M	even after they tweeted the deal they still didnt do anything but were quite happy to get the free advertising from the deal .
M	that was my first and last order from their website and i wouldnt go into their stores or recommend them .
M	have bought gifts for parents and friends , various mugs for work and they are reasonably_priced and i love the novelty items .
M	no issues with customer_service and delivery on 0 orders so far
M	i live two miles_away and i can usually collect on my way to and from work , plenty of parking in the reading store and usually no other customers than me whenever i go .
M	staff are friendly and seem knowledgeable enough ( but i never need sales assistance anyway as i buy parts ).
M	have bought all parts for my new computer from there and collected when it was ready .
M	they are usually a couple of quid more_expensive than amazon or dabs but the fact i dont pay postage and can get the item the same day by collecting is a trade - off i am willing to make .
M	can even get quidco cashback so that makes up a little_bit .
M	any_issues i just go back in there and they test the component there and then , had a doa ram and they replaced it on the spot with a new one .
M	have been recommending this to my local friends and colleagues .
M	amazon is simply great
M	great prices
M	great customer_service
M	no issues with deliveries , always very quick and they dont use parcelforce !
M	puts most of the other_retailers to shame
M	delivery from two retailers , email and text advises me it has arrived onto the depot and will be delivered next_day , option to choose the delivery date if the proposed one is not suitable .
M	on the morning of the delivery you get a timeslot .
M	drivers are friendly and polite and respect the supplied timeslot .
M	i highly recomment their service .
M	complete liars .
M	never ring the door_bell with about a dozen deliveries in two years , yet the postman is able to ring the bell ok .
M	constantly having to drive and park in town to go and pick_up from the post_office .
M	if i wanted to go to the shops i wouldnt have bought the items online .
M	their customer_service is useless its handled by people who have never seen a parcel or a doorbell and probably not even in the uk .
M	when you ring the 00xx number it sends you to another depot , only to be told my local_depot have switched their phones off .
M	why people still use them i dont know ?
M	!!!!!!
M	avoid like the plague !!!!
M	!
M	i have been buying goods from ebuyer since 0000 and ebuyer used to be really good and have recommended it to many friends and work colleagues .
M	delivery was brilliant when they were using citylink .
M	prices were right and quality of the items was really good .
M	had one bad_experience with a faulty item collected from my place and returned to my old adress , one of their agents was plain rude and in the wrong ( got this confirmed by trading_standards ) which was only sorted when another agent picked_up the enote 0 months later , leaving me with without my mp0 player and my money ... not great customer_service .
M	decided to stop ordering from them for almost 0yrs .
M	then wanted to give them a second chance hoping they had sorted their issues but i got bitten twice , this time by the crap delivery company they use ( parcelforce ) who never ring the house despite the fact that i am in but seem to be quite happy to put a card in the letterbox and making me collect it from the post_office for a delivery which i paid , rearranging a delivery takes over a week .
M	complained to ebuyer to complain got an answer 0 weeks_later ..
M	this has appened again on my latest delivery .
M	unfortunately the delivery company is the only contact between ebuyer and its customer and on top of that the poor customer experience i had with ebuyer means i will now stop using and recommending ebuyer altogheter .
M	i have to admit that i was a little_sceptical at first given all the scammers out there , but i ' m now overjoyed that i can now use my iphone on any network !
M	!
M	since my iphone was locked to o0 uk , i did have to wait for 00 days till the unlock arrived , but at_least the website allowed me to check the status of my order any time i wanted .
M	also , it may be good to note that once you effect payment , the company will ask you to verify the order by sending a photo id or at_least the frontside of the credit_card used to pay ( card number covered ) - it seems its just the company ' s way to ensure that they are not deaing with a scammer !
M	!
M	truly a wonderful service at a reasonable_price !
M	!
M	will_definitely_recommend !
M	!
M	blackcircles sent email confirmation on thursday that the tyres i ordered had arrived at the garage ready for my fitting appointment .
M	when we arrived at the garage on saturday_morning there was no tyres !
M	disgraceful !
M	turns_out blackcircles hadn ' t even ordered them from their supplier .
M	shocking !
M	result , i ' ve taken my business elsewhere , event mobile tyres sorted me out with new tyres_fitted by monday lunchtime .
M	they had the cheek to offer a 00_%_discount off my next order as compensation .
M	no chance of that ever being used ... then i suppose they knew that already .
M	pathetic service .
M	we strive towards great customer_service , and as a uk_based company , we are here to listen to your comments and improve wherever necessary
M	this is the same company as iflorist , please read their reviews first before buying
M	i ordered a bouquet of flowers on the 00th of december in order to receive them on the 00th of december as a gift to my wife .
M	on the 00th we made sure that someone was in the house at all times and also mentioned to my neighbors to watch out in case we didn ' t see them being delivered .
M	the bouquet never arrived , they were supposed to be delivered via yodel , and i received an_email_stating that they had been delivered , it also stated they had been left safe ( strange as i was at home ), so i ran around my house looking for them but found nothing , i then spent about an_hour knocking on neighbours doors trying to find if they had been delivered to the wrong_address , but noone had received the delivery .
M	as they were closed on the 00th and 00th i proceeded to contact yodel to follow my delivery who stated that they had been left in the front porch .......
M	i do not have a front porch ?
M	i then contacted iflorist who can only be contacted via live_chat on their website and they take about 0 mins to answer any 0 line of questioning or response , very slow .... all i was told is that they will investigate .
M	so now i have a very unhappy wife who thinks i forgot about her flowers for christmas and no response as to when or if they will be delivered
M	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i emailed iflorist and chatted to them online on the 00th and still have no response after 00hrs
M	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have chatted to iflorist , they have told me to check with neighbours , which i had already done on the 00th and now the flowers were dead , they then gave me a phone number to call : 00000000000
M	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have called iflorist , they have told me they will be getting the flowers redelivered on the friday 0th of january so they will be delayed by a total of 00 days late , i also asked if they were going to do anything_else , and the answer was a simple : " no , company policy_states that all we can do is have the flowers redlivered "
M	the weekend was organised exactly to my specification and executed flawlessly .
M	the guide was very friendly , well_organised and kept us all on the straight and narrow road to a drink fuelled weekend .
M	use this service for a stress_free weekend where all you need to do is pay and the rest is done for you .
M	purchased a product and wished to return it , however the return process was awful , and is still ongoing !
M	had to wait 00 days to get a response from the returns people , and when i go a response they wanted to charge me 00_% of the cost of the item as a ' handling charge ' to return the item .
M	unacceptable !!
M	never buy a product from here if you think you might need to return it at any point .
M	very disappointed .
M	i was searching the internet for a pc which was affordable , good quality , and ready for gaming components .
M	i found arbico and they seemed to be a very trust_worthy company just from the quality of their site , but anyway i bought a pc with , what seemed to be average parts / specification ( amd athlon dual core 0hz , 0gb_ram , asus m0a00l - mlx motherboard , and a 000gb hdd ).
M	so i ordered the pc for around £_000 all together i think and i received it within 0 days , which is what i expected as a minimum .
M	the pc was amazing without tweaks and new parts , but as i wanted a computer which was amazing at handling games and video .
M	i bought an asus geforce gtx_000 ti video card for £_000 and the computer is amazing .
M	i am so happy with the product and the customer_service i received .
M	hi , my name is simon newman .
M	i use hostelbookers all the time as they have a good variety of places to choose from and since it is a well_established site it has many reviews that help me make an informed_decision .
M	i recently placed my first order after using lush for so many years !
M	i mainly ordered for myself , bath bombs and soap , but also purchased a gift pack for an upcoming birthday as the packs were exceptional value !
M	paid for standard delivery but received it next_day and a free_sample was also included !
M	bonus .
M	highly_recommended based on my recent_purchase .
M	ive been a customer of virgin_media services for a while , no major problems with the service and the price i pay is rather reasonable .
M	one problem , which was rather sneaky - i phoned up as the one time my service wasn ' t working they offered me a discount !
M	the chap on the phone said i wouldn ' t be tied in to another 00 month_contract but several days_later i received a new contract !!!
M	nothing like deception
M	popped in to a local_store today as need a part for pc fast - first of all , ridiculous prices - i cant_believe people pay their over_inflated prices !!!
M	!
M	sales people so pushy its unbelievable !!
M	!
M	wouldn ' t ever shop there again !
M	order from mp several_times .... always good service , quick delivery and great products !
M	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it ' s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
M	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
M	the experience had it ' s good points and it ' s bad points !!!
M	!
M	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
M	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
M	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
M	0 hour later i received a phone call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn ' t best pleased when i said no .
M	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
M	i was sceptic at first , didn ' t really believe that they would smell exactly the same , but then i decided to order a bottle and give it a try .
M	i purchased millionaire ( inspired by 0 million paco rabanne ), received it today and it ' s spot on !
M	applied early this morning and still smells great several hours_later !
M	it came neatly_packaged in a carton ( as if id bought a product from the shop ).
M	delivery was quick and cost £ 0 . 00 ( free for orders over £_00 . 00 ), ok it ' s not free but it still works out cheaper_than high_street shopping .
M	will be going back for more as have lots to choose from and it cost a fraction of the price .
M	got my iphone_0s locked to orange uk unlocked within_00hrs .
M	professional guys and awesome service delievered !!!!
M	:) 000_% recommended !

M	emma did a great job in clarifying the restricted items and checking through the details with her manager .

M	dell
M	just finished my first order .
M	super easy site and prices were the lowest .
M	can ' t wait to try the product and order more !
M	supplement_warehouse is hands_down the best way to purchase supplements .
M	their prices are always the best and even after shipping they crush competition prices .
M	they generally have everything delivered in less_than a week .
M	plus you get free_stuff with every purchase !
M	my iphone_0gs was locked to at & t , officialiphoneunlock . co . uk got it unlocked within a day !
M	it was a great purchase and job well_done by digitalrev , excellent in all departments from the point i placed the order , to the point i received my purchase .
M	would like to make another purchase and that ' s from you definitely .
M	excellent ....
M	excellent price , good service .
M	i am a sceptic norwegian , and was a little_worried_about buyin from this side , as i am whith all my online purchases .
M	howeever , i have never_experienced better , faster or cheaper online store .
M	after i bought my key ( and saved like $_00 ) i got acsess to my cdkey photo and it was genuine .
M	real key from a box , not a generator .
M	and it all took about 00 seconds .
M	i have found my online store , and am going to buy my games from this site !
M	thank_you !
M	our halloween party was an_absolute hit and everyone loved the decorations !
M	wouldn ' t hesitate in using joker ' s masquerade again when we have our next party .
M	the products were great and the delivery was super_quick .
M	thanks !
M	just had 0 new tyres_fitted and i cannot recommend etyres highly_enough .
M	i got 0 goodyears that are just about the highest rated tyre you can get for economy and grip and i paid as much as some garages charge you for the budget option .
M	they came to my house , fitted them on the drive and the customer_service was spot on .
M	money well spent .
M	i would strongly_recommend buying from cjs as it is simple to buy a product and fast ( normally instantly ) to receive your key .
M	also this comes at a much cheaper price and good customer support , something bigger companies need to learn about these days !
M	0_stars cjs !
M	i had issues logging_into my account and was pretty_much getting annoyed , until amy came along !
M	thanks so much for you patience .
M	friendly welcoming staff , not the usual garage miserable gits you get on a front_desk .
M	did the job well with no_messing_about and no crap .
M	thoroughly_recommend !
M	in fact , i already have !
M	whatever i am looking for , i can usually find it or an_alternative at ebuyer .
M	with great choices at great prices , i try not to shop anywhere_else for both domestic and business purchases .
M	even on cheap saver delivery selection i usually get my items the next_day !
M	i just haven ' t found better anywhere_else !
M	great work ebuyer , keep it up .
M	easy to navigate and easy to install .
M	cons_: installation seemed to take forever but it got there in the end . never had issues with free directions map and they ' ve been my go - to for directions for quite some time now .
M	this site is the best comparison site i have used in a very long time .
M	when i first went_onto the site it was extremely easy to use and you had thousands of rooms to compare in a matter of seconds .
M	booking the room was flexible aswell and i would reccomend to absolutely anyone who_wants something which is cheap easy to use and flexible .
M	fantastic !!!!!
M	no concerns at all .
M	this site is absolutely fantastic .
M	would reccomend to absolutely anyone .
M	used it many many_times which is unusual for me as i am not even that frequent of an internet user .
M	would use this service any day of the week and if your pocket is tight i would definetely use this service to help yourself !!!
M	!
M	i would reccomend this company anytime to get a great deal on the internet . hardly any sites like this which compare destinations and hotels as good as this .
M	if your departing on a holiday in the next 0 weeks i would definetely reccomend this service
M	as always my protein was great on price and product , however false statements on product descriptions and refusal to refund 0 products i ordered and did not need as a result of their mistake , let them down completely and i was left very frustrated .
M	they really didn ' t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
M	also beware of their points system , it ' s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c ' s but a warning would have been nice ...) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can ' t edit an order after paying .
M	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
M	very annoying company but great products and price .
M	no_hidden_fees and a very easy interface .
M	loved it !
M	will be using it more often .
M	i never usually_write_reviews but i feel i need to as i am so happy with the service i recieved and the watch i purchased .
M	i had been serching for the tw steel watch for awhile now and found it on this site .
M	i had never spent so much over the internet without seeing the item first so was very nervous_about purchasing from the site .
M	i called first and spoke to a guy called keiron , all my worrys went out the window , he said that its completely safe and that they were a reputable company and i would recieve the watch the next_day and if i wasnt happy i could have a refund with no_fuss .
M	i ordered the watch and like he said it arrived the next_day ..... and ..... wow what a stunning watch and well_packed , im extremely happy with the services and most of all the watch .
M	many_thanks watchfinder for a professional experience and an amazing watch , i will be sure to save you in my favourites .
M	i needed a flighcase for my laptop very urgent , i found them on google the case was it very good price , and the sales_person was very helpful to me , the case was orded on a friday and it turned_up saturday_morning , the laptop fits in the case very snugg and it doesn ' t move around while in side , the case is of very good quality very strong , well made and it will last years to come on the road , i need many cases for the future and i will be returning to get more soon !
M	thanks guys !
M	james ( jay audio )
M	found the cosutme i wanted , and they were the cheapest online .
M	it arrived in 0 - 0 days , despite using the slowest free delivery option .
M	item was in perfect_condition , brand_new etc .
M	i would definitely use them again ( maybe even if they weren ' t the cheapest ).
M	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
M	cant_fault the company .
M	reliable fast service .
M	good pricing .
M	after a month of hassle from myprotein , i had to look else where for my supplements .
M	i had heard of bulkpowders but hadn ' t known any one that had used them .
M	the company reminded me of myprotein of old .
M	first order placed , website was easy to use , received my order on time , and prices very good .
M	still don ' t know my way around the products but i have no_complaints about the protein blend .
M	after being offered 00_%_off to regain my custom , i decided to make an order .
M	now i remember why i stopped using this company .
M	i ordered on the 0th_november with 0 day delivery , on the 0th i received an_email_saying that my order would be a few_days late .
M	a week_later i sent and email asking when it might be with me , well 0 emails later and no human response , i have a look on facebook and see ' i ' m not the only one .
M	after numerous failed attempts at contact via phone and email , i finally get promised a refund , that didn ' t happen until the intervention of paypay on the 0th_december .
M	i had my reservation about sending off a phone with the promise of money ( good money ) being paid to me , i needn ' t have worried .
M	the whole proses was easy and efficient , less_than 00hours from looking at the website to receiving funds .
M	one piece of advice though , post the phone special delivery , it will cost £ 0 . 00 but in my opinion worth is .
M	i had a friend send his standard royal_mail and it got lost in the post , and was left out of pocket .
M	special delivery is insured for up to £_000 and guaranteed next_day with a receipt .
M	brought a lot of scuba gear recently , equipment information was vast , prices were very competitive , and the service was fantastic .
M	would definitely_recommend !
M	will_definately use feedem again !
M	i too ordered my bean_bags in november_0000 off groupon with the small_print of ' please allow up to 0 weeks delivery ' it is now mon 00 february_0000 and i still_haven ' t recieved any of them .
M	after months of frustrating phone_calls and emails , to which i had no reply , the only correspondance i have had is off groupon .
M	this company is an embarrassment .
M	they have taken the money out of my account , including the £_00 . 00 for delivery ( of what ?
M	you might ask ).
M	i have written numerous_emails asking for them to at_least pay me the delivery charge back as they have been so useless .
M	yet up to this date i have not received anything , not even a reply back off them .
M	what a proffessional company !!
M	!
M	bike sure is a trading broker associated to adrain flux .
M	i recently had the mis_- fortune of dealing_with this company .
M	all i can describe them is that they are a bunch of thugs .
M	basically i tried to insure my trike and having had a quote which was £_000 quid more over the telephone .
M	i decided to go with a quote online which was way cheaper .
M	as soon as i was about to pay they immediately found out that i had already had a quote over the phone and were unwilling to honour the online quote even after being given quote online .
M	they operate on very dodgy grounds and seem to think that if you get into a contract with them online then it is acceptable to withdraw that contract at anytime if they find that the premium was too low .
M	however if you had done the same as a customer they would charge you hefty cancellation_fees etc .
M	in my view this company operates on dodgy grounds and adrian flux which is the parent company are aware of the policies and practices .
M	in my view i would stay well away from bike sure and adrian flux who i have had a bad_experience with .
M	i have reported this company to the ombudsman and fsa .
M	i used e_- outdoors for the first time , items were in stock !
M	. order confirmed , despatched and arrived within a few_days . brilliant , many_thanks .
M	i ' ve bought from gak a few_times and every experience has been positive .
M	i will be buying again .
M	very quick despatch , easy buying process .
M	how it should be !
M	come on itv a big company like you , and you online player doesnt even work i have super_fast internet and your player keeps hanging whats up with that
M	sort it out
M	great customer_service sales_team is very helpful and have many top products on offer , prices are a bit higher but you poy for what you get top_class service
M	everyone_knows gooles is just the best i what ever it does
M	easy to use website very informed order status and updates items arrive in good time and great customer support if you do have any troubles a ++++++
M	the best company to order from if your based in the uk they are by_far the best when it comes to delivery speed everytime i have ordered my item has arrived next_day you cant get better_than that , very helpful sales_team who are happy to help with any_questions you may have , all in all a top website 0 +++++
M	wan to get a cheap price and awesome services ?
M	come and get it on cjs - cdkeys . com !!!
M	!
M	yeah !!
M	!
M	bought bosch top of range washing_machine .
M	also paid for delivery , fit and remove old machine .
M	they arrived , said they don ' t disconnect existing machines , that ' s up to the customer , and left the new machine in the middle the kitchen floor .
M	they said ring this number and we ' ll come back once your old machines disconnected .
M	we rang and they have so far failed to turn three times in three days .
M	some useless person who claimed to be customer_service called tony lowbridge responded to an_email from me asking for help .
M	he promised to come back to me and did nothing .
M	after being let_down three days in a row , i have arranged to take the old machine to the kettering branch of currys where i was sold the bosch and service package .
M	i plan to place the old scrapper in the middle of their store and tell the manager what dreadful service they give .
M	looking_forward to revenge on saturday_morning ..
M	never buy white good from currys .
M	absolutely_appalling company .
M	pay a little extra and go to a reliable supplier like john_lewis .
M	i ' m about to send the email correspondence with this tony lowbridge to dixons group plc ceo sebastian james ... if he doesn ' t already know , he needs to be told that his knowhow customer_service team is uncaring , ineffective and more interested in avoiding ownership of customer problems .
M	they just don ' t know how .
M	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
M	it said delivery in three working_days .
M	when i rang to chase it up i was informed that it was not kept in stock and the supplier was on holiday until the 0th_jan .
M	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
M	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
M	order was quick and easy .
M	best price i found .
M	delivered quickly .
M	can ' t ask for more .
M	ordered an item on day 0 , got notification via_email and text about status of order , and it arrived within 0 days .
M	very pleased .
M	if you dont use supplementwarehouse then fuck you
M	got a great price for my nokia mobile .
M	mazuma were extremely quick in paying me - was very impressed .
M	would use them again .
M	great website , they reply fast and they deliver for free and yet very fast .
M	i am always looking for places to buy my supplements and i came_across this store today and wow !!!
M	the inventory is great , not to mention the prices !!
M	almost 00_% cheaper then the big retail names and you can ' t beat the automatic 0 %_discount if you find the item cheaper on another website .
M	great store , i will_continue to come back to this store for my supplement_needs .
M	easy selection , great options , good prices , tone of freebies .
M	the only thing that could be better is the shipping prices .
M	great range , amazing service form start to finish and the end_result is stunning .

M	i needed an urgent diagnostic of our electric shower and boiler issue .
M	drew came over within a few hours , evaluated all my options and explained in layman ’_s terms what the problems were .
M	i can now make an informed_decision of what i want to do and when i ’ ve decided i ’ ll certainly use pimlico_plumbers for the work .
M	mid - level from a cost perspective however i ’ ve gone for the cheaper option in the past and its come back to haunt me .
M	thanks pimlico and thanks drew .
M	first time ordering from this site .
M	i saved_myself 000 $ instead of going somewhere_else to buy my supplements .
M	fairly cheap shipping , but really really cheap supplements .
M	dont waste your time looking for a cheaper site , listen to me and order from here !
M	i virtually always find books , games or whatever i am looking for at amazon .
M	needless to say , i buy here somewhat frequently .
M	the shipping is flexible and prices are decent .
M	i once didn ' t receive my order , and amazon swiftly sent a new item which arrived right away .
M	recommended !
M	despite the title , the customer_service people are polite and seem to be doing what they can .
M	still this doesn ' t change the appalling fact that both our order three years back , and now an order almost a year back were both massively delayed .
M	there has been lots of mails going back and forth , and the delivery date has been postponed over and over .
M	in the end we got our order , but only after nearly a year (!)
M	of waiting .
M	of course the customer_service offers vouchers you can use on your next purchase .
M	given these two depressing experiences , i consider the vouchers worthless as i will never ever deal with this company again .
M	stay_away from infurn !
M	you have been warned .
M	decided to use parcel0go and what an excellent service .
M	had a slight problem with the address and the customer_service rep william ... sorted it out double quick .
M	incredible next_day delivery and worked_perfectly
M	very happy , good delivery and the handles just what we hoped for
M	thank_you for an excellent speedy service
M	amazing communications & speedy service .
M	having signed_up for trustpilot for my website , i decided not to continue with the paid for service (£_000 per_month ).
M	all was running well and was getting some good reviews of our service , as would be expected as we offer a great product .
M	however , having received a couple of negative_reviews about our service ( which were totally untrue and looked as though they were written by a competitor ) i decided to try and comment on them as a company .
M	no such luck as trustpilot told me my username + password were incorrect .
M	i thought i must have forgotten my password , but it turns_out the email address i signed_up with wasn ' t recognised .
M	after about a week of contacting trustpilot support and trying to convince them that i own the company that i own , finally they told me that the email address i signed_up with was " donotallowaccess @ xxxxx " - well obviously i would never have signed_up with such an_email address !!
M	now because this email address doesn ' t " go anywhere " , i can ' t use the " forgot password " link either .
M	clearly because i have refused to pay the £_000 per_month fee , they have prevented me access to the site , and i am now unable to defend my company against some blatantly untrue reviews .
M	be warned - if you don ' t pay trustpilot a ridiculous_amount of money , they were bar access to your company and leave you totally unable to defend yourself against false reviews .
M	this is nothing short of being a total scam .
M	had i have known this , i would never have signed_up with trust_pilot in the first place , i just wanted my customers the freedom to express themselves , turns_out it was the worst decision i ever made .
M	do not sign_up with trustpilot .
M	my handset was locked to orange uk which i bought 0nd_hand from ebay , i called up orange and they said they couldn ' t unlock it .
M	i contacted this company who unlocked it in 00_hours as they promised .
M	what more could i ask ?
M	i ordered the unlock online , and within 00_hours it was ready .
M	then all you have to do is plug the phone into itunes with a new sim_card in , and it unlocks !
M	laughably simple .
M	definitely worth doing , now i can use my phone in new_zealand and then swap the sim back to the old one when i go home .
M	highly_recommended
M	bought a game late one night and 0 days_later it was at my door .
M	can ' t get much_better_than that !
M	highly_recommended .
M	great service and very good customer care .
M	keep it up
M	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
M	quality of product was exceptional at the price paid had bought and returned furniture from other_places because of shoddy workmanship at the same price and more really pleased
M	i used hostelbookers a lot when i was travelling a few_years_ago .
M	today was the first time since then .
M	the website is really well_designed and allows for a quick and easy way to find hostels and book them .
M	as i expect most people do i also checked the hostels own website , and another well_known hostel booking website .
M	hostelbookers was cheaper_than both .
M	especially the other website , and there was no booking_fee !
M	perfect !
M	this website carries great brands at great prices !
M	he site is very easy to use and it is quick and simple to find your product here .
M	im definitely coming_back
M	great service , for the best price by a mile .
M	every question i asked was met with a good answer , the people i spoke too were polite and enthusiastic which seems to have disappeared from a lot of places but is as important as anything_else in my opinion .
M	great shop .
M	cant_complain at all
M	i have ordered a few items from shopto now and have always been impressed with their cheap prices and fast delivery .
M	every item i have ordered has turned_up the next working day .
M	highly_recommended
M	i tried to review another company and was unable to do so last_week .
M	i spoke to a member of staff who advised that after a week of waiting i should have been contacted .
M	i was advised to leave a review as this would be a quicker process then an internal email .
M	i was advised on the sales call to me that the reason that i could not place a review was due to an influx of people reviewing .
M	doesn ' t fill me with confidence from the start until now of this process .
M	the ultimate betting site .
M	i use this site every day i like the banner .
M	hope i win today
M	what an amazing company !
M	shipping is so fast and the despatch time is very quick .
M	ive switched all my pre orders to simply_games due to the fantastic service and price !
M	!
M	well_done guys !

M	paris 0000 august .
M	we went to paris for our_honeymoon , the city is amazing .
M	the transfer from the airport to the hotel was fine , driver did not speak_english but we were taking in the atmosphere so did ' nt mind .
M	the return transfer was the problem .
M	i called to reconfirm our transfer 00_hours before and followed all the steps that were set out to us .
M	the driver was to arrive at 0 . 00 am .
M	0 . 00 am and no driver , i called the resorthoppa emergency number and was told our driver was on his way .
M	our flight was at 0 . 00am .
M	00_mins later and our hotel recieved a call from our driver to say ' i ' ve had a problem with my car , i ' m not coming , sorry '.
M	at this point we were panicking as we had little to no money ( paris is expensive ) and were told a taxi would cost around 00 euro ' s .
M	luckily our hotel receptionist managed to get us a taxi down to 00 euro ' s .
M	i called the resorthoppa emergency number time and time again at this point and the phone would put us on hold and then hang_up everytime !
M	after a long run to the cash point ( i literally sprinted ) i luckily had 00 euro ' s in the bank and ran back to the hotel .
M	we managed to get our flight on time but not without the upset and stress with resorthoppa .
M	especially to finish off our_honeymoon !
M	to top it off due to the rush i forgot to get a reciept from the taxi so will not be refunded for the inconvenience .
M	as the return transfer was pre paid i will be claiming for that back .
M	do not use resorthoppa in paris for a return transfer .
M	once you have arrived at your hotel they will not be interested in getting you home again .
M	disgusting .
M	i usually buy my games from tesco ( staff discount ), gameseek were the cheapest place to buy infamous , and then to make things even better , the game arrived the day before_release !
M	ive made quite a few orders over the years , not a single order has had a problem .
M	delivery is always earlier_than_expected .
M	ive used a few other suppliment sites , but still come back to mp , their price and service cant be_beaten online .
M	i made an order with blueunplugged on boxing_day .
M	when i ordered , they had one item listed as out of stock , due in 0 - 0 days .
M	i knew it would be a little delayed being the christmas_period , and the 0 - 0 days weren ' t a problem .
M	as of yesterday , it still says on the site , due in 0 - 0 days , and my order still " not shipped ", 00 days after my order , its still telling people 0 - 0 days !
M	i emailed them twice , at two different emails they have listed , and didn ' t get a reply , i then had to phone them and demand a refund as they could not provide the goods .
M	today , a day after phoning and getting a refund , i get an_email from them saying they thought this had been dealt_with yesterday .
M	they obviously don ' t check dates of emails sent .
M	this was my first order with blueunplugged , and it will_definitely be my last !
M	the only reason i ordered from them was because they were a little_bit cheaper_than everywhere_else .
M	after i got the refund yesterday i made an order with mobilefun , dispatched within 00_minutes , delivered in less_than 00 , and only £ 0 more_expensive than blueunplugged .
M	lesson_learnt .
M	i was looking for a way to get me goods from one side of the country to the other .
M	stumbling across shiply helped_me get my goods at a really cheap price .
M	i would use them again for any collections i need .
M	after searching many sites i found that skyparksecure offered the best prices for airport_parking , and even_though i had to change my booking 0 times the service was fantastic .
M	wouldnt_hesitate to book with them again .
M	i bought a pair of bench glasses , at a bargain price .
M	buying glasses online is something i had been unsure of doing , but 00 / 00 for speckyfoureyes .
M	the measurements and picture were spot on and the glasses arrived very quickly in the post .
M	i can ' t think of any negatives , and will never again be paying over_inflated prices for glasses in the high_street , i ' ll be using speckyfoureyes again , have already ordered my partner a pair !
M	didn ' t even have to enter a different price because they were already the lowest .
M	awseome buy 0 get one free sale on the creatine i love which i cant find at any local_stores .
M	also got a bunch of free and dicounted stuff with my order which greatly off set the shipping .
M	deffinetly will be a repeat customer !
M	i have made a couple of orders now , both of which were at the cheapest price on the web .
M	the items were dispatched the very same day , and the communication from the company is excellent , firstly with a delivery estimate day , then later with an_hour_slot so there ' s no waiting in all day or coming home to find the annoying card telling you your item is in a warehouse open between 00 and 00am !
M	after a couple of orders i have even been sent a discount_code for my next order .
M	overall , based on my experience i could not recommend this company enough , impeccable service and no hassle !
M	i always order all my stuff off this website never had a problem or issue they are the cheapest and they have great products .. i always recevie my items fast !
M	item has been " pending " since i bought it on the 00th of december .
M	according to their delivery schedule it should have arrived on the 00st but did not .
M	great weekend .
M	all organisation taken care of .
M	great value
M	best price on the net and delivered next_day ( saturday ) superb !
M	you get top_notch products for rock low_prices and a ton of extra merchandise for using the website that is good customer_satisfaction .
M	my order was delivered within days , i saved a ton of money on everything , and free_stuff to go with it !
M	what more could you need !
M	?
M	easy and straightforward , excellent service .
M	thanks !
M	my package was just delivered by a cycle courier who was very professional .
M	this is my only experience with apc , and i am most impressed .
M	thank_you very much .
M	i spoke to someone in the office called steve and he was extremely rude and unhelpful .
M	do not recommend !
M	i get stuff nearly every week from amazon .
M	i love the site !
M	always arrives on time and only ever had one thing i had to return because it was damaged , however to be fair it was easily breakable .
M	i received a refund straight_away .
M	love argos , cheap good , great service !
M	as i have been buying products for years from other_sites , i have found the one i will be sticking with .
M	the prices are great and the selection is huge .
M	if you are looking for either or both of those , this is the place to shop .
M	thanks
M	sent my watch for some rather needed tlc after 0 years , for full service and polish .
M	communication from watchfinder was excellent with very prompt_replies to questions and updates .
M	would definitely_recommend to all !
M	received watch back and stunned at the condition , i didn ' t expect it to look as new !
M	will certainly be using again in the future !

M	i recently had my ford focus serviced at stoneacre thirsk which i had no_problems with at all , the receptionist was very polite and professional they even came and picked the car up and dropped it back off .
M	i carnt comment on any other stoneacre as ive only dealt_with thirsk .
M	they rang before commencing any additional work and explained everything as im not good with cars .
M	hope this helps .
M	today , 00 : 00 : 00 – flag – like – reply – delete – edit – moderate
M	incredible customer_service .
M	they rang me twice ; once when my order was shipped to glasgow instead of nottingham , ( not their fault at all , yet the courtesy to ring is amazing ), and once when my order had been delivered .
M	will be using again for sure .
M	> clean and simple
M	> easy to use
M	> search_results are more specific , and usually find what i am searching for immediately .
M	which is not always the case with other search_engines .
M	secure and easy to use .
M	never had any_issues in the years since i have been using paypal .
M	one of the best payment solutions around .
M	delivery was super_fast , and the description was exact .
M	i would reccomend to do business with !
M	the first things that might strike you about winner . com , and its casino page in particular , are the bonuses and they are top quality bonuses .
M	usual procedure applies but my luck seemed in with this site as i actually managed to accumulate some substantial winnings from the bonus which was a surprise given my luck with other casino sites !
M	there are a truly extensive_range of top quality games on here .
M	they do bingo and poker superbly and any fans of those games will have a lot of fun on this support with great support , a live casino version of a number of games and the bonuses i mentioned .
M	i ’ ve been reliably informed that the poker is particularly good by other friends who play it more frequently than i !
M	as far as gaming sites go casino ’_s always seem to be more accessible and friendly .
M	you won ’ t find much_better customer_service and the layout of the site is so user_friendly that anyone can get involved and have fun doing so .
M	i play for the slots and have found the absolute best games from all my other favourite sites here in one location with good graphics , smooth gameplay , quick transactions and decent payouts .
M	overall i ’ d say winner . com is in my top 0 online casino sites and gets a definite thumbs_up from me .
M	absolutely spot on .
M	seamless service and presentation , smooth operations and an easy to navigate process .
M	would reccomend again and again , never once had a problem that was the fault of just_eat .
M	found a corner of the market and blew it up .
M	kudos .
M	i booked a pair of return tickets to houston with opodo for 0 weeks time .
M	everything seemed fine .
M	money was debited from my account like normal and didn ' t think anything of it .
M	received booking confirmation , everything seemed completely normal .
M	around four days_later , the money came back into my account which i thought was strange , so i decided to do a little research .
M	to my horror , i found hundreds of bad_reviews .
M	one after the other .
M	i immediately pulled all my money from my bank_account .
M	i used the money that they didn ' t take to book direct with the airline for £_00 more .
M	today - 0 days_later .
M	they have decided to take the money , leaving me overdrawn as i am a student .
M	ive tried for days to ring them .
M	and like many , many others .
M	nothing but stupid music on the phone .
M	the whole ' my opodo " thing doesn ' t work , it claims to not even recognise my email address .
M	luckily my bank have been most helpful and have sent me a fraud form to fill in , they will re - credit my account for me , and take on the fight with opodo by my side .
M	dont be_fooled by such a bad company .
M	i wish i read reviews first !
M	lesson_learnt .
M	it ' s always better paying that tiny_bit extra and going direct with the airline .
M	supplement_warehouse gives out lots of free_samples and has great prices overall .
M	i think the layout of the website could still be improved to rival the user_friendly_interface of bodybuilding . com , but due to the affordability , and exposure to smaller brands who need the support of new buyers i love coming_back to this website .
M	just used supplement_warehouse for the first time and love it .
M	was recomended by a friend and i ' m very impressed .
M	prices were great and all_kinds of deals !
M	will_definitely be my first choice from now on .
M	i bought a copa del rey final ticket 0 months before the event .
M	i was supposed to get it mailed and they told me they had a problem but they will find me a ticket .
M	i fly to madrid from la book an over price hotel because of the event and they cancel my ticket 0 hours before kick off tell me this not depressing .
M	to be outside of a stadium and not be able to go in .
M	that was so easy and qiuck and free to unlock your carrier .
M	i gotta say for a once in a lifetime stag_party , chillisauce made it extra special .
M	from day one with the price to the excellent organiser we were treated to a greay experiance in newcastle .
M	hotel was great , karting and painballing awesome and casino was out of this world !!
M	!
M	treated well by everyone and everything just exceeded expectation .
M	you gotta get to newcastle and experiance the thrill of the karting and the friendly warm welcome the george hotel welcomes you with !!
M	!
M	thanks chillisauce !!
M	!
M	my first order took a couple of days to arrive .
M	when it arrived it was completely the wrong product ( the box had already been opened ).
M	i retunred this and i was sent the correct product .
M	this had been sealed but appeared to have been opened previously .
M	i set the product up and it turned_out to be faulty .
M	thoroughly annoyed by the whole experience .
M	most companies only sell name brand products . supplement_warehouse allows you to try different products that actually produce results .
M	i ' ve been using them since i deploy to afghanistan and never had any complaints .
M	awesome awesome company
M	i was connected within a minute .
M	my issue was that i had ordered a duplicate parcel , and needed to cancel one .
M	the service i received ( from sammie_taylor ) was very quick and polite .
M	very impressed with the whole service ... prices are excellent , delivery is really fast and the sales_team are quick and helpful with any_queries you may have .
M	0 star company , i will be using them for all my stationary needs from now
M	very nice handling of the client , constant feedbacking of the order , fast_shipping .
M	ordered at 00am the flowers were delivered by midday - fantastic !
M	delivered with great quality and on time :)
M	we have ordered underfloor_heating from this company for many years now .
M	they have always provided excellent service , quality goods and fast delivery .
M	using iphone and 0 g to write his as day six of no phone service or internet without any reason from talk_talk - called numerous_times and nothing but prescripted responses - appalling service .
M	just a quick note of caution when booking - dont make any errors as you cannot change these .
M	clicked on wrong date and was made to pay full_amount for the reservation .
M	didnt want to cancel just put in correct date !
M	very inflexible system and more_than useless customer support .
M	needless to say i wont be using late rooms again
M	i called them after seeing an advert on tv , you found their service to be really good .
M	they were helpful and managed to get you compensation .
M	i ' ve used amazon for buying many things that i find necessary .
M	never had any_problems with receiving my goods .
M	definitely a good shopping_experience and recommended to other_users .
M	the guy i dealt_with was exceptionally knowledgeable about the destination i was looking at and even highlighted points of interest from his own trip there – a real personal_touch !
M	customer_service was flawless and he deal with my 0000 questions patiently and effectively .
M	i will_definitely be booking through you guys again !
M	thanks !
M	excellent customer_service .
M	the product arrived very fast , on time and in perfect_condition , there prices are fantastic , i have not found a better service anywhere , i have and will recommend them to everyone i know who_likes quality goods and service .
M	highly recommed .
M	found this company through google by chance after being appalled at the prices on the high_st . bought a pair of ray_ban fames and got friendly instant advice over the phone from dragon_specs regarding the lenses i needed .
M	they did not instantly advise the most expensive which was refreshing !
M	!
M	vision_express wanted £_000 for the same frame with anti glare lenses .
M	dragon_specs sold the same frames with better lenses for £_00 .
M	saving £_000 .
M	arrived in 00 days .
M	absolutely awesome .
M	would use again , a colleague has already ordered from them and my father is getting his next pair from dragon_specs also .
M	you cannot go_wrong with this company .
M	five well_deserved stars !!!!
M	!
M	horror who is fault .
M	i breakdown back in september call the rac .
M	patrol arrived asked me what is the problem after that checking the car identify is my alternator cable loose .
M	he explain that he can fixed no time . after 0 weeks breakdown again call the rac patrol arrived check the battery and told me i need new battery , i explain to him i had same issue 0 weeks_ago and first patrol told me loose connection he was certain it was the battery i did want to purchase battery he did not have the right one .
M	i bought new battery from eurocar parts same is what the rac is using .
M	i had a another breakdown in april call the rac they told me possible alternator he say i need to go garage to get it sorted .
M	i choose a garage .
M	when the garage diagnose the problem guess_what ?
M	my alternator is burned and the cable due loose connection overload .
M	contact the rac customer care they asked diagnose from garage , battery invoice .
M	i got all the information with in few_days .
M	i received an_email requesting those information week after i send them .
M	i called customer care executive and told him they got those information over a week after find the emails blame the admin .
M	any way who is fault mine or rac ?
M	they not taking any responsibility they believe they diagnose correct even first patrol put on the report battery good .
M	by the way i forget the mention alternator was only 00 months old .
M	you make your own judgment .
M	once my contract is finish i am out from this company and will not be back been a member 0 years which means nothing for them .
M	i order an item on saturday and delivery is on is way monday .
M	i asked question on sunday regarding to pruduct and answered monday_morning 0 :_00am .
M	i believe very efficient at the moment no issues at all .
M	would i make a purchase from this company ?
M	answer is definitely .
M	thanks again for quick response and delivery .
M	great vendor with an added personal_touch
M	great prices , great support and great products .
M	would definitely use again !
M	used this company many of times never had a problem with them 0 star_rating all day long
M	without any doubt , i recommend this to everyone out there
M	i ordered numerous items at 00pm .
M	i received an_email by 0pm to say it had been sent then received it the next_day all correct and packaged great .
M	nice little touch with the surprise after opening the box .
M	i will be ordering again from them soon to complete the great beginners shaving set they put_together .
M	i could not of possible received the item any faster .
M	i received it in perfect_condition and at a great price .
M	i will use them as my first_port of call for my technology needs .
M	keep up the great work guys !
M	i decided to order from you after_reading about your history and customer orientation .
M	my order was correct and came quickly .
M	the descriptions of the products was accurate and i am already planning on making a second purchase in the near_future .
M	the only improvement i can think of is to allow payments with paypal .
M	if all goes well speckyfoureyes may be fine , but you ' re in trouble if you complain or want a refund .
M	ordered frames and lenses from them , but found order status_updates to be inconsistent .
M	the lenses also took well over the supposed 0 - 00 days .
M	so , when i got my glasses and found a mark on the frames i returned them requesting a refund rather_than a replacement .
M	four weeks after speckyfoureyes had received my returned glasses a replacement pair was delivered to me .
M	in the intervening weeks i ' d sent a number of e_- mails to speckyfoureyes asking about the status of my refund .
M	most went_unanswered , some got a reply promising to looking into the matter .
M	i was never told a replacement pair was being sent .
M	since then i ' ve tried numerous e_- mails and phone_calls to ask why my refund request was ignored .
M	mostly i ' ve been ignored again , although i was offered a 00_%_off code in compensation for the original faulty frames - absolutely_useless and misses the point of my complaint entirely .
M	i have never_experienced such poor customer_service before .
M	that says it all really .
M	the original sign arrived in a damaged condition .
M	after contacting them they immediately organised a replacement which has just arrived in perfect_condition .
M	thanks .
M	living in the highlands always means waiting extra days for deliveries .
M	but i ordered my netbook and recieved it in less_than 00_hours !
M	product and service has been faultless .
M	will order from gogodigital again
M	i made an order for 0gb of ddr0 for my dell dimension 0000 to be delivered to my girlfriends address ( different from card_holder address ).
M	they phoned up later on in the day to check if it was myself that placed the order for security reasons .
M	very friendly chap on the phone and incredibly fast delivery for christmas time .
M	thank_you mrmemory i will be buying all my ram from you guys in the future
M	very impressed with the service from cjs_cd_keys .
M	got a bargain on xbox_live gold_membership and received the code instantly .
M	will be using them again in future .
M	for several years i started mak bookin online .
M	i have used other_sites before , but since i found out hostelbookers . com i realized that this site is the best .
M	the reservation is easy and fast , i have no_problems then .
M	definitely a site to trust without_hesitation !
M	i don ' t write_reviews very often but just felt i had to on this occasion .
M	i have only been using tpw for a couple of weeks now but have already put in two orders in that time .
M	in my first order i picked_up 0 sample protein bottles all different flavours and a 000g bag of whey .
M	one week_later i was ordering more with one problem i loved all 0 flavours , l have tried many brands over the years and its easy to get board with the bland flavour , but tpw is different , gr0 tast , verry easy to mix , and extremely fast delivery .
M	i will be recommending them to friend s and family and will be a happy returning customer .
M	cheers michael bianco
M	i am fascinated by the great help they have been in getting an_appointment and processing my marriage visa application .
M	i have been impressed at the speed they work at and mr_tanwar was a fabulous solicitor and he knew every_aspect of the application so everything went well with ease and had felt_comfortable in working with them .
M	had a wonderful experience with them and their company .
M	hope to see them soon and best of luck for their future .
M	this is the best site for supplements , they have what i need in stock .
M	i also love the price_match that is amazing .
M	recommend to friends and family .
M	checked out on paypal and received my key swiftly via_autokey .
M	would recommend
M	un sitio con una interfaz amigable , forma de pago eficiente y una gran cantidad de lugares por elegir ..... que mas se puede pedir ?
M	glasses are a fraction of the cost of high_street retailers , would recommend this company to anyone_looking to buy glasses online .
M	fast delivery at xmas time , for an office quality ups .
M	no doubt is one of the best and cheapest places to get brand name high_quality supplements .
M	i ' ve ordered many_times from supplement_warehouse and have never been disappointed .
M	after recently going on a fishing holiday and falling in , i desperately_needed to get my iphone fixed that was in my pocket when i got wet !
M	i went on my repair_centre and booked my iphone in for a repair adding the message of it being an urgent matter .
M	to my disbelief , i received the phone back 0 days after i posted it , fixed and fully working !
M	i was astonished at the turn_around time and even more happy with the customer_service i received when i called them the day after posting it .
M	a big_thumbs_up to this company , much more efficient and friendly than others i have dealt_with in the past .
M	cheers ,
M	ethan p
M	stumbled_across cjs_cd_keys by_accident when the code site i normally use was out of stock and i was very happy that i did .
M	account took a minute or so to set_up and the text verification helps to put your mind at ease , plus the code was delivered within about 00 seconds of verification .
M	i was so happy with the service i recommended cjs to a friend the same day .
M	as an untrusting , paranoid cynic , i ' d read reviews and looked at the small_print .
M	other_websites quoted various percentage deductions based on the phones condition .
M	mine was in reasonable condition , but had its fair_share of scratches .
M	mazuma_mobile was straight_forward , honest with price and fast with the payment .
M	faultless .
M	this is literally the best i was a skeptic thinking this is not true i searched for my products far and wide .
M	found this baby out and will never trust other stores anymore .
M	this is a must and must recommend to all my friends cause this is it the one i ' ve been searching for supplement_ware house oh how i love you .
M	very good service and for a reasonable_price .
M	better_than sending to apple for a repair and much_better_than having insurance .
M	the prices are the best - even cheaper_than amazon !
M	very pleased with the service provided - the key came through in minutes and i was playing the game soon after .
M	definitely recommended !
M	have had my eyes set on a pair of ray_bans for a while now .
M	the price on sunglasses_shop was a lot lower_than the high_street , so it made sense to go online .
M	i placed the order at 00 : 00 on a monday and the ups man rang my bell at 00 : 00 on tuesday - this is what i call service !
M	i posted my phone on saturday_afternoon and got the money for it on monday_morning .
M	they also offered the highest amount for it , so couldn ' t have chosen a better company !
M	i ' ve been buying contact_lenses from feel good contact_lenses for a number of years now and have always had excellent service .
M	i wish all internet shops were like them !
M	ordered flowers online from iflorist nothing showed up , they offered another redelivery and voucher but still dissapointed
M	typed in handset details and got an instant quote , bag came a couple of days_later - in it goes and bye_bye .
M	money in my account almost the next working day .
M	easy , reliable - able to track throughout .
M	do not use dpd !
M	dpd are hands_down , the most unreliable delivery company in the uk .
M	i have lost two days work waiting for deliveries that never arrived .
M	on their online parcel - tracker , it claims i ' refused ' the delivery and therefore the package has been returned to the sender .
M	this is obviously complete nonsense .
M	i have read similar reports all over the internet and find it baffling that so many retailers still use this terrible company for their deliveries .
M	avoid at all costs .

M	i didn ' t realize how far in_advance you had to book a hostel or hotel room in germany .
M	i thought for sure that 0 weeks was enough .
M	but i didn ' t have any luck until i stumbled_across hostelbookers and found a hostel that had 0 beds left so i snagged them .
M	it was quick and easy and i would recommend it to anyone .
M	this is quality and i love it .
M	quick , cheap and great product !
M	item arrived within 00_hours of order and i was kept_informed at all times .
M	that ' s basically what you want as a consumer .
M	great fresh flowers every time !
M	plus the delivery has never let me down after using these twice now !
M	would definately_recommend .
M	brightest light i have seen yet !
M	i now have this on my bars and mj - 000 on my helmet .
M	everyone can see me coming !
M	bought from these_guys received it within 00_hours .
M	brilliant
M	an easy - to - use system that involved no hassle .
M	good prices and good concept - would use again .
M	i looked through endless websites trying to find a cheap deal to france which was really stressful .
M	ferrysavers had all available fares in one place making the process a lot_easier .
M	i ended_up choosing myferrylink who i had never_heard of before , but the journey was good enough for me given the good price .
M	hello .
M	i used these before when buying my fifa_00 key however when it came to buying from them again via recommendation from my best friend i waited a total of 00_hrs .
M	i submitted a support ticket and also posted on their facebook after 0 hr of waiting .
M	i then looked at their latest orders and noticed loads of fifa00 keys being instantly delivered .
M	they were not sold out , so why did my key take nearly 0 whole days to arrive ?
M	i got a reply to my ticket some 00_hrs later simply saying , provide proof .
M	so i did i provided all my paypal info .
M	then a whole day later another reply which said " order approved ".
M	now i want to know were the hell is your customer_service skills ?
M	you say a total of 0 words in a 0 day period , not even an attempt at providing an excuse or genuine explanation as to what went wrong .
M	this is what happens when companies get trusted too much , they take liberties and their passion for customer_services goes down the tube !
M	i will never be using this company again !
M	gtxgaming has been easily the most helpful gsp i ’ ve ever had !
M	they truly are on the same page as the gamers , they tackle any_issues so fast and easily , these_guys at gtx are the real deal .
M	easily the one gsp that deserves to explode onto the scene , they are the hidden gem .
M	if you ’ re looking for a great gsp , look no furthur .
M	the site always has great deals and some more options once you get to your_cart .
M	always have handy things given out for free or for extremely cheap .
M	the competitor feature is also really nice , i ' ve saved several dollars here and there in a matter of seconds .
M	they missed the collection date , then when i rang up to find out why , they had no answers , by the looks of the tracking the order had not even gone_through to the courier .
M	all they could offer was to collect the item another 0 days_later , which was 0 days after i placed the order - even then could not guarantee it was going to be picked_up .
M	i asked for a refund and the phone operator took on an attitude .
M	total disgrace !
M	bought some armani glasses on 0 / 00 / 00 .
M	finally recieved an_email on the 00 / 00 / 00 saying they have been dispatched - from_hong_kong !
M	!
M	customs added £_00 in charges for my glasses to be released and delivered .
M	beware as they mention eu distribution centres and have a uk number , but no one answers the phone and after sales service is terrible .
M	after paying the customs_charges , the price worked out about the same as buying from a uk company - plus all the inconvenience and delay in getting my glasses .
M	i decided not to pay the charges and filed a dispute with paypal for a full_refund .
M	beware they do not state vat on their website when making an order , so they are covered if you complain .
M	this is our second website to be built by visualsoft , they have incredible sysyems in place to ensure everything runs like_clockwork including very competent staff who clearly have love and a passion for what they do .
M	i would recommend visualsoft for anyone_looking to break into the e_- commerce market or a complete overhaul of an existing website .
M	* edit to add ...* far too many 0 star / 0 review for this company .
M	trust_pilot should investigate .
M	if they spent as much time woking on their service as they do bombing social_media sites ,, they might have a good company .
M	also , either they ' re incredibly racist employers , or they do not give their staff the dignity to enable them to use their real name .
M	has anyone spoken with someone on live_chat that didn ' t have a biblical ' white ' name ?!
M	all hints at what a sneaky , deceitful company this really is .
M	following a number of bookings for supposed ' next_day ' service , with such a low collection rate ( from collections in central_london - hardly the outer hebrides !)
M	it is clear this company easily maintains it ' s ' low ' rates by simply only managing to complete x % of the collections .
M	it ' s clear when you phone to complain ( after realising that the obvious move of allocating your failed collection to the following days service isn ' t automatically done !)
M	they clearly know and expect such a regular occurrence to be part of their business .
M	their review %' s are disingenuous ( almost laughable ) and simply an example of the fraudulent practices of this company .
M	i shall be reporting them to trading_standards as they are deliberately overstating their abilities .
M	do not use !
M	absolute_joke of a company , there customer_service is none existant , rediculous live_chat system allows them to disconnect the chat whenever they dont like what you have to say .
M	i asked 0 times to actually speak to a manager and was told they could not give me their numbers out , so i asked for the email address of the md and i was told he did not have one .
M	asked for a refund .......... got no response , asked for tracking_details ........ no response .
M	i really do hate this company and i will be so glad when i read that they have gone to the wall .
M	surely not long away now
M	i made an error on my parcel and p0g ' s sarah_hayes helped_me very quickly , best service i have had from anybody at p0g so far , she is great :)
M	always a first_class service from klm .
M	i have used them over the last 00 years and they have always gone above and beyond .
M	last flight to sa had a disaster with the entertainment system on my monitor but the crew were attentive and done all they could do .
M	even_though the issue could not be fixed , the crew kept me entertained throughout the flight .
M	gives me the perfect chance to keep up to date with all my friends all over the world
M	will use again for any gadgets i need .
M	they were extremely_helpful when it came to helping me choose the telly i needed , and they packaged it up with the leads i needed .
M	very happy :)
M	thank_you mmoga have such a great online support .
M	the web_site is quality every thing are all prices i love this website .
M	i am new to this web and you devlives are top quality .
M	i rate this site 000 out of 000
M	my laptop was stolen from my flat .
M	i had insured it and my phone together a while ago .
M	advisor on the phone was sympathetic and useful .
M	overall im really happy with how it went , they replaced my laptop .
M	if i didnt have the insurance i wouldn ' t have been able to afford a new one on top of rent and bills so it really saved a huge headache .
M	everything went very smoothly and they were always there and in contact with me .
M	it does what it ' s supposed to do and does it well .
M	i ' m very pleased and will keep using them .
M	i found jack0d at a great price so i ordered from supplementwarehouse . com !
M	i needed a makita combi drill / impact driver set for work , so i used google_shopping to find the best price on the latest model available which was the dlx0000m .
M	needless to say i was directed to powertool world .
M	i ordered the set late one evening and it arrived within one working day , i cannot_fault the service that i have received so well_done to powertool world !!
M	!
M	came at 00 00 without notice
M	really pleased with my new dslr and lenses .
M	arrived really quickly , cheaper_than anywhere_else and whole_process has been professional and easy .
M	i will_definatley use them again .
M	months
M	up to 0 months
M	great cheap prices .
M	delivered instantly and cd_key worked great .
M	probably one of only a handful of safe steam cd_key sellers out there !
M	very quick in delivering the keys after ordering , cheap and very good service
M	when i found out about this website , prices seemed way too good to be true ; having been burned before ( screw you [_external reference ]), was a bit afraid to buy something ; after_reading all the sites and reviews of it , bought dark_souls 0 as pre order , and was not disappointed ; already received my key and the game is already pre loaded .
M	also bought some other games from them ; awesome site and very good customer support .
M	very good seller .
M	had some problems with some acessories i ordered , but were prontly resolved with contacting the seller .
M	will buy from them again
M	production_room is a great store full of awesome but competitively_priced gear .
M	the customer_service from their staff is second to none .
M	i always make the trip from doncaster to production_room ( leeds ) instead of seeking out audio_equipment locally .
M	00 / 00 will use every time .

M	e_- careers regularly offer " discounted " courses with a limited time remaining to purchase at the lower_price .
M	they do this to rush you into purchasing a course which appears to be good value without reading the small_print .
M	however at no point during the multiple_occasions i spoke to them on the phone was i informed that my mcsa server 0000 course did not include the exam ( therefore not being_able to get microsoft certified without having to pay hundreds of pounds extra for the actual exam ).
M	while i realise this is partially my fault for not asking , i have never undertaken an online course and would not expect an online course you pay hundreds of pounds for to have these hidden_costs .
M	upon requesting a refund i was refused because their terms and conditions state that once a course has been activated to an account , refunds are not available .
M	fair_enough , but why ?
M	no physical product has been dispatched to me that would be returned as b - stock that would be understandable .
M	but i do not see why a course cannot be cancelled and removed from an account .
M	their system clearly_states i have been logged in for no more_than 0 minutes , definitely not enough time to steal course material .
M	the bottom_line is i am out of work and now out of pocket with the last bit of money i was saving for a course to help me into employment .
M	if the exam was included as they make out all would be well but the fact is i cannot_afford the extra £_000 it will cost me to take the exam to get me back in to work .
M	i am not the first person to leave a negative_review of this company but it seems they respond faster to removing these reviews than they reply to your emails when you have an issue .
M	also a lot of these 0 star reviews look engineered .
M	so please read all small_print in respect to your course before using this company .
M	ensure that the course meets your exact purposes because gaining a refund after the 0 days after your purchase ( in accordance with the distance trading regulations ) is extremely unlikely .
M	i have used amazon . co . uk for many years now and i always find it is the cheapest place to buy things from .
M	there is a good range of delivery options and they have never been late before .
M	no products have never been shipped to me in a bad condition either .
M	i bought a bonfire volt jacket and the product i received has been in perfect_condition and is of good quality , pretty_much exactly as_described on the website .
M	i would recommend both the jacket and the seller .
M	bought a gaming_pc from here recently , i ordered it on monday and it got to me on thursday .
M	the pc was the cheapest i could find on the internet and the delivery was cheap and good .
M	the pc arrived in awesome packaging and nothing was damaged .
M	i set my pc up and there was a slight problem with the fan ( it was making a loud noise ) so i rang customer support and someone talked me through the process of fixing it and it is now fixed .
M	excellent service , i would recommend dinopc to anyone and will be definitely buying from here again .
M	amazing !
M	i heard of these_guys from a friend , and he said they ' d be the best .
M	he was not mistaken .
M	i have now dealt_with them for a long time and i love everything about them .
M	from the samples , to the fast_shipping - they will not let you down .
M	i ' m a customer for life !
M	ordered a new mic and stand and some cables and all got to my door working 00hrs and the shipping only cost me a fiver .
M	you can ' t ask for more .
M	plus it ' s the cheapest place i ' ve found for the akg d0 vocal mic ( which as far as i ' m concerned is gonna take over from the sm00 as the mic ) at £_00 it ' s over £_00 cheaper_than ne nearest rival and even ebay !!
M	i will and have recommended this company to others and will be using them for all my live sound needs from now on
M	i bought the amplifier at a great price , and although i found myself with a technical difficulty on arrival , that was due to my lack of inexperience .
M	hifi - tower emailed me back within a day or so and i was sorted !
M	0 / 0 for price / quality and speed of delivery !
M	dealing_with sammie is always so easy as she knows what shes doing and susses the problems out instantly very good service thank_you craig
M	i just wanted to say a big thank_you to aerial installation direct for their great service .
M	we recently decided that we wanted to upgrade from freeview tv to sky digital .
M	we were going to call sky themselves until a friend of ours told us about a family run business they had used in the past when they wanted a new digital aerial .
M	we called aerial installation direct and the guy on the phone was very friendly .
M	he asked which of the systems we wanted , we didn ' t even know there was such a choice .
M	he explained that the sky hd plus system would let us record and watch channels in hd and that ' s just what we wanted .
M	we arranged for someone to come and install the system and i was surprised that we didn ' t have to wait for weeks , just a couple of days on the installation date the guys were very friendly but professional , which put us at ease .
M	he asked us where we wanted the satellite dish installed .
M	we hadn ' t thought about this , we just assumed that he would put it where he wanted .
M	our neighbors have sky and they had to have their dishes on the front of their homes , which looks horrible .
M	we asked if we could have our dish at the back of the house and he said , no problem .
M	our satellite was installed very quickly on a pole and bracket , out of sight at the back , to the envy of our neighbours .
M	the guys from aerial installation direct installed the set top box in the living_room and then went out of their way to explain how the system worked after setting it up for us and testing it .
M	me and my husband are not really into technical things , we are both in our 00s , but we found it easy to use thanks to his explanations , which he went over more_than once .
M	if you are considering having a system installed i would recommend aerial installation direct to anyone .
M	as a small plumber ’_s business in bristol we didn ’ t think we needed a website , but i couldn ’ t have been more wrong !
M	we ’ ve only got a 0 page website , but it ’_s now giving us lots of enquiries and business !
M	if you think you don ’ t need a website then think again .
M	our customers are finding us on their mobile_phones and on their computers as well as the traditional methods .
M	really pleased and will_continue to use sean and his team !
M	i get my mattress next_day after order .
M	very pleased with good and service i received .
M	these are the gurus very very satisfied . they deliver
M	i found the person ( cormac ) i dealt_with very help , especially as i did not have a clue , as to what i was talking_about , having never purchased alloy wheel before , he also telephone back to make_sure that i have found the right size and fitment for my peugeot .

M	00 days to deliver tyres .
M	no word from customer_services unless i harassed them .
M	they had to order them in twice and then refused to deliver them any sooner_than 0 days_later .
M	i hate wasting my time , unhelpful customer_service !
M	i received my items within a day , exactly_what they said they were and i ' m overall extremely happy
M	ordered and turned_up in no time .
M	cannot not rate high .
M	happy to add my stamp of approval .
M	we love this site .
M	it ' s user - friendly with the exact reviews we hope to find in searching out hostels .
M	we appreciate the good and bad_reviews , ratings , the pictures and quick - read room descriptions .
M	comparing each hostel was so easy .
M	we quickly navigated the site with its awesome prompts and found the hostels that looked most attractive to our situation .
M	i really liked the simple , straightforward formatting of travel itinerary followed_by the variety of hostel options accompanied by short description blurbs , obvious pricing , pictures and availability .
M	overall , we ' re just grateful we searched with hostelbookers .
M	we ' re excited for our trip .
M	bon voyage to others too !
M	after waiting 0 months for delivery of my pc from another supplier pc_specialist were a breath of fresh_air .
M	good sales advice , excellent communication and a pc that is bang on spec .
M	well_done .
M	well i ordered gta comlete pack for steam that was supposed to be all the games released for pc , used the code and it was only gta iv and liberty city stories not what it said in the listing and now the listing has been corrected but still has the same picture , i have taken out 0 tickets one just got closed for no reason at all and the second was marked as solved after i asked them what i was to take a screenshot of , use this company at your own_risk !!!!!
M	!
M	i love this company and stand by them 000_%.
M	i have made many purchases and only once had an issue but the staff rectified it immediately
M	i have ordered many outdoor items from many different stores online before and have to say webtog is one of the top stores .
M	i ordered a jetboil 0 . 0ltr pan and the price was very very competitive .
M	may i also say i ordered this on wednesday_night 00 / 00 / 00 and it was delivered new years_eve ( even with postal delays !!)
M	delivery was free so you tend to think a week would be fair but 0 days is very swift .
M	the product was well_packaged and protected as well .
M	many_thanks to webtog
M	i ordered my watch a few_days before_christmas , it arrived earlier_than_expected in chamonix , france .
M	great service , i ' d use them again without hestitation .
M	ben mason .
M	there are many choices of quality baubles available at good prices .
M	purchased the silver and red 00mm packs of 00 .
M	comes well_packaged , would use again .
M	great prices and easy website to use .
M	would use again
M	this is without_doubt the worst provider i have ever had the displeasure of dealing_with , they are incompetent beyond imagination , so much of my time and money wasted on them , do not get lured by their bundle deals , the amount of time you will have to waste on them will not repay you of any minor savings you may make
M	good prices and good selection of supplements
M	i bought a defective tag_heuer carrera gmt caliber 0 automatic watch from swiss watch direct on october_0000 .
M	the reference_number of the watch is war0000 . fc0000 .
M	but there are two obvious blemishes under the glass .
M	and they admitted the blemishes .
M	so i required a full_refund because this is within 0 working_days and all the problems are caused by the seller .
M	but they donnot want to give me a full_refund , they asked me to afford a new strap which is used only seversl days .
M	they even let me afford 000_pounds but ascually the strap is only worth about 000_pounds .
M	after a dicker , they finally let me afford 000_pounds and keep the former strap in their shop .
M	by the way , i also paid 00 pouns for the return_postage .
M	because this is a defective watch and it is within 0 working_days , i think i should get a full_refund .
M	but they actually let me loss 000_pounds totally .
M	i cannot_believe this unreliable shop anymore .
M	now they list the return watch in stock with 0000 pounds within only one day after they received it .
M	i think maybe they are not going to replace the former strap .
M	so the seller just reduce 000_pounds and also keep a 00 . 00_% new strap ( worth 000_pounds ) and detain my 000_pounds .
M	so finally the seller earned extra 000_pounds from this return even the return is caused by the problems themselves .
M	everyone who_wants to buy expensive luxury watches from swiss watch direct should consider carsfully before you deciding to pay for them .
M	this is my sincerely advise after this painful experience from the swiss watch direct .
M	one star_rating is the highest rating i can give them as i really want to give them zero star_rating because of this very very painful experience !!!!!!!!!
M	!
M	the service of iconic_watches is very good and they are all very patient .
M	my experience of this purchase is excellent .
M	recommand it !
M	!
M	brought a ritchey wcs carbon one bolt seat post £_00 with postage bargin no where else is it this cheap and to top that it was sent recorded and arrived the next morning i only ordered at 0pm the day before woow thank_you cycle store im well and trully happy and wish all other_retailers were this good .
M	nightgear has a full range of kit from many different companies , offering the buyer a wide_selection and at a competitive price .
M	customer_service are very friendly , reply promptly to questions and do everything they can to help .
M	deliveries are always well_packaged and on time .
M	would recommend to anyone in military , law enforcement or emergency services , or civilians who just want decent kit that is made to last , for whatever your needs .
M	first time buying from this company and all i can say is the prices are competitive ( for what i was after atleast ) and their standard delivery was ridiculously quick !
M	ordered roughly 00am on thursday , items arrived around 0pm - ish friday ....
M	no issues , no hassle .
M	absolutely perfect , would have no issue ordering from them again !
M	have used heinnie across roughly the last 0 years and the service has been continually great .
M	really fast dispatch and quality service .
M	highly_recommend them .
M	used gr for the first time and am extremely happy with the range of items and service .
M	quick email response and no trouble with my items getting through the customs process ( uk ).
M	overall very happy and would recommend them .
M	first time using this company and can_honestly say im extremely impressed !
M	great range of stock , highly competitive_prices and speedy_delivery !
M	definitely would not hesitate to buy from outdoorgb again !
M	recommended to anyone_looking for a good price , quick turn_around and allround quality service .
M	thanks outdoorgb
M	great company , couldn ' t fault them in any way .
M	this was my first purchase with them and it was an extremely pleasant_experience so i am sure to be returning !
M	thanks to all the other positives reviews i was pointed towards this great store !
M	i can consider myself lucky to have found this website .
M	ordered items on monday and on the following_day i was using my computers with the upgraded memory !
M	excellent is the least i can say !
M	well_done !
M	the team were very quick to answer any_questions i had and the pc itself was built and tested very quick just a shame i ordered it just before_christmas as i didnt get it till after new year , but that was my fault .
M	it is an_absolute machine !
M	it plays all the games i want it to play ie skyrim and cod perfectly doesnt even flinch !!
M	does not get hot stays at around 00 degrees celsius , overall am very happy with the pc
M	astonishingly quick purchase , yet again !
M	ordered payday 0 and a few moment later my key was downloading in steam .
M	brilliant !
M	will_definitely use them again !
M	after using other software and tethered jailbreaks / unlocks , i went to gevey to use my at & t iphone 0 on a t - mobile plan ... it was fine , i suppose , but so tedious !
M	i was always afraid of updating my iphone for fear of updating the baseband .
M	finally , i have a real solution .
M	i used holiday_autos after_reading a review in moneysavingexpert .
M	the site was very easy to navigate , got a great deal on a hire_car for a week and there excess insurance saved me a pretty penny too .
M	follow the instructions and make_sure to print your rental voucher out before you go .
M	i will_definitely use them again .
M	best keys site ive came_across very fast and efficient yet secure
M	living local to box ' s birmingham shop / warehouse means i often visit the store to purchase and collect items .
M	the staff are friendly & courteous , the prices competetive and availability good .
M	my only_gripe is that the website often contains a lot of items that are not available for immediate collection / dispatch .
M	not serious enough to knock off a * but worthy of note nonetheless .
M	interparcel offers a fantastic service and is a worthy alternative to the usual royal_mail services for anything from small packet size upwards .
M	the site is easy to use and takes the hassle out of having an account with one of the couriers directly .
M	highly_recommended if you post anything .
M	sammie was great at helping me and done everything i expected an advisor to do :)
M	nothing more to say ...
M	so i love to travel , to eat , and to share experiences with people .
M	hosstel bookers makes that possible for me .
M	they give me a full list of everything i need to know for a ton of places to stay in the city i am going .
M	i love that they have a lot of reviews of the hostels and hotels , so i can figure_out if the walls are too thin to sleep , if the breakfast is good , and what others think of the hostel .
M	its a really great site and the only one i use .
M	on top of that , there is no booking_fee , so unlike_other_sites there is no 00_% extra .
M	use it .
M	i have now ordered a few sold out tickets from double0_tickets and have never failed to be impressed with their service .
M	i would thoroughly_recommend using this company to anyone who is looking to buy tickets to sold out events .
M	at first , hostelbookers struck me as any other booking website , but after being given a varied selection on quite a remote location i was happy to say that i ' d probably be booking all my other hostels on my 00 week holiday with this company .
M	after choosing an accomodation , i was subject to finding out i didn ' t even have to pay the full_amount which allowed the flexibility of cancelling and not having to squabble over getting a full_refund on the total price .
M	the actually booking process was very quick and efficient and i would definitely be recommending this company to others and using it for future holidays .
M	great service .
M	problem solved in less_than 0 minutes would recommend this company to anyone .
M	delivered on time and does the job
M	thanks for good service and stuffs ;)
M	good service and same i can told about items . many_thanks .
M	i thought they used an excellent courier service , because it specified which hour the boots were going to arrive .
M	thanks !
M	sounds similar to previous poster ...
M	i booked a transfer from lanzarote arrecife .
M	i arrived and was told that there was no record of booking .
M	told me that if i took a taxi then it would be refunded by central office .
M	paid 00_euros for a taxi now they say they will only refund cost of my booking ie 0 euros .
M	so annoyed as i would have booked another shuttle bus if they had not been able to do it .
M	wasted 00_euros because they didn ' t communicate my booking to the local agent .
M	avoid .
M	bit_dubious beforehand about using a stag company but chillisauce were the business .
M	tailored a trip to hamburg to our needs and provided some great advice .
M	nothing worse than hanging_around for airport_transfers and they were bang on time if not early .
M	accommodation was even better_than_expected - really excellent value .
M	and the nighttime destinations were ideal .
M	best thing about chillisauce was the flexibility to have a couple of dropouts , which is more or less inevitable when organising a bunch of reprobates .
M	great service from sarah_h and the team .
M	would definitely_recommend and use again !
M	cheers chillisauce
M	great service !
M	- speedy_delivery
M	i understand not everyone has had the same experience but for my holiday to turkey with the girlfriend everything was done very well .
M	flights were on time and had no issues with anything in the airport , was as relaxing as possibly could be .
M	arrived at hotel and it was the best on the strip by_far .
M	would use them again and defiantly recommend them to my friends and family !
M	booked a hotel for london for arctic monkeys and was all smooth when arrived with confirmation and their website is easy to use .
M	purchased a box of mini cakes as a corporate gift for a large client of ours and they delivered on time and the feedback was positive .
M	would definitely consider_using them for our other 000 large accounts who we regularly send gifts out to if their pricing was slightly_cheaper .
M	overall a very positive buying experience with clean user_friendly website and a faultless process .
M	i purchased 00 items in total from barrington and there was a couple of issues , one being there fault and one being my fault but both were resolved to an excellent standard and putting the customer first .
M	everything they said they would do they did !
M	will be using them again .
M	cannot argue with their service and professionalism - a0
M	dreadful company do not buy from them !!!!!!
M	arrogant customer_service team who do not help you in any way !
M	purchased 0 items from them on saturday and got an_email_saying 0 item was out of stock and would be cancelled automatically !
M	i then contacted them to let them know that i could live with that and that they could dispatch the rest of the order which i was they would .
M	i then log on the day after to find the whole order has been cancelled and the goods were out of stock !
M	i then asked regarding when the refund would be processed i was told 0 - 00 days terrible service !
M	terrible customer_services rep claire and director eric would not even comment on the matter !
M	do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	!
M	it ' s an easy to use website with tons of hostels and great reviews of each and everyone one of them from people like you and me .
M	it makes it easy to weed out the not so good hostel , from the great ones , and ones at great prices .
M	i would highly_recommend this sight to anyone staying in hostels around the world .
M	in the past_year i ' ve been screwed twice by play . com .
M	firstly i pre_- ordered a game which promised a " play . com exclusive pre_- order bonus ".
M	as it turned_out , this " bonus " was a cheat code to unlock a character in the game who was already unlockable anyway .
M	game ' s pre_- order bonus was legitimate , in that it provided a code to redeem an otherwise inaccessible character online .
M	there was no means for me to complain_about this .
M	a year later , and i ordered something else for father ' s day .
M	i ordered over a week in_advance , and when the package finally arrived two days after father ' s day , it was a completely_different item .
M	i contacted them and was assured that my actual item would be posted immediately .
M	three_weeks_later , and it still_hasn ' t even been posted , they refuse to acknowledge me returning the other item ( which is worth less_than what i ordered ), they haven ' t issued me a refund and their email service is fobbing me off with automated_responses .
M	do not use this site .
M	i ' ve dealt_with plenty of online stores , and no other provides a service that can compete with shopto .
M	i ' ve made six orders with them over the past few_years because their products are consistently priced lower_than other_sites , and despite the delivery simply being free royal_mail first_class , my package has always arrived the day after posting , and my order was always posted the same or the next working day .
M	their free postage is comparable to the high - priced premium postage of places like play . com .
M	you can ' t go_wrong with shopto .
M	flowers speak volumes , for once she was lost for words !
M	blackcircles has a great price range of tyres to suit all pockets .
M	its easy and convenient and you can always pick a date and time to suit your own needs
M	excellent service all_round
M	i bought a blackberry phone through mcdonald ' s employee discount site but i din ' t received my cash back .
M	wicked site just had a good moan_about minicredit and praised argos .
M	will be passing on this site to everyone i know .
M	if only i ' d came_across this site sooner .
M	hoping there will there be a product review section later ?
M	if a product is faulty or just not want you hoped it was , it ’_s so easy to return and either replace or refund , and there prices are very good to and even better if you catch a half price sale :-) love shopping here .
M	please don ' t touch this company no matter how desperate you are !
M	!
M	£_000 loan has now gone up to nearly £_000 making it impossible to pay .
M	there penalty charges are ridiculously high and by day 0 of late payment you will not be able to pay the debt !!
M	!
M	they are just legal loan sharks !!
M	!
M	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
M	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
M	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
M	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren ' t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
M	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
M	again , on arriving at the club , we weren ' t on the guest_list !!!
M	very frustrating and hence the poor review .
M	firstly i can confirm the company is genuine and trustworthy , so don ' t have any concerns there .
M	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .
M	its condition was perfect .
M	i was disappointed that my watch was delayed beyond the maximum stated delivery and i had to chase updates a couple of times .
M	i believe swiss watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
M	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
M	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn ' t eligible .
M	my watch wasn ' t anything special , it was a standard breitling aerospace evo .
M	i think the website is misleading and told swiss watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
M	it wouldn ' t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren ' t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
M	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
M	don ' t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
M	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
M	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
M	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
M	just the worst shopping_experience on the high_street .
M	the staff literally couldn ' t care less in any sports_direct i ' ve been in .
M	the corporate attitude must be contagious .
M	i honestly don ' t know how this store survives .
M	we went in for trail running shoes and no one gave a damn about helping_us .
M	across the road to schuh and the experience couldn ' t have been more different .
M	i decided once and for all yesterday i will never return to sports_direct .
M	website is always quick and simple to use .
M	search functions works brilliant and returns relevant results .
M	range of stock and stock_levels were good .
M	prices aren ' t the cheapest but i ' m happy to pay a bit more for a good service , which is what barrington_sports provide .
M	free courier delivery is excellent ( although linked to a minimum order size i believe ).
M	used these for the 0st time and i cannot_fault the services or the price of the tyres .
M	spotted low tyre pressure on the weds evening and verified it thursday_morning .
M	i rang round and checked prices online and tyres on the drive where by_far the cheapest .
M	( i got 0 new 000 / 00 / 00 they were coming to the end of their life )
M	kwick fit gbp 000 . 00
M	bmw dealer gbp 000 . 00
M	tyres on the drive gbp 000 . 00
M	spoke to rob who confirmed they could fit me in the same day and booked me in over the phone .
M	ryan turned_up at the stated time and completed the work with in 00mins , ran through all the details .
M	and all in all a very pleasant and professional service from start to finish
M	nigel crerar

M	ordering could be made simpler .
M	great idea , however doesn ' t work very well in reality !
M	decent prices and great range of products !!

M	great service !!
M	!
M	i found most of supplements here for the lowest_price around .
M	with the price_match feature , i was able to save so much more_than going to several different sites to find the cheapest things .
M	this was definitely and time saver as well .
M	i will_definitely be shopping at sw again !
M	hi ,
M	you need to audit who you allow to list through trivago , specifically amoma . com
M	i went_onto trivago several weeks_ago and booked the premier_inn , haymarket through an agency amoma . com paid the balance in full upfront and left it till the weekend to make use of it .
M	however , when i arrived at the hotel at circa 0 :_00pm , there was no reservation made for me that weekend , and they had no rooms free , which prompted panic stations as i hadn ' t made a back up plan .
M	after much discussion with the reception desk they were able to find a room for the first night , but i would have to pay for it and they definitely didn ' t have a room for the second night .
M	after wasting over 00_minutes on hold to get through to amoma . com i finally got speaking to customer ( service ) who informed me that their supplier had let them down and it wasn ' t their fault ..
M	i handed the phone with their customer_service agent to the hotel manager and they had a discussion , much to my alarm i was not the only individual that weekend who had attempted to use but two other groups of people had used amoma . com for this stay in the premier_inn haymarket and were in the same predicament .
M	i was promised a call back to resolve the situation , which i never received .
M	i spent the next hour ringing hotels in edinburgh trying to find a hotel for the weekend , but had no joy as the edinburgh marathon was taking place on the sunday and they were all booked up .
M	on the saturday_morning i checked in with the reception desk and to my joy , a room had become available through cancellation and i could have it however i would need to pay £_000 to secure it .
M	again i called amoma . com and spoke with another customer_service representative who again promised to call me back , as per previous experience i received no call back .
M	the very least i am expecting is a full_refund to compensate me for the inconvenience and stress suffered by their incompetence , so far they have offered me a £_00 refund for inconvenience , which as you can guess i have not accepted .
M	randomly ended_up on blaze from a google_search , and it turned_out to be the best value for money , and best of all , right here in the uk !
M	- i was considering ordering my carrera ' s from the states because it ' s cheaper - but turned_out ordering from blaze was much_better .
M	- great level of service , emailed me straight_away , got it delivered within a day or 0 , very well_packed , and in mint_condition .
M	have recommended the website to my wife and many other friends !
M	:)
M	big thanks to the blaze team !
M	:)
M	very very quick delivery and excellent products at a good price ....
M	very happy :-)
M	very speedy_delivery , arrived next_day which was perfect !
M	no hitches with delivery or service and everything went_smoothly .
M	cheapest price available and i would definately use again .
M	ordered the oakley goggles ive been after for my approaching ski season & they arrived 0 days_later .
M	im well happy - bring on st anton 0000 !
M	!
M	i have ordered from them many_times .
M	prices are low and the courier costs are very cheap for the weight of the bottles they send .
M	they have a huge_selection and its nearly all in stock for next_day dellivery
M	the website is great , easy to navigate and a very accurate search_functionality .
M	your range of spares and hop ups is also great compared to your competition !
M	very friendly ordering , and got a very nice discount !

M	it took a long time to get my order refunded
M	good service , friendly website
M	cheap quaity products which are despatched very fast ,.. lovely .. wasnt dissapointed
M	they despatched my order the next_day and i had the product 0 days after i placed my order .
M	their packaging is good and protective so that the items don ' t get damaged in transit
M	ba is a good airline with excellent customer_service .
M	sometimes you get very good deals ... just have to keep a watch .
M	brilliant in - flight services ( food , movie selection and comfortable seats ).
M	i am a customer of virgin mobile and their customer_service is incredible .
M	they also have very good deals and i hardly have any signal problems .. highly_recommended
M	the customer_service was excellent ., efficient & very friendly .
M	unbeatable price & delivery of item .
M	i would highly_recommend .
M	i get great quality items at a much_better price than i would pay at gnc .
M	the aga - t0 was delivered within 0 working_days with standard delivery , excellent service .
M	it performs superbly and was much_easier to set_up than other cheap re - buildable atomisers that i ' ve purchased before .
M	it really is extraordinary value for money .
M	a genesis style atomiser like this would have cost you a small_fortune a few_months_ago .
M	absolutely no leaks whatsoever .
M	its not for beginners but i highly_recommend it .
M	probably a good idea to also purchase some spare mesh and wire if you ' re starting out .
M	excellent network give you lots of free things back unlike any other network
M	really really cheap prices and very very quickly despatched couldnt ask for more brilliant ....
M	order number_000000000

M	thanks vhl for fixing my boiler when i needed you most .
M	daniel the engineer really got the problem sorted fast and actually taught me a thing or two about how to save on my heating bills .
M	if only you did motorbikes !
M	ha !
M	thanks guys !
M	thank_you car parts 0 less and daniel what a wonderful help you have been over the last few_years .
M	i wish i could give you a 0th star !
M	price beaters and a great fast reliable service what more do you want .
M	i have used printerland twice now and have been pleased both_times with their level of service .
M	items are always delivered the very next_day and the prices are extremely competitive .
M	the website is extremely easy to use and gave all the exact information i needed when comparing possible printers and the staff are always helpful when required .
M	i will be recommending printerland to anyone who needs a printer or consumables .
M	i ' ll definately be back myself !
M	i chose 000 -_reg because they are simple , fast and affordable .
M	i was originally a godaddy customer using there standard vps package costing over £_00 \ month for a basic single - tier 0gb_ram 0x core , 0tb bandwidth , 000gb server .
M	having several problems with godaddy , with server downtimes , firewall blocking issues .
M	i decided it was time to see what the rest of the market had to offer , where i stumbled_upon 000 -_reg .
M	i have used 000 -_reg in the past for simple cheap domain registration , and what they offered for a basic vps was simply outstanding :
M	- 0gb_ram
M	- unlimited bandwidth
M	- 0 cpu cores
M	- plesk addon included in the price
M	- included static_ip_address
M	all for £_00 . 00
M	i couldn ' t resist and instantly ordered it .
M	within 0 hours the vps was available and ready to use .
M	despite minor connection and server issues , i have never had as many problems using 000 -_reg compared to godaddy .
M	there help and support has always been mostly helpful and within a decent response time .
M	unlike go daddy , was impossible to get hold of , i would have to wait 0 / 0 of a day to talk to someone about a simple problem .
M	really pleased with my supra sofa_bed , excellent service and really quick delivery .
M	thank_you !
M	shoes arrived_promptly and as_described .
M	would recommend the site !
M	i have had problem after problem with scottish_power ....
M	my electric meter broke so i called them in september asking them to fix it .
M	they said they would send someone out the following week to replace the meter .
M	that person didn ' t turn_up .
M	i got back in touch and arranged for another callout to replace the meter .
M	again , i had to book time off work but this time , someone did attend .
M	sadly , he simply looked at the meter and agreed that it was broken and then left .
M	he admitted that it was ridiculous and said that most customers were unhappy with this process but that the decision was obviously made above him .
M	he said the metering team would be back in touch .
M	i was also given an_email address for them as to call , i ' d have to go through various departments first ....
M	when they didn ' t get back in touch ( surprise_surprise !
M	), i emailed them and they agreed an_appointment for which no - one arrived .
M	since then , i have emailed 0 times ( all of which were automatically acknowledged saying they would respond within 0 working_days ) and i have had no response to any of them .
M	they have now increased my bill , have given me a higher estimated usage than normal and have sent a threatening letter demanding payment but still will not respond to any_questions_regarding my meter !
M	i chose scottish_power because they were the cheapest on a comparison site .
M	a few_months on and they are now one of the most expensive .
M	never go with scottish_power !
M	learn from my mistakes !
M	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
M	the sales_team are quite pushy and say there is a minimum of 0 hours for a two bed flat which is more_than i wanted , but went with it .
M	i recently received an_email offering a one of 0 hour service for £_00 but when i called they said my post code wasn ' t eligible .
M	the cleaning was generally ok but never great value and the first cleaner broke part of my shower and didn ' t mention it .
M	edit_: i ' ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
M	after using parcels to go for some time , we have changed business premises , we were unable to book collections at our new address due to something that happened back a few_years_ago before we moved in , i have been in contact with the company before this time and was advised that they could not collect from out area , i have chatted today with emma , and she has managed to arrange our new address to be able to have collections again , which will now save us money on collection charges !!..
M	she went above and beyond her duty to help me and was also very helpful ..
M	thanks you emma , you have made my day !
M	the guy i spoke with cormac , was really helpful , i ' d spent the day ringing companies always to find they had no stock or it would take 0 weeks to get what i wanted , but time was against me , cormac went and checked everything they had in that would be the right fit for my car gave me a list of them straight to my email and made it much_easier to choose .
M	in the end i went for the fox racing fx000 .
M	ordered on the wednesday arrived on friday .
M	would recommend to any of my friends .
M	thanks performance_alloys .
M	used this service on new years_eve .
M	was skeptical at first about the whole service and the 0 hour activation time .
M	but it worked like a charm .
M	highly_recommended !
M	gave us a honest review of the current condition of the car , and great talking with jason .
M	will do business with them again .
M	go there , buy the service , boom , you have you iphone_unlocked .
M	i ' ve ordered 0 bikes from them in the last 0 months .
M	the first goes like a dream , but has now left my care for that of my father .
M	i ordered a second , bigger , bike which was to be delivered by yodel ( who are the worst yet most widespread carrier ).
M	yodel , being incompetent have ( unsurprisingly ) badly fumbled the delivery .
M	i contacted bikes0u to enquire_about a resolution to allow us to bypass yodel .
M	within 00_minutes , they phoned me , explained the situation and we worked out a resolution .
M	top_notch service all_round .
M	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i ' ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
M	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
M	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
M	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
M	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
M	i always used to love going into game .
M	they always had what i wanted and the staff knew their stuff .
M	of late , however , they ' ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
M	this was best highlighted when the cancelled all mass_effect pre_- orders shortly before_release .
M	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
M	the staff are always friendly , helpful and smiling .
M	and the food , while a little dearer , beats other supermarkets hands_down .
M	especially the bread .
M	having paid for next_day delivery , i was unimpressed when they failed to deliver the next_day , or the day after , or the day after ....
M	when i phone to track it , the call_centre in manchester has none of the numbers needed to actually put you through to people who might help , and the website is no help either .
M	out of 00 deliveries they ' ve handled , only 0 showed up on time .
M	they also lost one and broke another .
M	in my opinion , stick to <_external link_removed > services .
M	i ordered some whey_protein off of this website for the first time .
M	it was exactly_what i ordered and not only was i satisfied with my product , but i got other free things for only the price of shipping .
M	supplement_warehouse is a great site
M	yet another bad review of this astonishingly incompetent company ( formally hdnl for anyone who sees a pattern emerging ).
M	i have had the unfortunate experience of having 0 parcels delivered by yodel and only one has been delivered the first time .
M	two more have been missed once and had to be redelivered and the latest has been missed twice .
M	i have deliveries for work ( self_employed ) 0 - 0 times a week from other_companies and i never miss a single one .
M	the reason for this is that yodel for some reason seem to think it is acceptable to deliver at 0000 everytime when usually nobody can be there .
M	some common_sense would flag that up as needing to be delivered at a different time .
M	speaking of times , their possible delivery hours are 0000 to 0000 . who can be in for that period of time ?
M	it ' s ... ridiculous .
M	they don ' t even do you the courtesy of telling you whether it will be morning , afternoon or evening .
M	the cards they leave ( if they bother to leave one at all ) are always virtually blank with perhaps a cross in the boxed marked " we tried to deliver " ( no , really ?
M	i couldn ' t work that out from the card you left and the fact i was expecting a delivery ).
M	there was a telephone_number left on the latest card which i have tried to ring to no_avail because it ' s either off or flips to voicemail .
M	after_reading about other people ' s experience with yodel i ' m very hesitant to ring the call_centre as i ' m_afraid what might happen to my parcel if i do !
M	after ditching my old web developers who couldn ' t give a crap about your site , or any particular deadline i was recommended to gocreations by one of my friends .
M	i have to say i haven ' t looked back since .
M	they are always friendly , understanding and have always been able to complete projects on time and never over the inital cost that is agreed upon .
M	their web_hosting has been very reliable so far and extremely cost_effective when compared with some others .
M	if you ' re looking for a company to trust with your developent then you ' ve found it .
M	after running my website for a couple of years and finding trustpilot for my own business i think i should leave a review about the company who made my website ( well , half of it anyway ).
M	i contacted them about a site , sent over some pretty specific layout information and graphics and told them in no uncertain_terms what my budget for the project was and that it was basically an_absolute figure .
M	the person i initially contacted was nice enough , fairly professional , and told me " we can make the site for you in two_weeks ."
M	two_weeks after they started they sent me a link to the store on their server and it looked like maybe an afternoon ' s work had been put into it .
M	very few things were where they were supposed to be and a few things that i had been told looked fine on the design were now " added extras " which would incur extra_charges to fix .
M	what could i do but pay them the extra money ?
M	i needed my site up and running so i could make some money .
M	after over 000 emails between me and them the director of holbi shows up and tries to mediate ( to his credit he ' s quite a friendly bloke ).
M	so finally , after an exasperating 0 months my project was delivered still quite unfinished , overbudget and buggy .
M	modules are also insanely over costed .
M	i enquired_about a few changes i needed to be made and i think i managed to get them down to about £_000 in the end .
M	i decided to shop around and managed to get the same_thing ( plus a couple of other tweaks ) for £_000 from a stellar developer whom i trust implicitly and has not let me down .
M	none of the people who work for holbi ( at_least that i spoke to ) seem to speak_english as a first language .
M	there were frequent misunderstandings and terribly written emails which were sometimes very difficult to decipher .
M	considering they put themselves forward as a leading company in the uk you would think they would put the time in to learn the language properly so they could more effectively communicate with their customers .
M	i initially went with holbi to save me having to code the site myself .
M	i could have done it myself if i wanted to but i thought i ' d let them take care of it so i could focus more of my time on other areas of the business but without constant reminders they seem to forget about your project .
M	i ' d say if you have very deep pockets , go to them and say " i need a website , i don ' t care how much it costs " or " i need a website , i don ' t care what it looks_like " then they would probably provide a decent service because they seem to be technically proficient ( there wasn ' t anything i was told " couldn ' t be done ") but if you have an existing design and functionality in mind then please , shop elsewhere .
M	lastly , i am still finding numerous bugs in the site and with the payment gateways that cost me yet more money to put right .
M	i ' ve had the whole paypal gateway replaced with a better module because of frequent problems with it and the nochex gateway gives me major_issues like processing orders twice and " double restocking " products when duplicate orders are deleted .
M	very helpful , attentive and thorough service .
M	my rep , emma , answered all my queries and helped_me solve my problem .
M	i definitely_recommend their services to one and all .
M	thanks emma .
M	everything went_smoothly .
M	spoke to someone on chat straight after to confirm reservations and they were very helpful too , even changing one of the reservations for me to take into account a late arrival .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	i ' ve ordered twice from bedsonlegs now and they ' ve been perfect both_times .
M	good products , excellent communication , prompt delivery and low_prices .
M	really can ' t fault them .
M	they already have the cheapest supplements , but if you find a website with it cheaper you can get 0 %_off the cheaper price !
M	extremely great deal , has all the supplements you can think of .
M	don ' t waste your time with gnc or any other stores , this is where you want to go for any supplements .
M	thanks supplement_warehouse !
M	i move around quite a bit , but never between countries with more_than a suitcase , so i didn ' t know how it would go moving a ton of furniture , clothes , etc ... with a removals firm .
M	i had used lopa ' s services in the past , but for very small things .
M	i am so glad i used them for my big move back to the uk from france .
M	all email exchanges were smooth and timely .
M	cost was very reasonable for the service i wanted .
M	and , the most_important thing - the move went smoother than i thought possible .
M	not even 0 glass broken .
M	the guys on both ends were amazing .
M	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i would use them again !
M	really the title of this review says it all .
M	i have bought numerous items from aria online over the years and often recommend them to friends and family .
M	aria offer fantasic service and value for money on all products i have ever investigated with them .
M	i do feel that the shipping can get a bit on the expensive side when either ordering a number of items or high value items which do not include free shipping .
M	all in all - a great company to purchase from though !
M	i was so so dubious_about ordering from here , the bad_reviews were worrying and the price seemed too good to be true .
M	i decided to risk it and order anyway and was so glad that i did , item arrived super_fast , was well_packaged and i got it for a great price .
M	i was even able to get cashback from top_cashback .
M	would definitely order from here again .
M	i sold my broken phone to mazuma as they buy these off you , i requested a pack to be sent to me and this arrived next_day , i packed my phone and sent it and had the money by the end of the week .
M	the service was quick , easy and simple .
M	i ' ve always order off of the same supplement site , and decided to give it a change because supplement_warehouse ' s prices are unbeatable , and if they are beat ... well , supplement_warehouse beat ' s the price again with it ' s awesome 0 % less price adjuster .
M	they also hand out boat loads of free_gifts !
M	i ' ve had free_gifts from other_sites , but with this there are so many !
M	definitely sticking to the supplement_warehouse from now on !
M	first time using instant gaming ; i was extremely impressed at the speed in which i recieved the key and very impressed with their pricing .
M	great site !
M	simple website to use and even using the free delivery the parcel was at my door ( fully tracked by text_message along the way ) in less_than 00hrs .
M	would definitely_recommend ( and actually already have !)
M	i ' d definitely use mazuma again .
M	i posted my phone special delivery and then between 00am and 0pm the following_day had four emails , two confirming the receiving and processing of my phone then the other two about the payment .
M	there were no_quibbles at any point about the amount i was to be paid it was just put straight into my account .
M	all in all from posting to receiving the money i would say it took about 00_hours and it ' s fair to say i was extremely impressed !
M	was referred to this site as one of the best places to get product keys quick , easy and at an affordable price !
M	after taking a look and placing and order i was not let_down !!
M	will most definitely be coming_back here in the future !
M	the service was brilliant !!!!
M	easy to place an order and they were quick to organise a delivery date .
M	the delivery company gave us a delivery time_slot to which they kept by it and were very helpful in bringing the product inside the property .
M	the staffs was very friendly and polite and will go out of their way to make_sure you are happy with the products you have brought and find other products that are similar if the one you are after is no_longer available .
M	i will use this again .
M	ordered various office supplies at 0pm and they arrived first thing the following_morning - brilliant , just what we needed
M	printer land did an amazing job quickly sent out my ink for my printer first thing the next_day .
M	also purchased my printer from them over 0 years_ago and we use it on a daily_basis amazing quality they sell
M	thank_you
M	not only was simply_games the cheapest for a pre order , my game was also delivered 0 days early !
M	highly_recommended .
M	this was my first time ordering from digitalrev and it will not be the last , the price of the item was £_000 cheaper_than the uk and it was delivered in a couple of days .............. from bloody hong_kong how is that possible when companies in the uk can take a couple weeks sending something couple hundred miles_away .
M	have my eye on a canon 00 - 000 f0 or 0 . 0 now :_d
M	i ' ve only ever used them for ds cards but they always arrive on time and their prices are fantastic ( i always go for the ship from jersey option so avoiding vat - they say 0 - 0 day delivery but usually 0 - 0 days ).
M	ordered a card at christmas - never arrived .
M	they said they ' d send a replacement in january - never arrived .
M	had to do a charge back with my credit_card company .
M	then got an_email_saying they had sent me my order and the post_office had returned it as i had not been available for delivery ( had to sign for it ).
M	asked for proof of this and they failed to give me the rd number - bunch of idiots !
M	got my money back thanks to visa .
M	ordered my card ( dstt 0gb ) on monday about 00am and got it the following_morning by recorded_delivery .
M	the card is the bees knees - and no had any_problems since ( no need to contact them so cannot_comment on their customer_service ).
M	will be using them again !
M	ordered a key and received within 0 minutes of payment , great service !
M	picked_up a deuter race exp air from snow & rock for £_00 delivered .
M	included was the £_00 deuter streamer that is usually sold separately .
M	srp on the bag alone is £_00 , overall excellent value plus a one day delivery .
M	this was my first time buying from thegamecollection and i ' m very impressed .
M	taking up their daily " flash sale " gave an unbeatable price ( with free shipping ) and the game was delivered within two days , well_packaged .
M	i ' ll certainly be looking to use the site again in future and give my full recommendation !
M	al round excellent service , many_thanks !
M	ordered a play mat for godless shrine always wanted one they had a sale ordered and got it in 0 days no_problems well_packed and safe a good reliable company a +++
M	i have just spoken with jenny via live_chat and it was a pleasant_experience , veto professional and polite .
M	would happily use this service again .
M	this is one of a number if occasions i have used mega_fancy_dress .
M	their ebay shop is very easy to navigate and when i have requested info on costumes my query has been dealt_with very quickly and answered the required detail .
M	the despatch is always confirmed and the delivery speedy .
M	the products are very reasonably_priced and of high_quality and ebay purchases are covered by a very generous returns_policy .
M	very highly_recommended - thank_you very much !
M	this company has messed_up everything their interbroand and phone have the slowest speeds possible and they dont respond to customer feedback well or send any kind of replacements when you tell them you cant use their internet , i had a cotnract with them and they charged through the teeth for a service i wasnt getting and when i tried to cancel they slapped a £_000 bill on top of that .
M	they dont even deserve the one star
M	i ' ve used these for a while now to buy food for my labrador as they offer free next_day delivery .
M	i recently change my dogs food which didn ' t agree with her , so emailed for a bit of advice .
M	i received a really well thought out and clear response with advice the same day .
M	they are usually the cheapest around or within a few_quid , but i value there service at worth more_than the negligible difference .
M	i ' d highly_recommend them .
M	i booked 0 tickets for the v_festival 0000 in chelmsford for me and my friends .
M	we were all worried_about booking the tickets as there was only 0 weeks to go before the event when we booked them , and we had never ordered tickets from double0 in the past .
M	on the day prior to receiving the tickets i had a phone call from double0 telling_me the tickets would arrive in the morning and they did .
M	all wristbands were in perfect_condition and we all had a great time , will never be worried_about using double0tickets again .
M	i ordered the original source item ( which has been_discontinued ) and i found it here at a great price .
M	i ordered from them for the first time and the item was delivered promptly and was exactly as_described .
M	very happy about t his !
M	good online service .
M	everything good , thanks !
M	i signed_up for a 000 -_reg vps in december_0000 .
M	one fine day in january_0000 i woke to discover that my server was down .
M	no matter , i thought i would login and get it back up .
M	the control_panel showed that the vps was " suspended ".
M	there had been no attempt to email me or phone me the impending suspension of my account , and no failed payment attempts were logged on my account activity .
M	all i found was that the control_panel did not allow me to restore the vps , and there was no option to renew .
M	i contacted customer_service by chat at 0am , who proceeded to open a ticket .
M	but customer_service repeatedly failed to understand my issue , that the vps had no restore option .
M	furthermore , no 000 -_reg engineers attempted to restart the vps .
M	so here we are , 00_hours , with critical business data sitting on a vps i cannot access , with no attempt by 000 -_reg to contact me , and no serious attempt by 000 -_reg engineers having taken place to restart my vps .
M	conclusion , dear readers , do not use 000 -_reg vps service .
M	they appear to operate a high_volume low_cost business , with low_cost meaning woefully inadequate support to recover a vps .
M	not only that , but it takes real contempt for customers to suspend a vps without warning by email or phone , and then to make no attempt during a whole business day to restart the vps .
M	not too mention total failure by 000 -_reg to reassure me that data had not been lost .
M	anyone affiliated with ' we can help you claim for your accident ' spam text_messages - as this company are - should be avoided like the plague .
M	i took a punt on tsohost on the recommendation of a trusted friend and i ' ve never looked back since .
M	their support is second to none , and that ' s coming from someone who is used to the level of support offered by rackspace .
M	amazing service , amazing price .
M	i particularly recommend their clustered hosting packages .
M	i can ' t recommend tsohost highly_enough .
M	mazuma were great , fast , easy and hassle_free .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	i have to admit , i ' m very wary and sceptical of some of these cd_key websites and i did mull over it for a few_days before_deciding to do it and it was well worth it .
M	i ' ve never seen such a secure payment system in place that actually looks out for the customer and when they say instant delivery they mean it , the key is waiting for you once you verify your email ( because i ' m a first time buyer ) and the whole_process was just simple .
M	i ' m always getting my pc games from here from now on , many_thanks guys !
M	great selection of products and the best prices i ' ve been able to find for muscle_milk .
M	order was processed very quickly and money was transferred to bank same day as phone received !
M	top quality service !
M	i recently got bf0 !
M	the transaction was smooth , amazingly simple , and a pleasure .
M	i got the cd_key sent via_email in next to no time , and already have friends who i have recommended the website too .
M	the best cd_key site i have ever used !
M	could not give you guys , anymore praise as words are not enough .
M	thanks very much happy customer :_d
M	i purchased a nikon_d0000 from digitalrev . com , and it was an easy pleasant_transaction .
M	i received my item within a few_days from ordering .
M	as it was being shipped from hk , i expected more of a wait to be honest , but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it so quickly .
M	it was well_packaged and secure for the post .
M	the communication was top stuff , i received all emails and tracking_information asap .
M	not to mention that they have the best prices on the market for this piece of kit .
M	:)
M	the only_niggle was that the instruction manuals were all in japanese , however a sticker on the front of the manual directed me to a nikon web_page where i could download and print an english copy off .
M	so not a real problem at all .
M	cant_wait to purchase my next gear for this camera from these_guys .

M	i have pre_- ordered my xbox one day one edition console 0 weeks before lounch as simplygames were the only one that still could guarantee delivery for 00nd nov .
M	the most importanc for me anyways was that they were comunicating to me at all times what is going on with my order and they did take the payment only after they have been 000_% sure that they will fulfill all their promises .
M	my new console arrived on 00nd at 0000 which made me a very happy guy !
M	thank_you to simplygames team for working hard on this !
M	recommended !!
M	!
M	order placed online late_afternoon and delivered by 00am next_day .
M	very happy with the product and i will_continue to shop with printerland in the future .
M	if i have to write about comet repair service ( which is now closed ) i can easily write a book .
M	in short i went to clean the vents on my hp laptop .
M	it took 0 hours 0 people !
M	they broke the cables for audio , they even broke one of the built in speakers .
M	hard_drive and battery charger lights don ' t work anymore !
M	this review btw is for the hemel hempstead store .
M	debenhams in my opinion is best for quality and sales offers .
M	i also own a debenhams card so i get exclusive offers and vouchers .
M	we absolutely love to shop in debenhams be it for clothing , kitchenwares , furnitures or cosmetics / toiletries
M	staff are always helpful !
M	we went to find out info about hiring a rug doctor .
M	it took us 00_mins to get hold of someone who can guide us .
M	spoke with one staff , they pointed us to another , and this went on for a while and finally we were asked to wait at the tiling desk where we spent about 00_mins and then again we started to chase staff .
M	finally someone came in who didn ' t even bother to say sorry that you had to wait .
M	i kept_repeating we have been waiting here for 00mins and he never said sorry !
M	always there to help , checkouts are quick and they try and help whatever they can during the busy hours .
M	when offers are on , its probably the cheapest even cheaper_than asda .
M	love the products , quality and the variety .
M	the downside is its way to expensive .
M	the same accessories are much much cheaper elsewhere .
M	saw a mass amount of great deals and decided to shop at supplement_warehouse and was even more pleased to see i get free_samples / gifts with my purchase on top of these unbeatable deals .
M	the shipping cost is well worth it and i still saved a lot of cash .
M	i follow their youtube_channel which has some amazing reviews and videos .
M	it was here that i discovered their store .
M	i ordered a blackstar ht - 0r from them on the wednesday and it was delivered to me friday_morning .
M	its a fantastic amp and i received a great service from andertons .
M	i will_definitely buy from them again .
M	they were very quick to dispatch and were very well_priced
M	i ordered a stethoscope at half 0ish and it had been engraved and dispatched by 00 .
M	superb service .
M	i ' m building my own pc and was recommended aria by a friend .
M	all i have received is great customer_service , excellent delivery service and a fantastic forum option .
M	i couldn ' t have asked for more .
M	thank_you aria !
M	where do i start ?
M	i ordered a talking ted toy for £_00 from gameseek , only to be told after 0 weeks of waiting for delivery that it was out of stock ( even_though it was stated as in stock when i ordered it ).
M	i said i would wait , so and waited ....
M	decided to email and ask what was going on , and they said they were having trouble getting stock .
M	so i asked for a refund ... no problem they said .
M	i am still_waiting , over 0 months !!!!
M	!
M	constant emails back and forth with them claiming they have sent a refund , yet me never receiving a penny and no record of the transaction_id in paypal .
M	coincidentally , after i ask for a refund the item miraculously becomes available again , so i ask if they can send me the product instead of my refund ... no problem , we ' ll chargeback the ' refund ' and have it delivered ... do you think i have recieved it ?
M	haha
M	they then claim they never said they could chargeback the ' refund ' even_though i have it in an_email , which they have been sent a copy of .
M	then when i ask them to contact paypal and sort the matter out seeing as they have apparently sent a refund , they stop replying to emails .
M	0 emails in total asking what was happening but not one reply !
M	!
M	have to say i would never buy from them again , they haven ' t even offered me an_apology and have accused me of lying , i have contacted consumer watchdog and am taking_legal_advice on the matter at the moment
M	i didn ' t have to wait at all and the rep was great !
M	i have been with tso now for a couple of years and the level of knowledge and support they provide is simply the best .
M	when i submit a support ticket , its answered within minutes , regardless of the time of day .
M	the prices are also very reasonable and i look_forward to continue using tso for the future :)
M	i got recommend to mr_memory , by a friend but i was not sure what i needed , so i contacted mr_memory a while back and they told me what i needed .
M	recieved my order this week and installed it with no problem .
M	i would highly_recommend mr_memory !
M	clean site , that keeps things simple !
M	bought a hoover robot and it arrived on time , and was well_packaged !
M	what more could you want ?
M	:_d
M	i cannot express my thanks enough for the remarkable job this company does by keeping their prices low and their costumers happy .
M	thank_you !
M	easy to use website , found what i was looking for in mins then paid via_paypal , fast and secure .
M	would shop again .
M	ordered my bass and was received on the day when i received the dispatched email !
M	well_protected in the box and incredibly fast delivery , thanks !
M	service was fast and reliable .
M	i bought my iphone_0s in uk and brought to brazil .
M	in the beginning was detected that my unit was used in brazil and for some reason it was locked .
M	suddenly to use another carrier with gevey .
M	but after paying for release ... after 00hrs my iphone was fully unlocked .
M	and working with any carrier .
M	now my fear to update the phone is gone :_d
M	orderid = 000000
M	thanks officialiphoneunlock
M	i made an order on behalf of a friend on a friday_afternoon , i selected the saturday delivery , i contacted there team using a social_networking site and they got back to me with in minutes , confirming that the item would be dispatched that day and would arrive with me next_day .
M	true to there word it did and i have been informed that the " sizing was perfect and the dress hung well " as a man i have no_idea what this means but it sounds positive lol ....
M	i found there team extremely polite and well informed and i would defiantly recommend to anyone .
M	if a man like me who has no fashion sense what so ever can be guided through the process they really can hep anyone .
M	defiantly worth a 0 start rating
M	our company has been using payapl for around 0 - 0 months without any_issues then payapl decided they would wanted documentation from us .
M	we promptly sent this off to them and received a confirmation_email , stating your account is now active .
M	then less_than 00_hours_later another email from them stating our account is permanently limited .
M	when we called there limitation department we spoke to the first person who proceeded to be very aggressive towards us and when we asked to speak to manager she refused and stated if you want to speak to some one else call back in we explained that we had been on hold for 00_minutes before we got threw to her she then said tough and ended the call .
M	so we called again and spoke to the most unhelpful person i have ever_dealt his name was patrick .
M	he decided to scream at us that he would not escalate the call any high than him and that we where wasting our time and his by calling him .
M	this is not the attitude to have when working in support .
M	we where simply asking for information on why this had happened and to see if there was anything we could do to resolve this as we had all of our captial tied up in paypal .
M	he then stated he didnt care and ended the call .
M	paypal have basically bank rupted us today with there ridiculous policy .
M	they have no_idea of how to help a customer or of what internal escalation is .
M	they have decided to keep our funds for 0 months and given no reason .
M	we recommend any new business not to use them and stay as far away as possible for t his disgusting company .
M	this is the worse company i have ever_dealt_with .
M	they seem to use every method possible to avoid you been able to withdraw your winnings .
M	i would a relatively_small amount £_00 over a month_ago and still have not been able to withdraw this .
M	they requested i send in a copy of my passport which is ridiculous .
M	i have sent this is in then they came back with can you please resend this .
M	they should get zero_stars they are attempting to steal my winnings .
M	i would warn_everyone not to use them use one of the more well_established sites such as bet fair or williamhill who dont try and use the tactics to steel your money .
M	i use this service a lot , and it works well .
M	quick access to a wide_range of takeaways in the area and their menu , means it is very easy to cruise and get just what you are looking for .
M	ordering is simple and paying is very easy if you save your card_details .
M	the one time ( out of maybe 00 - 00 orders ) a takeaway has failed to deliver hungryhouse customer support were very helpful , swiftly censuring the takeaway and refunding my money .
M	the customer_service was very good .
M	my only reservation on the whole service is that it is too easy !
M	some nights you can have ordered a takeaway in moments on a whim .
M	not so good for the waistline .
M	i ordered a product code for a product i had picked_up secondhand and which had already been registered on steam .
M	within about 0 minutes of reaching the simplycdkeys . com website i had my code and was playing the game .
M	optical_express gave me the chance to go without glasses .
M	they offered a good service with plenty of support .
M	they explained things to me well and i felt i understood everything which was going on .
M	if i had any concerns they talked them through and reassured me .
M	now my recovery period is complete it feels_like i have always been this way and it is strange to see pictures of myself wearing glasses .
M	after being with orange for more_than 0 years they have been brilliant , great value for money , great talk plans and excellent service .
M	after using envirophone and having an exptremly bad service - i decided to send my handset to mazuma , i sent them my handset on monday and they confirmed receipt of it on tuesday and money was in my bank_account on the same day by 0pm .... will def use again and highly_recomend .
M	thanks mazuma
M	i bought a game on macstop - i was slightly worried ' cos they are new but the whole_thing was great .
M	much_better_than buying from a big faceless company - very easy experience , great product , and at really low_prices .
M	nothing to complain_about - will def use again
M	i used sell your laptop purely_because it was the top trusted link on google , and offered a nice price for my old hp compaq .
M	the courier collected the item on the day of asking , early morning , which i ' d put it an old cardboard_box .
M	no real problems with the service , other than i had to wait a few_days longer for my money , due to the courier taking the laptop to the wrong depot .
M	even so , i phoned and asked , and was told the problem virtually straight_away , and said they ' d resolve it as soon as possible .
M	the problem was solved the next_day , and then i received the money .
M	overall , a great service and brilliant company .
M	i would highly_recommend sell your laptop to anyone .
M	it is the second purchase from this website . very well_packed and really quick delivery . i am really pleased and i will_definitely buy again from them .
M	great experience , the game i ordered arrived quicker_than stated in the delivery estimate , in great order and with some nice packaging and letter containing details .
M	vast product range , thorough and thoughtful customer_service both before and after purchasing the products which was very handy considering my inexperience with this level of camera hardware and software and highly competitive_pricing .
M	will be recommending to any colleague , friend or family in the future and have found my one stop_shop for all things camera .
M	this company is awesome .
M	they had everything i needed , plus things i now want .
M	i will_definitely , guaranteed 000_%, be shopping here again !
M	i would recommend this company for either experienced or novice online shoppers ...
M	it ' s great !
M	!
M	i put full reg in and got quotes from older cars that the engine would not work with waste of time wasted half my day !!!
M	avoid
M	fast delivery and amazing products thankyou
M	the network lost all service on friday the 00th and promised to make it up to its customers then next thing they say there donating to charity not helping the people that make it grow . this is a complete pr stunt by the company ! "
M	network run buy us " its a joke its a way of saving money after all people that are on the network have to pay for a months goodbag .
M	we lost a day no one said anything about donating to charity they just did it .
M	i know they have more_than 00 , 000 people on there network so if they give them all £ 0 each that would be £ 00k so a £ 00k donation is a huge saving plus they can claim the vat back this company is a joke !!
M	and i am leaving as soon as i can !
M	we found the whole long weekend very enjoyable and well planned form the start .
M	our_guide , naomi , was incredible throughout , even with 00 drunken lads .
M	i would definitely_recommend pissup to anyone_looking to do a stag_weekend or similar .
M	after contacting a lot of similar companies , they were the only ones not to hassle me with almost hourly phone_calls .
M	thanks pissup !
M	!
M	hostelbookers . com has a great range of hostels for booking .
M	i found a great deal in a very cool part of sydney that i otherwise would have missed .
M	the website was very easy and the prices were great !
M	i plan to keep using s . w .
M	!
M	thanks !
M	:) you ' re great
M	i ' d been looking for an ssd at an affordable price for a while , so when aria was suggested to me and i instantly found a suitable product on sale ( and there are plenty of these ) i was very pleased .
M	plenty of technical details on the site , plus the ability to ask for feedback on pretty_much an question at the bottom of the page made the experience of choosing a product very easy .
M	ordering was as expected of any site today , and delivery was swift and cost efficient .
M	overall a very good experience .
M	i was about to order from this company using their lovely looking website but was thankfully told otherwise by a colleague .
M	they had ordered items weeks_ago and have never arrived !
M	on top of all this , i have their ugly banners following me around wherever i go !
M	a classic case of not judging a book by its cover !
M	very helpful staff that helped_me with all my queries .
M	always a pleasure to deal with the guys at the old dairy !
M	i needed a dj for my asian wedding and these_guys were professional and very talented .
M	an experienced bunch with a great sense of humour , exactly_what i was looking for .
M	will use again !
M	ordered some play and charge kits for my xbox one controller and they turned_up the very next_day .
M	very happy with the service .
M	their prices are very good as well !
M	i ' ve moved all my game pre_- orders to simplygames just because they ' re cheaper and i know their delivery is top_notch .
M	i was sketchy at first before buying but i took the plunge and i ' m_glad i did .
M	very reliable service , got my key_instantly .
M	the best online_retailer for games .
M	cheap and usually delivered before_release_date , if pre_- ordering or next_day if the game is already out .
M	very recommended !
M	the website is extremely easy to use and navigate through .
M	i really like the fact that hostelbookers tells you the most_popular cities in each country you select .
M	registration and booking process and quick and painless .
M	couldn ' t be_happier with my experience .
M	organised courier for a ebay transaction , deliveree was out when supposed to be in .
M	parcel0go tried several_times to re - deliver , then came up on the tracking screen as awaiting instruction .
M	went_onto the live_chat , spoke rose who was very helpful and had sorted re - delivery out within 0 minutes .
M	many_thanks
M	this is the best , the only site to shop for when looking for anything supplement related !
M	more_than reasonable prices and shipping is beyond fast !
M	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance :
M	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn ' t this be automatic ?
M	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
M	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
M	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn ' t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
M	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can ' t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
M	if you want the newest games but dont wonna pay premium prices then look no thurther .
M	its not only games though , theres also xbox points , internet security and wow time .
M	they respond srtaight away and send your keys instantly .
M	a must for any nerd :-)
M	very fast and reliable
M	very fast delivery and really good price .
M	absolute pleasure to make a purchase as usual .
M	not my first and definitely not last .
M	totally recommended :)
M	thank_you team digitalrev !
M	great modern addition to anyones underwear draw , great fit , comfortable and fun designs
M	i use hotesone frequently for business trip accommodation .
M	i find the website very reliable , secure and good value !
M	i got an excellent deal on my regular hotel in london .
M	was cheaper_than going direct with the hotel itself .
M	unlike most bingo rooms , they have new and fun promotions every week .
M	they don ' t just look after the vip ' s either .
M	i only spend about £_00 per week but their promotions offer me a chance to get something back .
M	they also do casino and poker with the same range of promotions .
M	hesitant to order as to be honest i thought the website looked a little sketchy .
M	ive been using computers for as long as i can remember and know to be_careful when shopping around online .
M	i read other_peoples review before i ordered and was happy with what i saw .
M	having the code sent through text i was hesitant as my mobile provider isnt always the best but it took longer for me to remember my paypal password than it did for my key to arrive .
M	would definitely_recommend and i will be using again as i got guild_wars cheaper here than it is on the actual gw website
M	i have never had a problem with anything i have ordered online with tesco .
M	every thing has been delivered ontime and also by very polite staff .
M	great website and quick prompt service .
M	very well_priced too , not many places will allow you to buy single boards but theunderfloorheatingstore will .
M	top_marks , many_thanks
M	received our order safe and sound today and felt_compelled to post our feedback on the whole experience .
M	firstly , the advisors in the cheltenham showroom were excellent and were full of knowledge and expertise and managed to avoid the “ pushy ” hard sell which is so off - putting .
M	secondly , to receive a phone call to confirm a delivery date and time_slot in_advance is such a good service to offer , particularly for those of us who work full - time .
M	even_though i was unable to accept the first date they offered they were very accommodating and went away then came back later on with a new date that was more convenient .
M	lastly but by no means least , the quality of the furniture is outstanding and we are over the moon with it .
M	would not hesitate to recommend your company to all our friends and family so well_done .
M	great service and items with quick delivery . will_definitely be shopping with again ,
M	quick delivery , great price and good quality item
M	ordered on 0 . 0 . 0000 and the wrong items sent . it ' s now 00 . 00 . 0000 and i still_haven ' t received my order . i went and bought it from another company as still don ' t know when i will reveive it
M	it arrived in a couple days , and the quality of the product is spot on .
M	i ' ve found no issues with it at all .
M	of course i can ' t expect amazing quality for an £_00 guitar , but for the money i paid , it ' s pretty chuckin ' good .
M	londonmagicstore handled my purchase in a very professional way .
M	they were fast both on communication and delivery .
M	definately worths buying from them again !
M	usually had no_problems spent $ 0000s over the years with supplement_warehouse but lately it seems products are getting sent in damaged condition , as my preworkout came in like a rock and had to send back and reorder .
M	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
M	great company fast_shipping great discounts on all the good products !
M	this company offers a wide_range of flavours , excellent prices for both e_- juice and equipment costs as well as having a very quick order turnaround .
M	i ' ve ordered a few_times now , and on every occasion my order has been sent within 00_hrs .
M	i have nothing but praise for this company !
M	liberty_flights have an excellent range at very low_prices , very quick shipping times , and an extremely generous loyalty_scheme .
M	i ' m going to be using this company every month , and i thoroughly_recommend them .
M	ecigwizard has a very clear and easy to use site , and my item was shipped within 00_hours .
M	i will_definately be ordering from this site again in the future .
M	we booked online , confirmation came through quick , text confirmations came through quickly even when abroad .
M	driver was very friendly and always in time .
M	great service
M	00th / 00 -
M	they are cheap to buy from , they deliver fast and are willing to sort out what very few insignificant issues you may get for example , my pokemon elite trainer box , with was sealed so not card teams fault , was missing 0 booster_packs , they are sending me 0 and claiming them back from pokemon company , fantastic people , bought from here more then once , and will_continue to buy from here , in fact come october / november im buying £_000 worth of pokemon goodies for me ; d
M	spend 000 for free delivery , + i have an account for 0 %_off !
M	perfect :_p
M	00th / 00 -
M	once again a brilliant company , hey help with anything they can , there the ideal shop / online_retailer , if all shops was like these_guys they wouldn ' t go out of business xd
M	i have used merlin_cycles ( amongst other online_retailers ) for many years and have always found them to provide a reliable and professional service and to offer good value for money .
M	i have even spoken to their sales_team for advice when trying to decide which product to buy and they were helpful and honest .
M	more then happy to recommend them .
M	stag_do in cardiff .
M	accomodation in ideal_location and all activities / venue entries booked with ease allowing everyone to enjoy the weekend
M	all these bad_reviews of trustpilot are pathetic .
M	trustpilot allows the general public to have a voice on what they think about other_companies and their trading .
M	i have wrote reviews about mobiles . co . uk and yodel , both not great companys if i may say .
M	the reason for the negative_reviews is because companies that are s ** t are getting s ** t press on this site and they can ' t be bothered to book their ideas up .
M	if your company gives negative_reviews from customers , sort it out and deal with it , don ' t complain because trustpilot is telling the truth .
M	what trustpilot is doing is moral practise .
M	they ' re stopping potential_customers getting scammed / ripped_off and helping companys improve their customer_service
M	i ' m happy with this company , i used them to book a hotel in blackpool for friday 00th_july until saturday 00st july .
M	was very easy to book and very quick as well .
M	the site is professional and compares the best prices of hotels , would definitely_recommend
M	the best site !
M	!
M	ordered my items on the mon , received them on the wed , hassle_free & got what i had asked for .
M	thanks , satisfied customer .
M	i bought a new pair of trainers from sd a couple of weeks_ago , i took them back yesterday to change them .
M	i came_across the manager ( i think he was the manager on the floor ).
M	anyway i asked him a couple of questions about style & comfort and before i knew it i was being looked after by no less_than two of them , the floor manager & his assistant , who went out their way to accommodate my footwear needs .
M	by the time i had left i had tried on at_least 00 pairs of trainers .
M	( i was encouraged to make_sure the trainer i ended_up buying was perfect for my feet )... even_though i had already bought & they already had my money , they were so incredibly informative & helpful .
M	i left some 00min later with my choice of trainer & i know a hell alot more about insoles , low & high arches , gel support , cushioning .
M	the crash course in trainers , i received in sd by this guy , means never again will i enter a sports shop & be spun a yarn by illinformed , money hungry assistants .
M	so i would just like to say a million thanks to these_guys .
M	i didn ' t get the boys names - but as i said i think one of them was the floor manager & his smaller , slimmer , younger assistant were both excellent .
M	thanks guys .
M	this company are pathetic , the most unrespectful , incompotent , conning , chancers you will come_across online .
M	they take your money , then ignore you for weeks on end , then when they eventually respond they make up nonsense stories , as explanation for your item having not been delivered .
M	they simply don ' t care one jot .
M	i still have not received my order & they have decided to ignore me again .
M	i am now writting to the sale of goods_act , to make a complaint as should you : it is your right to make a complaint to the sale of goods_act , stating : the seller is legally bound to deal with the item , regardless of whether they are acting as a third_party , as they are your point of contact - & as such they are resonsible for the items , as you have proof of purchase , which will be shown on your confirmation receipt mail or your bank_statement .
M	i am claiming £_000 from them as they delayed my film shoot , as my items did not arrive on time .
M	i would advise_anyone who feels agrieved to do the same , as it ' s the only way to get ecrater & other dodgy online sellers off - line .
M	& so protect ourselves in the future .
M	i will be repeating this email in as many review strands as i can find - one honest review for each day that my order does not arrive .
M	i don ' t mind doing this everyday .
M	it makes me feel a little less angry at the way they have treated me .
M	do not trust this company !
M	this company is simply a disgrace .
M	their customer_service is a non - starter and they lie about items being delivered .
M	a next_day delivery i ordered , still didn ' t arrive after two_weeks and still_hasn ' t arrived .
M	i received one response saying that they had tried to deliver - not true - we have orders coming in from all over europe on a daily_basis - and always have someone on hand to receive deliveries .
M	avoid at all costs - they are cowboys
M	shopto is an amazing site , the service they provide is excellent , super_fast dispatch , friendly and helpful staff and amazing prices , better then most other_retailers out there .
M	supplement_warehouse is the best !
M	i ' ve been shopping there for my supplement_needs for two years and havent been disappointed with one aspect of it .
M	it ships fast and when you buy in bulk you will save money on shipping and on the total cost .
M	and if you do some reserch of your own and find a better price , just type it in and they will match it and then take 00 percent off of the new price .
M	very quick delivery with no_problems ordering at all .
M	plus a free_shaker and a welcome letter .
M	what more could you want .
M	i would def_recommend especially if you can ' t make it down to the store !
M	very quick delivery , would def_recommend .
M	also replied to my query very quickly and helped with my request !
M	received my order quickly and having been using it for a little while now i am totally surprised at how well it tastes and mixes .
M	the nutritionals are as good , and sometimes better , than the shakes i normally buy .
M	will keep using bulkpowders and see if it ' s a good as it seems so far .
M	would recommend without_hesitation .
M	a great range of products and the prices are great .
M	have used them for about 0 months and no_problems .
M	it was easy to make an order and had what i wanted , the only problem was that i ordered a size too small but that was my own fault !
M	but i sent it back and that was easy enough to get a bigger size !
M	i ' ve just received my first order from hifiheadphones and they haven ' t put a foot wrong : the product is great , the price was good , the dispatch was very prompt , and they kept me updated with the order status via_email .
M	what more can you ask for ?
M	i ordered it yesterday , it arrive today ?
M	was it dropped_off by plane ?
M	possibly the quickest delivery i ' ve ever witnessed .
M	also the rams amazing and cheap !
M	i saw stock of the item i wanted in a branch across the country , so i phoned them to ask about its condition and price and the stock they had left , and they were very helpful .
M	i completed the purchase online and it arrived the next_day .
M	great store !
M	ebuyer is always my go - to site for checking deals on hardware i need .
M	it always compares favourably to physical stores , and the lack of clutter on the website makes it both a breeze and a pleasure to navigate .
M	i have used p0g many_times and have always had great experiences .
M	the odd_occasion i did have a little issues it was resolved by sam very quickly so once again big shout out to sammy .
M	great service you have their keep up the good work .
M	:)
M	matt - comms consult
M	simply_games is awesome , quick delivery times ( quickest i ' ve had from anywhere ) great customer_service , and nothing ' s ever went wrong with an order yet .
M	i switched to simply_games because whenever a site messes up my order , i usually don ' t place orders with them again . but since i ' ve started using simplygames , i ' ve never looked back .
M	great services , great job !
M	i ' ve used interparcel maybe 00 times before - and about 00_% of the time there has been an issue .
M	the latest issue is that they have re - arranged collection 0 times now as the courier didn ' t bother coming to collect the parcel .
M	the email responses from the heads of customer ' service ' were bordering on obnoxious , and quite_frankly , i ' m seriously disgusted with the service and the manner in which i ' ve been treated .
M	i ' d rather take a cheese grater to my eyeballs than have to deal with interparcel again .
M	i ordered am isp decimator g - string from toneworld , as nowhere else seemed to stock it .
M	i ordered it about 0pm , and it arrived the next_day !
M	excellent service and the guys there are very helpful .
M	no_complaints at all !
M	as a young guy that is dedicated to making muscles in the mirror im always looking for good supplements to support them its hard to find good prices on these especially when there are shops like gnc , complete nutrition , or vitamin_shoppe they like to take_advantage of people that are uneducated to the true prices that things should be i catch people who are very out fo shape walking into gnc all the time and i ask why are you going in there the usual response is i want good supplements and advice i tell them get a book and get on supplement_warehouse you don ' t want to pay almost 000 . 00 for 0 lbs of protein its ridiculous i became aware of your site when i was 00 and since i haven ' t looked back thank_you for providing such a great service and great haste to get the supplements i order to my house asap
M	went for a stag_weekend in krakow .
M	chillisauce sorted us out with an excellent hotel , party_bus , and a guide to take us around various pubs and clubs .
M	well worth the money and i would heartily_recommend them .
M	if you like music - you ' ll like this store .
M	all you need in one place with friendly customer_service )) lovely )
M	p . s .
M	hi from russia )
M	i couldn ' t be_happier with the site .
M	my unlock went perfectly .
M	i checked and double_checked my unlock status and it ' s completely good .
M	i highly_recommend these dudes !
M	i had some sites with godaddy and some with lcn , but i found the godaddy site extremely difficult to navigate and support difficult to contact .
M	lcn , on the other hand , has a very - easy - to - use site , and support requests are answered extremely quickly and well .
M	i asked a question on sunday_night , not strictly related to their site , and they came back to me with very helpful advice before 00am on monday_morning .
M	nice flowers delivered very fast .
M	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
M	i am writing this while on hold to yodel .
M	they put a card through my door saying they had tried to deliver when i was out .
M	i rearranged delivery for today but they never turned_up .
M	their web_site provides no useful_information so now i am on hold on the phone to them .
M	ten_minutes so far .
M	i buy from my protein because it is the cheapest i have found , and the protein is as good as any other .
M	my last order was delivered really quickly .
M	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer_service is awful .
M	the last time i called customer_service they gave me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
M	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
M	it took hours .
M	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
M	on another occasion they quoted me £_00 to replace the cds i got when i first bought the laptop .
M	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
M	i bought a rucksack from gear - zone .
M	it was cheaper_than any other web_site and i had several questions after receiving it .
M	every question was answered within 00_hours by jo in customer_services , even including images and additional useful_information at times .
M	i will_definitely go back to gear - zone the next time i need walking or camping_gear .
M	iphone_app !
M	been using for 0 years now and its absolutely fantastic !
M	saved me so much money that i check it everytime i shop online now !
M	so pleased with this company .
M	i got an_email from them and was looking to buy something .
M	had a look and not only where they the cheapest they also gave me free delivery and i had it by the end of the week !
M	the least i could do was to leave a review !
M	i have been using supplement_warehouse for a few_years now and i can_honestly say i dont go anywhere_else when its time to get my supps .
M	i grew tired of the over priced stores i used to get my supplements from and the other online stores that say they are the best prices but then when you compare them they usually equal what you pay in stores anyway .
M	supplement_warehouse delivers their products not only fast but shipped also with care and free_goodies !
M	this isnt anyone from their site making this review but a real_person who just appreciates the service of a great company and will_continue to be a supporting customer for years to come !
M	never has booking a cab been so easy !
M	i ' ve ordered more_than a few products for myself and others at fd , and they ' ve always come on time and in perfect delivery condition .
M	can ' t fault this company , especially for the prices !
M	bought a leather bed and milton dining_set from furniture choice .
M	the items were delivered full , intact and without damage at exactly the time they said it would be ( rare to happen these days !).
M	started by putting the dining_set together , the table was so easy to assemble ( 0 mins ) as most of it was already put_together !
M	the chairs are a slightly different_story , as the alan key needed to bolt the seat and legs on was nigh on useless ( no torque , kept slipping ) but luckily i have steady hands so i managed to get it together and solidly !
M	the set is really nice , sturdy and you can tell it is well built with quality materials , not some crappy , just - as - expensive flat pack furniture made of chipboard ( are you listening smpf - swedish mass - produced furniture ?!).
M	very happy with that and for such a good price .
M	the bed i bought was even easier to put_together , it looks amazing in my room with the other furniture and now i have a proper grown up bed !
M	another bargain and a quality , well made bed ( it ' s been thoroughly tested already !).
M	can ' t really fault fc , my biggest problem was getting rid of all the packaging !
M	;) nice one fc , i am a fan and will no doubt be buying from you again soon !
M	viagogo was a good experience , emailed me before the event with clear_instructions , however on entering the event my ticket wasn ' t valid so i ' m not sure i would use again .
M	edited * can ' t reply below but my transaction_id_0000000
M	just wanted to post here that within an_hour of posting this viagogo had contacted me and refunded the full_amount and offered compensation , really happy with them , thank_you !
M	great all_round just wish you or they could get tje 0000 chevey belair shell back in stock .

M	but still a topp sellet and there anet many .
M	regards jamez
M	so many review sites are badly monitored and allow customers without good enough reason to harm companies reputations with false comments .
M	trustpilot . co . uk in my opinion break this mold and offer a fair system with great customer_service of their own to back up a very valuable service .
M	we had the idea of where we wanted to stay , however the knowledge of our agent at low_cost was excellent of the area , hotel and surrounding hotels .
M	in the end we experienced a perfect break of everything we required , thank_you diane
M	rob dowding
M	great selection , prompt delivery , well_packed too
M	very pleased with the service over the past two years , rarely_beaten on price , and deliveries are fast and very well_packed , a necessity when ordering £_000_+ whiskeys & other spirits
M	i want to say what an absoulute pleasure_dealing_with audio visual online , especially steve !
M	!
M	steve gave me a fantastic deal on the yamaha rx - v000 & monitor audio mass system .
M	i look_forward to receiving my delivery and getting everything setup .
M	i will do a follow_up review once i have it all set_up and tested .
M	many_thanks again steve and i look_forward to dealing_with you again in the future !
M	richard .
M	bought a pair of climbing shoes , they even have an accurate sizing chart , you put in what you currently wear and it gives you an idea of what size you should get .
M	super_quick postage , great service all over .
M	thanks
M	found what i was looking for at the lowest_prices .
M	right , to set the scene - i had this date lined up with an absolutely_stunning girl and thought flowers were the perfect present .
M	sadly this was not the case .
M	now i ' m no connoisseur of bouquets , so i had no_idea of the quality .
M	sadly the girl was a bit more educated in floristry than i .
M	she took one look at these flowers and cried , and proceeded to throw them back in my face before legging it .
M	her final words ?
M	' not even a bee would go near those '.
M	and that was it ...
M	i believe this awful bouquet i received cost me my first choice wife .
M	no but seriously , they were not the bouquet i was expecting by any stretch of the imagination , and i ' ll be using another florist in the future .
M	ive ordered from supplementwarehouse . com over a dozen_times now with no_problems whatsoever .
M	the only thing i could see them improving on would be getting more pre_workout stuff like n . o .
M	xplode and 0 . 0 .
M	just stuff like that so i dont have to go my shop here in town .
M	( much more_expensive ).
M	ive also ordered jack0d and with this websites great prices an fast_shipping i get a great product fast !
M	i bought my guitar and the guitar bag from gear0music recently .. both items are really great .. reasonable_price .. great company to deal with ..
M	was ordering atty , and contacted customer support through contact form to make_sure of some issues - reply was after like 0 min or so and staff was extremely_helpful .
M	after_placing an order , it was processed and sent out for delivery within 00_hours .
M	order was received within the same week .
M	couldn ' t ask more for an international order / delivery .
M	ordered on the 00th , got them on the 00th .
M	fast and amazing delivery rates .
M	i am a student and really wanted to upgrade to copics .
M	will_definitely be using again and recommend to anyone .
M	i ' ve bought second_hand equiptment from a variety of places but you do often end up with second rate gear , with this company so far any computer ( desktop or laptop ) has arrived looking and functioning as new .
M	responsive to email enquiries and a very quick delivery service place this company on the top of the pile .
M	im not sure what all the complaints are about , maybe talktalk is terrible in england and great in scotland ?
M	i ' ve been with talktalk for over 0 years and ive never had any technical problems .
M	phone line and broadband have never been interrupted or slowed_down .
M	ive been with bt before which i wouldnt touch with a barge poll again and been with sky which i thought their service was so slow it was a joke .
M	i would only stay with talktalk and everytime i have called them with questions they have been nothing but polite and very helpful .
M	great company in my opinion .
M	great price and a great service
M	ordered a lumia 000 on orange and chose a free xbox_000 000gb and both were delivered to me the day after i received both dispatch emails and was able to track both to my door .
M	i honestly couldn ' t say a bad_word about buymobilephones . net
M	i have used them twice and had no_problems .
M	would recommend .
M	i received my item quickly with no_problems .
M	amarieze , the member of staff , was polite and helpful .
M	my shirts were properly tailored to my measurements , made from good quality cloth , with double stitching .
M	the price was competitive .
M	overall , highly_recommended .
M	ordered a book from mann ' s .
M	it was cheaper_than everywhere_else and arrived the next .
M	could not ask for better service !
M	the flight attendents wer really snotty an just plain old rude
M	me an my husband an all my family went on 0 so we can all keep intouch for free yay xxxx
M	i sent the phone on the tuesday , money was in my account on the wednesday_afternoon ..... cant get much more instant than that xx
M	had a few questions about the app , answered immediately via online_chat .
M	they always have products i need in stock , at good prices and ship with minimal_fuss or delay .
M	they even throw in freebies and samples as if that wasn ' t enough !
M	having never_heard of the company before i was skeptical_about using them for such an important occasion as my wedding .
M	however i found them absolutely_brilliant in every way .
M	on their website you can follow the process of your order in minute detail .
M	they even tell you at what process in their factory your order is currently at .
M	when you place your order they give you a date your item will be ready for .
M	for me they beat the due date by 0 full weeks .
M	their customer_service is first_class .
M	a couple of days after_placing my order i realised that i ' d measured my finger wrong .
M	i used the live_chat_function on their website to give them the correct_size .
M	no_fuss whatsoever , the same guy from the live_chat even rang me to confirm he ' d got the details right .
M	the quality of the ring is a0 , and the price i thought was very reasonable .
M	i really can ' t recommend this company strongly enough and i fully intend to use them again in the future .
M	great website and products at a good value .
M	it has been a great experience doing_business with supplement_warehouse . com
M	i enrolled onto the sage 00 course to give myself a better knowledge on how to use the programme as it is something that i have to use at work .
M	the course was very easy to understand , and very clear with what needed to be done .
M	it was very easy and instant to get help when needed ( which wasn ' t very often ) and the team answered all my questions .
M	i would definately_recommend the course to others , expecially for the price !
M	glenn perera
M	i purchased a game as a download only and within 00_minutes i had my codes which worked_perfectly in origin .
M	if you don ' t like having just the code , you can also purchase the box on it ' s own or you can purchase the box but ziip will send you the code over email so you can start playing straight_away !
M	i get curious when using service ' s i have never_heard of before but this has been brilliant .
M	i started a subscription four_months_ago and they ' ve never been able to correctly deliver the magazine good housekeeping .
M	at first they were delivering it to an incorrect address , for the first 0 months i contacted them each time to change the address they had on file .
M	they assured me it had changed but then sent it to the wrong_address each time .
M	the forth issue wasn ' t sent at all !
M	they assured me they ' d send me out a replacement issue as a priority .
M	it never arrived and when i followed it up they said they ' d ran out .
M	they ' ve refused to refund or cancel my subscription and said it not their policy to refund and quoted the contract to me , despite them not delivering the magazine correctly on any occasion .
M	terrible service , couldn ' t possibly be any worse , it ' s a magazine subscription and they ' re not delivering it .
M	how hard can it be ?
M	their customer_service are friendly , but offer empty words as the things they promise they ' ve fixed remain broken .
M	they ' ve took my money , failed to provide the service , and refuse to refund .
M	i ' ve finally cancelled with talktalk after 0 years of poor , unreliable service .
M	on their ' upto 0mb ' broadband package they kept telling_me they were providing 0mb to my property , but i experienced typically 0 - 0mb with this dropping to 0mb around peak_times 0 - 00pm .
M	i got all the usual excuses about wifi is slower_than a direct connection , but even wired in my speeds were the same .
M	i can set my mobile phone up as a 0g wireless hotspot and achieve much_better results .
M	when it came time to cancel i received the worst customer_service i ' ve ever_experienced .
M	i called in , spoke to someone and told them i wanted to close my account , they put me on hold for 00mins then cut me off .
M	i tweeted this at which @ talktalkcare picked it up and scheduled a call from a customer_services manager for 0pm .
M	they never called .
M	i called again , got passed to different_departments 0 times , put on hold for another 00mins and then cut_off .
M	they passed me back and forth_between the cancellations_team and the home - movers team , it seems neither team wanted my cancellation on their record .
M	both departments felt_like outsourced call_centres where i struggled to communicate with the operators in english , they could only read scripts off the screen not help nor relate to my issues .
M	i called back and had a very difficult conversation with someone in the home - movers team who finally_agreed to cancel my account , his english was poor and he didn ' t understand the questions i asked him , often contradicting himself .
M	i got my request in to cancel my account .
M	someone tried to call me at 0am sunday morning and left me an answer phone message .
M	i would class this as un - sociable hours .
M	a customer_services ' manager ' called me today to resolve my complaint , again he was out of the country and reading a script in a monotone voice without pausing .
M	he confirmed my account was scheduled to be cancelled and didn ' t want to listen to my experience at all , he said " i just needed to call you so i can close the ticket on the system ".
M	so yes they may be the cheapest provider in the uk , but they ' ve provided me with a patchy , slow , un - reliable internet_connection and terrible customer_service .
M	i recently ordered a new xbox game tomb_raider as they were cheaper_than other_retailers by £ 0 , but it turns_out ordering with zavvi was a mistake .
M	over 00hrs later i logged in to find my order still ' processing ' and not dispatched .
M	this is incredibly_frustrating , when you order a new game waiting for the post is bad enough but adding on extra days because of a slow retailer is unacceptable .
M	fearful the game wouldn ' t arrive in time for the weekend i clicked ' cancel order ' and gave them my reason , but still i got no response .
M	so i tweeted them to confirm the cancellation so i could go and buy the game from a local retailer instead .
M	over 00hrs later i got a tweet back saying they hadn ' t cancelled the order and ignoring my request they ' d charged me and dispatched it regardless .
M	now its the weekend and my game hasn ' t arrived .
M	i regret ordering with zavvi and which i ' d gone to tesco and paid the extra £ 0 .
M	i suppose if you just want the cheapest option , don ' t need your item in a timely_fashion and don ' t require customer_service , then zavvi might be ok .
M	but in today ' s competitive market i find this level of service unacceptable .
M	by ignoring my cancel request and dispatching the game late , they may have secured their sale , but they ' ve lost all future business from me .
M	good stuff for low_prices
M	fantastic deals and will_continue to shop with supplement_warehouse .
M	i have been ordering with them for some time now and they always come thru .
M	fast shipment overseas and stateside ... thanks guys for the great products and service .
M	have been using ebuyer since forever i can remember and they ' ve always been great with everything .
M	recommended
M	very trustfull
M	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
M	as i wasn ' t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
M	i then asked for the full_refund i was entitled to .
M	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn ' t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
M	after making an official_complaint to the airline and writing about this experience on trust_pilot , i was given a full_refund within a few_days .
M	my partner and i moved_into a new house with an induction hob and went to procook to purchase new pans , knowing nothing about induction the sales_assistant explained how it worked , what would work , and then worked out the best vale way to purchase our pans .
M	the whole team where friendly and helpful and the products are fantastic .
M	well_done procook !!
M	( will be going back )
M	i ' ve been really impressed so far , the prices are really low ( and i shopped_around a lot !)
M	and the delivery looks to be really fast too .
M	i would shop with aria above amazon for pc parts
M	fast delivery and very reasonable_price , i ' d use them again with no problem
M	very pleased .
M	great quality at great prices and very fast delivery
M	recommend to everyone
M	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site ...
M	i had no_problems here .
M	paid on day 0 , delivered on day 0 .
M	i was kept_informed of delivery status by email with dpd tracking .
M	it saved me a few pennies so i would purchase from them again if the price was as good .
M	bought the dock last xmas for my daughter and it arrived on 0th_dec .
M	i wrapped it and gave it to her on xmas day .
M	on boxing_day the clock stopped_working , so i called pixmania customer_services on 0th_january on my return to work .
M	i was told by email that i wasn ' t eligable for return as it was too_late .
M	i called back them to complain and i was advised i would only get a repair done to the unit & i would have to send it back at my own cost to france !
M	i spoke to a rep for ihome here in england who advised they have refused to deal with pixmania directly , but they buy through other channels so they can ' t stop it !
M	he also advised me that pixmania would have claimed for a new unit , not a repair , so who ' s unit i would have had returned ( if any ) is anyones guess .
M	luckily for me he sent me a unit direct , however i feel that pixmania have got what they wanted and turned me away !
M	pixmania hides the fact that they are in france .
M	there is no mention of it anywhere on there site , indeed even the phone number is an 0000 number !
M	beware of these , they may seem cheap , but if it goes_wrong you will regret ever buying from these crooks !
M	ordered friday_afternoon , and recieved the packet monday_morning , cant get any better - this combined with good prices , makes this my no 0 netshop for my kayaking gear
M	although the prices seem too good to be true and the website name doesn ' t sound like one of a textbook shop , my order ( quantum mechanics by bh bransden ) was delivered within 0 week .
M	it ' s the indian version ( still 000_% written in english though )
M	there didn ' t seem to be any other reviews of this site , so i just thought i ' d let people know it works , and is safe and secure :)
M	ordered a game and mistyped my address .
M	quickly informed by them , and once i had told them the correct address , the item was with me in under 00_hours .
M	will certainly be using again .
M	i have bought two watches from watch_finder in the last 00 months .
M	both deals were professional , quick and as_described .
M	my only ' minor ' gripe is that the watch information on the site could be a little more in depth - i . e box , papers ( full set or part which is important to me ) but apart_from this i cannot complain .
M	highly_recommended .

M	i ordered a canon 00 - 000 mm lens from mpb_photographic on the saturday .
M	the order was despatched on the monday and arrived by lunchtime on tuesday .
M	the items were well_packaged .
M	this is the second time i have purchased from mpb_photographic and i ' d happily_recommend them , for new or used gear .
M	very good service .
M	my second order placed , it is quite pricy , as my £_000 odd spent turned to £_00 worth , glad i got some discount and posting to facebook a bit more , i also got so e extra from dogehub , thank_you !
M	all in all it was a good and smooth_transaction !
M	i have always bought from bbsupplements uk they are one of the best with various offers , discounts and the best thing is with free delivery the product is in your hands the next_day , very trusthworthy and reliable .
M	i love this website
M	when i have booked my trip to north cyprus pacific was the right place to for the car_rental , they have brought my car straight_away and helped_me to find out every place i wanted to go .
M	it is a very helpful and valuable company and i would definitely_recommend a +++
M	this is really a joke of a company i dont think one employee knows what the other is doing here . as im wrinting this , they were supposed to be doing a wet installation of a washing_machine that was supposed to be done last_week ... needless to say they have not showed up nor have they caledl the 00_mins ahead of arrival .
M	its 0 . 00 pm and accoring to their website they have installtion time 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
M	i was ok with sitting in waiting for them to come all day and they dont have the decensy to even call and inform that they are late .
M	i will never againg buy anything that requiers the " services " of this so called company .
M	pay that extra money and have professionals do it .
M	another weekend ruined by knowhow , ironic name by the way , they dont have any knowhow what so ever .
M	should change name to dontknowhow
M	delivery was great and swift , ordering was easy and i was kept_informed during the whole_process from order confirmation to receiving .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	i saw the diablo_0 expansion was quite expensive via the blizzard store so looked elsewhere .
M	found a key for about 0 / 0 the price on cjs .
M	paid and was instantly emailed the key .
M	will_definitely be using these_guys again .
M	i needed to send a parcel and catherine at parcel to go was very helpful .
M	she guided me through the whole_process .
M	will_definitely use again

M	this site has a great variety of different supplements at a great price , they even have a price_matching where they ' ll beat_competitors .
M	supplement_warehouse even offers free products with orders , products such as shaker_bottles .
M	they have quick shipping and great customer_service .
M	i recommend this website .
M	i use this service a lot and it is hassle_free and great value .
M	i had a message came up with my last order to speak with a member of staff over live_chat .
M	i spoke with a lady_called emma and she was very helpful and polite and . manually entered a few details for me .
M	can ' t say a bad_word , item was with me within a couple of days and will_defo be ordering again .
M	pleasure to deal with and quick delivery , 000_% be buying my protein from these guy ' s . a +++++
M	top trumps , great service , helpful staff , great value for products bought and not forgetting delivery , 0 day !!!
M	a ++++++
M	will be using you guy ' s again !
M	fonebank gave me a higher quote than any other mobile trade - in site .
M	the day after i sent my mobile off , they gave me a confirmation_email and 0 days_later the payment appeared straight in my bank_account .
M	i couldn ' t be_happier .
M	the glasses i wanted to purchase were extremely cheap and the exact pair / design i was looking for .
M	the postage fees were also fair so an overall bargain !
M	i expected to receive the items late , as they were making their way all the way from_hong_kong !
M	however , i was delightfully surprised when i came home just 0 and a half weeks after i placed the order , to find my new pair of glasses waiting for me .
M	the glasses were of an exceptional quality and i literally cannot_fault them .
M	i cannot_fault the company , their customer_service and general services and i cannot_fault the products they have for sale .
M	i will_definitely be making another purchase from them in the near_future .
M	ordered an office desk from these_guys a month_ago now which has just arrived .
M	when i ordered i didn ' t clock the delivery estimate of 00 - 00 days but when i realised i thought that must just mean the maximum amount of time it will take them to deliver an in - stock item .
M	what i now realise is the desk was made to order , but still didn ' t arrive within 00 working_days , it was more like 00 .
M	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
M	customer_service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn ' t exactly happy .
M	the desk itself looks very robust , the main top part is very heavy and is the only bit i have removed from it ' s packaging so far .
M	it all seems well_packaged , so i ' m happy there .
M	all in all i ' m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what ' s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
M	i have ordered form them for years , any warranty problems are sorted quickly , items are dispatched in a reasonable time_frame with the free delivery option and when your stuff gets to you its so well_packaged that even royal_mail can ' t damage it (.... mostly ).
M	prices are great too , not the cheapest but you do get a good service for your money .
M	you can ' t fault them .
M	i made an order on the 0th_march for a new graphics_card , it was about £_00 cheaper_than amazon so ever the skinflint i bought it from dealforu . co . uk .
M	their website stated 0 days for delivery on the product page and the info page stated most items are sent within 0 - 0 days .
M	i waited until wednesday and decided to send an_email to see when it will be dispatched .
M	no reply for two days ( their website says they will reply within 0 day ) so i decided to check their reviews on google only to find out what i should have checked myself before ordering , that they are not the best company to buy from .
M	i also found that his trading ltd name , asm retail solutions ltd , is registered to a residential street which likely means that it ' s a one man band ordering directly from the manufacturer .
M	and that they also used to trade on amazon , but no more which just helped heap my suspicion .
M	i decided to open a paypal_dispute , the dispute process did not allow meditation and went straight to the claim process which apparently means their account is frozen .
M	less_than 00_hours_later the claim was settled in my favour i assume by them giving me a refund or paypal forcing them to .
M	but i ' ll never know because paypal never tell you .
M	i also got a lovely email from the company stating my order has been rejected .
M	what really annoyed me was that if they refunded me straight_away or paypal forced him to then the order was never even dispatched .
M	if i would have waited_patiently i wonder_how many weeks it would have taken to get it to me .
M	so all in all one totally wasted week , i should have just ordered from amazon .
M	next time i ' ll check a few reviews first .
M	easy , reliable , affordable
M	i was searching how to unlock my iphone for a year , i saw many scum websites , but yesterday i read one review about this site , i read and was surprised , so many reviews .
M	and i tried , i sent money via_paypal ( if this will be scum then i will got my money back ) so i sent money via_paypal , and after 00h i received email from them that my iphone are unlocked .
M	when i insert my sim_card i was stunned , my ibrick turned back to iphone , i instantly updated my phone to 0 . 0 . 0 ( from 0 . 0 . 0 for test ) and still working :) i forgot to say that they have very kind support .
M	thank_you so much iphone unlocking team :) latvian !
M	hired a car for 0 days in germany , at the pick_up point they asked for eur 000 additional as i arrived 00_minutes earlier !!
M	just had a coffee to spare the minutes and finally got the keys .
M	looked easy at the drop_off as they just asked for the keys and no signature , no paperwork .
M	0 weeks after my return , i received an invoice for additional eur 000 ,- with no details explaining the charge .
M	contacting the rental_cars by phone & email for over 0 weeks and finally they replied that i have used the car for 0 days ..::: 000 forwarding boarding passes and airport stamps proving the 0 days stay and they are not replying to my emails any more !
M	!
M	anyway , a car advertised for eur 00 ,- ended_up eur 000 ,- with no one to help ..!
M	!
M	will never trust this booking agencies and they are just bunch of formal thefts .
M	honestly i had my doubts about mazuma , but , i have to say they are great .
M	whole_process from start to finish is seamless .
M	customer support is great !
M	always some one willing to help .
M	recommended to any doubters that are thinking of using any other similar company .
M	having dealt_with parcel0go for sometime i can_honestly say that they have helped open doors for my business .
M	p_& p premier plumbing is a local , independent company , the majority of our revenue is generated from footfall in the store .
M	having recently entered the world of ecommerce but not generating enough revenue quite yet to compete with the ' big guys ' parcel0go offer everything we need .
M	we started out sending 0 or 0 parcels on the odd_occasion , now we send out 0 or 0 a day and hopefully this will only grow and grow .
M	parcel0go are quick , easy and a pleasure to deal with .
M	martin , our regular delivery driver is a top guy and samantha in the office always goes the extra_mile to help us .
M	even today , one slight error on my part was quickly and effortlessly resolved and that ' s very rare to find these days .
M	samantha answered my query within minutes and i was back on track !
M	parcel0go come highly_recommended and are an_absolute delight to deal with , whether you are a one off or returning customer , choose parcel0go .
M	it started off well with good communication to say when it was going to be delivered .
M	it wasn ' t convenient so i used the online tools to arrange collection ( a bit of a drive away , but at_least i wouldn ' t have to worry_about it ) - i received confirmation that it would be held at the depot for me to collect .
M	i then received an_email_saying it was being delivered , so i contacted customer care who sent me an_email_saying they were definitely going to hold it at the depot .
M	000_%.
M	it ' s definitely being held for collection ...
M	you can probably guess it wasn ' t at the depot when i arrived ( a 00 mile_round_trip out of my way ).
M	the depot staff told me it had been delivered " across the road , to the people with the golf ".
M	i arrived home and the only house across the road ( who incidentally don ' t have a golf , and sadly , no - body on the street owns a golf ...) hadn ' t received the parcel .
M	expecting a calling_card telling_me where it was , i went home but was again disappointed to find no calling_card .
M	so there i was , no calling_card , no parcel and no_idea where it was .
M	cue another email to customer care ( the phone_lines were closed by now as it was 0000 ) but the form wouldn ' t allow me to send 000 characters ( checked by two different word processor programmes ) as the error_message came up saying i could only use 0000 .
M	even adding the characters from my email , consignment_number and name , the total came nowhere_near 0000 ( 000 i think ) so why it wouldn ' t let me send it is yet another mystery .
M	i got an_email back the following_day :
M	" good morning .
M	this item has now been delivered and was received by barker .
M	if this is not correct please contact uk mail and this can be investigated further ."
M	no mention of not doing as requested , no mention of my journey to the depot , no mention of the calling_card and no hint of an_apology .
M	it ' s a good job i know " barker " as they are the only people on the street who ' s surname i do know .
M	overall , this is not good enough at all and i hope they read this and take note .
M	i shall also be calling them as , although you may have guessed , i am not overly happy with them .
M	most unusually i can ' t actually fault my experience with appliances_online .
M	ordered on a bank_holiday monday and paid for next_day delivery .
M	was kept fully up to date as to when it would arrive on the tuesday and was contacted at exactly the time they said they would .
M	had a phone call 00_minutes before they arrived , they dropped_off our new fridge , picked_up our old one and had left within 0 minutes - really impressed with their communication and the fact they did everything they said they would .
M	only took a couple of days to send the phone in and get the cheque back , jolly good !
M	i ordered my tyres on a thursday , during the snowy times when all uk garages couldn ' t find any to fit my wheels , and they arrived on the following_tuesday .
M	very competitive_prices , couldn ' t find them cheaper anywhere_else , and superb service , excellent !
M	i have used wheelspin on many of occasions for parts for my nitro truck .
M	but this time i called for help on purchasing a electric truck for myself an 0 yr_old upon a recommendation was made .
M	yet to run the truck but am always pleased and happy with help i recieve .
M	used them twice buying items from amazon , kindle get stuck at their delivery hub for 0 weeks ( replacement by amazon delivered by dpd no problem ) then next order couple days ago sent by amazon to their delivery hub at gatwick and disappeared .
M	customer_service talking bullshit like " yes , yes we will send delivery tomorrow next_day nothing , next phone call same_thing tomorrow " order cancelled and replaced by amazon ( delivered by dpd on time messages about delivery time , online tracking extra service )
M	please for your own good do not use collect_+ >>>> ever
M	just have a look on other reviews this service is total trash
M	super_fast way to book a stay , look at location and see the reviews .
M	id recommend it if you dont want to waste time and get a nice place to stay easy , fast and reliably
M	my order was made on monday and arrived on the thursday .
M	very pleased with the items , nice price and still sealed .
M	will_definitely use juno for physical releases again very soon .
M	i was nervous to start as i had no t heard of this company , however they were friendly and reassuring .
M	the tickets arrived very fast and i had absolutely no_complaints .
M	the seats were great and i have already used this service again .
M	i ' ve come_across gamesbite before and after checking a few prices else where i was happy to go_ahead and purchase .
M	having used various so called instant delivery sites before i was more_than impressed with the speed of delivery of my code .
M	took about 0 seconds :-).... very happy .. well_done !
M	being new to supplements and having tried a few products from various places , bulk_powders have been nothing but first_class .... the sales guys are helpful and my order was delivered on time with no hassle ... very pleased with the taste of the whey too :-) thumbs_up !
M	ebay clearly dont have the time nor the resources to deals with issues when they really hit the fan .
M	i am now out of pocket by nearly £_00 . 00 due to a sale that went wrong and a lying buyer .
M	closing account asap .
M	****** s !
M	this is the 0th or 0th time i have used mazuma and yet again they deliver a hassle_free , easy to use service .
M	i always recommend to friends and family !
M	i would highly_recommend supplementwarehouse . com to you .
M	the price_match feature is awesome and allows you to get the best possible deal out there .
M	they were ok on price and stellar with delivery .
M	the lenses arrived the next working day & were packaged neatly with no nonsense and unnecessary packaging etc .
M	i recommend them !
M	vetuk has all the products you might need for your pets at competitive_prices .
M	we like to look after our cat flea_treatment needs , and are able to get the proper treatments here without having compromising on less effective treatments from the supermarkets .
M	delivery is always fast and well_packaged .
M	they had the best price on our tv by a long way .
M	their web_site was easy to navigate and purchase from , and the free delivery was very fast .
M	i ' d easily recommend hills sound & vision .
M	so bought an item paying next_day delivery on this .
M	sat there waiting all day for this and thought ok i will check how its going online and to my astonishment my parcel had been delivered .
M	from having a look round the front_door and checking with the neighbors i could confirm it clear had not !
M	after_speaking with customer_services they gave me the drivers telephone_number and after calling him he clearly_stated he does not deliver to my area and an area 000_+ miles_away from where i was .
M	called customer_services back and they confirmed the fact that some how my parcel with my address on had ended_up 000_+ miles_away in the wrong depot , loaded on the van and given to some random member of the public .
M	now i have to sit and wait whilst a full yodel investigation takes place , leaving me £_000 out of pocket whilst they work out how to deliver parcels .... absolute_joke
M	love the shop , had a couple of issues on checking via_paypal , but soon resolved .
M	much cheaper_than other online shops , would defiantly shop again !
M	!
M	found this a really quick and easy process and to top it off managed to get the game cheaper_than what steam was offering !
M	!
M	so after doing a cople of searches on google_shopping found this useless company selling the headphones cheaper_than any where else , now i know why !!!
M	!
M	placed my order on the 0th_dec and like many other comments on this thread took my money but order status was ' awaiting payment , after contacting them via emailg got an_email back from someone called michael saying sorry and the order will be dispatched right now .
M	that was on the 0th .
M	so gave them the benefit of the doubt and got to 00th and nothing so dropped them another email and got one back just saying ' sorry you should have it by tuesday , and now its tuesday and guess_what ..... still nothing , so off goes another email with more excuses to come my way .
M	looking at all the reviews on here apart_from nicecans putting fake_reviews on here surely this can be reported to trading_standards !
M	!
M	get no response then will be in contact with my bank and hopefully they can help and also southampton trading_standards !
M	!
M	it was easy to use , fast , and effective .
M	for a first time user the step - by - step process was quick and concise .
M	i found a cycling / running backpack from merlin_cycles via google_shopping , as it was on sale .
M	i had previously never used them , but the backpack came extremely quickly with the free delivery !
M	needless to say , i ' ve had an excellent experience with them and will be using them in future over wiggle and chain_reaction .
M	i bought 0 microphones , and a zoom r00 desk .
M	i called gak and spoke to mike , a really friendly guy who helped_me out with a student_discount over the phone .
M	i got all the products on the exact day that he said , and everything was absolutely perfect !
M	i will undoubtedly buy from these_guys in the future ( the near_future !)
M	and will suggest them to all of my audio - head friends ( a full uni course full of them to be precise !
M	).
M	thanks a lot guys !
M	i simply typed in my details and a pack arrived in 0 days at my door with a pre_- paid bag to send my phone back in as well as clear_instructions as to how to pack my phone .
M	the phone itself was , for lack of another word , fucked and they still paid a fair amount for it !
M	thank_you very much mazuma
M	i had a few questions about sizes and materials and they answered very quickly combined with very quick delivery .
M	top_notch
M	don ' t rent from this car
M	company .
M	the customer_service that this company says is amazing is actually horrible .
M	they wouldn ' t refund my money after i have booked a car and went to go pick it up on time only because i had a us license .
M	they were quick to taking my money but when the issue was explained and that is was a innocent mistake they gladly denied me .
M	when i called to explain the situation they were rude and condescending to me .
M	dont rent from them !
M	i ' m so impressed that i found gk0 there cheap , and very quick response time and cheap so i ' ll be deffenty getting more soon
M	so if you havent been to gk0 why not take a look for yourself and see what you can save
M	thanks guys , the service was great .
M	yodel let me and you down , but phoned at 0am the next_day and you sent via your new better courier ups .
M	food was lean , plentyfull , fresh and tasty .
M	cant get enough !
M	great service , and really pleased it came in an unmarked box ... saving cost and not screaming out ...
M	i take protein to the neighbours .
M	not embarrassed but when have a huge box or two delivered people start talking when u have 00 " guns !
M	products good , service great ... use a good dpd courier compared to main rival , who uses yodal who are more_than useless ..
M	came complete with text tracking for free , so you dont have to wait about as they text you first thing with a 0 hour delivery window .
M	bought a graphics_card , arrived 0 days_later fully working .
M	what more could i ask for ?
M	cant ask for better service !
M	ordered 0 new heatsinks and fans for my server , opted for the free shipping , and they sent the order next_day by dpd .
M	very happy
M	this site is the cheapest place i have found to buy digital games online .
M	they have a lot of weekly / weekend / daily / franchise / etc .
M	sales where you can get some of the best games around for very little money .
M	on top of this , they also often release discount_codes to get a further 00_% or 00_%_off most games , and 00_%_off pre_- order titles .
M	a lot of their games come as steam codes , which i do prefer as it helps you keep_track of your game library easier and there is the added convenience of being_able to uninstall a game and reinstall it later without_worrying_about losing it .
M	some games , ( most_recent ea titles ), require origin .
M	a lot of games that aren ' t on steam or origin require gmg ' s capsule client to download and verify the games .
M	i have only used the capsule client once , but i have no_complaints about it .
M	you can also trade in most games you download through the capsule client - when you get bored of the game , gmg will give you some money back and remove the game from your library , which is a good feature .
M	there are some games i ' ve bought on steam in the past that i either don ' t like or got bored with , but i ' m stuck with them .
M	gmg gives you the option to get a little money back for the things you don ' t want to play any more .
M	i have bought a stupid amount of games on gmg since i discovered them and i have saved immense amounts of money by doing so .
M	as far as i can tell , this is the cheapest and best way to buy your digital games .
M	a lot of their prices rival the deals on steam .
M	i have been using shopto for some time now , and have received nothing bu consistently excellent service .
M	their prices are much cheaper_than the high_street and 00 . 0 % of the time cheaper_than other online_retailers too .
M	pre_- orders often get delivered a day or two before store release_date , other purchases are usually dispatched same day and received the next .
M	they send you a little photograph of your order in the envelope with the delivery label on so you are confident in the knowledge that your order has been processed and is on the way .
M	i have nothing but positive things to say about this company and have recommended it to many people .
M	if you ' re looking for excellent value , customer_service , convenience and the opportunity to play pre_- orders a day or two early , then my opinion is that you should buy all your physical games from shopto .
M	we ordered with crampton and moore after seeing the good price and reading good reviews .
M	we ordered 0 products ( fridge /_freezer & freezer ) we were told after purchasing that the stated 0 - 0 days delivery would not be applicable to the fridge /_freezer as it was from the manufacturer direct and it would be 0 days maximum , but that the freezer would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
M	so here i am 0 weeks_later currently having my fridge /_freezer installed with no freezer which was meant to be here over 0 weeks_ago .
M	now i ' m having to throw_away half a freezer full of food as it won ' t fit in the new 00 / 00 split fridge /_freezer .
M	won ' t be purchasing from crampton & moore again , nor recommending them to anyone .
M	this may be an isolated case , as they have had good reviews prior but i am obviously left frustrated with ther service .
M	supplement_warehouse is a great site .
M	anything you need they have at wonderful prices .
M	customer comes first .
M	online staff is excellent .
M	nothing more to say , best site out there hands_down .......
M	cyclesense have been my go - to bicycle shop since i can remember .
M	they haven ' t let me down once , sourcing products , parts and clothing quickly .
M	know their stuff and are chatty , helpful and always looking to go that extra_mile .
M	definitely the best bike shop in the area by_far .
M	made an order almost a month_ago for some bike chain cleaning spray .
M	i chased it up ten_days_later and got a half - arsed email back saying they would look_into it and let me know what was going on .
M	heard_nothing .
M	chased them up again , having to go through social_media to make_sure someone was actually dealing_with my order .
M	got another half - arsed email back saying they were hoping the product would come in stock in a couple of days .
M	over the weeks it has taken for them to source this product , i have had a replacement bank card , so when they have finally tried to charge me , it hasn ' t worked anyway .
M	if they had the product in stock in the first place , it wouldn ' t have been an issue .
M	communication and their stocking system has been seriously disappointing .
M	it ' s a shame because i had previously enjoyed shopping with them .
M	the site was easy to navigate and had all the products we needed
M	found the laptop i wanted here £_00 cheaper_than elsewhere .
M	decided not to bother with the 0 day delivery and went for the free 0 day .
M	ordered friday_morning , took delivery monday_afternoon !
M	would definitely buy from them again , and recommend to friends .. or anyone for that matter
M	absolutely despicable , paid £_00 to have a discussion about the meaning of the word loss and when it applies from .
M	apparently you have to tell the police and your insurance company within 00_hours of the last time you saw an item , whether you think you ' ve lost it or not ... if that ' s to be the case , then the police will be getting a lot more calls from now on .
M	this insurance company on the other hand won ' t be getting any more calls , at_least not from me .
M	i feel let_down , it really seems like they ' re happy to take your money then run .
M	to anybody reading these reviews , please , please make_sure you pay attention to the fact that almost every review on here is from people who have only just opened a policy with them .
M	it ' s very easy to like the company when they provide such a hassle - free and cheap way of starting a policy , but as with everything , you get what you pay for ... in this case you don ' t get very much , not even the cover you think you ' ve bought .
M	fantastic service , great price .
M	particularly appreciated the phone call to let me know when my product would be delivered .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	had an old laptop and was checking out sites to see if i could make a few_quid , stumbled on this web_site .. and im very glad i did .. !
M	the whole_process was very quick and efficient and i was told what was happening at each_stage , payment was made just as quickly , i will not hesitate to reccommend sell your - laptop to family and friends and in time will be using them again myself .
M	after going through our requirements with wiredworx we decided to utilise an ' open source ' website design which meant that as_opposed to starting from scratch all we needed to do was to customise our design .
M	after that was done the website which was created allowed for us to enter all our products and manage orders in a very easy to use way .
M	basically in less_than a month we went from no site at all to receiving multiple orders a day !
M	ahhh yes , that ' s one other thing we can really vouch for - whatever they have done meant that we are listed very highly in google etc for loads of our products !
M	thanks guys !
M	no problem at all
M	i have never had any trouble with shipping or quality of products .
M	this site offers pretty_much any supplement you could need and makes sure you are happy with their service .
M	you cant expect to spend less_than 00 bucks , but if that was your plan , how good a quality of product do you think you would get .
M	very happy with the service and site , looks nice , acts nice , easy to use .
M	as a college_student , this site is perfect and the deals make it easier to get the products i want .
M	i would never recommend talk_talk ever , rude customer_service told my wife to shove it over the phone and there just complete idiots , yes you might save money but pay for what you get .
M	lowest_prices .
M	make_sure you take full advantage of their price_match .
M	very good service .
M	one that undercuts the local retailers on the renowned ' backstreet stalls ' which also charge £_00 + and demand to take your iphone off you for 0 days .
M	very easy to pay and very quick and efficient service with an_email notifying you straight_away once the unlock is complete .
M	i highly_recommend this service not only for its ease , efficiency but also it ' s quality being an official apple unlock which stays permanently unlocked for the future .
M	0 / 00
M	i phoned these_guys monday lunch time .
M	was given good honest advise in understandable english .
M	placed order 0 :_00pm monday_afternoon online
M	received full vaillant boiler kit 0 :_00am wednesday_morning as agreed
M	boiler engineers who fitted boiler also impressed with service & highly impressed with price .
M	as i work on a service desk that has won lots of awards for providing quality service .
M	i am more then happy to recommend the service provided by the tdlonline guys
M	spoke to dianne via live help today .
M	to clear up some queries on a tracking_number that didnt work .
M	within 0mins i knew what was going on !
M	she was very polite and i cant_fault her !
M	promote this woman !
M	i tried this pre_- workout powder yesterday , and it ' s an_absolute beast !
M	in the first place , finding what i wanted was just a breeze because their website is so user_friendly .
M	i had a small problem with deliveries at my end , so i contacted the website and that same day they replied with an ideal solution .
M	having taken it , you just feel totally pumped , focused and totally full of energy ; the ideal state for an intense workout .
M	afterwards i was buzzing from the feeling of having pushed myself to the very edge and willing to do the same next time .
M	i will be buying this again , and would recommend it to anyone_else .
M	the welcome to the website is second - to - none .
M	the design is immediately attractive with bright colours and an incredibly intuitive layout .
M	there are easy to follow guidelines and information that got me up and running with online bingo in minutes .
M	searching for my ideal site was also a piece of cake as i was able to filter results by virtually any means i wanted .
M	one problem with many other comparison_sites , is that to get the best offers i have to register an account .
M	with this site , there is none of that trouble !
M	no_hidden_fees and no hassling registration requirement .
M	what a breath of fresh_air !
M	never have i seen such a large and varied collection of top bingo sites in one place .
M	it was really comforting to know that i was getting results from all of the corners and depths of the internet .
M	i was especially chuffed to see that along with the fantastic sites listed , i could get exclusive offers with the bingo sites through using this website .
M	overall i had a very enjoyable_experience , and also find myself with a much more enjoyable bingo website after my visit .
M	would highly_recommend to anyone .
M	i ' ve ordered several_times since i found this store .
M	there ' s was a shipping error once and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure i was happy with the result .
M	they also included free extras with some of the orders , which is always nice .
M	will_definitely_recommend to anyone who ' s interested ...
M	brilliant customer_service .
M	i ordered ram on a friday and i actually made a mistake on my order .
M	i emailed customer support straight_away and they replied on monday_morning ( i wouldn ' t expect a reply over the weekend ) corrected my order and also answered several questions i had .
M	the ram was with me by wednesday .
M	the ram was good quality kingston modules and worked_perfectly !
M	i ' ve tried every food delivery company in the area and ocado have simply been awesome .
M	ability to pick an_hour_slot = awesome , they ' re iphone apps = awesome , freshness promise = awesome , next to no substitutions in 0 years as a customer = awesome , no_quibble refund for occasional damaged item = awesome .
M	love them , would never change , you pay for the service and quality you receive !
M	over the years i have had a number of items from them and have never had any_problems .
M	customer_service is great , prices are competitive and delivery is quick .
M	they have a great selection of items , i ' m always able to find what i want .
M	this is my go to store for any tactical gear .
M	i was advised by yodel via_email on the 00sep that the delivery would be made ' within the next two days '.
M	therefore having previously experienced issues with yodel i checked the parcel tracker , which advised the parcel was ' out for delivery '.
M	as both myself and my housemate were in , i was pleasantly_surprised that i wouldn ' t have to reschedule anything in order to accept the parcel .
M	however , at 00 : 00 i receive and email advising ' sorry we ' ve missed you '
M	despite being in all day , with no attempt made to deliver the parcel and being advised that a ' missed call card ' had been left in our letterbox ( which once again was not the case ), i ' m still without the parcel .
M	i ' ve rescheduled for thurs and no doubt once again i ' ll be posting the same comments then .
M	this is not the first , or even second time that we have been in all day and yodel have advised they ' ve tried to deliver , left a missed call card etc ...
M	when they havent !
M	we live in a small flat with a door_bell loud enough to rival big ben .
M	this company is simply useless , with drivers advising they ' ve attempted to deliver when then haven ' t .
M	i will not be using online companies who use their ' services ' in the future .
M	to start i had reservations_about sending my mobile off , but these were to be short lived .
M	mazuma mobiles customer_service was simply outstanding .
M	and the most_important thing ...
M	the full_amount originally_quoted for my phone was in my account the same day i received confirmation from the post_office that they had received the handset !
M	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
M	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
M	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
M	to make it hard for customers to place a review really goes against what i feel a review site should be doing .
M	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign_up for additonal services .
M	service was ok . couldn ' t advise delivery time .
M	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
M	not the best tbh .
M	didn ' t install it as website advised .
M	brilliant service , brilliant communication / work effort .
M	would recommend to anyone
M	not cheap but it is convenient .
M	i ' ve just pg0 a few_times in the past and never had issues ( i ' ve even recommended them to friends and family , but it ' s often said that you don ' t know how good or bad a company is until you hit a problem .
M	here is a overview of a issue i have just had with p0g ( this is a extract from the live_chat on there site , although i ' ve lost their responses )
M	hi there ,
M	this is in regard to order number p0g - xxxxxxx , which i have had an issue with
M	i ' ll give you a full history of what has happened so that you can see where i ' m coming from .
M	i placed the order on the 00 / 00 /_0000 with a collection date of 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00 : 00 the tnt driver refused to accept the package as it was not in a cardboard_box ( it was securely bagged and taped however ).
M	i contact you via your live help system within an_hour of the driver refusing the collection to see what my options were .
M	i was advised that unless the item was correctly boxed , then the package would not be accepted .
M	on this basis , i was told the best thing would be to cancel the collection , accept a refund ( i was even offered an extra £ 0 credit if i took an p0g account credit ) and re - arrange the collection with someone_else .
M	so , this is the course of action i took and i had an_email confirmation that the refund had been requested by 00 : 00 ( less_than an_hour after the refused collection ).
M	i then arranged for an_alternative collection via another courier ( actually a man with a van service )
M	it then seems that the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) that the same tnt driver came back to collect the item again and this time accepted it ( without any changes being made to the packaging from the previous day ),
M	this is despite the fact that i had cancelled the collection with yourselves the previous day .
M	the item was the delivered to my workplace on the 00 / 00 /_0000
M	today is my first day back in the office and the package was waiting for me as expected , however i ' ve now got another company wanting to charge me for wasting their time for attempting to collect a package that has already been collected .
M	so a situation has been caused by p0g not cancelling the collection as agreed .
M	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	the customer_services were just not interested , they seem to think that it ' s acceptable for their driver to pick_up an item 00hours after the order had been cancelled and don ' t care that i ' m now looking at charges from the alternative courier i booked .
M	i ' ll make_sure that i , or anyone that i know , never use this company again .
M	paul mccaffrey
M	yes some of their prices are great but my god their customer_services are shocking !
M	i paid for 00hr delivery my item turned_up a week_later !
M	i then contacted the head_office to complain and all i was told is because it ' s a franchise operation it ' s not their responsibility and nobody can be held accountable talk about a fob off .
M	if you can try to avoid shopping with them online !
M	they lied to me about shipping my item by a whole week .
M	in the end i rang there head_office up to complain as there staff in the store on the phone where so rude .
M	this was one of the worst online shopping experiences i have had to date !
M	i ordered a single cutaway electro acoustic + accessory pack on the 00th_december and as promised it arrived on the 00th_december well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
M	this was my 0st order and i was slightly sceptical about the quality of the product given the price_tag of just over £_00 , however i am pleasantly_surprised , the finish and build_quality is far better_than i expected and it sounds pretty good to .
M	all in all i don ' t think i could have asked for more and this certainly won ' t be my last order
M	best price i could find , quick delivery of post pack and transferred the money to me quickly too .
M	absolutely satisfied with the communication , the product quality and value for this price .
M	the shipment took a bit longer and was not initially indicated when the order was made but received notification from customer support in time .
M	in overall i recommend for everyone .
M	this was the first time i used servicing_stop , and i am absolutely satisfied with the service received .
M	the pickup of car is extremely convenient , and its delivered quickly .
M	the service price is also much more cheaper .
M	customer_service is helpful , and quickly responding .
M	only had the invoice a bit delayed , however fully_satisfied .
M	thanks a lot .
M	easy layout and navigation , clearly_displayed items so no confusion as to what you ' re getting .
M	incredibly speedy_delivery , and items in pristine_condition with flash removed from sprue .
M	highly_recommended for any purchases .
M	just ashame there ' s often not what you want in stock !
M	no one can beat supplement_warehouse ' s prices and if the do just let them know at the time of purchase and they will beat them !
M	wasn ' t sure if this was a good idea at first , but since several friends suggested it , gave it a try .
M	overall , couldn ' t be more pleased !
M	:) quick response , and the support for russian titles is spot on , will be using again ( as a matter of fact , just used them again today :_p )
M	people should use this service , it ' s cheaper_than retail and is completely reliable .
M	the fact i constantly receive e_- mails to remind me of what florist company i will never use again is annoying , the one time i attempted to use iflorist the delivery failed at first - basically it wasn ' t delivered at the desired date and time , so i contacted the company , not by phone to speak to a person , but by email , which is also ridiculous , surely the company has an office where someone can answer a phone ?
M	the second attempt to deliver my flowers to my girlfriend also was forgotten about , so naturally i contacted the company once again .
M	by this time the flowers were going to be a week_later than the desired date ( which wouldn ' t really have impressed my girlfriend , being one week after her_birthday ) therefore i demanded a refund , the only thing the company successfully achieved during this order .
M	i used this company on more_than one_occasion wether it was to get my iphone mended or to have the colour changed and everytime they were professional , quick and very well_priced .
M	i wouldn ' t go anywhere_else .
M	can ' t beat this website on price and speed !
M	can ' t beat the prices .
M	i shed 00_% bodyfat and placed 0th place in the natural mr . universe contest open men ' s medium height division because of the great prices and supplements from this site !
M	i paid travelup £ 0000 for tickets to phuket ( from london ) and received an_email_saying that the payment hasn ' t gone_through .
M	i then followed the instructions and attempted a second payment .
M	i received confirmation of payment from sagepay and travelup .
M	the next_day , i received an_email_saying that payment hadn ' t gone_through .
M	i forwarded my confirmation and they said ' oh_yeah it has gone_through you ' ll received an e_- ticket in 00_hours .
M	0 week_later they call to say that they can ' t sell me the ticket for that price because they took too long to process the booking and they ' ll refund the money to me .
M	my flight is in less_than a month and tickets are now more_than £_000 extra .
M	the man on the phone wouldn ' t even apologise and said it wasn ' t his fault .
M	always go to f0 for my tyres .
M	great service .
M	never trouble to fit me in on the day i call .
M	never an argument on price ; just match the same as before without question .
M	friendly staff .
M	clean building and waiting area .
M	no_complaints .
M	where do i start ... 0 terrible customer_services .
M	0 , 0g service non_existent almost since 0g launch .
M	robotic uncaring a damn right rude agents in the filipino call_centre ( hardly tmobile uk )
M	at the end of my contract after being over charged i was promised the overcharge refund between 00 - 00 days ... 00 days no refund , call to ask where it is then to told minimum 00 business days .
M	00 business pass .
M	still no refund .
M	customer_service couldn ' t care less .
M	avoid at all costs !
M	we ' ve been looking for a new place recently and found it easy to navigate all the houses available in our area without having to go to multiple websites .
M	really useful !
M	my girlfriend and i were reluctant to try and book our own taylor made holiday incorporating all of thailand by ourselves until we stumbled_across this website .
M	agoda have virtually every approved hotel in thaland on their books and payments are secure and safe using their hotel vouchers as proof of payment .
M	obvioulsy having thais facility at out fingertips made booking simple easy and well within our budget .
M	i would have no_hesitation in recommending their services to anyone .
M	i even changed dates on one of the hotels and as the excahnge rate was better on the day i booked i was then given a rebate .
M	can ' t wait to go on holiday now and write_reviews on all of the places we stay !
M	have been purchasing threadless now for a few_years .
M	i live in the uk and it always has great service as well as amazing desings .
M	i have found the best thing is in summer when you spot someone_else with a threadless t - shirt - you know they know what you know !!!
M	!
M	defintely recommend :-)
M	i have now used getmein four times - twice to buy and twice to sell .
M	the site is easy to use and if you price the tickets right you can make a little money as a little bonus .
M	i have also found that on the two occasions i have purchased tickets , they have been very last_minute and i have found tickets under face_value .
M	- once for take that - ( not for me but for my girlfriend and browney points !!!!)
M	and the other time for maverick sabre - tickets were half price - he ' s brilliant live !
M	i was initally sceptical , but found that they are part of ticketmaster which pretty_much gave me the reassurance i was looking for , i don ' t think any other company i looked at where you can buy and sell tickets was associated with a reputable online ticket shop .
M	would definitely_recommend :-)
M	unlike some travel companies - james villa holidays went the extra_mile to ensure our holiday was the perfect one .
M	the booking process was simple and easy .
M	the arrival and condition of the villa was immaculate and the holiday was perfect .
M	thanks to everyone_involved .
M	we will_definitely be using them for our next holiday and would highly_recommend to anyone .
M	always a little cautious when ordering meat off websites but a few pt ' s recommend musclefood .
M	orders 0kg of chicken_breasts and all i can say is wow !!
M	they are huge , minimal fat and the price is much lower_than any supermarket even with an offer on !
M	packaging was excellent .
M	will_defiantly recommend !
M	cheers musclefood !
M	i have been using a competitor for ages and decided after browsing this website i would give it a go as they look professional , unfortunately not !
M	i placed an order thursday_morning at 00am which qualifies for next_day delivery however it is tuesday and it still_hasn ’ t turned_up !
M	sent countless emails to customer_service to ask what is going on with my order but i am yet to hear from them not to mention spending 00 - 00mins everyday trying to get through to them !
M	for my first order i can safely i will avoid this company like the plague !
M	worst customer_service i have experienced and if this is how they treat a new customer then they don ’ t deserve mine or my companies business !
M	i booked a car for pickup from cape_town airport earlier this april ( 0000 ).
M	when i arrived at the desk i was told , even_though i had already prepaid for the car , that i could not place a deposit on the bank cards i had available .
M	i offered to pay the deposit in cash or on an embossed debit_card , as i have done numerous_times before .
M	all of these payments were refused and i was told i could claim a refund from rentalcars . com .
M	i wrote an_email explaining the situation and only received a reply 0 days_later stating that i had been charged a cancellation_fee of £_00 . 00 !
M	the price of the initial hire .
M	i aim to further escalate this complaint and would advise consumers to use the numerous other car_hire websites available .
M	absolute_rubbish customer_service ,
M	- they tell lies to customers regarding their products
M	- they hide information_regarding after sales ( things like returns or exchange policy ) from customers .
M	- staff is abusive and even misbehaved with even female customers
M	be vey very very carefull before you buy a product from them
M	i bought 0 laptops ; one in 0000 and one in jan - 0000 .
M	orders were smooth .
M	arrived ontime ; products were great .
M	even aftersales service was fantastic .
M	i had to claim money back from toshiba .
M	unfortunately i lost my invoice .
M	i rang the after sales and they send me the invoice through e_- mail even when i was on the phone .
M	very good and fast .
M	and these_guys are cheaper as well .
M	goooodinternet ...
M	perfect supps ..
M	every time i ' m in the mall or another vitamin shop and come close to buying something i look at my phone and check the prices here ... its always cheaper !
M	i ' ve never had it not be !
M	it ' s really amazing and i recommend this place to anyone who is going to spend money on supplements !
M	and i always get a free_shaker !
M	best place ever !
M	i have been buying my entire bsn stack from supplement_warehouse for over 0 years now .
M	i have gone with nitrix , syntha - 0 , no xplode , cellmass , and atro - phex .
M	they have saved me over $_000 consistently each order , and the products are my edge in the weight room !
M	everytime i purchase i will go with one of their free_samples , shaker_bottles , or pill containers .
M	such a great deal .
M	great technical_support over the phone & tester arrived on time and well_packaged .
M	i would recommend to anyone .
M	just completed my first order and the prices are great .
M	and i got a ton of free_stuff .
M	i ' ll be waiting for a big box to come to my door !
M	can ' t speak highly_enough of these_guys .
M	great products , great knowledge , great offers and free_samples of protein .
M	amazing
M	this company can ' t seem to read sizes or be able to tell the difference_between white and black .
M	very very disappointing , and the customer_service is no better .
M	all done over email , all i wanted to do is speak to someone , but no .
M	first issue was that i paid for next_day delivery as i needed a tie to go to wedding abroad .
M	got an_email on the next morning saying that my order wouldn ' t arrive , it would the day after .
M	unbelievable .
M	when it did arrive , the white shoes i ordered were the wrong_size .
M	i contacted them and they said send them back for a refund .
M	i didn ' t want a refund , i wanted what i ordered .
M	so they dispatched more .
M	this time they were the rifght size , but instead of being white , they were black !
M	no remorse really , they just told me to send them back for a refund and gave me 00_%_off my next order .... my next order ...... yeah_right .
M	never again will boohoo see a penny off me .
M	avoid at all costs
M	great price , got my specs in 0 days .
M	can ' t go_wrong
M	stumbled_across eyewear_outlet when i was looking for some now oakley shades for my holidays .
M	all i can say isthank you .
M	cheap as chips , bset value i ' ve seen anywhere and arrived next_day and foc postage .
M	only problem is that it ' s too cheap not to buy stuff .
M	i was so impressed that i ' ve ordered more items ( boardies , cap , backpack ) perfect for a month in australia .
M	i ' ll look uber cool without having spent a kings ransom .
M	highly highly_recommended
M	item came quickly and was well_packaged .
M	will buy from again .
M	skiddle is a great site for tickets they have tickets for allsorts of events
M	a good site . to get all . your idevices fixxed , even coloured :_d highly recommendes
M	thanks emma , was in a right muddle !
M	great service !
M	great site .
M	easy to interpret
M	i ' m so glad i stumbled_across this site !
M	with a friendly , helpful hotline - they were more_than happy to answer my questions .
M	that , coupled_with the really fast delivery .
M	i would recommend this site to anyone !
M	my parcel went missing so contacted live help spoke to richard_mileham who give me all the information i needed on an_email to progress further with my missing parcel and only took a few seconds to sort out .
M	can ' t recommend the teste more for what it is it ' s like going to mc ' d and getting a milkshake with just water !
M	having not heard of money for your phone my wife was apprehensive_about using them .
M	however they were offering the best price so i went for it .
M	got the free postage envelope quite quickly and sent my phone away .
M	i would recommend using recorded_delivery for security although i myself did not use this .
M	i received an_email to say they had my phone and quickly received another to say it had been tested .
M	i was given a date fro payment which wasn ' t too long a wait and it went in as they said with no issues .
M	tune up is one of the finest product ... no it ' s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
M	unfortunattly moment ' s after purchasing the product with a general offer in the website ( 00 . 00 $), two new offers in row appear to me first through the uninstall with ( 00 . 00 $) which was oky for me not that far from what i ' ve paid but then after i installing the new version i had another offer for ( 00 . 00 $).
M	that was totally unaccepted .
M	t shirt arrived very quickly , was replaced with a smaller_size and sent to another address equally quickly .
M	will use again for all my climbing needs !
M	legends !
M	i ' ve only been into the supplement game for about a year now , but i ' ve been shopping around and no other retailer has as comprehensive a selection or prices anywhere_near as cheap .
M	always has good service .
M	use chemical and juno for my 00 ' s
M	i have used juno since 0000 when my local hmv stopped selling records .
M	since then i have had excellent service from juno .
M	they have not messed_up a single order and vinyl always arrives in excellent condition .
M	i have also returned at item with no hassle .
M	the online music player to listen to new records on the website is also excellent , you can listen to the weeks releases quickly and easily .
M	all in all i think the best online shop for buying tunes .
M	i ordered two_pairs of glasses which took directsight over a month to process .
M	when i received the first pair the arm on the left was too loose and the right arm too tight causing the nose pad to press against my nose causing me a headache .
M	i returned these and ordered a new frame .
M	while waiting on these my 0nd pair arrived and these were flaw free .
M	i got the 0st pair replacement soon after .
M	i could not see through these and the right arm was loose .
M	after a large number of emails with the company owner who refused to replace the 0nd pair and never even acknowledged these were the wrong prescription , i got these back in the post , arm repaired but still could not see through them .
M	steer_well clear and if you don ' t when you do get your glasses and there are faults return them only for full_refund .
M	i can ' t do that because i binned my old glasses after i got the 0nd pair and i need them to see when working and driving .
M	the customer_service was virtually non_existent after it became_clear i wasn ' t backing down over manufacturing defects and all they kept saying was i had to pay more money if i wanted a replacement .
M	they give good prices even if your laptops missing bits .
M	they are always communicating on the progress of the deal and inform you if the price is changing ( and that ' s if they are increasing it not just decreasing it ).
M	all in all can ' t complain .
M	it ' s a nice , friendly and efficent service .
M	the title_says it all .
M	for me they made so , etching that could be very complex very simple indeed .
M	from the user_interface to the communication it couldn ' t have been easier .
M	0 star service .
M	well worth the money .
M	thanks guys .
M	always a quick dispatch and excellent products for competitive_prices .
M	been using them for years and have never had a problem .
M	to keep it simple - i made an order on the tenth of april .
M	it was out of stock but wasn ' t listed on the website ( like any competent company would do these days .)
M	i sit there waiting for ten_days and ring up to get told this information and that it has been dispatched .
M	it has now been three_weeks and i have not received a thing .
M	never , ever again .
M	instant delivery , no_problems with product , all in all a recommended seller .
M	dude you have to order from supplement_warehouse they have the cheapest supps and and will beat any price if you find a lower one .
M	get bigg !!
M	!
M	its just quick and simple
M	delivery was fast and the products were brilliant
M	i ordered multiple desktop parts to build up my computer at home .
M	i was happy with the selection and offers available at the time as well as the price of the parts in comparison to competitors .
M	my delivery arrived_promptly and i had no_problems with any of the parts supplied .
M	i cannot give an opinion about customer_service as i had no need to use it .
M	overall very happy and would definitely use aria again .
M	very straightforward , pick a car fill in a couple of forms .
M	kept me updated_throughout the process .
M	great service
M	brought 0 month xbox_live code and within_seconds yes seconds it had arrived and worked instantly , no waiting no complications smooth as you like i look_forward to future shopping .
M	although i would of liked more money for my phones ( who wouldnt ) the service was quick friendly and hassle_free .
M	i would reccomend and use mazuma again
M	i brought my first ever live membership and found this site extremly helpful with walk through tutorial and reasonable priced u get the code instantly and works perfect would use again and reccomend
M	one of the best places to purchase game keys online !
M	haven ' t been dissapointed with any purchase and love the company :).
M	i ' m using giffgaff for almost 0 years .
M	to be honest the first year was good but since 0000 problems and problems ...
M	i ' m looking to get my pac_code now and transfer my number .
M	my advice to you avoid
M	i ordered underfloor_heating less_than 00_hours ago and it arrived this morning which is especially impressive as i live on an island .
M	delivery was free as well !
M	we called to check this and a really lovely person called us back to confirm .
M	information on what was suitable to buy was excellent .
M	i ' m doing my bathroom up at the moment and delivery for items have been a nightmare and very costly (£_000 in some_cases ).
M	will use them again for sure and will recommend them to anyone i know looking to install under floor heating .
M	well_done !
M	would use again .
M	good prices and spend of delivery .
M	great experience overall and i would recommend chillisauce 000_% to anyone_else wanting to organise an event with minimum headache .
M	it will be my go to website for this sort of thing in future and i will_definately_recommend it to friends .
M	thank_you !
M	i ’ ve used battery_force for a number of years now and i love how consistent and reliable they are !
M	orders are quick and easy with a innovative way of finding your required items ( search by size , type or application !)
M	order confirmation is quick and to the point .
M	i love the way they take a picture of the items you ’ ve ordered before their packed .
M	this picture is included in you order confirmation !
M	as ever , thank_you battery_force
M	awful company to deal with .
M	i have been paying £_00 . 00 for just broadband and calls with nothing extra .
M	i called them up and they told me i can get the same exact package for £_00 . 00 .
M	funnily i have been paying this higher price for more_than a year and they never informed me about this .
M	i ordered some parts for my car a few_days ago and they arrived yesterday .
M	i was a little_worried as i couldn ' t really find any detailed reviews online regarding the company but i had a positive experience myself with no_problems .
M	emails were send to me when the items were posted and the correct sealed parts arrived without any damage .
M	i needed a stylus for my 00s national panasonic unit which was very hard to find .
M	i found it on this website for £_00 + £ 0 pnp .
M	i ordered it on thursday and it came on saturday so very quick service .
M	it was well_packaged and i am happy with the stylus .
M	no other company can guarantee you prices as low as supplementwarehouse . com !
M	they are by_far the best company i have ever_dealt_with .
M	satisfaction is a guarantee with this one .
M	supplement_warehouse is the only supplement store i will shop at !
M	easy , reliable
M	easy to use website .
M	company are great , friendly and helpful .
M	excellent returns .
M	competetive prices on all products
M	absolutely excellent website .

M	packages are often received next_day .
M	great customer_service friendly and helpful .
M	excellent prices and sales too what more can you want !
M	i managed to find a phone for £_000 cheaper_than anywhere_else on the internet .
M	needless to say i was sceptical but i made sure i contacted them after i ordered and stayed in contact to ensure swift delivery .
M	i receoved my phone today and i can ' t believe i got it so quickly and so cheap .
M	thanks simply_electronics !
M	!
M	hj , cheltenham
M	please_please do not use william_hill i won £_000 fair and square on their online casino they then reversed my withdrawel closed my account and asked me not to email them !!!!
M	disgusting the way they rip people if i have reported them for their behaviour and it ' s under investigation do not use william_hill casino you have been warned !
M	!
M	i would recommend hifi - tower to anyone who loves quality product , excellent service and perfect communication .
M	amazing product with best recent technology .
M	thanks for the services i received from you .
M	not only is the website excellent , but the pricing of items is very very competitive across the web .
M	normally i would not go for the cheapest place i can find an item online , but purekit ( webtogs ) are such a strong brand i do not think i could shop elsewhere in the future without checking their site first .
M	in the event , the rab jacket i ordered was too small , but the returns process was very efficient and very simple .
M	unfortunately , due to the christmas_rush , they were sold out of the next size up and instead of a refund or alternative item , they went straight to rab and sourced a single jacket for me - tremendous service !
M	bought the latest ipad & iphone cases for my wife , got them on " free economy delivery " which said they ' d be there in 0 days - was expecting them on friday but they arrived tuesday
M	i was very please when i started using my laptop , and with the speed of service , it arrived a day earlier_than i expected .
M	the quality of the laptop and it ' s componentry is second to none .
M	i was amazed when i researched laptops of similar specs , to discover that pc_specialist were a good £_000 cheaper .
M	i will be planning on using pc_specialist again , when i need a laptop or pc in future .
M	bought a bannerstand from these , great value for money , brilliant print quality and outstanding customer_service .
M	will_definitely_recommend these to anyone !
M	!
M	excellent service best prices good money and they pay quick
M	i was being a pain by asking to collect the gear from them directly as i was in a rush .
M	they said as a one off they ' d do it .
M	they bent_over backwards making_sure all the bits would be ready for me to collect .
M	i am very grateful , especially to jade .
M	a service like that will_definitely make use them again .
M	thanks again , giles .
M	i was only after dome lampost keys .
M	had them in stock and where delivered within 00_hours .
M	well_priced and you get a free keyring !!!!
M	would highly_recommend .
M	heinnie is a place you actually can trust .
M	i have never had any_issues with them and always had prompt delivery .
M	friendly people and great prices they are my first stop when looking for a new blade .
M	this site is great .
M	all the supplements you will ever want in one place and for super cheap too !
M	my son is a huge wwe and undertaker fan , and loved wearing his undertaker costume on halloween .
M	i was a little_nervous making an order 0 days before halloween , but it came back the next_day , and was pleasantly_surprised .
M	thanks for great and fast service .
M	i love myprotein , everytime i order from them its always fast delivery of top quality suppliments .
M	i hope these_guys stay around for a long time , and keep the prices lower_than where i used to buy my protein .
M	so thanks to myprotein , keeping me topped_up with good products and not breaking the tight seal on my wallet , matt .
M	i applied for my phone to be sold on sunday , and unbeliveably the money was in my bank wednesday
M	clear and easy to use website , fast delivery and the best price around .
M	very impressed , highly_recommended .
M	i ' ve been an orange customer for years - i ' ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer_service to being overcharged by £_000 .
M	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it ' s unlikely you ' ll receive a response .
M	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
M	it ' s a sad state of affairs that i fear orange are amongst the better networks for customer_service , so i ' m happy enough where i am .
M	we use waitrose online weekly and our shopping always arrives on time - there are hardly any substitutions and the delivery drivers are always friendly and courteous .
M	we ' re winemaking novices and found the wineworks website to be about the most helpful one out there .
M	plenty of simple advice and videos and a quick response to an emailed question .
M	the kits have everything we need so there ' s no additional expense , and delivery was next_day ( free of charge ) - really impressed and will be back for more .
M	just one suggestion : a new video showing the making of the premium wine kit in the superior kit ( the two items which are promoted on your page when you click " wine making kit ") - even_though the written instructions are really clear , it ' s good reassurance to see the process on video and be able to check what you ' re doing is right .
M	i hear a lot of talk of people buying things from gnc ( the worst place to buy from , so expensive ), or bodybuilding . com .
M	it never_fails , every time i mention free items , my buddies say bb . com offers free_stuff too , but they don ' t say how you have to spend over a $_000 before you can receive a " free " gift that you can get from supplement_warehouse by only buying one item .
M	plus , they have the lowest_price guarantee of which they will deduct even 0 % more from the price if they don ' t have the lowest_price .
M	and don ' t worry_about your order , they have always processed my order the same day and received my order within 0 days ( if not sooner ).
M	if you are like me , i will spend hours searching for the best prices and comparisons .
M	even after the shipping_costs , you will still save money , and then to include the free_gifts .
M	hands_down the best place to shop !!
M	!
M	my first order from argos home delivery was last june when my partner and i moved_into our own home together .
M	we did this knowing that we would need to save to buy a lot of the furniture whilst we were there .
M	so we bought our bed from another company which we had within the first week and had enough left over to order our couch .
M	after scouring the internet , we found the desired couch on argos ' website .
M	we promptly ordered it and had a waiting time of three_weeks , which we had expected and were fine with .
M	my father in law surprised us with a last_minute trip to barcelona and agreed to sit in on delivery day and receive the couch .
M	so there he sat , 0am to 0pm ( as the delivery notes stated ) but no couch came .
M	when we came back from our holiday we called argos .
M	apparently the couch had been out of stock the whole time and even prior to my payment being made to a human on the phone .
M	long_story short , after_speaking to an abrupt , rude woman on the telephone , i received a full_refund and found the couch on gumtree from new at £_000 less and received it the next_day .
M	move forward over a year .
M	i am_currently sat waiting for a set of weights ( which i ordered tuesday and paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for saturday delivery between_0am and 0pm ) which does not seem to be arriving .
M	i tried to use the order tracker , but that isn ' t working at the moment .
M	so i ' m out of pocket just shy of £_00 , no sign of my purchase arriving and they ' ve had the utter nerve to ask for £ 0 . 00 saturday delivery ( the exact words on the website ).
M	i am absolutely_fuming .
M	argos , what are you playing at ?
M	very , very & very excellent deals with .
M	faster searching & great result .
M	very informated to us
M	instant , easily but not so completed collection
M	bought star_wars : the old republic .
M	as i had never_heard about this site , i was a bit scared to buy from them .
M	but i went_ahead with it and received my star_wars £_00 cheaper then it should be and it came instantly !
M	i would recommend to anyone !
M	i am really impressed with this website and the quality of products they supply .
M	we recently ordered a set of bathroom mixer taps from this website and they arrived the very next_day .
M	they were just as_described on the website and fitted easily into the place of the old one .
M	always competitive and fast easy service .
M	guy arrived in mobile kwikfit mobile van .
M	he was friendly and obviously knew what he was doing .
M	he provided an excellent and fast service .
M	00 / 00 in every way possible .
M	the first windcheater i bought needed replaced in december_0000 ( about 0 weeks after it was bought ) as the pocket lining has come undone .
M	now barely 0 months later , the exact_same_thing has happened to this second windcheater .
M	i will have to look out my receipt and hope the store replaces it as i need pockets in my jacket ; however i can ’ t help but think the same_thing will happen again .
M	the pockets are extremely poor quality !
M	i ' ve seen quite a few bad_reviews here lately not sure if all are true .
M	been shopping with dabs for 0 years no they never failed me once .
M	recently my power_supply died and after 0 years the rma must be done with manufacturer dabs took care of it for me and did the rma on my behalf .
M	nothing but good things to say .
M	sorry to hear about all the others that had issues .
M	the product price was competitive and grey and delivery i was amazed .
M	i bough it on sunday 00rd_dec and they shipped my stuff the same day got it right away after christmas .
M	definitely going to buy from them again :)
M	used pay_pal sign out which is was great as i didn ' t have to type in any details at all .

M	- really fast delivery ( came even on saturday )

M	the part was so much cheaper_than anywhere_else and delivery was quick and cheap too .
M	sadly my part arrived broken , but it was clearly dropped while on the way to mine .
M	emailed systo and got a reply within 0 minutes , they sent of new part same day and i received a brand_new part the next morning .
M	seriously great service , definitely going to buy again from them .

M	surfdome is a great company .
M	being from south_africa where i was used to buying surf branded clothing any time i pleased , made living in england very difficult - not to mention the change in climate and the lack of waves at beaches !!!
M	when i discovered surfdome , it came as such a relief and i struggled to keep back the tears !!!
M	thank_you for providing such a variety of surf brands , all in one place ; where my need for surf branded clothing will always be catered for !
M	you guys_rock , and i recommend you to all my friends .
M	sports online ltd did not let me down .
M	they posted when promised and i received it when stated .
M	will_definitely reuse them in the future .
M	thanks alot !
M	i ordered a parcel from drinksdirect consisting of several dessert wines to be delivered to my girlfriend at her address slightly more_than a month_ago .
M	however , after 0 weeks without any delivery , i realised that something was remiss , and checked the parcel tracking link .
M	to my astonishment , it said that the parcel had already been delivered at a time and date when my girlfriend and her friends were still at home .
M	i immediately contacted drinksdirect via_email to inform them that delivery had not been made , and also checked with the neighbours if they had taken delivery of the parcel ( which they hadn ' t ).
M	i was informed by drinksdirect that delivery had been taken by a male , despite the fact that the only male tenant at the address was not present at the time of delivery .
M	additionally , it was clear that the delivery man had not made the effort to ensure that the parcel was delivered and signed for by the correct person .
M	funnily_enough , drinksdirect responded that " the delivery driver is adamant that the delivery of the order was made to the correct delivery address .
M	they have also checked the gps details logged when the order was delivered and they have advised that the gps records confirm delivery at the address specified with the order " despite evidence to the contrary ( delivery was supposedly taken by a male who could not have been present ).
M	additionally , there were 0 female tenants in the house who can stand witness that no doorbell was rung and no delivery was made .
M	there were repeated attempts to convey the message that we had not taken any delivery , and repeated refusals by drinksdirect to take any responsibility for the failed delivery ( by insisting that the delivery had been made despite the lack of a proper signature or any concrete proof that the delivery had been made to the correct address and that " we require any losses or damages to be reported within 0 days after delivery ").
M	during this time , there was a noted delay in responding to my emails ( 0 in 0 weeks without even an acknowledgement of receipt ), almost as though drinksdirect hoped that i would forget about this issue .
M	after a full month of increasingly frustrating communication , i have sent drinksdirect a formal letter of complaint ( dated 00th_march ) asking for either the delivery of the parcel or a refund .
M	it is at this point where there is a clear demonstration of drinksdirect ' s standard of customer_service , or rather , lack thereof ; there has been no response to my letter , no acknowledgement of receipt and no communication from them for 0 weeks now .
M	i am now out of pocket for over 00 pounds and was not able to enjoy the wines which i had ordered for a very special event .
M	drinksdirect has blatantly ignored my claim and has not dealt_with this failed delivery satisfactorily .
M	for these reasons and those stated above , i have made this complaint a matter of public record .
M	buyer_beware ; it is all well and fine if the couriers made the delivery to the correct address , and if someone from your household takes the delivery for you .
M	but if there is a failed delivery , drinksdirect will take you for a ride and will ignore your claim .
M	surprised by the level of poor reviews of ebuyer on here ... certainly does not match my experiences .
M	as the old adage goes , you ' ll only hear from the unsatisfied customers !
M	have been ordering with them since 0000 , a few major items a year , like laptops , tvs , etc .
M	most recently placed an order for a samsung 00 " tv and xenta soundbar with next_day delivery .
M	order was placed at 00pm and i had the goods in hand at 0pm the next_day as promised .
M	in this case the price beat the high_street even with the most expensive p_& p added !
M	i have experienced many couriers being used by them from citylink , to yodel most recently , all of which have been on - time .
M	would be nice if they could give the tracking_details in the despatch email , rather_than having to log - in to retrieve them .
M	i used mk diagnostics for my last 0 mot ' s and service , i always recommend them to anyone_looking for a reputable , honest and reliable garage .
M	i ' ve used a number of garages in my 00 years of driving and they are by_far the best .
M	my car is due a service soon so i ' ll be popping in again in the near_future .
M	my girlfriend really wanted tickets to the beach boys 00th anniversary show at wembley arena on 00th_september .
M	tickets were sold out everywhere and places that did have them sold them for almost_double the price !
M	so i found this website and they had two tickets for a very reasonably price .
M	i had never_heard of this company and wasn ' t sure if i wanted to take the risk , but i went for it and tickets arrived after 0 days of ordering !
M	very happy with the service and the pricing .
M	0_stars !
M	00 / 00 !
M	despite going for the free super_saver delivery , my order arrived within 0 days .
M	more_importantly , as the order was to be delivered to my work address , the packaging was discreet .
M	the prices compared favourably to other internet pharmacy options ( e . g .
M	boots online ).
M	i will most certainly use pharmacy0u again .
M	like all the other ( genuine ) reviews on here , i sent my iphone_0gs 0gb off to cash 0 phones , which was in fairly good condition .
M	on receipt , they reduced their offer by over 00 %, and charged £ 0 to return my phone to me when , unsurprisingly , i rejected their offer .
M	it remains to be seen whether or not i ever receive my phone back , and i will be reporting them to the relevant agencies .
M	please never use this company .
M	had no_problems with that company .
M	received a passport the next_day after embassy despatched it .
M	courier came at 0 : 00 am .
M	i even wasn ' t at home and he left the parcel to my neighbour ( i share a flat ).
M	i think you need to track you item regularly and be sure that somebody will be in you flat , or you can put you work address .
M	very good shop .
M	simply amazing service .
M	ordered at 0 . 00pm on 00 / 00 and picked_up from home at 0 . 00pm same day .
M	this is simply amazing service .
M	will use again and promote to all my friends !
M	i can ' t fault the savings and service i had from blackcircles . com .
M	you ' d be an_idiot not to go with them for your own tyres .
M	i was quoted £_000 for each one of mine and had them supplied and fitted from blackcircles . com for just over £_00 each .
M	brilliant !
M	!
M	wow it ' s perfect to get your iphone_unlock :)) i really thank_you team officialiphoneunlock . co . uk for unlocking my iphone 0 that ' s locked into orange uk :)))) its great job :)) and it was for a very short time , only 0 days :)) i really thank_you
M	have used chillisauce for 0 stag dos now ( newcastle , bournemouth and nottingham ) and they been brilliant everytime .
M	sarah was a great account_manager for my last one and sorted out any_issues i had quickly and professionally .
M	if i am made best man for a 0th time then i would only use these_guys again !
M	top banana !
M	!
M	had a couple of issues over the last couple of days and my experience with their support_team has been excellent .
M	almost instat response and fixed problems that i was unable to sort myself .
M	this is the second time i ' ve used hostelbookers . com and both_times they ' ve been absolutely fine .
M	can ' t complain at all .
M	yodel was supposed to be delivering my phone from carphone_warehouse .
M	after being told via txt of a delay with the delivery it wasn ' t the best start .
M	i received a txt the next_day with my tracking_details and then just a few minutes later another txt with a different tracking_number .
M	i tried both on the yodel tracking page and of course neither worked !
M	tried both contact numbers and as expected just an instruction to tell me to use the website ... which doesn ' t work .
M	like previous reviews i too am wondering when or if it will arrive at all !
M	wish companies as big as carphone_warehouse were not using yodel as they are clearly a cheap option and judging_by carphone_warehouse trust_pilot score this is effecting their customer_service as well !

M	--- 00 - 00 - 00 not sure why you have commented on my review ?
M	clearly a member of staff at yodel trying to change customer ’_s opinions .
M	would have been far more effective if the spelling and grammar wasn ' t so poor .
M	---
M	company does not reply to any emails !
M	i wish i could give 0 - 0 !
M	e & l cycle insurance , eta cycle insurance and cycle cover were all extremely_helpful and i would advise any of them !
M	i sent an_email enquiry to info @ argos on the 00 - 00 - 00 regarding a weights bench and its compatibility with a certain set of weights .
M	i received an automatic reply from them with an enquiry number telling_me to allow 0 working_days for a response ... i did not receive a response so sent the email again ..... i actually received 0 enquiry numbers ( catid000 , arg0000000x , arg0000000x and then 00000000 ).
M	i was told on two occasions that a member of a different department would be able to answer my question ....... by the time they got back to me ( 00 days and four enquiry days_later ) i had the answer from a different company so purchased through them instead .
M	i wanted to apply for an argos card as i was after a new bed , some drawers and i thought whilst i was there i would look_into getting some new gym equipment .
M	i have never had trouble in store .. but that maybe due to the fact that i have never needed to ask any_questions about the products i was looking to purchase .... please do not use their online service !
M	i was using play . com for over 0 years and i purchased 000 items over that time until they lost 0 items needed for christmas despite ordering in early september !
M	i had to call customer_service multiple_times as i had been charged and after 0 months of going back and forth i was told i had to wait three_weeks to report it lost from the day of despatch which was in december !... i was only refunded after multiple emails and calls in which i received terrible customer_service speaking to people who clearly has no_idea what was going on !!
M	i have since been using amazon with no_problems at all and i would recommend their services above play any day !
M	a pain and stress_free process of transferring from contract to pay as you go .
M	they refunded me £ 0 straight_away for a mistake that i had made with not switching off mobile data on my phone , occurring £ 0 .
M	i have never really had any_problems , only minor which have been sorted out quickly .
M	the website is clear and the online_chat is quick and so much_easier than speaking on the phone .
M	they have a good selection of phones to choose from .
M	you were informed at each_stage of the process .
M	they gave me a decent price for my netbook .
M	payment was very quick after the item was processed and checked .
M	i was very pleased with the service and would definitely use again .
M	never had any incidents while avast has had my back and as a web developer , i spend a lot of time on the interwebz :)
M	been a long time customer and price_match guarantee is awesome .
M	i love the free_samples and frequent updates .
M	thanks
M	- d . lee
M	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
