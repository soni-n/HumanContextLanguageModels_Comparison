0	nathan timblin "
2	was a bit_wary given the very low price of the glasses ( 0 pairs ) but as it was turned_out to be very happy with what i got .
2	after being notified by the person who should have received the parcel i sent via ' inerparcel ', i sent a email to the so called customer service to find out what had happened to the delivery .
2	thank_you serenata !
0	the products have all been very well_packaged with several layers of bubble_wrap and i can confirm have all arrived undamaged and as_described .
0	instead , in a condescending manner , she explained that the ring may be loose because may fiancee may have lost weight since it was ordered just three_weeks before .
0	fantastic company to deal with .
2	the customer service was sensitive , helpful and positive .
0	so paid for glasses i will never actually receive .
2	the choice , price , contact and status reports through the purchase process , the planned security delivery and after_sales service , in fact the overall level of service left me impressed .
2	i believe someone_else reported the same experience on their negative_review .
2	lisa & chris
2	what more can a girl ask for .
0	i was kept_informed of progress and money paid into my bank very quickly .
0	sent my phone on friday and by monday my order was approved for the full_amount .
0	the only response i got from that exercise was a request that i be patient .
0	i got a top quality uk product with guarantee , very well_packaged to withstand the modern airport baggage handler and arrived within 00_hours of ordering ( monday_evening - wednesday_evening ), way before expected .
2	no delivery ever transpired - late contact made about non delivery and i asked to deliver again .
2	even if size not in stock .
0	they ' re professional and the website is really easy to use .
0	fantastic company and i will recommend to anyone_looking for an engagement_ring .
2	quick , easy transaction and very quick delivery .
0	however , i sent my phone on monday 0th_july and they emailed me 0 days_later to tell me i would be getting my money on the 00th_july . 0 days from sending is not what i was looking for .
0	everything was explained clearly , with as much care and attendion to details to make the whole transaction go smoothly .
2	on the 00th , the tracking_system was once again updated stating that they were unable to deliver the parcel ( but having contacted the recipient i knew for a fact that they hadn_'_t yet called her or attempted a delivery !)
2	excellent quality of stuff but i ' m just starting out in business & can '_t always make the £_000 order to get free delivery , my orders are around £_00 - £_000 and this costs me £_00 . 00 delivery so there is no saving that i can pass on to customers .
2	i will refer you to my friends and you can count on future orders from me .
2	.
0	ordered bose headphones from hispek - great price which nobody else could get near to .
2	i had a full_refund for my flowers and a lovely letter of apology .
2	having looked at the major carriers websites & ruled them out due to the expense we then seemed to falls between 0 stools , not having enough for overseas removals firms but too much for regular parcel post .

0	i had no_problems with delivery or quality .
0	i bought the amplifier at a great price , and although i found myself with a technical difficulty on arrival , that was due to my lack of inexperience .

0	safercigs is absolutely one of the best vaping stores in europe , featuring top_notch brands like ikenvape , evolv , aw , siam mods .
2	the website is easy to get a quote for a courier service , giving you lots of different options and prices .
2	i was able to track my package every_step of the way .
2	contacting them is a trial , they should know that using a premium number and long hold times doesn_'_t go down well with customers nowadays !
2	everything turned_out so well
0	i was very sceptical about buying from_hong_kong with bad stories and delays with delivery tax on imports ect flying around the web .
0	i then arranged for an_alternative collection via another courier ( actually a man with a van service )
0	0 ) no collection , no response from customer_service .
2	even the delivery driver was professional and courteous !
2	the lens i ordered came in perfect working order , and arrived early .
0	items always arrive in immaculate_condition and in excellent time .
2	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
0	use chemical and juno for my 00 ' s
0	they sounded polite , apparently it ' s because of the holiday so there ' s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there ' s no mention on the site ).
0	that insurance factor is the only reason they get 0 / 0 , otherwise it would be 0 . 0 / 0
2	basically they are not interested they have got the money for the flowers , they dont care how and when they are delivered .
2	very easy to order , efficient service and elegant flowers .
2	great prices - the one i bought was reduced in price , which allowed me to upgrade to the slightly bigger version .
2	i '_ll be heading straight to kiltmakers of scotland .
0	ok correct me if i am wrong , i florist relies on you handing_over your money online and then the order being delivered .
2	they have ignored me , then lied to me , then ignored me again .
2	i was kept_informed by e_- mail about availability , despatch date and tracking_number if required .
0	fed_ex deliver but this was the third time they have got my address wrong .
2	communication was excellent , from first acknowledgement of order , to confirmation of payment and despatch of item with expected delivery day .

2	i had 0 old_phones worth nothing , and a quick email ascertained that i could send these as well .

0	all of those occasions i have spoken to poorly trained staff , who have never once apologised or offered any compensation .
0	sunglasses - shop has all the information you need about your new sunglasses .

0	i ' ve been contacting customer_service several_times but so far my case hasn ' t been resolved , i can ' t cancel my order or get refund for my lcd 0d_tv .
0	the items i have received are exactly as_described , fitting and incredibly beautiful , the prices are pretty reasonable to .
2	i looked it up online , clicked a few boxes , even handled the whole " print these forms off " ( cos you know i dont get on well with printers ), popped it in the post . didnt even have to get a stamp and it was done !
0	thanks so much catherine !
0	not happy & will not use this service ever & will guarantee that my family & friends will not use your service .

0	i was given a date fro payment which wasn ' t too long a wait and it went in as they said with no issues .
0	she dealt_with my query quickly and efficiently .
2	from receiving quote online , to receiving cheque in post was just a few_days .
2	they seemed reasonable and so i used them .
0	thanks catherine for helping me with the courier colletion and drop_off .
2	i thought the fowers were very reasonable , well advertised and i was notified of every_step frome ordering to actual delivery .
2	as i had now been on their websaite again for nearly 0hours , out of frustration , anger & disappointment i decided to hang up for the sake of my own health .
0	i recently_purchased a canon_0d mkii from digital_rev .
2	they didn_'_t even take the money form my account until after i had signed for the camera delivery .
0	disappointment is an_understatement , i am so unbelievely upset that something nice i was trying to do for someone is completely thrown back into my face - they can offer me a refund , which is fine , but it doesnt rectify the situation .
2	my personal experience is that this company offer an excellent product and level of customer service .
0	the whole proses was easy and efficient , less_than 00hours from looking at the website to receiving funds .
0	excellent service !
2	i had a bad_experience with a rival compony and turned to mazuma .
2	my aunty was delighted with her flowers thank_you they were really beautiful .
0	there was a change of plan on the day as i was working from home and i ' m_glad i was .
0	i cannot_fault this company .
0	ok no problem i hope you enjoy your weekend
0	also when the camera arrived it was well_protected in packaging .
0	the only thing i can really do now is to inform about all the situation authorities from outside which will be able to deal with the problem .
0	today was my friend ' s birthday .
2	very competitive but i had some questions about the practical aspects so used the online_chat_facility and spoke to catherine_corless .
2	?
2	very easy booking system via website .
2	five_stars isn_'_t enough to express how good this company is .
2	this was the first time shopping at julesb on line and i must_say what an excellent shopping_experience , it is just great when the correct item arrives , very neatly , expertly and safely_packaged and delivered promptly .
2	rmp - oswestry
0	great company to deal with , been buying shades of them for years .
2	as test i opened a bottle and got my wife to guess the flavour . she could smell the flavour , well that '_s a first for me .
0	i will be buying again !
2	great service , delivered on time .
0	on this basis , i was told the best thing would be to cancel the collection , accept a refund ( i was even offered an extra £ 0 credit if i took an p0g account credit ) and re - arrange the collection with someone_else .
0	i requested it back and sent it off to mazuma instead . they had it the next_day and i had the full payment in my account that day !
2	there may come a day when we all work through the same electronic connectors but that day is a long way off .
0	i ordered 0 sets of the same ones to test the different impedances and the one that was sent back was refunded the same day they received it , no questions_asked , completely trouble free .
0	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
0	it ' s nice to have nothing to worry_about when you are buying your sunglasses , especially given how stressful sorting your holidays out are !
0	i expect a refund immediately , and an_apology , though with the level of customer_service i ' ve seen here i imagine i ' ll be fighting for it .
2	their incompetence and that of their carrier lost me £_000 . smashed jewellery cabinet inspite of excellent packaging and bubble_wrap on our part . what compensation did they offer ????????????
0	thank_you !
0	i placed the order on tuesday , the postage bag arrived on wednesday and i posted the phone that afternoon , email to say it had arrived on thursday 0pm , £_00 im my bank at 0 . 00pm on thursday_night .
0	it ' s a joke mazuma all the way !.
2	this is a really good and unusual buying experience .
2	the website was easy to use with step by step instructions , and everything was available to value , agree price and send the phone in the mail with pre_- paid postage labels .
0	having ordered a bouquet for mother ' s day ( ironically at the recommendation of a banner advertising specifically mother ' s day services ) four days in_advance , i was surprised to learn that the next_day , my order hadn ' t turned_up .
0	perfect helped_me out very much and will always use them
2	the flowers were delivered on the day requested and were beautiful .
2	the boots arrived in time and i was able to finish the walk .

0	i found a lot of reviews and success stories from acquaintances in a photography forum i am a member of and heard of people successfully using the digitalrev warranty when required to i decided to take the plunge and give it a go .
0	00 / 00 , would recommend .
0	the biggest advantage of interparcel is the prices .
0	thank_you :-)

2	regards
2	very good communication and quick payment .
0	the flowers was brown and dieing and not like the flowers on the picture and i never got the bubbly i order which cost me 00 . 00
0	incredibly surprised how well everything went , i was prepared for a bit of a haggle with mazuma over the price of my phone but they sent me an_email a day after i posted my phone saying a check had been posted for me for the exact amount i was quoted and the check turned_up the very next_day , very impressed , thank_you .
2	altogether an excellent experience !
0	you have been warned !
2	you are not intimidated by jargon and confusing process on the messy pages .
2	after looking a various positive_reviews , i decided to go with digitalrev . com .
2	i ordered collection of a parcel to be picked_up on monday 00th_nov . 0000 and had to pay premium price as it wasn_'_t being picked_up from my address .
2	they kept me informed every_step of the way & apparently the flowers were really lovely .
2	some doubts to use this service , but was amazed by the super_fast and efficient service , and the price paid for my phone was excellent .
0	my partner came in and told me she was thrown a box by the delivery driver who was rude and then she opened up to find some small stems with what looked like roses on the end .
0	i spoke to emma on the live web help who had the collection cancelled in minutes .
0	very pleased !
0	received email confirmation and sms confirmation .
2	i regulary send flowers and allow for seasons .
0	!
0	keep up the good work !
0	original post 00 / 00 /_0000
0	they are fast at replying emails and are extremely clear with everything .
2	the day the order was despatched i received an_email and text_message to adivse me my order was on route with the courier .
2	!
2	would have no_reservations_about recommending this company - good to have a company dealing through the web you can trust .
0	not because they had a negative reputation , more that i had never ordered glasses online before and wasn ' t sure what website to use .
2	it is now 0 months since the original order .
2	i had left it rather late to send flowers to a friend for a " special " birthday .
2	i placed the order and waited , but for a couple of days nothing changed
0	here goes , again .
0	i can ' t recommend highly_enough for your headphone needs .
0	- double - check the measurement .
2	!
2	choice of delivery days means i can choose a day to suit , even next_day .
2	it '_s the first time i '_ve used them and i will_definitely_use them again .
0	it was sized as an m , rather_than the j that we were expecting , proving that the mistake had occurred , which i had been told was not possible .
2	he confirmed the above request had been completed by emily and agreed to pass on my thanks to her .
2	from start to finish of process , i was extremely happy .
2	the 000 g duc d ' o belgian luxury chocolates which were paid for as an extra were actually out of date when they arrived .
2	in the end i had to rebook the collection for friday , but because i needed the generator for a holiday next week they forced me to pay the extra for a saturday delivery (£_00 . 00 !)
2	and the speakers look cool and sound great keep_up the good work .
0	first : if items are out of stock and they still charge for it , then its there responsibility to tell us asap .
0	could not fault them in any way , they wher easy to use , quick on delivery and good with payment .
0	great product , delivered super_fast .
0	it was held at by fedex until i sent prof of purchase but i wasn ' t charged and the item arrived the next_day well_packaged .
0	the fact i constantly receive e_- mails to remind me of what florist company i will never use again is annoying , the one time i attempted to use iflorist the delivery failed at first - basically it wasn ' t delivered at the desired date and time , so i contacted the company , not by phone to speak to a person , but by email , which is also ridiculous , surely the company has an office where someone can answer a phone ?
2	i sent my friend a bouquet of roses and stocks , it was the deluxe bunch .
2	ordered on the monday_afternoon , arrived wednesday_morning all at a good value all_inclusive price , easy to use website
0	i am not disappointed !
0	i would highly_recommend the service they provide .
0	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort out my problem .
0	very good prices , can ' t be_beaten anywhere .
2	will use webtogs again .
0	not only this , but now parcel0go sent me an_email today saying i will have to pay for the return of the parcel although it is entirely their fault .
2	not much of a hi -_fi buff myself , especially since the frequency response of my ears has_been the limiting factor , but i do like ' quality '.
2	don_'_t feel that they need ' breaking in .'
2	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
2	thank_you we are so pleased with our purchase .
2	i simply entered the details of my mobile ( make , model ); was offered a better_than expeted price for it ; choose my preferred payment_options and was on my way .
0	i find it quite shocking that we never recieved anything to say there was replacement items , the delivery was late and they have not replied to my ticket .
2	what could be easire ??
0	she didn ' t want to tell me about it and had been wrestling with her conscience before calling , leaving her very stressed and confused .
0	he knew everything i needed to know , and was quick to help me out and advise me on the best possible service for my needs .
0	but they had run out of all mothers_day bouquet in my ( large ) town .
2	i would highly_recommend her , ask for catherine .
0	at 00 : 00 i received a text telling_me the order was out for the delivery , but at 00 : 00 still nothing so i emailed them and i was told at busy times orders can be delivered until 00 : 00 .
0	how is that even possible ?
0	i had no_idea what i was doing with the engagement_ring .
0	i think she is the best example for typical advisors that customers would love to meet when they have questions .
0	we do not offer compensation , we have transit cover in place for loss or damage and if a service is guaranteed then we will refund the shipment costs
2	ordered flowers for my friend and was impressed that delivery was free .
2	the address was slightly wrong 0 the neighbours rejected the flowers .
0	from the very beginning pacel0go made a complete arse of what is there main job !
2	my auntie told me this afternoon that she had never received a bouquet ever that was quite so wonderful and for a lady of 00 + that says a lot .
0	i decided to purchase glasses over the internet due to ever increasing prices on the high_street .
2	i received a text_message from teleflorist to confirm that the flowers had been delivered .
2	got some flowers off them for valentines , they were top_notch .
2	the seller was delighted when i said i would arrange for the parcel to be collected from her workplace - all she had to do was print out the label .
2	!
0	i am now considering contacting my friend from trading_standards who will advise us further .
2	the service and flowers were great .
2	all this and for £££££ s cheaper_than any other store online or in the high_street .
0	great items , with quick dispatch and delivery , many_thanks !
0	i then asked after 00_hours how come the package was not moving or being delivered .
2	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
0	item was dispatched next working day via courier .
2	my camera and accessories all arrived in a single packet that was cocooned in bubble_wrap .
0	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
0	c ' mon !
2	sent the phone wednesday , got an_email thursday to say the phone had arrived , payment was received into my bank by thursday_afternoon .
2	well_done .
0	not happy with the delivery company .
0	serenataflowers are great
0	i do that but it costs more .
0	so in conclusion use parcel0go . com and ask for catherine on live_chat !!!!!
2	everything was just as_described , well_packed and hassel free .
2	i would recommend serenata .
2	so quick and so easy to do thankyou
0	always has good service .
0	drop_off may be reasonable but staying in for two 00hr windows is not acceptable .
2	mindblowing !!
2	instead of a cheque i chose bank_transfer .
2	i have paid much more for flowers in the past , and they have arrived a lot less loved and only survived a few_days .
0	always here promptly the day after i book it or even on the same day if booked early enough and always arrives the next_day .
0	i do not recommend envirofone .
0	the only problem is that the packages sent out for delivery are sometimes too small .
2	emily made the process very easy and my problem was sorted_out quickly .
2	* fast delivery
2	simply the best internet company i have ever bought from .
2	customer service ( peter_chandler ) was superb too .
0	i placed my order sunday_afternoon , and had an_email and a text promptly confirming my order .
0	i will not be using the company again
2	it was easy to find what i was looking for on the website .
0	i ' ve sold a couple of phones to mazuma and have had brilliant service both_times .
0	with a brilliant attitude and speedy_delivery , i would recommend digital_rev to every photography and film enthusiast out there !
0	i wanted to sell my old sony_ericsson k000i phone , but was unsure what to do with it .
0	once the phones arrived the process went through in next to no time !
2	i had a problem with a collection and delivery , richard_mileham was very helpful in resolving my problem and made every effort to help
2	got in touch with p0go via there chat function , spoke to a agent called rose she was fabulous sorted problem out super_fast and was friendly and did not make feel stupid ( which is debateable ) xmassed out !!!
2	sold my old_mobile and got paid all within only a few_days
0	didnt receive a reply for another couple of days !
2	i shouldn_'_t have worried !
2	was going to go for the much_cheaper simply_electronics and boy am i glad i opted for digitalrev .
0	i spoke with emma about my parcel she is very kind and helpful .
2	i '_ve lost out on £_000 plus the transit costs if i don_'_t get them back .
2	so i wait with baited breath !!
2	no_problems with this one !
2	i was recommended to serenata_flowers by my daughter and i would not_hesitate to recommend them myself .
2	i ordered flowers and a teddy for my sister on her_birthday for same day delivery and they arrived later in the day .
2	the choice was fantastic , everything worked and five_minutes later i was relieved to have completed my pyurchase , complete with free card .
0	this is my second order with clare florist - order arrived on the specified day , in good condition .
2	phone depsatched on monday , money in the bank on friday - can '_t say_fairer_than that .
2	would be happy to use again with confidence .
0	they pay very competitive rates in the comparison_sites , but what drew me to them was that they pay the same day of receiving the phone direct to your bank_account .
2	the last tracking entry was over a week ago .
0	would definitely use again and recommend to others .
0	their web shop was easy to use .
0	the website was simple to use and the product delivered quickly and well_packaged .
0	thank_you !
0	n those buds well its like marmite i guess u either love em or hate em :-) good company id recomend shoppin there
2	after keeping me on hold for 0 mins they then told me i could make a claim for a refund and send me a claim form .
0	out of the many_times i ' ve used parcel0go i can_honestly say i have only had one problem , a parcel wasn ' t picked_up , but i contacted them online and spoke to a lady_called amber , she had the parcel re - booked and new labels emailed to me .
0	thank_you
2	ordered a nikon camera lens on saturday from the uk , and it arrived on the following_tuesday .
2	very happy with the transaction
2	had a problem where i entered the wrong detail and required a refund used the live_chat to see if i can resolve this with a refund and was connected to rowan who was very helpful and refunded immediately and gave me a choice of either refunding back to card or as credit !
2	i have used mazuma_mobile before and have always been completely_satisfied with the service .
2	mazuma e_- mailed me every_step of the way and the money was in my account when they said it would be .
0	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
2	it was the easiest order i have ever been able to place .
2	i sent two parcels and both arrived on the morning of the expected delivery day .
0	sammie helped rebook my parcel with in a few minutes , and was very help full in answering any_questions i had .
2	as this was blatantly untrue , and i had the telephone records to prove it , i quite understandably was not amused , but had no choice but to accept that the parcel was now on its way back to me .
0	i could not be stronger in my recommendation that people go nowhere_near iflorist . co . uk .
0	all in all it was every quick and easy to do and if i will no doubt do it again when i get a new phone .
2	couldn_'_t afford £ 0000 + for a powerful pa_system for up to 000 people , then i found the dj00 set_up .
2	!
0	the whole transaction was so easy !
0	very happy with the lens and the service .
0	absolutely_terrible customer_service and well i can ' t really say anything about the flowers as they never arrived .
0	i ordered a premium service to have flowers delivered on mother ' s day .
0	i would reccomend and use mazuma again
2	i found this site and decided to get myself some funky readers and a pair of cheap rimless too - seriously , £_00 . 00 , what had i got to lose ?
0	from start to finish , the process was simple and well explained .
0	i looked around at a few mobile recycle sites , and thought i ' d go with mazuma .
0	excellent service , got the money very quickly and got the amount my phones were valued at .
0	sadly the girl was a bit more educated in floristry than i .
0	i wouldn ' t use serenata_flowers again .
0	my friend didnt know that i was going to send it back so its ok , but i was disapointed that i got no call informing_me of a delivery date or anything and for that i had to send the tv back trough post wich costed me 00_euros wich i doubt will be refunded .
2	on the 0nd i finally got through to be told that the parcel was being returned to me because i hadn_'_t confirmed the telephone_number in time for them to contact the recipient .
2	on only one occasion have i had a problem with a collection and it is then that the service was put to the test .
0	what a speedy service !!!
2	on monday_morning , i received confirmation that the order had been processed and a few hours_later the money was in my bank_account .
0	i saw that someone commented on the valuation ( from a third - party ) not arriving - the valuation on the ring i bought took two months to come in but the independent assessor valued it as higher_than the price i paid !
0	and that was it .
0	faster could be from china .
2	i live on a remote scottish island , so that is no mean feat .
2	highly_recommended
2	as a follow_up to my review on 00rd july regarding flowers not delivered on the date requested and subsequent response from the company that someone from their escaltions department would get back to me .
2	would recomend to anyone and will_definately_use again .
2	i only have two complaints .
0	i received a email 0 minute after they sent me the email_saying the order was complete saying they sent me a payment confirmation_email_saying they transfered the money via faster_payments .
2	thanks
2	brilliant all_round .
2	[_name ] was my ' helper ' whilst making enquiries about the services of parcel0go .
0	i ' ll make_sure that i , or anyone that i know , never use this company again .
0	the laptop had been well wrapped up in bubble_wrap and the cardboard_box was also well_packed with more bubble_wrap .
2	i compared prices and found juleb had the best for the item i wanted .
2	!
2	you simply cannot get these brands at a better price anywhere online & their customer service is 0nd to none , i recommend to all my friends & they even ask me for advice now on what to buy & i ' m 00 next week ahah , fantastic , just lucky i don_'_t live in kendal anymore otherwise i ' d probably be divorced now ahah .
2	fantastic service .
0	quick payment .

2	the live_chat person sammie_taylor was very helpful in answering all my inquiries and ease my concerns .
0	!
2	this is a well_laid_out site , it is so easy to find the flowers or plants i want .
2	the speaker cases and unit have a high gloss finish and look very swish ( i know it '_s a dated expression !).
0	like all businesses , things don ' t always go to plan .
0	not only was it quick but the packaging was superb .
0	i wanted to cancel my order , and sammie_taylor cancelled my order in a second and i got my refund back .
2	i have purchased from a large number of world and uk e_- cig companies but have now narrowed my list down to just a few . safercigs is one of them !
0	ordered flowers on friday for mother ' s day even paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered on sunday due to living so far away from my partners mum , they waited in all day for them to be delivered and the flowers were a no show .
2	i was a bit_dubious_about ordering outside the uk but am now happy to recommend digitarev on this performance and would certainly use again .
2	i am pleased to say that i did not have any_problems at all , and apart_from the initial online contact , i had no cause to contact this company .
2	although he tried hard to use these instead of cigarettes he just didn_'_t get the satisfaction from them .
0	had to contact them as account locked out .
0	please let me know if there is anything_else i can help you with .
0	without a word of exaggeration i saved over £ 0000 buying from dg compared to buying the same spec on the high_street .
0	i ' ve been bitten before using cut - price courier companies , huge parcels " going missing " aka nicked by the driver ( parcel0go , i ' m looking at you ) so was somewhat wary of using another .
0	i had a few questions about postage and spoke to a live_chat advisor ( sammie_taylor ) who was very friendly and helpful .
0	this was broken down as additional taxes and administration fees do to incorrect documentation .
2	no wasted words in giving support , it was straight to the point , a pleasant and personable service .
0	lovely interface , very pretty website and a expansive range of flowers .
2	answered all the questions quickly and concisely - thank_you very much .
2	mark raybould
2	quick delivery , wrapped well and better_than the description given .
0	we all contact different companies to chase orders , change details , price plans etc .
2	it wouldn_'_t have been quicker if they ' d walked the cheque to my house .
2	the phone was found and the police came and took a statement to that effect .
0	arrived really quickly , cheaper_than anywhere_else and whole_process has been professional and easy .
0	registered , input phone details and waited for the packaging to arrive to post the phone in .
0	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
2	yet again some excellent customer service this week from this company , the bigger companies could_learn a thing or two about customer service skills from these . well_done remi and kate x
0	recipe as my items in just over 00_hours of dispatch from_hong_kong to the uk !
2	!
2	excellent service , very fast delivery , very pleased , thank_you !
0	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn ' t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn ' t as special .

0	i think you should be searching harder for this item !!!
0	i have tried to contact the customer_service number provided on the webpage but it won ' t dial .
2	update 00 sep 00 .

2	after doing some research i decided the canon_powershot sx000 had everything i wanted from a new camera to replace my old canon ixus 000is - far better spec .
2	i am a very small business and cannot sustain losses like these .
0	i asked for a telephone_number and you declined me of giving me one and said the same excuse that i had previously heard twice saying ' we deliver the flowers at different stages of their lives '. as far as i ' m concerned the flowers looked like i could ' ve gone to a florists and put them together myself .

0	:)
0	sammie was really really really helpful with my parcels and also has very good taste in programs :)

0	this means that you won ' t be looking at clothes that would take weeks to deliver , and it saves you so much time .
2	my son recommended that i use mazuma and i am glad i did .
0	i have asked for a refund - according to my consumer_rights , if a delivery date was agreed ( which is was ) and the goods have not arrived by that date , that is a breach of contract and you can request your money back .

2	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .

0	so having returned a smashed laptop ( worth £_000 . 00 ) they credited my account with £_00 . 00 ; notwithstanding the fact that i have already paid them £ 0 . 00 for a failed delivery , so they actually credited me £_00 . 00 to spend with them .
2	i recently sold three old contract phones to mazumamobile which had just been lying_around collecting dust .
0	i used the standard two day delivery service and it was not overly clear to up the insurance value on the item ( my fault completely , assuming the claim was accepted )

2	all - in - all , a job very well_done .

0	after realising we have left it so late to send a birthday parcel i went online for quotes and wondered who could get it there in time .
2	the status of your parcel is now enquiry closed - no further action "
0	as expected after_reading all other reviews , there were going to be zero problems with this company and i was right .
0	i am completely_satisfied , especially with their international 0 year_warranty .
2	i have been wearing glasses for reading purposes for a while and i have tried many on - line glasses companies and my own personal experience with selectspecs has_been a very good and efficient service , i ordered 0 pairs of glasses at £ 0 . 00 each and i can_honestly say i was pleasantly_surprised with how good they are and i can say i was very pleased with the whole_experience , let us not forget things won_'_t always go right and there are risks with buying over the internet , so if you are upset and unhappy at some stage , think to yourself is buying over the net really for me and if not go to the high_street and pay a fortune .

0	after_reading the reports they all say the same , if the courier delivers all is good .
0	upon_receipt of the text alert , i immediately tried to make contact with your company and found it extremely frustrating that there was no telephone_number available .
2	i have often sent flowers and this is the first time that i have come_across a company that has failed to deliver .
2	i ordered my flowers to be delivered to a hospital ward just before_xmas .
2	[_name ] was very helpful and enabled_me to send my parcel with no_problems
0	if you ' re having doubts do not worry at all , the most professional and friendly online shopping_experience i have ever had .
0	quickly resolved the issue
0	it was a great purchase and job well_done by digitalrev , excellent in all departments from the point i placed the order , to the point i received my purchase .
2	visited yesterday as wanted some fresh_meat from the butcher dept .
2	i have been using interparcel for some time now and thought it was about time i posted a review .
0	0_stars , well_done mazumamobile
0	i couldnt fault them on there service or how easy the website was to use .
0	at first i was a bit_worried as it was coming from_hong_kong but the delivery was super_fast , i had ordered it late on a thursday_evening and it was delivered the monday_morning .
0	a real credit to p0g customer_service should be like this .
2	bonus .
2	i would recommend this service to anyone_thinking of trading in their old_mobile_phone
0	finally after two_weeks i recieved a generated message which must be sent to all saying they are sorry and value customer feedback ( which they dont ) i replied to this message again saying how i am not happy both with the deleivery date , the flowers , their service , basically everything about them !
0	sent the phone on the saturday , and the money was in my account on monday !
2	i was very pleased with my experience .
2	very fast response , very concise_instructions and very speedy payment from them put straight into my bank_account within 0 days of posting them my phone .
0	really bad_experience - would not recommend or use again .
0	the delivery girl was knocking on my door by 0pm !
0	i would definitely_recommend to anyone .
0	no response to my emails , or telephone_calls .
2	thinking it was empty , i bought the cartridges with it .
0	!
2	emailed again and asked for a refund , they are sending me a cheque for £ 0 . 00 !
0	- the website was easy to use
2	print labels
2	the flowers that did arrive were not the best quality and looks as if they will only last a few_days .
2	from the moment you order you can track your goods and the delivery is so speedy !
2	they also said they turn off their telephones at 0pm so cannot investigate anything until the following_day !
0	to start i had reservations_about sending my mobile off , but these were to be short lived .
0	' please_accept my apologies for the damages caused to your goods and any inconvenience this matter may have caused you thus_far .
2	as with my other sales to this company , everything_went_smoothly , so i didn ’ t get any
2	when the order was delieved to the recipient i again received an_email and text messge to advise .
2	no need to pay to return the items , they just knock a few_quid off your refund .
0	i will not recomend this company !
0	they sent me an envelope , i popped the phone into it and posted it to them .
2	i love their nail polish and all nail gems and nail stickers which are incredibly good value for money .
2	many_thanks for putting some sunshine back into my evening
2	straight_forward simple service
2	excellent fast service with full valuation paid .
2	the quote for the phones , done in seconds , downloaded and printed out the paperwork , again easy to follow_instructions , sent phones off and received the money within 0 days direct into my bank .
2	it was easy to assemble and even has a remote_control .
0	my good lady loved the ring and said ' yes ' so all is good .
0	not collected on the day it was booked , and they told me my guarantee comes in only when the goods are collected .
2	excellent service ; picked_up and delivered as promised
0	my queries were resolved asap and i have saved a lot of money on phone_calls .
2	lg g0 mobile_phone ordered 00th_december in the afternoon and arrived morning of the 00rd in perfect_condition .
0	happy to deal with this company again .
2	when i first ordered my product from this company everything was well_done , from the order process , packing of my item to delivery .
0	the first thing they do is blame it onto the florist .
0	you ' d be hard pressed to find similar service elsewhere .
0	the only negative with the delivery is that my message said ' the flowers have been delivered and left securely at the front of the property ', i . e .
2	the whole_thing is laughable .
2	watch out royal_mail , you are getting too gready and will price yourself out of the market !
0	in general i can highly_recommend digitalrev .
0	and had it not been broken and still in working order would have only been valued at a mere £ 0 . 00 !
2	i informed them that this was unacceptable and that as the address was a business premises delivery after 0 . 00pm was a waste of time as my client , would have probably not been available .
0	hopefully all the hard work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
2	allowing for the weekend , the package arrived on the tuesday .
0	i will never use their awful service again and urge you to do the same .
0	once the flowers opened they were beautiful !
0	ordered at 0 . 00pm on 00 / 00 and picked_up from home at 0 . 00pm same day .
0	i immediately contacted them about it and its been two_weeks and still i have yet to receive my payment back !
0	my mother lives a few_hundred miles_away so iflorist ' s delivery service seemed like a great idea - a combo of flowers , chocolates and cards with guaranteed delivery by mothers_day .
0	then i found this website .
2	unfortunately another courier collected my parcel by mistake and wasn_'_t noticed until ups turned_up .
2	* you are kept_informed every_step of the way by their own and dhl '_s tracking systems .
0	the only flaw that i found was that the imist , awesome as it is , does leak a tiny_bit so i found that i was using more liquid than i should have , but i was walking for 0 hours a day with it in my pocket , so that was probably a contributing factor .
2	short of someone popping round with the cash , it '_s hard to see how the service could have been any better .
2	no compensation , no telephone_number to ring on website , web_site very misleading .
2	thank_you diane you deserve that vodka & tonic .
0	i spoke with stephane this evening to help me find where my local drop_off points are , she was quick and effective in answer all my questions .
0	then at 0pm i received a text_saying that they had been delivered , but they was badly delivered 0 hours before .
2	look no further .

0	i ' ve been shopping at chemical for years now .
0	a ***
0	anthony hickman
0	they send it back saying its faulty .
0	if you come to buxton make_sure you visit this lovely shop :-)
2	they fit like a glove , in fact i will be walking out in the peaks this coming week - end .
0	i logged a ticket reporting the issue and then escalated , but no action was taken .
0	its a busy time of the year and although ive been in all day .
2	interparcel refused to refund any part of the £_000 irregardless of the fact that the parcel had only traveled from bolton to interparcel quoting their t &_c '_s .
0	i ' ll definitely use this service again , thank_you !
0	i tried to contact them online but online_chat just brought me through to logging a complaint .
0	been using this service for quite a while now and very rarely have any_problems .
0	these_guys made me feel_like one of the family !
2	easy efficient booking procedure backed_up by on - time service !
2	my wife broke bones in both her feet and was unable to try the boots on again before the expiry of the normal returns date .
0	the service and quality of your products is 0nd to none and we will_definately be back !
0	very trustfull
2	the sandals are exactly as they were described , and i am_delighted with them and with the level of service .
0	i sell a used blackberry 0000 for £_00 which is reasonable given the speedy process in mazuma
2	well_done !!
0	will use again and promote to all my friends !
0	what is completely_unacceptable is that interparcel sell a service which they have no_intention or method of fulfilling .
0	i wouldn ' t spend my money anywhere_else .
2	my headphones were dispatched quickly and well_packaged .
0	0 .
2	the online website application is a piece of cake , the offers are very fair and you get the the confirmation and return envelope within 0 working_days and the cheque within 0 days every time !
0	they tell us on the phone if we supply an e_- mail address and telephone_number they will contact us shortly to tell us how to pay this charge .
0	ive used cr many_times over the last couple a years to purchase clothing and never had any_problems .
2	will_certainly use this site again
2	choose collection time
2	this wasn_'_t an issue however .
0	the flowers were never delivered .
0	plus with the added_bonus of nectar points , i ' ll definitely be using the site again .
2	first time using dr , will now be my go to site .
0	adding various accessories !
0	big_mistake .
0	avoid !!
0	many_thanks !
2	otherwise they offered a first_class service and i would recommend them .
2	wouldn_'_t hesitate in recommending the site .
0	being a guy who_likes to research every purchase to death i checked out all of the online jewellers i could find .
2	keep_up the good work ptog .
2	i ' m going to have another look in a moment and see what i else i can order !
0	i need to contact u asap ,
2	i have used serenataa few_times , easty to use web_site with good descriptions .
0	richard was totally helpful and really reassured us we were making a good decision .
0	after umming and aaahing for a few weeks i finally went with digitalrev . com for my nikon d000 plus three lens ( tokina 000mm macro , tamron 00 - 00 vc and nikon 00mm0 . 0g ) and a sb - 000 flash .
2	!
0	ordered a pair of glasses , however when i logged in to my account to see if they had been dispatched , i discovered they had been dispatched to a totally different address to the one i had stated , i contacted select_specs who deny having my actual delivery address and they they cannot do anything about it , they suggest i pick_up the specs from the address to which they have been delivered which is lanarkshire and i live in crawley . no refund offered .
2	i had a call from argos and they explianed to me it was there error . that was my first time doing a sale of my phone .
2	in this case , the ma strum jacket had a lot of money off in the sale , and while delivery took perhaps a day longer_than i expected , the communication about the delivery date etc was excellent .
2	very quick .
0	postage envolope came day after ordering , payment in my bank 0 days after , even with xmas . emails to kept me updated .
2	as i am having a parcel delivered
0	then , when i got the goods , i also got a bill fro ups , containing_cutoms + a fee .
2	any_queries contact pete chandler , he '_s on the ball !
0	i then wrote to prestige_flowers explaining my upset and reminding them that their website states 000_% satisfaction guaranteed which i was not .
0	i also had a very happy mother .
0	at_least my parents got to see a picture of what they would have looked like and appreciated the sentiment .
0	my mum hates carnations !
0	its an easy to use website , with fast service and payment .
0	it was too_late to do anything so i had to just deal with it and say nothing about it .
2	they keep you informed , the flowers arrive on time , they are fresh and nicely_presented and i no_longer use any other on - line flower delivery company
2	used live_chat twice before purchase , was very efficient and quick , prices are lowest of any other site , i checked amazon , jessops , currys , ebay , and a few othes .
0	sorry for bad review
0	i then log on this morning to see that it is being held at the romford depot .
0	yours regrettably ,
2	very friendly and helpful service , would recommend them .
2	if you have a problem don_'_t be afraid to use this service .
0	received product sooner_than_expected , exactly as i expected it and with good customer_service !
0	life is too short !
2	i have never been let_down once .
2	she tried them on briefly on christmas day , thought they were great , but wanted to try them again as she suspected they might be a little small .
0	despite the fact that i sent my phone off a bit late , and that it had some minor_scratches on the screen , mazuma still paid me very promptly in full .
0	i cannot call as there is no number , and i have no calling_card ?!
0	as it was being shipped from hk , i expected more of a wait to be honest , but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it so quickly .
0	i asked 0 times to actually speak to a manager and was told they could not give me their numbers out , so i asked for the email address of the md and i was told he did not have one .
2	i then submitted my request , and the pack came very quickly .
2	this was more than first_class
0	i cheekily sold my 0s the day before the announcement of the 0 and even after the prices dropped , they paid the higher amount when i sent my phone in 00 days_later .
0	0 starts for her !
0	the budget range is brilliant , and most pairs i ' ve had i ' ve worn everyday for a year plus .
2	0 *****
0	the whole service was great - really , really easy , i was very pleased with the amount of money i received for my phone and the bank_transfer was quick and completely hassle_free .
0	they sent me the bag and documentation within a day .
0	the dress arrived carefully_packaged and i was immediately contacted by a customer_services rep to be sure i was happy with my purchase .
2	i emailed again and then rang them myself .
2	i had previously telephoned tnt who as i thought had no details of me or the address where the item was due to be collected from .
2	they would give me no refund , and said i should send in a complaint which would go to the lady i was speaking to on the phone as she was head of customer_services , so what is the point of that ?.
2	product sound and an extra plus came with video software which is the reason_why i bought it .
2	i have been requesting reimbuirsement for the appalling bouquet sent to my mother in belgium since the 00th_december_0000 .
2	i have used many ebay shops over the years but i have to admit hifi_tower is the very best .
2	( although if it named and shamed iflorist to a wider public , it would be well - spent .)
2	the price is excellent as it was a good £ 0 + cheaper_than royal_mail and you knew when it would be delivered .
0	gave me a great price for my old phone .
0	the item come very quick seeing as i ordered it at the weekend
2	brilliant value , brilliant choice and brilliant service .
0	when i proposed my fiancee was blown_away and said it was the most beautiful ring she had ever_seen .
0	such a fast service so so so surprised .
2	the on line chat and help service is highly_recommended , especially if all the staff are as helpful and efficient as catherine .
0	i opperate a small business and have been running an ebay shop for a little while now .
0	i ordered a canon ef 00 -_000mm l from digitalrev and was more_than impressed with how quickly it got here .
2	thank_you .
0	quick collection and delivery
0	i needn ' t have had any concerns at all !
0	delivery driver very friendly too , which was refreshing !
2	when i decided to sell my old iphone , i was a little_wary as it was the first time i ' d tried this sort of sale .
0	there was no paper manual , but you get a link to an online version .
0	it was in transit to leeds and the last scan is showing it has been received at leeds .
2	i was connected to emily who very quickly re arranged my collection with a courier who did not need a label .
2	will_definitely have no_hesitation in using the company again and will be recommending them to everyone i can .
0	that was until today when ashley was able to sort out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
2	i have been using arenaflowers . com for a number of years to send flowers and gifts to my relatives in england .
2	just had a telephone_call from her to say ' thank_you so much ' for the gorgeous flowers , they came in excellent condition complete with foil and a ribbon , she just burst into tears when she took delivery of her flowers .
0	make the process of cancelling an order very easy and stress_free .
0	i did contact serenata_flowers and they asked for images which i couldn ' t provide ( they basically got hidden behind a curtain out of embarrassment and i definitely didn ' t want to insult our parents by handing out such a crappy bunch of flowers and i didn ' t want to take them home with me either .
0	very good service .
2	all paperwork sent to me with bag to send off the phone with clear_instructions .
2	so upsetting and stressful for my mum and me .
2	quick transaction .
2	in summary a very nice unit at a very good price .
0	good prices and quick delivery you cannot beat this service !
0	would recommend a *
0	replied to my email within the hour !
0	the delivery is usually fast and efficient , easy check out service , great range of the latest music software etc , overall 0 out of 0 for the reasons stated above .
0	** interparcel ** says :
2	friday i had the prepaid bag .
0	i received frequent emails detailing the status of order including delivery tracking_information .
0	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
2	first time i had ever ordered flowers on line , i couldnt_believe_how quick they were delivered they brought a smile to my mums face especially the heart what i purchased to go on them i thought the price was very reasonable and will be using them again in the future .
2	the service is extremely reliable and quick and pleases me because i ' m ordering from several thousand miles_away .
2	so much_nicer to be able to put in the details online and then decide which courier service i wanted to use - all options and prices available , from the cheapest economy to the most expensive , with at_least six different courier companies within the uk !
2	and the best thing is that it arrived in only seven ( 0 ) days .
2	found the product required on line , cheapest including delivery was hispek , ordered online , arrived before the stated date , spot on what more can you say .
0	they still_havent got back to me .
0	i want to put in a formal_complaint for the flowers that were delivered , i probably would have got a better service from morrisons ,!!!
0	needless to say this would never put me off using parcel0go .
0	i have used parcel0go for a while now , great prices and normally a good service .
2	i must_admit - i was a bit_worried_about using a new service - i needn_'_t have been .
2	posted my fone off sunday wednesday funds were in my account fabulous !!!
0	quick response to my email enquiry , and very friendly tone .
2	good flowers delivered on time .
0	i shall now be reporting them to the office of fair_trading for misleading marketing .
0	sent the phone off on tuesday and the money was in my account on wednesday .
2	my recent transaction with mazuma went without a hitch and in superfast time , i can highly_recommend and will_certainly be using the service again .
0	in short , i had to return item to digitalrev .
0	the roses were wilting with the head of one completely removed , the foliage was riddled with holes and chunks missing and remaining flowers looked dismal .
0	i have been insulted at every_stage by parcel0go and frankly the latest one of adding £_00 . 00 to a pre_- pay account is the final_straw , for the sake of good manners i won ’ t put into words what they can do with it !
2	darren is one of the most honest and helpful people you could possibly meet .
2	i send bulky items , but not often enough to justify an account with the big courier companies .
2	after receiving them within a week , my dad was up and running .
2	the only_downside is the transport costs are a bit high .
2	hope my mum likes them . a surprise for her 00th_birthday !
2	as i say - it is a pleasure to use p0g !
2	i sent a number of old_mobiles off using the printable labels .
0	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2	bought after posting on the hi_fi headphones expert forum .
0	thanks andrea !!
0	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have another parcel being delivered by dpd for today and during the tracking process , i ' ve just noticed the " follow my parcel " section and i love it !
0	however love the touch of adding the website to download one in english .
0	highly_reccomended
0	the next_day i had the money in my account !
2	fantastic service well_done rose from bolton
0	i definitely do not like the way how they scare you with insurance .
2	daniel knows his stuff .
0	i would recommend these_guys any day !
0	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
0	i have used others ([ external reference ], [_external reference ],[ external reference ]) and they are all absolutely_useless with no customer care at all !!
2	step by step guidance , range of choices , low_prices to compare between carriers and their options , something to bear in mind with christmas coming up .
0	i was emailed when they had received the phone and payment was transferred into my account the same day .
2	i am changing my review score and adding these additional comments due to the following events , tnt finally arrived with my equipment , they were wholly responsible for the error and problems and had to be held accountable .
2	roy tucker
0	definatly going to use again and referred all my friends
2	excellent service will be using again .
2	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
2	how else can the customer be sure the item he ordered was delivered , even if it was over 00_hours late ?
0	i called the following_morning , they apologised , said it didn ' t lodge on the system properly and rebooked for that day .
0	!
0	well impressed with mazuma , sent my phone monday , they recieved it tuesday .
0	it only took 0 days from start to finish and the camera is exactly_what i wanted .
0	i could not contact iflorist through their online customer_service as it said there was nobody online , so left a ticket , with no response .
0	not only did they not arrive , i had to ruin the surprise after asking my sister if she liked the flowers .
0	will shop here til the day i die :)
2	i have no_complaints .
0	it was easy to order some beautiful flowers , and the step by step updates allowed me to be aware of their dispatch and know that they had been delivered safely !
0	i ' m very very happy - just waiting for the collection of my parcel .
0	this week i used the service again and booked collection for yesterday 00th_february and after 00_minutes on the phone was told by daniel that i could travel to the next village 0 miles_away or he would arrange collect for friday .
2	a simple form quickly lead to despatch options and the p0g own service i chose was spot on picking_up on time and communicating throughout the whole_process .
0	amazing bitching flowers
0	i had a follow_up satisfaction e_- mail thanking me for my business and was i happy .
0	very pleased and would most definitely use selectspecs again !
0	i would recommend ups to re - evaluate their ethics .
0	the myhermes driver then turned_up the next_day !!
2	i reckon i saved around 00_% on the list price .
2	my email of complaint was ignored , now i find how many other customers , have also been ripped_off .
0	said they were beautiful and made her day .
2	my other option is to drive the hour or so from my house to their hq , in burnley , and speak face - to - face with someone - anyone .
0	i needed shipping some belongings to mexico and parcelhero came in price comparison as by_far most cost_effective .
2	thank_you for a brilliant and fun service .
2	they send the cheque out very promptly too , all in all , an amazing service , i would not_hesitate to recommend or use again .
0	if you can ' t keep up with the demand state this or do not accept more orders than you can handle !
0	i used same day delivery ordered at 0am and they were delivered by 0am .
2	i was kept in touch by text from despatch to delivery .
0	0 separate calls to their helpline , which_resulted_in being held in queues for over 00_minutes at a time with no answer each time !
0	i will_definately but using them again both for business and personal deliveries !
2	my visa billing and delivery address didn_'_t quite match but you took the initiative to phone me to confirm and consequently there was no delay and goods arrived the next_day - which was good with only a few_days left till christmas , thanks !
0	excellent service and fast delivery .
2	they have my phone number but didn_'_t make a courtesy_call to say they were failing to make a collection .
2	it was delivered monday_morning .
0	even faster_than rm first .
2	thank_you all at hifi_tower for all your good work in making me a happy man .
2	i thoroughly_recommend them .
0	from the first phone call i new that we had chosen the right place to buy my engagement_ring .
2	great defo 0 / 0
0	fifty notes for an old phone with minimum hassle !
0	- i sent my phone of with their pre_- paid envelope and they emailed me to say they had received it the next_day and by tea time i had the money .
2	we are very pleased !
0	they are a great backup pair , i then went and bought a pair of bench glasses for about half the price of what it was in the opticians !
2	i '_ve used lots of nail items from born pretty store .
2	everything was as they say easy to use and prompt payment
0	very good service would use again .
2	on top of all that it was free_postage !
2	the cheque arrived promptly too
0	and spelt properly .
2	!
2	lflorist do the decent thing and get back to me !!
0	i never write_reviews unless i ' m either extremely happy or extremely annoyed at a product / service , and this is definitely the former .
2	i ordered on a friday , tracked its dispatch and transport over the weekend and it arrived monday lunchtime .
2	!
0	here a copy of the email i sent the company , this should explain everything .
2	the only complaint from my son is that his mum has no window pocket to store his photo .
2	you can hunt down keener prices or make a lot more if you sell privately but for speed and convenience this service delivers what it says on the tin .
2	another purchase from market cross of three lovely trollbeads ( mermaid , pax & trefoil knot ).
2	mazumamobile did everything they said they would do .
2	now i feel_confident that my brother will get his christmas parcel as i wrapped it without customs feeling the need to investigate because i '_ve not given enough detail on the relevant documents .
0	sounds_like a good job to me .
2	i looked on the site and the same flowers go for about 00 pounds .
2	0 weeks_later the printer arrived back ( i was without a printer for those weeks ).
0	!
0	i ordered the headphones as a present for someone_else and so i am unable to rate the product , but i am very happy with the purchase experience and would certainly shop there again next time i need headphones .
0	the price was fantastic and they kept me up to date with the progress of my order every_step of the way .
0	!
0	this is the first time i ' ve ever purchased designer sunglasses online so it was a bit of a big deal and i needed a trusted website .
2	i would have no problem at all recommending their excellent service and prices and will be using them for all of my future photographic needs .
2	found tthe website easy to use , postage bag was sent following_day .
2	the added convenience of having the item delivered to a local_store is brilliant for those who cannot sit around waiting for a delivery .
2	i did panic that i had made a wrong decision but decided i ' d have to wait_until it was delivered so that i could check this out for myself .
2	told me they had received my order , and then when it was being despatched sent me an_email to tell me it was on it '_s way - even gave me a post_office tracking_number and a link to po website .
0	it is amazing !
2	!
0	how can you run a flower delivery business if you can ' t even send them at the promised date and time .
2	my order was accepted , and my card debited by £_00 . 00 .
2	and my fears of this turning into a no collect as the previous day once again turned_out to be correct !
0	so in summary_:
0	absolutely no leaks whatsoever .
2	easy to use , plug in the dimensions get the cheapest quote , if unsure_about anything just use the live_chat .
0	the advice i received was spot on , my fiance loves the ring and i could not have been happier with the service .
2	all went very quickly and as advertised , will use again .
0	after booking a parcel collection i accidentally chose the wrong collection day .
2	please do not waste your time with this company .
0	how were we supposed to pay it if we simply weren ' t told about the charge , and not told how to pay the charge .
2	they emailed me an offer of a white one , which i subsequently declined , and requested order cancellation .
0	i can only say thank_you serenata and i will_definitely use your service again
0	absolutely_fuming .
0	no unpleasant surprises , generous offer , speedy payment

0	0_stars .
2	we followed_instructions but they are very disappointing .
0	i am especially touched by the free chocolates that came with the order and also the personalised card .
2	if you want a fast reliable service , then try mazuma_mobile now .
0	i am stunned at how badly this has been handled and i still_haven ' t got my birthday_present .
0	however , i have done this review immediately after making the order .
2	it didn_'_t matter if they were tacky as they were only for driving .
0	i popped my phone in and sent it off .
0	i recently sold my phone on mazuma and i was very pleased with the speed of the service .
2	i posted it back saturday ( normal post with a certificate of posting - still free ) and on monday had an_email to say it had been received .

2	excellent service !
2	thank_you very much
2	it '_s nice to know that you can get a swift response from a real_person , rather_than having to be on hold on the phone forever like many other_companies i have had experience with in the past
2	thank_you
2	they were very efficient & promptly sent my money by the preferred method ( cheque ).
0	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don ' t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
2	my money came through very quickly .
0	i bought the strawberry sundae and oriental breeze from you .
2	a good range of products with very competitive_prices .
2	spoke to pmc returns details emailed and sent back and replacement provided within two days .
0	from now , the only place i ' ll shop for shades is with these chaps .
2	it is hopeless !
2	i spoke to a really helpful , friendly guy , david , who was polite , helpful and friendly despite my dithering about .

2	happy driver but 00 days late .
0	i will be using these very soon !!
2	won_'_t be using these_guys again .
0	very user_friendly website .
2	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’ t get hold of the company until the next_day !
2	to my astonishment the next_day i received a email_saying you were going to pay me in 00_hrs but the next email only a few_minutes later said that payment would be in my bank_account before the end of the day .
0	i went to visit my partner last_night and asked to see the flowers and oh my god iv never felt so embarrassed in my life !!
0	best of all was the funny emails i received as they had been sent and delivered .
0	i have lost two days work waiting for deliveries that never arrived .
0	i love you .
0	couldn ' t ask more for an international order / delivery .
2	well , having_read_reviews about this company and also being a little_apprehensive as to the fact that they were located in hong_kong , i went_ahead anyway and ordered the panasonic_lumix lx0 as although i am nearly 00 years old , i really wanted to get a fairly decent camera to take on holiday to mexico in a few_weeks , and reading the reviews of this camera , decided to order it from digitalrev . com as the price was extremely cheap !
0	not a biggie for me .
2	avoid p0d & avoid yodel
2	i think it '_s bad to be told that there '_s no compensation for failed collection which provides carte blanche for indefinite delays .
2	very prompt delivery , good value for the money .
0	sharing my chat experience with sam @ parcel0go . com ( sam was very professional , quick , and helpful !
2	arranging for a bouquet online was simplicity_itself .
2	i cant_believe_how easy and fast it was to sell my old_mobile to mazuma !

0	my friend ordered a package on river_island for my birthday , i live in the us , they live in england .
0	thank_you !
2	best service woulld recommend to everyone .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend anyone to use this service rather_than lugging heavy boxes to a post_office .
0	fantastic service , great price .
0	but part from that it been a ok experience
0	they offer very reasonable prices and also offer a social_networking service , which lets you get to know the company better ( a lot of " bigger " businesses could learn from this model , if this is the future of online shopping its very bright !)
2	a shocking rip_off and appalling customer service . what a shame i cannot post a photo .
2	choosing her ring as a surprise , totally scary !
0	i was expecting a big bouquet , of beautiful blossomed flowers . little did i know i as a student and money doesnt come round easy for me , was spending my hard_earned money on nothing better_than a bunch of flowers that looked like i bought them from a garage for nothing over ten_pounds .
0	thank_you to my agent gemma , who delt with my issue !
2	needed a parcel picked_up urgently - catherine came on line and offered to help , she was very helpful and efficient - just waiting to courier to come .

2	this is a very easy service to use and i decide who delivers and the pricing is unbelievable try it mags
2	keep_up the good work .
2	i got a good online quote , the prepaid_envelope arrived the next_day .
0	due to my previous experience i made it very clear that i wanted the shipping refunded as they failed to deliver the item .
2	this is the first time i have used this company but based on this experience i would definitely_use them again .
2	i knew thet sunglasses i wanted ( maui jim readers g000 - 0000 ) as they were to replace a previous pair .
2	being invited to a birthday_party with fancy_dress theme of your choice but will be decorated in haloween style sent shivers down my spine as thoughts of usual scream masks and blood came to mind .
0	amazing selection to choose from , been trying to find undies for ladies with big funky waistbands like this for ages , fast delivery , really comfy , epic website .
0	they now have my mobile and i am unable to activate my cards - so i have lost out .
0	after ordering a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for the 00th_feb .
2	flowers were delivered . on time and in perfect_condition ; she was delighted with them .
0	i can not explain this any further than what i have done .
2	their products are always first_class and they keep you informed of the progress of your order .
2	my mother was understandably disappointed so i tried to complain to iflorist to no_avail . the online_chat is always offline . they won_'_t answer the phone & certainly didn_'_t reply to my many emails . in the end i wrote to [_name ] as he had put his good name to this outfit . i have had a reply asking for my order no ; so i shall await with interest !
0	no one enjoys wasting an entire day , eg .
2	the insulting balloon freaked out my friend and the roses were nearly dead when they arrived .
2	the web - site estimated delivery was fiction .
0	it came as promised and i was delighted with the quality of both the ring and diamond .
2	terrible service i ordered flowers in good time and didn_'_t arrive on specific day i contacted eflorist who just told me i should have read small_print and used a florist if i wanted them for a specific day i felt the adviser was having a laugh at my expense . they arrived a day late but wasn_'_t left even_though i left clear delivery instructions emails haven_'_t been answered . please read other review_sites to get a clear picture of this company . they just don_'_t care about the customer when things go_wrong and ignore you
0	easy to do online and payment recieved fast
0	then they managed to lose 0 x huge boxes containing alloy_wheels .
2	never done that before thinking it would be a hassle if stuff didn_'_t fit .
0	flowers delivered to my partner at her work , genuinely the bouquet looked pathetic and nothing like the picture .
2	jayne hannigan
2	they deliver quickly too and returns are easy to do , and they turn_round refunds speedily .
0	the service was quick , easy and simple .
0	i almost sent my phone to envirofone for about £_00 .
2	kept_informed from day one via_email of every_step in the transaction .
2	very happy .
2	i ' m_sure many of us are a little reticent purchasing our photographic goods from hong_kong - so far away and so difficult to get in touch !
2	i needed to send some flowers urgently to a family_member who has had a bad time lately following a bereavement and just wanted her to know that i was thinking of her .
0	very easy , very quick , from filling in the online form to payment to my bank_account was less_than a week .
2	he really did sort everything out for me , and i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend parcel0go to anyone
0	!
2	i will not_hesitate in recommending this company to friends and business associates .
0	0 ***** i love it
2	best of all , you can track your " order " throughout the whole service .
0	receiving emails notifying me when delivered .
0	i have placed an order after 0pm on friday and that confused me when i saw " processing order " on monday_morning .
0	i steer_clear of yodel as i ' ve never had a smooth_transaction with them when being delivered too !
0	i ' d definitely use mazuma again .
2	all in all a lovely piece of kit .
2	david a .
2	i await hearing about the flowers !
0	i bought some prescription ray_ban sunglasses and i ' m delighted with them .
0	i found whilst the high_street guys were helpful they seemed to push the sale of rings i didn ’ t feel had the right balance .
0	placed an order for a north_face backpack earlier today - opted for the free delivery so was initially informed order would arrive before 00th_june , but i ' ve already had confirmation of its dispatch - so it should now arrive in time for my boyfriend ' s birthday - with no delivery charges !
2	thank_you so much
2	.
2	have now recieved an_email from some rep called jamie after a week of getting no where .
2	the discount offered to returning customers ( on loake , not sure about other makes ) will have me returning time & time again .
0	international services definitely requires improvement .
2	emma was easy to deal with and very helpful :)
0	completed the form online - pouch received in 00hrs - posted back same day - money in my account the next_day .
2	there was no card or note from us in the delivery so my parents did not know who sent it until i asked if they recieved it and ther was no name of the florist .
0	when i asked if my handset had arrived they responded with an_email_saying that i should not worry because my quote will not change because i have notified them of the date it was sent .
0	ordered flowers for valentines_day , never arrived on the 00th and when delivered on the 00th contained the wrong flowers ( roses my fiancee hates instead of tulips ), a broken vase and chocolates instead of the balloon .
0	brilliant service a ++++
0	i was very happy with my experience - if only all customer_service reps were this good !

2	recommend and will use again .
0	really happy with your service .
0	received the post wallet the next_day and received the cheque 0 days after i ' d posted it .
2	the famous " local " high_street / retail_park outlets had even higher prices !
2	aaa ***
2	the next_day comes and goes and you have waited indoors in silence for another 00_hours for a courier that has not appeared .
0	emails were communicative and had a touch of personality .
0	from , chloe :)
2	booked collection very easily
0	not only did they look nothing like the picture on the website , but the roses were tiny and the foilage was hardly noticable .
2	i would highly_recommend this seller to anybody , the service was outstanding , from start to finish , the product was as_described , cannot_fault at all .
0	it is so much cheaper_than going directly to the companies and i ' ve saved loads of money now i don ' t have to book directly with tnt or other couriers .
0	i presumed that ordering them so far in_advance and for a few_days before_christmas would mean that there would be no_problems . boy , was i wrong !
2	?
2	thanks again emma
0	best price i could find and i knew i was ordering from a reputable company .
0	highly .
0	i recently tried to send a parcel to south_africa .
0	had to write to get a response and a refund .
2	the item arrived well within the stated delivery time , was very well_packaged and arrived in perfect order .
0	easy to find the phone , helpful instructions .
0	the website is well arranged and easy to navigate with accurate item sizing guides and competitive_pricing .
0	would happily use this service again .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	i have sold 0 phones through them and each time the money has_gone straight into the bank with no deductions , despite a few minor scratches that , according to reviews of other phone buyers , might have solicited a reduction in the amount paid .
0	i found a trusted company who sold them for £_000 and decided to order them , however they were out of stock and would take 0 weeks for delivery , so i contiuned my search , i came_across sunglasses_shop who were selling them for £_000 but i noticed the did a price_match service .
0	the communication was top stuff , i received all emails and tracking_information asap .
2	their service was quick and they kept me updated with the progress of my order , which , when it arrived was extremely well_packaged .
0	complaint made and received no response !
0	i was at work all day , and i work on reception , and nothing was delivered .
0	i received my item within a few_days from ordering .
2	i paid it because i thought i had no choice .
2	saw the reviews for parcelhero on a cyprus forum & decided to give them a go , but was very apprehensive that our stuff would disappear into the back of a white van never to be seen again .
0	posted phone one day and received payment the following night , you couldnt ask for more for this company .
0	the delievery was extreamly quick !
0	miniinthebox has little opportunity to know about every_rule in every country .
0	finding a balance between size , quality , colour , cut , polish and symmetry was a nightmare .
2	i had a mobile lying_around that i never used .
2	again - fantastic customer service - thankyou
0	i ' ve sent numerous phones and always get what i ' m quoted .
0	the webpage is easy to use and great for any given occasion .
0	i shall be reporting them to trading_standards as they are deliberately overstating their abilities .
2	!
2	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
2	i was amazed to find my muck_boots at this price , 00_%_off usual price and the icing on the wellie boot cake was i got them delivered within 0 days of placing my online order .
2	have to say , happy with service & product , as a runner tried for age '_s to get a decent pair of sports headphones , these were recommended by hifi head phones an they got it right , delivery and transit reports , made the purchase joy and not a burden .
2	i found parcel_hero on an internet_search_engine & thought i would give them a try .
2	( with fresh flowers ) they say they have refunded the delivery charge and also the cost of the teddy_bear but after_reading all the reviews i '_ll believe it when / if it happens .
2	had a potential problem with collection , and samantha sorted it out immediately . p0g i love em !!!!!
0	the policy of parceltogo appears to treat the customer with utter contempt and an attitude that it ’_s not our fault so we couldn ' t care less .
2	i had a problem with sending a parcel recently when i was using their website , but they have an excellent " live_chat " feature which i used and daniel talked me through my problem and sorted it in a few_minutes
0	i simply typed in my details and a pack arrived in 0 days at my door with a pre_- paid bag to send my phone back in as well as clear_instructions as to how to pack my phone .
2	i would definitely_use this service again and the price was just brilliant . thank_you richard .
0	i ordered my 0d premium kit last month through digitalrev .
0	money was in the bank fast - couldn ' t be_happier !
0	:)
0	i ordered from the uk and had extremely quick delivery considering the distance and the poor weather in the uk at the moment !
2	i am a pensioner with not a lot of money to spare , and grudge paying good money for a bunch of dead flowers .
2	i would just like to say that i was having a chat that i was having a chat with [_name ] and she was most helpful .
2	geoff
0	i was kept_informed at every_stage of process
2	everything with order went nice and smooth no delays and item was looked after with great care good customer focus from the team .
2	very very fast
0	i think the service is fantastic , fast and reliable and i would definately_reccomend it .
2	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered yesterday evening but they didn_'_t arrive ( i had of course to spoil the surprise as i had to ask my daughter if anything had come ).
0	maybe it ' s a blessing in disguise that nothing was delivered .
2	have had a problem with another company and looked on the reviews for parcel0go , seeing that they were good i decided to ask for advice and use the live_chat .
0	i recieved an e_- mail the day after i sent the phones off just saying my phones had been recieved and to expect payment in the next two days .
0	i ' m always very sceptical of reviews .
2	large parcel to sweden
0	in the customs declaration the value was about 00_% what i paid , good way to avoid duty , but should anything happen .
0	i think we should all get together and do something about this - does anyone_else agree ?
0	when asked what would have happened had this not been paid we are informed that it would have just been sent back to the uk .
2	thanks
0	braw .
0	i quickly got connected to the advisor [_name ].
0	new , boxed , uk charger .
0	i have used interparcel on several_occasions over the past few_years , they always save me time and money , their standard service in my opinion is the best , managed by ups and i have had no issues .
0	also the prices are the best vie found online .
2	thanks
0	this was the third ( and last ) time i have ordered from serenata_flowers .
0	well . there ' s that one time the fedex man came round and everyone in my house was either too neurotic and / or anally spiteful to open the door to the man , and the fedex guy left my parcel with the neighbour across the street .
2	very good full range choice for your parcels transportation here and abroad .
2	big deal .
0	katie was very helpful and friendly and sorted out a full_refund within a couple of minutes .
2	i ordered my glasses and paid for them through paypal .
2	good price paid .
2	the person who received it was very impressed and thought it was beautiful .
2	!, these_idiots are ignorant and shouldnt be allowed to trade !!!!
2	but watch them ( once they get you hooked ) on the lollipops =)
0	i ' ll be ordering more treats soon !
0	i looked at several sites , some of which offered a fair bit more money .
0	i spoke to paul on live_chat and he was very helpful and dealt and helped_me with my enquiry very quickly x
0	really don ' t bother , these were for my partners_birthday and i ' m so disappointed in the flowers
2	thanks george , kate & the rest of the team .

2	professional service from start to finish .
0	they delivered my order faster_than_expected , and i had no issues with them , not to mention they were the cheapest online by £_00 . ill happily buy all my future sunglasses with them .
2	money in the bank within 00_hours of receipt of the ' phone .
2	i ordered a pair of le chameau boots as a christmas_present for my wife in early_december .
0	the communication with the company was good .
2	how can you fault that excellant service - top_marks .
0	- what a joke so i was forced to accept a small amount for the phone or they return the damaged which has no value to me now .
2	essex
2	i have booked collection for my parcel and the cost was fantastic for the destination requested as i tried many others but very expensive almost double , in addition i missed my collection so went through the chat room in the website and the person chat it with " jessica " was extremely_helpful and she re booked collection in the same day with fedex so i recommend this company highly for the price and the service they provide .
0	they look nothing like what i had ordered , i paid decent money for quality not for something that looks crap , im very annoyed and will never be ordering flowers ever again from u . sites like urs people should be able to trust !
0	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
0	having not heard of money for your phone my wife was apprehensive_about using them .
0	i use the next_day delivery service which was a complete bargain compared to the extortionate amount of money other_sites are charging !
2	from initial_enquiry to a cheque on my doormat in less_than 00_hours !
0	i am really happy with my deal , good prise , fast money transfer to bank .
0	i ' d like to be able to comment on the quality of the flowers but quite simply they never arrived ( something i only found out late sunday_evening ).
0	i hear there ' s a drop_off services at certain shops / garages ( some 00hr ), and the person at the other end can choose to have it delivered to a collection point near them .
0	i called the driver and question this who said he would call back and pick it up but later in the day after i had left work .
2	there are other . 0phone companies that could_learn a lot .
0	i was very wrong , i connected to the live_chat were a very friendly gemma fixed my problem in a couple of minutes !
0	a brilliant service and i would highly_recommend .
2	i said how i had been trying to contact them for over 0 weeks and she said she was working her way through the emails , which was rubbish as i never got a reply from my 0st email .
0	kaneeshkumar selvasothy
2	no reply .
0	no respond to any of my emails !!
2	easy to register and print of all needed information .
0	i discovered p0go , the site is easy and gave lots of options .
0	sceptical about ordering as based in hong_kong as worried_about getting the camera in time for xmas .
2	this meant that i knew every day where my parcel had got to and at what time .
0	paid a for premium for what i thought was next_day collection - turns_out the service is not guaranteed service thus the package maybe collected in the next few_days in the meantime if i can be in the house 00 : 00 until 00 : 00 each day that would be great . avoid !!!
2	great being_able to track my parcel .
0	iv used parcels0go for some time now find it easy and help from there is great i rate this as a 0 star as a brill and good way of sending parcels hasel free and live help kirsty was brill :) no_problems
0	i have only ever done 0 other review of a website because on the whole you dont generally receive a service from most websites that warrants any merit .
0	sarah assisted me quickly and efficiently .
0	i had a friend send his standard royal_mail and it got lost in the post , and was left out of pocket .
2	can '_t get better_than that .
0	the service was quick and easy to use and the entire transaction was smooth and efficent .
0	i was taken with you and found what i wanted immediately .
2	on contacting the company , my husband was told that it was in their small_print that flowers could be delivered on an_alternative date if the company so decided and that a refund was out of the question .
2	excellent service , already looking for my next pair of prescription glasses .
0	i placed the order on the 00 / 00 /_0000 with a collection date of 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	koney
2	fast , friendly , efficient service .
2	i was kept_informed at all times as to the delivery status .
2	i queried the fact with iflorist by e_- mail , to be told " the status of the order can only be changed by the courier so if the courier first made the deliveries and then marked them as delivered this is why the time difference , i apologize for any_issues encountered ", basically blaming the courier .
2	so i am sorry if this caused mazuma bad score they had done all what they said they would .
0	i have had dealings with [_name ] and he has been very efficient in escalating and resolving my claims ; however this should be done in the first place and not need to be a last resort .
2	she listened to my problem and sorted things out quickly - many_thanks to emma !
2	keep going !!!
2	zoomfish gave a much_better price than a high_street service provider had given on my wife '_s iphone just a week earlier and paid up much_faster , i wished i had found this company before !
2	i ioved them so much , and will recommend you to others .

0	i guess i will phone them yet again in the morning and ask them who they think they delivered it to and hope against hope that it eventually arrives sometime tomorrow .
0	we started out sending 0 or 0 parcels on the odd_occasion , now we send out 0 or 0 a day and hopefully this will only grow and grow .
2	have used another company before , but serenata_flowers beats them hands_down in all departments .
2	after buying something on ebay the seller quoted me the cheapest royal_mail price -£ 00 . 00 for a 0kg parcel .
0	she arranged for us to drop the parcel to a depot near my partners work which he passes on his route .
2	just amazing , and just the job .
2	transaction completed within a week , from submission of application to money in the bank .
2	all products ordered arrive in next to no time and as expected
2	i couldn_'_t fly over for that day , so i decided to have flowers delivered after she ' d got home .
0	the website was easy to use , the envelopes arrived on time and the money was transfered straight into my account .
0	it is not a time critical parcel , i wouldn ' t mind to receive it with some delays if christmas delivery are overloaded , but i can ' t understand_why they lie to us , it ' s unrespectful , so i ' d say that if you have a time critical product , don ' t go for ups , or better , i ' d say don ' t go with ups at all , pure trash company .
2	fonebank won_'_t necessarily offer the very best prices but they ' re never far away .
0	on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00 : 00 the tnt driver refused to accept the package as it was not in a cardboard_box ( it was securely bagged and taped however ).
2	i ordered flowers for delivery the same day for my husband and his brothers and sisters who were together following the death that day of their sister christine .
0	they keep you constantly_updated_throughout the process and was informed when the item was dispatched from their warehouse .
0	i was absolutely amazed at how quick and easy the service was .
2	nope , the online_chat with nick ( thanks nick ) answered my questions , emailed me new labels ( in less_than 0 minutes ) and confirmed that there was no charge .
2	they actually delivered the flowers on monday despite_being told not to as it was too late .
0	i know the subject heading sounds_like an over statement .
0	couldn ' t ask for much more and i don ' t need to write and essay on why .
0	can ' t argue with that at all .
0	they missed the collection date , then when i rang up to find out why , they had no answers , by the looks of the tracking the order had not even gone_through to the courier .
2	always happy to leave feedback for cath , she is always on top form !!!!
2	arrived saturday_afternoon , once i opened the box i realised flowers were all in bud .
0	well i ' m not gonna waste my time phoning the premium_rate number as i can ' t be wasting anymore of my money when they aren ' t in any way helpful or apologetic and don ' t seem to care .
2	many_thanks and look_forward to shopping with you again in the near_future .
0	they seem to have washed their hands of the matter , so they have stolen my money , not a small amount of money either .
0	when asked what website i was on , i told him iflorist . co . uk , he told me no thats the wrong one , you use m . iflorist . co . uk ( which i have checked now , and does have gaurenteed delivery option ) however , the usual iflorist . co . uk does not have this option .
2	parcel was well - packed and lens was in perfect_condition .
0	nothing was delivered and i have received no further communication from them .
0	disgusted with the lack of customer_service given .
0	- be prepared for a worrying ' you order is on hold ' email while they authenticate your credit / debit_card .
2	the next e_- mail said they didn_'_t have the bouquet i wanted and would send 00 roses instead .
0	i fully recommend saving the money , the company was excellent and thoroughly deserve all the praise that they get !
2	i don_'_t order from end all that often , but when i do the experience is always quick and high_quality .
0	good value for money , very quick and hassle_free service .
0	i ' ve had several problems .
2	excellent service .
2	resolved within 0 weeks which i feel is great service .
2	serenata are really good and the only florist that i use .
0	thank_you for making my mum ' s birthday special
0	i ordered saturday evening and they have arrived today ( tuesday ) with amazing dpd delivery service with allotted delivery time_slot of 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
0	i was connected within a minute .
0	i received the postage bag on the tuesday .
2	upon checking the royal_mail tracking the phone had been received the day before as she had said was required , so another phone_call was made they then proceeded to try and say that was the date the item would be received at the royal_mail sorting_office not at envirophone even_though this was clearly_stated on the royal_mail tracking_information .
0	the ring i had pictured in my mind was close to the designs on the website but not exact .
0	i cannot get a response from them now , via phone , email , twitter or facebook , online_chat .
2	but once again they would not accept that they could possibly be wrong and they assured me the parcel would be collected by 0 . 00 today ( friday ) i asked if they could check with tnt , waited about 00 seconds & was told tnt have said the parcel is booked for collection today .
2	they have opened up now and are lovely .
2	they are 000_% reliable and never let you down .
2	they paid the quoted amount without quibbling , and the cheque was here within a couple of days of the email_confirming that the phones were in working order .
2	arrived next_day . top_notch .
0	image nor description .
0	i provided my details to mazumba mobile online on a sunday .
0	easy to use website , simple process to post off my phone .
0	what a complete_joke , i can claim and if i win i will get £_00 back which means a refund to the ebayer of £_000 , ebay fees of £ 0 , collect_plus fee of £ 0 total out of pocket and having to find = £_000
2	what a superb company to deal with ?!
0	the flowers were very much_appreciated and had numerous comments on their quality and beauty !
0	i had a final text and email a shortly_after confirming delivery .
2	parents bought a new tv and the hdmi sockets were on the side so that all the cables stuck out beyond the edge of the screen ( great design panasonic !).
2	anyway , it wasnt collected !
2	i didn_'_t need to be , it was really easy to order ( i ordered on friday for delivery on saturday ), the flowers arrived on time and my mum in law was thrilled with them .
2	hello !
0	i am really angry about this and would never recommend this company to anyone !
0	the fee from ups is partially_customs , and the rest is a fee for taking care of the customs for you .
2	i need not have worried .
2	clare was incredibly helpful and totally understood all of my needs , infact she solved all of them for me . i will_continue to sing the praises of this wonderful , good value company and reccomend them to every one needing quality glasses with that personal_touch and good reliable service .
2	i had no issues placing my order , the item was dispatched on the next working day and received the following_day so all in all a good experience and would recommend safercigs to friends .
2	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
2	well_done and affordable too .
2	i am absolutely_delighted with the produts and service from this company .
2	took just a few_minutes , was courteous and helpful , so well_done katie , and thank_you .
2	don_'_t trust this company as their promises are like pie crust .
0	i booked a same day collection for next_day delivery as i needed an item to be returned before my 00 day return period was up .
2	i will_definitely be using this site for any future international shipments i need to make .
2	!
0	i really can ' t recommend this company strongly enough and i fully intend to use them again in the future .
2	given their commitment to top_class customer service and satisfaction , i am pleased to recommend them and will be using them again .
0	overall extremely dissatisfied mothers_day flowers that just never came and when they did they were extremely poor quality .
0	i wanted to show my appreciation on a public holiday for someone i care about - and the one service that they are supposed to provide apparently is beyond them .
0	i have wrongly booked collection instead of drop - off service .
0	amazing .
2	i will without_doubt buy from this company again .
2	used mazuma_mobile to sell two old_mobiles website was really easy and simple to use , sent off my old_phones which were received the next_day order was processed and payment arranged all in in the same day .
0	she was thorough with her questions to enable an exact quote and emailed the details for later use .
2	sam you rock !!!!!
0	however , when she tried them on she didn ' t like them .
0	they are now " looking into it ".
2	great job al round .
2	dealing_with envirofone is a clear , easy process .
0	it left my girlfriend speechless , so that ' s got to count for something !
2	but this company is oh so frustrating to deal with , on the thursday they completely refused to telephone the courier ( tnt ) as they insisted it would be collected !
0	- the price was not the best but it was less by only a couple of pence and considering everything else there is a value attached to peace of mind that puts them back on top again .
2	although not a regular user , my previous experience with parcel_hero had been very good and so their slip - up was totally unexpected .
0	was very pleased i was able to make money from my broken phones !
0	everything got here on time and in great condition .
0	mazuma_mobile are great !
2	i went online and found just the one i wanted , it matched my decor and was offered at a good discounted rate so i purchased it .
2	i have been a customer for over seven years , the level of service and quality of products i have receieved have been outstanding .
2	good on you samantha .
0	and even came with a lollipop .
2	the description of the rucksack i wanted was very clear .
2	on one of our phones another company offered a better price , but after_reading customer_satisfaction reviews on the company ( royal_mail ) it put me off , so decided to stick with mazuma .
2	this is the first time i '_ve used serenata and i ' m very pleased .
2	my two year_old iphone 0 is in exceptionally good condition as it '_s always been in a case .
0	the reviews made me feel so positive that i was comfortable spending the amount of money that i did for someone based out of hong_kong .
0	i ' ve used interparcel maybe 00 times before - and about 00_% of the time there has been an issue .
0	it was not the first time i used mazuma service and again they proved to be nothing less_than excellent really simple and speedy process no hassle at all .
2	what more could you want ?
0	they did turn_up when they are supposed to though - despite using the worst delivery company known to man ( yodel ).
2	unbelievable !!
0	this was my second purchase from digitalrev and yet again they didn ' t disappoint .
0	i didnt know my way around the site and she sorted my quote for me and then went on to help me organise everything and i just had to click the link cornfirm and pay .
0	much_better !
0	all my queries have been responded swiftly .
2	i could even say they are a scam .
0	i am truly disappointed and will not be using this service again
2	the item was brand_new in the box and sealed as such .
0	my phone took longer to get to mazuma_mobile than anticipated ( only by a day or two .
0	also great customer_service and support from sam at parcel0go :) cheers !
2	no chance . got home from work on wednesday 00 / 0 / 00 and there is my lens . i don_'_t believe it was all i said , but there it was . the packaging was excellent in fact it took me longer to take off the protective bubble_wrap than it took to get here from hong_kong !
0	in particular i recommend the ups service .
2	they collected my parcel 0 weeks_ago .
0	mario
2	thank_you
0	however , courierpoint collected a 00kg parcel and delivered it to france within 0 days for under £_00 .

0	excellent service and prompt payment .
0	particularly appreciated the phone call to let me know when my product would be delivered .
2	when compared to others their choice of courier and service is 0nd to none .
0	sent my phone into them perfectly_fine .
0	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
0	the colours shone through on the web_page dispaying the elegance and sophistication of every boquet combination , a joy to send to my mother .
0	please do not use this company .
0	item arrived much_quicker that i expected , with item perfectly wrapped for transport !
0	my orders have arrived in timely_fashion and i really_appreciate the text update to let me know the hour time - frame they will deliver between .
0	i was very pleased when the ring arrived and even more so when i had the valuation .
0	the only problem i had was that i would be out of the house for 0hours on collection day and worried that the courier would arrive in that time so i decided to speak with an operator .
0	i ordered 0 pairs of headphones , both were as_described .
0	i will like to mention sammie_taylor in particular for great customer_service experience .

2	fortunatly i had a very pleasant and helpful lady_called jo .
0	i was sceptical about ordering glasses online , but i found the site easy to navigate , input my description and choose the frame , glass , protection , persciption very quickly .
0	i have found this company to be awful and in all my attempts to email a photo of the flowers has been rejected . a complete_waste of my friday_evening trying to sort this out . dont use this company
2	they are a professional team who keep their eye firmly on the ball .
2	second time ive used mazuma and would recommend them to my friends .
0	still i was not sure using tnt .
0	then finally i am offered " a maximum gesture of £ 0 . 00 voucher " which is obviously no use to me as i will not ever use them again !
0	i have had only one issue in a couple of dozen ( regarding duplicate payments ), which was resolved quickly and amicably .
0	really prompt response , cheque was with me in no time .
0	so in short i used there service to send my laptop and four weeks_later its returned to me smashed .

0	i ' d already decided i needed to get her some flowers but i could leave the house due to having to wait for building regulations guys to come check out the work done on our house .

2	helpful in getting me the price i needed .
2	& julie s .
2	if you need to send flowers with the assurance that they will be of good quality and delivered on time then i would recommend that you use eflorist . co . uk .

0	despite the correct prescription being provided the lenses are extremely poor .
0	my rep , emma , answered all my queries and helped_me solve my problem .
2	really good service .
2	this seems to be a recurrent theme as read complaints on twitter snd ciao from others stating they had received only 00 flowers also .
2	sammie_taylor was a very helpful young_lady ,
2	was asked to review this company by peter_chandler , this is no chore as the service i received was easy from start to finish , the price was a lot_cheaper that royal_mail and there was no lugging the box up to the post_office or queuing , the driver was really friendly and the tracking was excellent , will be using again in the next few_weeks .
2	great service from a name to watch .
0	tom
2	the services provided was exactly as promised and was a rapid as it could have possibly been .
0	but yeh , other than that , amazing shop and service
2	i was embarrased .
2	!
0	i intially went to envirophone and despite only having the hanset only a month brand_new they tried to claim it had some damage and cut their offer by half !
2	november in excellent condition , bubble_wrapped to infinity , duties paid .
2	there online customer_services refuse to help as i don_'_t have photographic_evidence of the flowers which i cannot get .
2	unrivaled , in my experience .
2	i found that mazuma_mobile were a very efficient professional company to deal with .
2	just made a mistake with an address and sammie_taylor at parcel0go sorted it in seconds what a star and brilliant service great team
0	the service was very quick and straight to the facts .
2	thank_you for providing a complete & friendly service .
2	excellent service very efficient from start to finish , five_star service .
0	digitalrev was much cheaper that other_retailers and included free delivery .
0	0 .
2	as one of the deliveries was to my mother - i don_'_t think she would lie about something like this .
2	the money was in my bank_account less_than 00_hours after my first enquiry on the web_site .
0	best online ordering experience so far , great range of products catering for all price ranges , good delivery options and brilliant information section for help in deciding which headphones or earphone are best for different scenarios .
2	if i dont get all my remaining orders by the 00th of july i will take it further . plus i will never use sutton , s seeds again .
2	i was just about to give up with what i wanted , when i made a quick call to webtogs who straight_away put a smile back on my face .
2	once i had filled in the web form postage envelope only took 0 days to come and i posted the phone the next_day .
2	the headset arrived the day after i ordered it , the staff were friendly and helpful with all my questions .
2	i was told by there customer service rep , " well i didn_'_t deliver the flowers , its not my fault ."
2	well , i had not finished sticking it onto the parcel when the courier company pulled up outside my house .
0	i ' ve used interparcel on many occasions and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend .
2	ordered 0 pairs of vans , they arrived in 0 days .
2	=.
0	if you have money to throw_away , feel free to do business with serenata because that is exactly_what you will be doing .
2	this year a search for our favoured brand , keen , led us to the webtogs site .
2	the order arrived quickly and i particularly_liked the lollipop .
0	i ordered 0 lenses on a monday , and was told they should be with me by saturday . they arrived on thursday , packed deep in bubble_wrap and exactly as_described , what else could you ask for ?
0	a small gift was included in the parcel as it was christmas , which iced the cake of a brilliant shopping_experience .
2	my experience this time was even better .
2	very happy !
2	the whole_transaction completed in 0 days .
0	i didn ' t miss work for nothing !
2	i ordered a canon priime lens , some filters and a 00gb sdxc card ( which digitalrev are by far the cheapest for btw ), in the early hours of saturday , got a phone_call a few hours_later ( when everyone normal had woken up ), to confirm my order , was given tracking_info , texts to tell me how my order was progressing and where it was , and i watched that order literally fly around the world in 00_hrs and arrive at my house in the uk on monday_morning .
2	i dealt_with sammie_taylor and she was exceptional thanks
0	all was delivered without a hitch and both myself and the recipient are delighted .
0	but today after_speaking to daniel on the live help i found out that i was looking for the wrong information from the wrong company .
0	!
2	why :-
2	very efficient service , no hassle pick_up at home delivered to new address , absolutely perfect . willdefinitely use this service again
0	package arrived in undamaged condition , with all the content intact .
2	i didn_'_t realise that it is a national company .
2	mazuma was very near the top in price and my searches didn_'_t throw up any apparent concerns so i went_ahead with the sale with them .
2	no flowers got delivered and now i have to wait for a investigation into what happened , that was the most_important day of the year ruined .
0	i just wish all shopping could be like this .
2	i did not have to wait for long and i got my cheque when i left .
2	?
0	one would expect a much higher level of customer_service when purchasing such an expensive and special item .
2	fast turn_around sent phones in and payment recieved day after only down_side was argos when voucher offered for payment they could not process it and had to return later to complete the transaction over all mazumamobile service was spot on next time i will take the cheque
2	it arrived at ema at 0000 and was at our house in derby next_morning .
2	third time i have used mazuma and as always brilliant !!
0	as an untrusting , paranoid cynic , i ' d read reviews and looked at the small_print .
0	also , the packaging is beyond stunning , you ' re going to want to keep everything from the bow to the box , they ' re that beautiful .
2	rg00 0su
2	very happy with product , company and service provided .
2	0 arrived at sort facility london - heathrow - uk london - heathrow - uk 00 : 00
2	thanks again catherine .
2	i will_definitely_use digitalrev for all my further_purchases .
0	the courier was polite and punctual .
0	when the item arrived back in hong_kong , they refunded me the total cost and then sent it to canon for inspection and repair .
2	the last two experiences have been unmitigated disasters .
2	choosing a ring and diamond is easy and the diamonds are certified by gia which is the standard you want .
2	i now have to contact my credit_card company to get them to deal with this company .
0	and they are of poor quality , stems are wilted and dying , they weren ' t even in water ?!?!?!?!
0	a brilliant service , offering the cheapest and easiest service .
0	was unsure_about sending cake so i used the online_chat where rose helped_me with all my enquiries .
0	great thankyou [_name ] very helpfull
2	this is the first time i have used dimond geezer i looked around shops but i could not find one that suited my engagment ring , icame across the site online , and i found my beautiful dimond wishbone wedding_ring , it is absolutley beautiful , and as from the moment i ordered my ring the customer contact was second to none i even recievied a phone_call a a
0	they talked me through the entire_process , helped_me navigate the different qualities of diamonds while never being pushy or trying to up my limit .
2	i agree with everyone_else - always read_reviews first , and never use this company
2	it has_been a pleasure to deal with you . thank_you !
0	i received my order confirmation with a delivery date of saturday . saturday rolled around with no phonecall from my mum .
2	perfect . very fast delivery .
0	com as part of a valentines present which were described as deluxe along with a heart shaped balloon at a cost of £_00 .
0	the latest issue is that they have re - arranged collection 0 times now as the courier didn ' t bother coming to collect the parcel .
2	would use them again .
2	they also have a point reward system , so the more you buy the more you save !
2	i am very pleased with the way in which this sale was conducted , so fast and so easy to complete no having to wait no letters back and fro just do it online and that is all you need do the rest is done for even the posting is done for you all you do is place the phone in the bag supplied and take it to the post_office , that '_s it done .
2	the multi facia that comes with the unit was easy to change over and i must_say that they look good too .
0	this is truly a terrible company to deal with .
0	at the moment it is being held in customs in south_africa .
2	i then re opened the chat and got emily who was able to pick straight up from where leanne had been cut_off
0	a very sweet surprise for sure ( and not just any kind , a chupa_chups ).
2	( that said , when i were a lad , we used to stick half buns to our ears ' n dream we ' ad summat to plug ' em into .)
2	none of that when i used parcel0go for the first time today , it really is so straightforward - all i have to do now is wait for my chosen courier to turn_up on monday !
2	really happy with mazumamobile . com !
0	well_chuffed .
0	they were flowers in a basket !
0	for £_00 i could of got a much_better bunch from asda and even £ 0 more_than what i paid would have given me an amazing bouquet from a florist and i know this through experience .
2	they would be sending them out to arrive on the 00th .
2	about my delivery date , i whish more companys were like dimond geezer . so if anyone is apprehensive_about ordering from them dont be , iam a genuine cutomer and i may add that i am 00years of age and thiss is the first time i have been married after 00 years of being with partner who is now my husbandhannah 0stars
0	selectspecs was an easy website to use and the glasses on offer were very reasonably_priced !
0	update_: the roses are finally dead !!!
0	he told me i was lying , and that i needed to refuse the goods in order to actually get a refund , which i again told him was impossible , due to this being delivered to a business address and not a home address - so i have no control over who accepts it and who doesn ' t , as my mother wont be there today !!
0	i will be recommending this service to everyone
0	i will never purchase glasses from them or anyone_else online again .
2	regards and thanks peter , ipswich
2	such cheap prices and collection from your door .
2	pete smith
2	so good ive bought three pairs and my husband so impressed he bought his new glasses as well .
0	fast dispatch and excellent customer_service .
2	arrived exactly as and when they said it would , but too large , my fault not theirs .
0	mazuma offered me the most money for my old phone , a blackberry 0000 .
0	i did a lot of research into all the different companies that offer this service and for several key reasons mazumamobile came out on top .
0	i will_definitely be buying from digitalrev again , and have been recommending the site to anyone who will listen .
0	in this way , the website has many headphones and accessories that other website do not have .
2	i ordered flowers for my best friends 00th_birthday on the 0st december .
0	post bag arrived after 0 days .
2	emma was just the kindest and friendliest person i could speak with and she dealt_with my problem very quickly and in an excellent manner .
0	my fiancee and i went to diamond_heaven to purchase her engagement_ring .
2	information is accessible and up front , but if you have any problem at all , you can so easily access customer service !
0	so digitalrev have given me a canon_00d at £_000 cheaper_than the uk price and around £_000 cheaper_than the newer 00d which is not hugely different .
0	even quicker_than amazon_prime !
0	lauren was extremely_helpful in changing a courier for me . from collect by city_link to drop_off with ups . all done via web chat whilst i was stuck on mexico .
2	as my parcel is going to reach manchester a day after it was supposed to , and i had to stay in reception myself from 0 . 00 - 0 . 00 for no collection , and had to communicate over the pc for ages , i think that i deserve a refund .
2	efficient and quick .
2	i ordered some replacement ear pads for my sennheiser px000 folding headphones .
0	would use again .
2	waxx is the way forward , as soon as you slip them on you notice the comfort , fit , and they feel great , plus the fact they enhance very well ;) . hats_off to the waxx team love um .

2	!
2	packaging was amazing , and all the uk requirements were inside the box .
2	i found a cheaper quote but the reviews were poor so i went for good value with god reviews .
2	rather_than the package being returned directly to us it was sent to interparcel resulting in a delay of several days .
2	easy to book , picked_up as stated and delivered as stated .
2	it was a pleasure to sell my phone to mazuma who did a splendid job of making every part of the transaction simple and slick . great price as well compared to similar companies and i won_'_t bother next time in researching a few different traders . i '_ll just go straight to mazuma .

0	one thing tho is the lillie ' s only lasted a week !
0	excellent from start to finish .
2	will always use you for flowers abroad .
2	i have been using interparcel for the last few_months and have found their service to be good value for money and reliable .
2	and catherine_corless not only helped_me out but did all the hard work for me , and filled in the form on my behalf .
2	wrong bouquet delivered and flowers were dead - have contacted then several ways - forms / phone / e_- mail etc been promised a refund so many_times and have been promised replies etc - simply the worst company company - my complaint raised in there support centre and closed by them as resolved with no communication - there online_chat button is never live and when it is - no agent comes on line .
0	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain ' t overly upset if it doesn ' t come .
0	they are very informative and polite .
2	highly_recommended
0	i was absolutely_disgusted with the product and delivery method .
2	if you want this kind of service i would definitely recommend mazumamobile .
2	a faultless service from completing online to receiving payment .
2	it could not have been much more than 00 to 00_mins from completing the order !!
0	will let all my tech - loving mates know about you , and will probably be coming_back for more !

0	i would recommend .
0	thank_you very much !
0	their customer_service dept is horrible .
2	the glasses are unexpectantly stylish , with pretty cases .
2	i booked a parcel on line weds 00th_october , destined for londonderry .
2	goods always arrive promptly and they even honour their price promise on their own website when items reduced a few_days after purchasing .
2	i stumbled_across repertoire and my new hugo boss scarf arrived a couple of days_later , just in time for the big freeze .
2	the transmittal note and postage bagb arrived , i posted the phones and 00_hrs later recieved and e_- mail confirming the sale .
0	she then tells_me that i wasn ' t at home when the driver stopped by .
0	as a film director i would come back for all my equipment needs .
0	prestige_flowers used royal_mail to deliver the flowers , not a particular courier so it wasn ' t surprisingly they didn ' t deliver on a sunday !
0	fantastic , delivered on time .
2	this is the third time i '_ve placed an order with hispek , they seem to have a problem with customer_services they don_'_t contact you if there is a problem but leave it until you contact them , i don_'_t mind problems with orders as long as i am aware of it .

0	prompt service and no_hassles .
2	the money was taken from my card .
2	hope the rest of the service and delivery matches up to her .
2	some other_companies slash their original quote and then tell you if you aren_'_t happy it costs around £_00 to send it back so they end up getting your phone at a knock down price .
2	bought a pair of loake brogues and the country_house price was the best i could find .
2	within 0 working_days , they were resent .
2	the school receptionists were not amused when i told them .

2	( jpspencer0 @ fsmail . net )
0	i proceeded to send the phone to mazuma who offered and paid the full £_00 after inspection .
2	i only had a very basic old nokia but even that earned me £_00 .

2	superb !
2	thanks sammie

0	placed an order on tuesday , 00th_july_0000 .
2	the second time it was collected at 00 : 00 and today it was collected at 00 : 00 .
2	!
2	i mean in all seriousness - you don_'_t want problems with your order but when you are dealt_with so efficiently and courteously as this - yes , you '_ve guessed it - " i '_ll be back "
2	anyway , i was given the complete run around , told that it would still be collected and to inform them after 0 . 00pm to rebook if it turned_out to be a failed collection .
2	very nice little cd_player ideal for small room . well_packaged and prompt
2	i don_'_t speak french so was no wiser as to what had happened - and when i started it up - no wifi connection was possible !
2	my experiences of eflorist are that the order exceeds my expectations compared to many other_suppliers , including large retail store online services .
0	now they have grown they seem to not care about service .
0	so in summary i would say before like me you decide to purchase with selectspecs think carefully .
0	!
2	i dropped the parcels at my local collect_+ shop and they scanned without a problem .
0	i am extremely disappointed with the products delivered , the customer_service and how you go about dealing_with customers .
2	i ordered a jacket which arrived perfectly packaged in perfect_condition in lovely julesb box with magazine and order documents in a jules_b logo envelope .
2	i have yet to be disappointed , and even better , i look like a rock star niece for being on time ( not something i am best known for ).
0	to my delight my mums flowers were amazing and delivered at the exact time they said theu would be ( on mothering_sunday for no extra charge ) and everyone was happy and delighted , especially my mum who had an amazing bouquet .
0	this is an awful courier company .
2	service was great - i posted five handsets to mazuma on tuesday_afternoon and i had the exact amount quoted in my bank on wednesday_afternoon .
2	i wanted to talk to a supervisor and was told no one else could help mke after sending emails i still have not had an_apology or refund or any flowers
0	i contacted them and they helped_me pick the right size frame for my big head ( i had actually chosen wrong to start with , but they changed my order for me !).
0	extremely fast and easy
0	but after_reading a number of good reviews and talking to a friend who had used them i gave them a go , and i am very happy that i did .
0	i would recommend iit to everyone !
2	it `_s simple . i ordered a barbour_jacket , kept_fully up to date re order , delivery etc_etc .

2	the 000_% satisfaction guarantee is non - existent !!!!!!
2	well_done mazuma .
2	can '_t recommend them highly_enough
2	advertising .
2	the courier turned_up first thing in the morning and was lovely and friendly , he handled the parcels carefully and listened to our instructions on how the parcels were fragile .
2	it '_s these small attentions to detail that stand out when it comes to customer service .
2	free delivery and affordable prices so i would recommend serenata and would use again .
0	i ordered the adore bouquet as she_loves red_roses and once they arrived i received a lovely text from her thanking me .
2	i used your service for the first time ever last_week to send three parcels , i would like to say how easy your service is to use , and straight_forward ordering , no_hidden costs or stupid questions to answer , no need to print out labels either .
0	the refund was then processed the next_day - amazing !
2	my order was delivered promptly but sadly the fit was not quite right ( nf apparently think i need more boobs and shoulder to balance out my hips ).
0	i ' m_afraid that i won ' t be using your services again in the future .
0	dhl messed_around with the delivery but still received item less_than a week after purchase ( and would have been 0 days quicker had it not been for dhl in the uk ).
0	richard_mileham gave me an excellent , personalized solution for my problem .
2	its most unusual to have a customer service department where you cannot speak to anyone and goodness_knows what one does if your unable to type at a reasonable speed or are not so good with the english_language .
0	they also give me tracking_details which makes it much_easier to see what going on with an order .
2	does that seem good value to you ?
0	i called them and spoke to chloe in customer_services who asked me to send details and they would confirm if they were able to match the price .
0	i felt involved in the whole_process of ring manufacture .

0	the reviews seemed good and they had the ray - bans i was looking for .
2	when you order on friday_afternoon and have your order delivered on the following_monday at 0 . 00am in the uk you could be forgiven for thinking it had come from a local supplier .
0	really easy to arrange a pick_up of an item i wanted to return to an ebay merchant , and tracking was really useful as well .
2	arrival in australia was within the time frame given and the parcel didn_'_t look as if it had travelled across the world brilliant .
2	no more trekking off to the post_office with heavy parcels .
2	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
0	i would not hesitate in recommending diamond_geezer to people and would happily use them again in the future .

2	i had a lovely experience today .
2	i had to email again to , in effect nudge them , and in response , i received this message .
2	my son prefers his cheap £ 0 ones to his designer ones and i ' m thinking that it is rather a shame to confine my rather nice dusky pink rimless ones to just being worn for driving !
2	i have received and made numerous phone_calls from / to its staff , including its md .
2	not a rip_off like the above company !!
0	overall , this saga had taken over five weeks from when we first ordered the ring in store .

0	great communication .
2	u are excellent people

0	great prices , easy to navigate website & fast response .
0	i feel_like they were knowingly trying to hugely undervalue the phone and the more recent reviews from this site confirms that .
0	delivery time was fine ( notstanding the website didn ' t work properly when i ordered the flowers initially and i had to call their customer_services line to arrange a refund ) but when they arrive the quality of them was appalling .
0	the website is really easy to use , everything you need to do to send the phones arrives really fast .

0	so the service that is provided by your company is purely customer_service and technically you do not have anything to do with the parcel as you are a broker and the ' contract ' is held with the company that expedites the package ?
0	0 .
0	as you can als see the scans you are referring to are from a previous date that is how it can be in transit before it is received into leeds .

0	no_complaints whatsoever and would definately purchase off them again .

0	i am very much of the mindset that the items of jewellery i have purchased from diamongeezer will stay within our new family and the valuation has proved that investing in a good quality diamond and platinum setting will show its true value for years to come .

2	my girlfriend loved them and they are still going strong .

2	it is the first time he has had disposable income to make such a gesture and it took a lot of hard work to earn the £_00 iflorist charged him .
0	so simple and easy .
0	it seemed to me that the high_street jewellers had very limited diamond selection and it was a hassle trying to pull together quotes for various different specs .
2	i was well impressed , as was my friend when she received her beautiful_bouquet , having arrived home after a birthday lunch out .
0	delivery was free and they kept me updated on each_stage of the process .
2	i am reading here about people waiting over a week for their collection .
0	* interparcel_* says :
2	sent several emails . the only reply was automated which is useless .
0	picking items and paying for them online was simple .
2	my sister was very impressed by the variety and quality .
0	within 0 hrs of placing the order , my dhl_tracking_number was updated on the website .
0	i thought this would be a big problem and i would lose my money as they had already tried to collect it twice from the wrong_address .
0	what more can you ask for ?
2	i chose one of those in a pretty wicker basket as i thought they would be the freshest and prettiest .
0	i ' ve used parcel to go ireland to italy and uk to italy multiple_times over the last few_months and not had a problem .
2	highly_recommend this company to book through , needed somehting uplifted in the uk while i live abroad and not only were they pretty damn cheap but they arranged pick_up and delivered on the dates promised with not even a scratch on the item !
0	i wish i get this type of services every time i contact parcel to go .
0	diamond_geezer is great and such good value for money , the quality os second to none also i love the way that when you buy a ring they sort of adopt you and clean your jewelery free ( even if it wasn ' t purchased from them !)
0	the service was quick and easy !
2	the flowers are dying , wilted and without water , i tried to ring and as usual got no response
0	“ i believe that the differing reports coming from tnt south_africa and tnt uk were regarding what was needed for export but what was also required for import .

2	also .
2	delivery was on time despite the last - minute order .
0	customer_service .
0	firstly let me know at 0pm on valentines_day that they would not be able to fulfill ( which defeated the object and forced me to go to a local_florist who gave me their last rose , but it was awesome !!
2	also , the prices mazuma offer are as good or better_than their competitors .
0	very happy with my miu miu s and ray_bans !
2	i was marking the boxes . didn_'_t take long for me to rate them 00 / 00 no funcky wierd tastes ,
0	when contacting their customer_service i was batted between different_departments .
0	the ordering_process is simple and effective .
0	my customers where pleased with what they purchased and received in a timely_manner .
0	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
2	cally , cumbria
2	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
2	my order arrived within 00_hrs and included a pre_- paid returns_label should there have been a problem .
2	as a customer of many_years and the purchaser of many , many garments for both myself and my daughter i feel i can fully justify my award of five_star_rating without_any reservations . i can phone alex , the delightful and most helpful at all times , manageress of the conservatory shop to discuss sizing , colour and design and either purchase from her or on line . customer service is always helpful and pleasant . the returning of items is no problem . the range of goods is wide suiting both myself and daughter .

2	well_done mazuma - a fast (& profitable ) way to get_rid of those old_mobile_phones
0	she did rebook my courier for me and was very polite and helpful .
2	if only everyone you dealt_with on the net worked like this !
0	on the 00th_may the parcel was due to be collected from my office , firstly it was declined due to having the collection address on the label and it might be delivered back to me .
2	received an_email from selectspecs informing_me that the glasses i had ordered had been discontinued .
2	tuesday_morning received cheque .
2	thanks very much .
2	five oceans moving ltd
2	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000 gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
2	excellent service highly_recommended .
2	this would have been with exactly the same courier !!
2	this is the answer , contact mazuma , simply enter the details as requested , send the phone in the package you recieve in the post , then spend the money you recieve .
0	" dear christina ,

2	superb service amazing products ( new delivery company first_class as well )

2	received an_email that they were enroute and then when they arrived .
2	he talked to someone who had tried the safersigs and recommeded them .
2	great price and a good service - i '_ll be using digitalrev again .
2	kept up to date with emails at each_stage so you know what '_s going on - when they receive it , when they agree it works , when they pay out .
2	thank_you all so much for your quick solution to my problem of when my parsel was to be collected emily was realy good but my hat gos off to tanya who sprang to my rescue ( many_thanks tanya ) all sorted .
0	fantastic quick and helpful service .
0	even explain every thing from start to end about the collection and delivery , cover options .
0	i have ordered from here several_times now and yes have had a few bumps along the way , mainly in accordance with delivery timing issues but that is to be expected of a company that offers such a large region of service .
2	the flowers were tiny , wilted and badly packaged in a broken box .
0	i wanted to get some flowers for a friend to brighten her day ; unfortunately , she lives in liverpool and i live in northamptonshire .
0	would i recommend them to others or use them again .
2	excellant service and dealt_with the situation with minimum_fuss .
2	everything was more than satisfactory .
0	total scam .
2	parcel0go gave best price and brilliant online_chat help in the form of daniel .
0	i would definitely_recommend hifiheadphones .
0	there are no telephone_numbers like some other courier companies , to speak to someone about whats happened .
0	i first heard of mazuma_mobile services on a tv ad that i had watched , i thought to myself " why don ' t i give it a go " since i have a few non - working mobile_phones laying around , why not trade it in for quick cash .
2	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
0	the service was quick and the website was easy to use .
0	quick and great cancellation , no_hesitation to use again .
2	do not order from these_people !!
0	i emailed them 0 days ago , took them today to answer .
0	since i bought my first record they have always good taken good care of me and on the very very few occasions there were mistakes they were dealt_with swiftly and professionaly - my number 0 stop for drum n bass vinyl !
0	defiantly recommend and would buy again .
0	another great delivery from parcel 0 go !
2	i shudder to think of the state of the bouquet and the obvious mutual embarrassment between myself and my client .
0	so , again thank_you .
2	then to top it off once the collect items go missing and are lost and never delivered .
0	after receiving my welcome_pack through the post on saturday i then posted my phone back to mazuma on monday_morning .

0	i felt_like she really cares_about my problem .
2	i have just ordered a pair of speakers from hifi_tower and was really impressed with how quick the package was delivered , and that was straight from germany .
2	i would highly_recommend this service having used parcel0go before .
2	through it i got a very good deal for my device .
2	used new lens for the first time yesterday on my birthday at the falconry center , everything worked wonderfully , no_problems .
0	hopefully it will be done .
0	important message : we strongly_advise you to check the parcel ’_s condition and contents before signing the delivery note . feel free to remove your product ( s ) from the box to inspect them , even if the outer_packaging doesn ’ t show any signs of damage .
0	less_than a 00 hour turnaround !
2	?
2	it might actually be quite annoying for them having to physically sort through their post . then , we have to think about some concerted legal_action .
0	if anyone is thinking about sending a parcel i suggest doing it direct with the courier and not use parcel 0 go
0	will recommend to others if they ' re all like him .
0	; d
2	would recommed this service to everyone .
0	you ' d be crazy not to use safer cigs for your beginner - pro vaping needs !
2	it was not delivered until the week_later .
0	right , to set the scene - i had this date lined up with an absolutely_stunning girl and thought flowers were the perfect present .
0	dean nash
0	i have tried_ringing them , i ' ve tried every number and each one just leaves a dead tone .
2	disappointed not to receive farm bucks for facebook game though not good for
2	great service .
0	hopefully will go without a hitch , watch this space !
0	brilliant service .
0	you get an_email when it is packed and then again when it is with the courier so you have every idea exactly where your item is at all stages of its journey which is great .
0	- they hadn ' t sent an_email , it wasn ' t on our mail server .
2	catherine was realy great and helpful to complete my order .
0	:)
2	i would certainly recommend this service .
0	fonebank gave me a higher quote than any other mobile trade - in site .
0	here is a overview of a issue i have just had with p0g ( this is a extract from the live_chat on there site , although i ' ve lost their responses )
0	leeds
0	excellent service , super_fast delivery
2	emma was an absolutele star , she is so friendly and helpful .
0	guess this is to be expected nowadays .
2	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
0	this is a review of the terrible service after ordering mothers_day flowers .
2	thanks
0	good packing for international item to make_sure you get it without any damage .
0	very competitive .
0	mazuma were very quick and very reliable , i sent my phone off in the post and 0 days_later the money was in my account .
0	went online to check it out one day . 0 days_later i received a cheque . top stuff !
2	i love born pretty & their products , one of my fave online websites .
2	excellent service throughout .
0	instead it ' s all green rubbish - i have no_idea what it is apart_from foliage i think it ' s called - i ' m not a flower person .
0	all done .
0	they have lost so many parcel ' s and not compensated for them as i didn ' t purchase the more_expensive delivery charge - obviously i assumed that they would do their jobs properly and deliver the parcel as it ' s not rocket_science .
2	customer_services igonore you & so does the managing_director , mr david price .
2	website is easy to find your way aroind but yiou can also phone of you are not quite sure about any detail .
0	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn ' t think too much about it .
0	i chose these as i was fed_up with the usual pink & white bouquets .
2	we got an_email_saying they had failed to deliver .
0	fantastic service with fantastic prices .
0	i normally use a website for the first time with a sinking heart , having to learn it and re - entering all my details etc .
2	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
0	the easiest_way to explain the quality of product from this company is to imagine buying a bouquet of gas station flowers and accidentally dropping them in petrol before setting them alight then leaving them on top of the roof of your car and driving off and waiting for a few weeks of cars to repeatedly run over them .
0	you can buy outfits for every occasion .
2	the key ring is omitted as well , but not a huge problem .
0	they checked and said it had been despatched and it would take up to five days for the courier to respond as to where the item was in the meantime , no refund or replacement was possible .
2	my parcels are trackable from collection to delivery .
0	everything was well_packaged .
2	i '_ll be spreading the word ( and looking for an excuse to be ordering again ).
2	very interested to see what bovine excrement the spew forth .
2	!
2	i then informed them of this & asked for a manager .
0	the bunch that arrived were not the ones i ordered .
0	not only is the website excellent , but the pricing of items is very very competitive across the web .
0	i sent pictures of the flowers i had received but this has not been mentioned at all .
2	thank_you so much .
0	the link to reply with a photo has no way on the page to respond with a photo making a complaint impossible by seranata the comapny itself .
2	ordered item mid_afternoon .
2	l want my money back !!!!!
2	!
0	the site was easy enough to navigate my way through ; choose the carrier ( tnt ), make your payment and then print out the shipping label .
2	i didn_'_t see them myself but my friend was really pleased with them and said they were really lovely , which was all i intended .
0	website is also aesthetically pleasing and joy to use .
2	they were happy for us to hold onto the boots for as long as it took , and then return them if they were too small .
2	from start to finish the process was easy communication and service was excellent .
0	recommend !!
2	they were delivered next_day to my friend for her_birthday . she reported that they were very beautiful .
2	more in anger and frustration than anything_else , i posted the story wherever i could .
0	but they definitely made up for it replacing the faulted goods and kept in touch with me throughout the whole procedure .
2	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
0	easy and very quick payment .

0	highly_recommended
0	b
0	the advisor was really helpful and not even the slightest bit pushy .
2	i went on line and decided to use a courier service i had not heard of before as i don_'_t often use couriers , of course i had my reservations with all the stories you hear about lost goods , late deliveries , but it was very good , straight_forward in completing the order online , then the collection and delivery were quick and early delivered .
2	!
2	catherine was excellent , she dealt_with my problem very quickly , no_fuss , friendly_manner . 000_% good .
0	i was really impressed with mazuma ' s service - the freepost_envelope arrived the next_day and the money was in my account the day after i sent the phone in and i was kept_informed of progress throughout .
0	first thing in the morning a fantastic assistant sarah , helped and moved to a different courier with no extra charge or delays in the parcel .
0	brillaint service this is my second phone with a massive price difference from the first one and i have always got the full_amount .
2	very impressed
2	can '_t recommend digitalrev highly_enough . shop with complete_confidence !
0	see you in about 0 hours , bill !
0	martin , our regular delivery driver is a top guy and samantha in the office always goes the extra_mile to help us .
2	i will never buy from pixmania again
2	the phone arrived the next_day along with the payment to my account .
2	then on the 0th day , the 00th_march i received a reply saying . ' i apologise , i have emailed hermes to find out whether the driver is now able to advise where the parcel was left .
0	very impressed overall .
0	so sent it again and now waiting for a reply ( and a refund ).
0	the flowers were gorgeous , however if i had not gone for a delux bouquet them i ' m not sure that there would have been enough in the bunch .
2	i sold a phone that i had had sitting about for quite .
0	great service , fast delivery , well_packaged .
2	i have had to change my review after a satisfactory performance by this company .
2	getting through to customer service at parcel0go . com was easy enough , but only if you dodn '_t mind typing for 0 hours .
2	if you want to find a a reliable competitively_priced place to buy a high_quality bouquet , be it for a birthday , get well or special_occasion , serenata_flowers cannot be_beaten .
2	thank_you so much for this and i wish everyone used this service , it is fantastic .
0	vidas
0	will re - post if by some miracle they arrive late today , however i doubt it .
2	she was very helpful and able to advise , plus very human and charming at the end of a customer service chat system .
0	no further contact by jan 00rd - two_weeks_later .
0	friendly and professional .
2	they looked like a £_00 pound '_s bunch of flowers from tesco and as if that wasn_'_t bad enough they resent them to my brothers again instead of my mothers .
2	i chased customer service and was eventually informed that they were out again for delivery by 0pm today .
2	service was amazing , i was e_- mailed with a one hour delivery time - slot and it arrived_bang on time so no hanging_around all day awaiting a delivery !
0	i am looking for a reply iflorist ( i have lodged two tickets and tried to call you ), within the next_day or i will be reporting you to ts for taking all our money and then disappearing off into the sunset .
0	may be a goodie for the person who has this brilliant idea ?
0	really patient and helpful individual couldn ' t have asked for a more friendlier or accomodating assistance .
2	justifiably so !
0	i would recomend this company to anyone selling a mobile phone .
2	two lots of flowers were to be delivered to a remote part of anglesey , where lots of deliveries go astray .
0	such a waste of money for effectively thin_air !
0	will not be using them ever again and suggest that anyone reading this do the same .
2	i would recommend this service to anyone and would definately_use parcel0go everytime i need to have a parcel delivered .
0	i ' m not that dumb enough to go with them lot again , no way !
2	!
2	!
2	and then to send a day late .
0	rough drunken delivery driver from hermes stumbled & fell collecting the parcel from my work , i could smell the alcohol on his breath .
2	the prepaid_envelope arrived the next_day and i had email_updates on the progress of my order .
0	i received an_email to say they had my phone and quickly received another to say it had been tested .
2	i ordered from this company as what seemed to be a good option for flower delivery to europe .
0	highly_recommended and would definitely use again .
0	it had been unpleasant , and ruined what would have been one of the most special parts of our engagement .
2	wanted to sell i phone 0 , registered with mazuma , they provided the pre paid_envelope and simple instructions , the next thing i knew the cash was in my bank .
0	regards
0	appalling website accuracy and terrible customer_service .
2	i would definitely_use them again and would recommend to anyone .

2	no_fuss no_nonsense .
2	fast delivery with reasonable p_&_p .
2	thank_you for such a professional service .
0	i won ' t use again .
2	the website is excellent , especially when it comes to sale time .
2	i had three old_phones with no batteries which i wanted to dispose of , but could not find anywhere to recycle them , so contacted fonebank to ask if i could send the phones in for no money but they insisted on paying me for the phones .
2	i received my pack the day after_placing my order , and when i posted my phone , i was credited in the bank two days_later .
0	so obviously i complained , can ' t ring only email which is annoying for me but the first response was apologising about the quality .
2	saved a huge_amount of time not having to trawl loads of websites to find the best deal , with an easy to use link straight through to buyer with no_messing_around .
2	they promise to give a refund and it is now wednesday and they keep fobbing me off saying they are investigating .
2	i was a little_apprehensive , as i had never used this service before .
0	i had paid extra to be able to track the order but all that the tracking said was that the order had been allocated .
2	it feels_like i am fighting a battle here for all of those who have had such appalling service from parcel0go . com .
2	i will use dobies again for sure
0	definitely will recommend and use again
2	iflorist gave me a voucher for 0 . after many calls and emails .

2	ive smoked for some 00 years and i was smoking approx 00 roll ups a day . out of breath , wheezing like a tied old train and smelling like an old pipe bowl i decided it was time to do my bit for the carbon footprint and try to stop the fags .
2	i was very glad to be able to drop my parcel off at a collection point so i did not have to wait in at home .
2	in fact the lens arrived 0 days before my credit account was charged - astonishing service .
2	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
0	really good selection to choose from and i love the fact that nine times out of ten you get your order the next_day .

0	the envelope arrived the next_day , it was strong enough to hold the 0 old_phones i sent off .
0	unfortunately i had to return a faulty tap , but darren in customer_services made the whole exchange process run smoothly and efficiently , which made it hassle_free .

2	yes , i could have got these a few_quid cheaper on amazon , but it was a real_pleasure to deal with this company , and my only regret is that i don_'_t really buy headphones exactly that frequently so i don_'_t see myself becoming a regular customer .

2	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly creased .
0	i could easily keep_track of my order on the website so i wasn ' t in the dark about the process and from the emails i recieved and information on the website , it explained everything i needed to know so the process was easy , stress_free and fast .

2	i found diamond_geezer to be an brilliant company to do_business with .
0	!
2	did everything they promised .
2	was never screwed by a british purchase .
2	after buying a cctv system both cameras stopped_working after a week .
2	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !
0	every_single time i was speaking to the cust .
2	i recieved both sms and emails regarding the delivery process and the flowers were delivered on time despite using yodel
2	i ordered the flowers for my friends birthday and i received a text to say they ' d received my order , then a text to say the flowers were out for delivery and yet another letting me know that the flowers had been successfully delivered .
0	i live in the uk and sent some flowers to my girlfriend in chicago , us .
2	0 / the goods purchased are excellent .
2	when i received them it is a normal bunch of 00 roses nothing like he ordered , there was no vase either .
0	the chat was so easy to use and ever so quick .
2	tried to contact customer_services by e_- mail twice with not even an acknowledgement to say they had received the e_- mail and would get back to me .
2	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
0	really disappointed with their customer_service and will never buy from them again .
2	i would have no hesittaion in using these_guys again .
2	when i came to trade - in my mobile , i decided to to some research , as many companies have had a lot of bad_press .
2	the service & delivery was exellent , delivered promptly , well_packed .
0	the flowers didn ' t arrive until the 00th_february at about 0pm , by which time they were dead .
0	in the past i ' ve used quite a few different online florists and the service i have received has always been of an excellent standard ( something i expect when paying so much money ) and i wouldn ' t want to tarnish them with iflorist ' s brush but in short , if you are considering ordering from this company then don ' t - you would be better off buying flowers from your local petrol_station .
0	i definitely_recommend their services to one and all .
2	after giving the battery a good initial charge everything was fine when taking photos but as soon as i started to video ( and use the zoom ), sure_enough , i got the low charge indicator for the battery .
2	it was a very user - friendly website , with on - time delivery .
0	family now thinks i do not care and took some convincing that i did make plans for stuff to be delivered .
2	i contacted parcel0go by live_chat .
2	overall i would say that they are very friendly professional and easy to deal with .
0	00 days_later i found out i needed to pay .

2	they managed to deliver plants and flowers to friends and family in december when other_companies , like m & s , would not even accept an order .
0	i then sent one of my guests out to buy a nice bunch at the local_supermarket - cost half the price , were still alive and had a decent amount of flowers in it .
0	thanks mazuma !
0	i believe this awful bouquet i received cost me my first choice wife .

2	i ordered a multi card_reader panel from lindy as it said it was windows 0 compatible , i had purcased various others that were rubbish to say the least from other outlets , this unit is working without_any_problems at all , the only item i was a little bemused at was i had to physically install a driver for windows 0 ( never known that before ) the reader has nice deep entries into each of the card_reader orifices , so there is little chance of bending any pins .

0	order number 000000 !
0	found six old_phones in my draws , sent them over and got over £_00 .
2	you eventually connect to live_chat , where the representative merely repeats endlessly that they are sorry , and that they will rebook for the next_day , etc .
0	i have left several messages to complain to which i have received the same response stating my flowers had been delivered on time but nothing in response to the popped balloon .
0	typed in handset details and got an instant quote , bag came a couple of days_later - in it goes and bye_bye .
0	cant_complain at all
0	i dont reccomend any one uses them .
2	this is the second time i have used mazuma and have found them to be very efficient and providers of an excellent service .

0	secondly i wrote an e_- mail expressing my feelings as i disagree that i should be deducted the damage incurred through postage they haven ’ t even replied - what great service i re - sent the e_- mail 0 days_later as their auto response said a response within 00_hours and still no reply .

2	i would like to say sorry to mazuma .
0	i bought my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer after being recommended from a work colleague .
2	would use again
0	disgusting service and i won ' t use them again .
2	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
2	friend absolutely_delighted with flowers and chocolates .
0	the reply i received was most unhelpful and i was offered no consolation or attempts to keep me 000_% satisfied which is a guarantee they pride themselves on .
0	before this i had it valued with envirofone . com who , because of the damaged outside , offered me £_00 , no thank_you .
0	there are companies that can turn this around alot quicker , i wouldn ' t of sent them my phone if i knew it would take this long - i didn ' t need to sell it if i couldnt get the money within 0 days .
2	i found mazuma very good and quick to endorse my payment this is the second time i have used them i will use again .
2	thank_you , jon .
0	basically given information been wrong so all service gone down .
0	i was amazed as my parcel arrived first thing the next_day , as i ordered only the afternoon before .
2	i expected a lot more for saying bought the grandisimo bunch . but service and communications are second to none .
0	do not use !!!!
0	", which again is a total lie , and i decided to call customer_service the moment i saw that message , which was around 00 : 00 , he told me he was going to mark my delivery as urgent , and the driver would call me in 0 hour or so , regarding my delivery , pure lie , i waited for like 0 hours so i could call customer_service again , the new guy that answered told he could see that i had called before regarding this ( like if it is of any help ), he then checked my phone , which was correct , and told me , that in the next_day , the collection centre ( or something like that ) would call me , and he told me that they would ensure that the driver would deliver it to me , as i told him repeated times that they were lying about the delivery details , cause i was there all the time .
0	!
0	thanks again chloe , i will_definitely buy from sunglassesshop . co . uk again !
0	the only issue i have is the stains it collects from the foods , but it ' s plastic so expected .

0	richard is an asset to parcel0go , and i do wish his abilities , strengths and positive contributions to this company are recognised .
2	it will be my first place to look for any future outdoor_gear , i would suggest others do the same .
2	i recently sold an ipod and a kindle to fonebank and was delighted with the service , price i received and fast payment .
2	the level of compensation is in no way adequate to cover the value of the contents or their replacement .
0	delivery was very speedy , i placed my order on saturday_night for a monday delivery at no extra_cost and they arrived monday_morning , i received a text_saying they had been delivered .
0	i look_forward to receiving my delivery and getting everything setup .
2	if they had listened and taken the appropriate action .
2	there customer service is the worst i have ever known and would definitely be telling everybody i know not to use them in the future .
0	ordered on the thursday , delivered saturday_morning as stated .
0	well , the leap of faith paid off big time as i saved literally hundreds of pounds on rival company prices , the goods were delivered within a week and are in perfect_condition .
0	i needed to transfer a lot of old photo negatives to positives onto my laptop and then print them .
2	when i said i would rather wait for the parcels to be located even if it took longer , i was told it was highly unlikely they would turn_up as they had probably been stolen !
0	mazuma are a great realible and fast sevice .
0	sent my phone off with the paid envelope and the money was transferred over quickly .

0	to top it off the horrible roses we recieved barely lasted the day .
0	i went for a palladium ring , i have since had the valuation and it seems i got an excellent deal !
2	if only everything in life was as simple and effective as parcel0go
2	the last and final time we will ever use this company was when we shipped a consignment of two packages to a british embassy in a foreign country .
2	i found this service excellent , it was so easy and your response was son quick .
0	just received the money .
2	won_'_t use them again and expect that the cost of raising and posting my cheque will add up to more that the actual packet of seeds .
2	i really hope emma wins the friday day off .
0	i ' ve not yet needed to use the redelivery via text , but i think it ' s fantastic that they give you the option to choose whether you ' d like to delivered to a neighbour or delay delivery for up to two days .
2	friend delighted with her flowers really fresh and beautiful .
2	sarah_hayes helped_me out today because i am not the best computer operator in the world !!!

0	the second experience was with an item that was lost .
0	mazuma_mobile proved to be a considerably easy and quick process , within a day or two i received the necessary documentation to post my old phone to them ( free !)
2	they function also as a search_engine to bring you the best priced courier service for different prices , and display them in an easy to understand format , the whole_process from beginning to end takes a couple of minuits
2	i . e .
0	the money was in my account with a week !!
0	the service was excellent loved it :) thank_you x
2	flowers were due on saturday , received no call .
0	why would they not make this clear and let us pay when we pay for delivery ???
2	i sent the phones and two days_later i had the checks .
0	one very happy customer
2	your new small parcel service is convenient , secure , great value and often takes less time than officially quoted .
2	the variofocals and fit are not as good as last time i ordered them .
2	still_waiting for the flowers to arrive . delivery driver claims left secure in the back of property , the back of property is sealed off with a 0ft fence with no access gate , so unless he threw them over the fence or dug a tunnel to crawl under the fence , then i am at a loss as to how he left them secure . the only conclusion , is they were not delivered to the requested delivery address . the day has_been spoiled by the non delivery but i will press to get refunded or a very good reason as to why not .
0	whilst the situation didn ' t go as planned leaving me a little frustrated ( canon saying there was nothing wrong with the camera ) this was not digitalrev ' s fault and they were very sympathetic .
2	i was very happy with mazuma '_s service and would use it again .
2	in a word excellent !!!
0	the service and delivery from this company perfectly reflects the high_quality product they are selling .
0	they email you to let you know all was well and they also let you know when they post your cheque .
2	!

2	on the 00th , when there was no further update on the tracking_system and the parcel still had not been received , i attempted to call interparcel again ( their website stated they were open till midday ) and just continuously got an answer machine message_saying the office would reopen after the august bank_holiday (??).

0	i made two complaints as both of the bunches i bought were a minuscule bunch of flowers and were ' waiting to bloom ' as one of your computers told me , to which i thought was a person replying to me but no it appeared to be a computer replying to me as i received the same message over and over .
0	and they paid close attention to my design brief and interpreted my less_than brilliant drawings superbly .
2	definitely recommend using these_guys .
0	i have emailed them twice and asked them to phone me and have requested a full_refund twice .
