2	so easy to do .
0	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .

2	the bouquets ordered and delivered have always been of a very high_standard !
0	i can ' t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person who doesn ' t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
0	no collection for two days , parcel couldnt be delivered before the required date .

0	order no 00000

0	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
2	however my recent order to my aunt who has terminal cancer was appalling and embarrassing .
2	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before_christmas .
2	the stems were excellent and the directions for caring for them were enclosed .
0	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .

0	gave my friend pat a pair and he absolutely loved them !!
0	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .

0	0_stars !
2	delivery failed for a freinds birthday .
0	the person i was speaking to just didn ' t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
0	she was friendly , patient and professional throughout .
2	i have been unable to access all of my orders on parcels0go statement if colleagues use their own email_addresses instead of the registered one , the orders do not show on the history or the statement making it impossible to reconcile the cash balance on the account .
0	we got a bundle including cleaning kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
2	since purchase i '_ve been on two of my daily 0 . 0 mile walks and the only external sound i '_ve heard was when an ambulance in full flight passed me a few feet away and i just heard a vague whisper of its sirens / two tones .
2	ive posted a photo of the pile pf poo the shop sent for 00 . 00 .

0	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
2	they were excellent value for money .
2	well_done !
0	the only potential word of caution is that they get by with no import_duty by claiming the value to by £_00 or so .
2	easy to do , very quick payment . i would do this again .
0	i will strongly_recommend your company thanx to the staffing of such professionals !
0	had a few questions about using some of the international services and emma found local information on the carrier in greece quickly and efficiently .
0	so now i have a very unhappy wife who thinks i forgot about her flowers for christmas and no response as to when or if they will be delivered
0	hi from russia )
0	delivery was quick and on time .
0	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !

0	great price , delivered next_day using a decent courier ( ups ), well_packaged , rang to confirm company name ( delivered to work ), was very polite and friendly on phone .
0	i ordered a bouquet for a friend ' s birthday which was supposed to consist of white roses and purple freesias and paid extra to include a further 00 %.

2	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 . meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves . yes . as good as half the amount i paid .
0	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
2	a very fast and efficient service .
0	i was updated all the way through with the process - unlike cash0phones who i have had to ring 0times and now threatened legal_action aswell as sent the managing_director a message on linkedin advising i have sent a complaint to watchdog - which i have - all to no reponse but they can send reminder letters about my sisters phone i enquired_about sending !!!!
2	. a contrast to yodel - i paid extra for their 00 hour service rather_than use my usual cheap courier , myhermes .
2	parcels are collected when they say they will be and delivered undamaged to their destination when they should be .
0	i ' m very happy that hi -_fi tower providing best service .
0	:)
0	what more can you ask !
0	eflorist may be slightly_cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer_service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
0	it was impressive watching the dhl_tracking status update from_hong_kong to germany , from germany to london and from london to the north_west in less_than a day ( it was dispatched on the tuesday ).
2	use an amazon local voucher tyo buy flowers , but on the checkout page you have to enter payment details even for a zero balance !
0	in well under a week i had received a replacement they had obtained from icebreaker .
0	thank_you .
2	this company have got it spot on .
2	sending the phone was straightforward - i chose to pay for signed for delivery but could have use the freepost label if it had been a less expensive phone .

0	thank_you crownbrush *****
2	all good apart_from that !
0	thanks a lot
0	my only comments would be 0 ) to add more design options for personalised cards and messages and 0 ) to maybe have an option for a sunday delivery - this is something offered by very few online flower delivery services and i think this would set serenata apart_from competitors if they could offer this service .
2	my postie delivered them at 00 . 00am today ( saturday ).
0	was unsure at first as the branding makes it look like a scam .
0	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .

2	i won_'_t hesitate next time - it will be mazuma first every time .
2	the whole_process from purchase to receiving the goods was excellent .
2	received email day after posting saying that it was being_processed at full value .
2	all your online people keep doing is saying it will be rebooked for the next_day with no sense that this cannot go on forever and at some point complaints have to be escalated .
0	i would highly_recommend them .
2	a request - can you do balloons as well ?
2	i have used parcels0go to send several parcels out using yodel and even_though using the yodel 00 hour service so far 00_% of parcels were delivered to customers the next_day .

2	as a matter of interest i took this parcel along with other items to post to local post_office & was quoted £_00 . 00 00hr service which included insurance to cover up to £_000 , interparcel was £_00 . 00 including additional_insurance_cover & vat to me that is extremely_competitive and interparcel will get all my future business .
0	a recent issue i had catherine sorted for me and was brilliant , if everybody was like her the world would be a better place .
0	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
2	i then had to drive to the nearest parcelforce depot to send the parcel to arrive the next_day .
0	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .

2	surprise , surprise , the flowers i ordered had doubled in price !!
0	thanks alot david .
0	i have not received any reply apart_from a pathetic automated_response and there online_chat doesn ' t work .
2	it came expertly packed less_than 00_hours after ordering it , and was even better_than described !
0	!
2	my gran ( age 00 ) lives in a multi - storey block of flats .
2	the only tiny improvement i could think of would be if plants were included too .
2	i ordered in the morning and the flowers arrived early the same day as promised .

2	please tell the driver , though that some people they deliver to , might be elderly or disabled and just need a few more seconds to get to the door , so they don_'_t have to struggle to get the flowers up from the porch floor , plus a smiley face offering a lovely surprise is as special as the flowers !

0	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i ' ve heard that one before !
2	so i think i have pretty_much heard and witnessed all that can happen from both_sides of the business .
0	i ordered the flowers on the tuesday_afternoon to be delivered to a london office the following_day .
2	recommend country_house outdoor , and will use in the future .
0	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
0	well i guess you get what you pay for .
2	couldn_'_t believe_how quick they arrived .
2	have called to ask for assistance and they have been extremely_helpful every time .
2	would not use this company again .
0	i ' m confident that ' s not going on here , my experience followed the same path as all the other positive_reviews i ' d heard about them and i ' m beginning to think that the negative_reviews are from people who ' re bitter about us not paying vat with dr . seriously , what ' s with everyone blowing a gasket that i ' m buying it cheaper_than they are ??
0	i ' m dealing_with human beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
0	i would reccommend to anyone .
2	we gain a superior product , quickly & securely at a vastly reduced cost ….
0	i must ' ve phoned him at_least 00 times before buying the ring - and by the time i placed the order - i was very short of time !
2	could not believe the discounted price 😀.
2	i '_ve bought 0 or 0 cameras and several lenses and other accessories now from digitalrev and they have never disappointed .
2	shirt was good too - and size and fit for both were perfect - exactly as advised and ordered !
2	wow , generous or what ?
0	a0 service , envirophone took_forever bt mazuma , better_than_expected & would use them first nxt time without a shadow of a doubt .
0	took less_than a week to sell my mobile and have the cash in the bank and its very simple to do . :)
0	the flowers are also very beautiful and i have always had comments from recipients about how lovely the flowers are and how long they last .
0	the item arrived very quickly , and included a free lolly .
2	the flowers plus a few words from the heart bought the desired effect and she rang to say how beautiful they were and thank my husband & i .
2	judi
0	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
0	really thrilled and they have save christmas
2	while ordering , due to the bank troubles , the order seemed to be placed three_times , then cancelled .
0	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
0	very fast and reliable service .
2	so simple so freindly thanks again
2	stumbled_upon this supplier thro google .
2	there '_s lots of choice and the free delivery is a big plus too .
2	great for the current weather , and my forthcoming hol - if i sit on them on the aircraft , i '_ll know where to come back to for another pair .
0	i genuinely have not dealt_with another company that has given better service .
2	she sent photos and she '_s right they are lovely , i '_ve used serenata several_times now and not been disappointed once .
2	avoid interparcel at all costs !!
2	as if .
2	only a refund will due now , both serenata and yodel are not doing all that is claimed on the website , totally_unacceptable .
2	incredible .
0	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
2	00 / 00 from me .
2	richard_mileham from parcel 0 go - very fast and efficient with friendly communication .
2	received notification they had the phones and money was in my account 00_hours_later .
0	there are a lot of sites out there offering maybe £ 0 more but i have heard some terrible things .
2	prompt responses by email , pack to return and payment made very swiftly .
0	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
0	i have emailed customer support twice now but still not got a reply back .
2	they want to know more .
2	they snootily pointed_out that the small_print says they can '_t guarantee delivery on the specified day .
0	you are an angel
2	in contrast , dealing_with mazuma was a breeze .
2	i needed some sandals in a hurry and did not order until after 0pm .
2	having used mazuma_mobile for the 0nd time , i find there service is second to none .
2	many_thanks ron
2	wonderful service , would not_hesitate to use this site again and will recommend to friends .
0	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
2	we have used p0d as our intermediary to arrange 00 hour courier delivery for a number of years .
2	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
0	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
2	i ordered flowers for my two sisters from seranata .
2	i looked at other recycling sites but they seem to want to pay second_hand prices but want pristine_condition phones .
0	another complaint and 0 weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
2	appalling service i cannot understand all the positive_comments .
0	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn ' t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
2	tommy gemmell , schottland
2	the delivery was a 0 day service and scheduled for today - yodel completely failed on that one , so fingers_crossed they will deliver tomorrow .
0	don ' t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
0	!
2	good choice fast delivery and flowers in good condition when arrived
2	the lady , danielle , was so helpful , it was such a pleasure communicating with her .

0	i have started using parcel0go as my courier of choice and they have been excellent so far .

2	i have used parcel0go many_times and thay have been very efficient .
2	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .
0	i will_definitely be using them again :-)
0	they are very happy for you to try before you buy , and there is always someone who can answer the most technical and obscure queries .
0	mazuma offered a great price for my phone , got the pre_- paid envelope out to me in no time , processed the phone almost_immediately after receiving it and paid me the next_day .
2	this isn_'_t a reputable company and i would certainly not deal with them again .
2	i will_definitely_use them again and recommend them to all my friends and family .
2	the player that i bought was exactly_what i needed and my husband is thrilled with it .
0	not to metion the gf who was upset !

2	i complained to them online as they conveniently have no telephone_number available to contact them with .
0	highly_recommended
0	after trying to trade in stores , needing to take a charger and queuing became a bit of a downer .
0	i had her wait there until 0pm but unfortunately the flowers didn ' t arrived until after this time ( this was a friday_night and so they were not picked_up until the monday ).
0	apart_from holidays bought from very well_known holiday companies this is easily the biggest single purchase i have ever made over the internet .
0	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
0	i will_definitely be buying more from them !
2	we are an auction house and i was organising a courier service for a client .
2	i will buy again and i ' m very happy with my little set .
2	you get emails to tell you when envirophone have checked your phone , also a email when you will get your money , great service will be using them again .
2	great service
0	amazing !
0	before purchasing there is a section that says ask the expert , which was inactive and failed to provide me with support .

0	i wanted this problem resolve it quickly so i chose the option repayment parts .
2	unfortunately i wouldn_'_t be home .
2	great service , quick and easy to order and the flowers were of great quality .
0	because i live a little way away from the post_office and i am at home a lot , i found that the parcel0go service was brilliant .
2	thank_you interparcel for outstanding and very competitively_priced service .

0	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go elsewhere .
2	i bought a pinocchio outfit for my daughter to wear for book day at school , was a bit_worried that it wouldn_'_t turn_up on time and may be too small but it arrived just in time and fitted_perfectly .
2	very polite , helpful and waited in seconds for my answer which info was spot on
2	i '_ve used parcel0go on a number of occasions now .

0	they were bang on with the estimated_delivery date as well .
0	i would strongly_advise people not to order from this company !
0	ive been to most of the main london pro audio stores and very few compare to the all_round quality of production rooms !
0	would 000_% use again !

2	bought to go over prescription glasses .

2	i have only today received a full_refund - weeks after the company failed to deliver the flowers .
0	everything from this company arrives very fast & their products are always of the highest_quality .
2	well_done samantha would not_hesitate to use live_chat again hope they are all like samantha .

0	can ' t say enough good words about them .
2	sammie was super helpful when i asked a question about which selection to use from one of the drop down menus and offered to do the whole_process for me .

0	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
0	thanks parcel0go
2	this does not help me in the slightest other than tell me what i already know .
2	giggear state their suppliers have let them down , but there was no mention of zero stock or delayed delivery when the order was placed .
2	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
2	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
0	not a single glitch when buying an engagement_ring .
0	if only all customer_services could be this helpful !
0	will use again .
0	great job guys !
0	don ' t think it should be me out of pocket due to a delivery driver taking it to the wrong place !

0	0 .
0	the flowers turned_up at the office at 0pm and it was only by pure luck someone was still in my office to sign for them , but considering i ' m on holiday now till the 00th of february (!!!!
2	timely emails
2	i expect this update to be ignored as well .
2	simple to do , realistic_prices and quick .
0	at this point i emailed to cancel the order . to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
0	i needed a few extra quid to pay off my bf for the last bit of my holiday . i was working but i needed to start saving i knew about mazuma and remembered that they send free post bags etc . i was trying to do it through another site before but i had to send it off myself this gave me no motivation so i never bothered .
2	very quick and easy with very good comunication via e_- mail
0	this did not happen either .
2	she sorted_out my issue really efficiently , way0go emily :))
2	obviously not groundbreaking but certainly different and all the more pleasant to do buy from them .
2	spoke to rose on the live_chat who gave the the address of the nearest parcelshop .
2	after work i received another " omg message from sylvia who received the pink orchids ".
2	they gave me a good price , the admin was easy and the money was sent to my account quickly .
0	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs . t
0	and bang , a lovely person called gemma was there , immediately cheering me up by being really friendly and putting smileys etc !!
0	they weren ' t the highest offer compared to others , but having read some bad_reviews of other_sites , and seen a whole range of companies i ' d never even heard of i stuck with mazuma .
0	0 .
2	all - in - all , not much to complain_about .

2	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
2	i would definitely_use again and not_hesitate to recommend to friends .
2	i have ordered two_pairs of raybans from selectspecs in the last three_months .
0	when i returned i found no sunglasses waiting for me .
2	looking further the flowers went to the courier the day before due delivery date and have no been transported around various couriers depots for the last three days !!!
2	very reasonably_priced , but no economy with the quality of flowers or service !
2	very friendly company - would highly_recommend them .
0	always send flowers .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone , they quickly sent me a reasonable quotation via_email within a couple of hours of filling out the form , i sent the item to them and they literally had the package for half a day before i had my money transferred to me .
0	they provide good quality , cheap brushes that i can ' t really fault .
2	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
2	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
2	lovely flowers , well_presented and quickly delivered .

2	serenata_flowers made the whole order easy .
2	ordered from the uk , excellent service and very speedy delivery .
0	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
0	sent off on wednesday , paid on friday !
0	it ' s something that should be valued much higher in businesses :-)

2	better price than uk , delivered quickly and safely without hassle .
2	i booked a courier on line today i was nervous but it was so easy .

2	( but it was all fine , really ).

2	i couldn_'_t find an invoice and emma at your chat_window tracked it down in seconds .
0	one even on a saturday .
2	it would be unprofessional of me to mention who this other company is , but remember that if you find a seemingly better offer for your phone , read the reviews on trustpilot or similar before dealing_with that company , and make_sure you read their fine print !
0	called on 00th was assured they would be delivered that day .

0	he sourced the mic , contacted me the next_day with an expected arrival and delivery date , and offered me a good deal .
2	i shall_certainly use this firm again and recommend it to others .
0	i found that out of all the mobile recyle companies that mazuma have the edge over them and are very reasonable prices given and that they accept mobiles that are not working and they are helpful , they keep to their promise and process the phones and money on the same day i ' ll definately recomend mazuma to my family and friends
0	**_update **

0	best customer_service i ' ve experienced in years

0	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
0	i ordered my udg cd wallet 0pm monday , it arrived very swiftly approx 00am the next_day !!!
0	great service , quick replies and all sorted .

0	the payment of £_00 . 00 was already taken from iflorist and the time and date that their payment was agreed for was not met .
0	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .

0	i placed an order with sunglasses_shop for some fairly expensive custom oakley_sunglasses , something which this website informed me would take on average 0 days before being dispatched and would have a trackable delivery .

0	0_stars to digitalrev .
0	hi
2	great service goods despatched promptly well_packaged and the best price i could find for this product , ok i did find them at £_00 but guess they would have been a cheap copy of the real thing
0	stop thinking about buying from them and just do it , it ' s a great way to keep the costs reasonable on an otherwise piss - taking hobby ( when it comes to uk pricing , the hobby itself is obviously great ).
0	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
0	but , i ordered it on monday lunchtime , and it arrived wednesday lunchtime !

0	will use again !

0	dear rob and steph and sam thanks in deed .
2	excellent service .
2	they kept to the estimated worth they had given for my phone .
2	the flowers were dying within a day of receipt .
0	did leave with neighbour even_though that wasn ' t requested , which was slightly worrying .
0	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
2	had a query and used the chat service and was connected to ashley .
2	i did use special delivery and increased the insurance_cover , but the phones arrived_safely , and the payment was made within hours .
2	having recently upgraded to iphone 0 '_s , my family used mazuma to recover some of the cost by recycling our old iphone_0gs '_s .
0	this site is awesome !
2	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
2	despatch very timely and received next_day .
2	i am very happy with the service provided .
0	excelent job !
2	ordered for the first time from e florists
2	i am so impressed by the service this company offers .
0	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn ' t seem at all concerned .
0	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
2	i had 0 phones sat in a drawer .
2	noel mobio ( bobby ) from london .
0	my only_gripe , ( and it is a minor one ); all the documentation was in japanese - not a big deal since the english pdf can be downloaded from canon ' s website .
0	would definitely order from this website again .
0	andrea was very helpfull and explain everthink with no time , thank_you
2	excellent quality .
0	i though might be longer then what i have expect but was very fast thank_you .
0	email_updates_throughout the process .
0	then to top it all off there isnt a telephone_number to call , just a typing service !
2	i am sure that i will be using it in the future and will hopefully make more sales now that i can quote a cheaper price than [_external_reference_].
0	the order process was easy , then i was getting email_updates re my order and then had an update once it had been delivered the next_day !
0	i do highly_recommend it .
2	!
0	they take your hard_earned money then send you an_email and deliver the flowers when they feel_like it .
2	we ordered a £_00 . 00 bq to be delivered to where we work in halifax .
0	due to an overwhelming amount of demand in your delivery area for valentine ’_s day , our local_florists have not been able to fulfil your order .
2	!
2	as a special thank_you , my husband has treated me to the most beautful pair of diamond_earrings .

0	so i strongly advice not to use this website and get your money ' s worth somewhere_else .
2	i am impressed with the service seems incredibly that i can get my camera and two lens 0 days before an order placed on the same day with amazon bearing in mind i am in west_yorkshire and the camera was in hong_kong
2	i recieved some flowers today , from my daughter in canada they were not suppose to be sent until the 0th but came today on the 0th for mothers_day , i dread to think what they would be like then , i feel for my daughter who has paid to have these delivered to me for mothers_day , you could buy a better bunch at supermarket i am discusted to think they could send such a bunch and charge my daughter a lot of money .
2	the only reason i ask is that mum is fascinated by the flowers in the polynation bouquet , some she has never seen before and would love to know more .
0	cant_complain !
0	. so i ' m still not too sure how our old_mobiles are worth money these days and they never used to be but this is now the second time i ' ve used mazumamobile and they ' ve been brilliant .

2	great service and product
0	lots of thx emma
0	i read some reviews that were either penned by someone whose first language isn ' t english or by someone whose is but they clearly have no regard for spelling and grammar .

0	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
2	what '_s the point of using serenata ?
0	thanks !
2	i will deffo be back .
0	i thought there may be some hidden conditions attached due to the cheap pricing of the product , however this was not the case and they guarantee free shipping on their website with covered insurance ( not many sites do this ) and my mind was put at rest .
2	i asked her what they were like and she said lilies and red gerberas and two yellow_roses .
2	i emailed webtogs asking about how to care for the down jacket as there is no label in it - i received a helpful email promptly .

0	once again i think it ' s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
2	very easy to use , excellent directions , very quick payment .
2	service off p0g is second to none , brilliant x
0	i ' m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i ' ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i ' d say is pretty good .
2	reasonably_priced too .
2	will be using them again .
2	a refreshing_change in today '_s world to find proper service , help and back up when you need it .
2	thanks daniel for a speedy answer to my query .
0	no controlaba bien la web e hice varias comprar accidentalmente y tan solo pague una .
2	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
2	same when i ordered my hunter wellingtons , superb .
2	customer service is second to none .
2	my sunglasses arrived the next_day as promised , they are really great quality ray - bans and at a fantastic price , such a big saving on the recommended retail price .
0	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0 weeks to replace the faulty unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
2	fast and efficient staff .
0	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather

2	i will_definitely_use them again .
2	sent the same phone to envirophone who falsely claimed the phone had an issue and tried to knock £_00 off their offer !!!
2	however , speaking online with a consultant from digitalrev put me right as to what to do .
2	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something_else .
0	sarah_hayes was fantasic x
2	the flowers arrived at almost 0 . 0pm and were disgusting .
0	though once we had finished sorting this out , the driver all of a sudden turned_up anyway .
0	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
2	throughout the order and shopping process , music matter kept me updated about the progress of my order .
0	had a quick query to do with an order i was in the process of making , and had a fully professional and prompt response to the query from the agent i spoke to ( samantha ).
2	i scanned florist websites for next_day delivery so late tuesday_evening ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) never thought i would find anyone , then came_across serenata_flowers . com .
0	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely_recommend these_guys .
0	just what i neededt !
2	i just picked floraqueen from a list of florists that could deliver floral tributes to an address in brussels and fortunately it turned_out to be an extremely good choice as the service , ordering and communication was superb throughout .
2	i checked my bank_account and sure_enough my money was there .
2	parcel0go '_s service is quick efficient and i particularly like the ability to have a live_chat when i have a non standard requirement .

0	they are worse than useless - the entire company !
0	fantastic - would defo_recommend .

2	the payment was in my account a day later .

2	why didn_'_t i use them before ?
0	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena_flowers .
0	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn ' t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
0	i ' ve had great service now , for over 00 parcels .
2	ian
2	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
2	it prompty arrived on my doorstep and was wrapped extremely well and protected from any knocks it might have had on the way .
0	all items present and working well .
0	about 0 months_ago i thought i would dig out my old_phones ( which were just lying_around gather dust ) and see if they were worth anything .
0	i emailed them about it last_night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
2	i am moving home and emma took the stress out of this for me , made me feel easy and relaxed , i will be reccomending this service to my employer , as they are always looking for quality and customer service , just like i recieved from emma , i cant thank her enough , parcel 0go here i come , goodbye royal_mail .
2	i have bought other items for my golden oldies disco from hi -_fi tower because i have always believed since i started as a dj in 0000 , that there is no reason_why discos should cause damage to your eardrums , or sound badly clipped .

2	will use again .
2	i recently_purchased a high end pair of beyerdynamic headphones - i called hifiheadphones in advance and talked through my options - they reccommended a pair of headphones much_cheaper_than my original decision - although in the event i went for the expensive ones anyway .

2	never used this service before but having registered the web_site was straight_forward and simple to navigate .
0	ive spent far less at flower shops and got a lot more .
0	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
2	serenata promise a full 000_% guarantee / refund of not satisfied .
0	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum loved them and didn ' t know the difference !
0	after such appalling service , i would never use parcel0go again .
2	i '_ve now got a quality brand of toaster , and it works beautifully , and it also looks good in the turquoise colour - but they have plenty of other colours to suit most kitchens , and with other matching items as well .
0	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
2	very few issues and always dealt_with quickly and compensated .

0	really please
0	could not reccommend the service i received any better_than 000_% perfect .
2	i bought a barbour_jacket from country_attire at christmas and was very pleased with the buying experience but then just three_months later a press stud popped off . given what i paid for the jacket i was a bit put out and i e_mailed the company for advice . i did that at about 0 . 00 pm and was rather amazed when i got a reply within less_than five_minutes and very helpful it was too . i was given clear_instructions as to what i had to do which entailed sending the jacket back to them , at no charge to me . in no time at all i got a reply ; they agreed the jacket was a write off and offered me the choice of a credit on my account or i could chose a replacement . sadly the jacket i had was no_longer in stock so i picked another which was more_expensive but i was given some money off as a good will gesture and before i knew it they had delivered it . to be honest i actually prefer it to the other one . i can say without_hesitation this company offer a first_class courteous efficient service way beyond my expectations and i would not_hesitate using them again or recommending them to anyone_else . i dealt_with liam , who should be congratulated on doing a very good job . if there was a six star_rating i ' d give it .
0	very pleased with my order .
2	ready for the next party thank_you
2	in summary , products seem fine and cheap .
0	what a simple website .

0	today i was making some work enquirers to parcel0go via the web chat .
0	i ’ ve done my research and after checking out 00 different recycling websites i have to say this is definitely the simplest .
2	i ' m most impressed with the broad tonal range of these speakers .
2	great quality , well sized , very good value for money .
2	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
0	always worth checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
0	!
0	another of my favourites is the b00 angle blush brush , it also feels soft and luxurious whilst still being dense enough to apply colour evenly and is great for contouring !
2	and determined to do some detective work . she traced it .
2	i was refunded really quickly too .
2	brenda clarkson
2	thank_you .
0	transglobal depend on successful rate but are not prepared for a complex case which is the worst thing for a company . a small issue can not be solved and it takes months .
2	i regularly sell a few bits and bobs on ebay and always use parcel0gofor the heavier items .
0	not much else i can say other than it was very simple .
2	and to top it all , they have now protected their facebook and twitter pages so i cant ( and others ) from contacting them that way .
0	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
0	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
0	their service is 0 ***** and when you send a phone off you generally have the money paid by faster payment the day they receive it .
0	sarah_hayes has brighten up my day - thanks for all your help and good news
2	huge_range , excellent service , and next_day delivery !
2	very very impressed with webtogs .
0	can ' t fault them :)
0	placed order on the tuesday and had received payment by the friday .
2	took only 0 days to arrive , in first_class condition and packed in military style .
2	i think it depends on which carrier is chosen when making the booking .
2	the lady that helped_me was quick and efficient and very patient , she resolved the problem i was experiencing straight_away .
0	top_notch .
0	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
2	much_cheaper_than the post_office .
0	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
2	great choice , ease of purchase and excellent service as well
0	also , i did a mistake whilst registering my order , and my chat assistant , sam , was incredibly rapid and efficient ; he fixed my mistake in no time while answering my questions .

0	would definatly recommend to others !
0	when you place your order they give you a date your item will be ready for .
0	thanks !
2	don_'_t worry_about the fact that they are an online store , it is a piece of cake to return things if they don_'_t suit .
2	note : it cost me £ 0 for special delivery but the post_office informed me that if i hadn_'_t and it had gone_missing i would not receive compensation for it even if the value was under £_00 as it was a mobile_phone .
0	the quality is also perfect , my wedding_ring bought elsewhere as we were given some vouchers has alreadt had to be redipped after only a year , my engagement_ring however , from diamondgeezer is still perfect x
0	good prices and delivered quickly will order from them again .
2	auna 0000 speakers are just what i wanted , so much so i am going to buy another pair - the company not only supplies great products , but cares enough to go the extra_mile to give its customers the best value and service .
0	will use this florist again .

2	after searching online for the best price for my new camera , digitalrev . com was by far cheapest .
0	having heard many bad_reviews on various sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn ' t want to do that .
0	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
0	absolutely outrageous !
2	[_name ] said parcel0go are carrying out a full investigation and if they find the parcel as well as the refund they will send the parcel back as well .
2	excellent service . highly_recommended
2	i will have to get the lens changed , and pay the high_street price .
2	after_reading_reviews to ensure they were a reliable site i tried to order - unfortunately , as the company is based in hong_kong , my bank secure system wouldn_'_t clear the purchase .

0	free p_& p too .
0	they also supplied me with a uk plug adaptor and paid my import_tax .
0	after my order was dispatched , i recieved an_email telling_me my package would arrive between the 00th and the 00th of january - it arrived on the 00th completely intact and pristine .

0	as per service - really quick service and delivery .

0	although many ppl have told me only request for cheques and dont give in your bank_details as a payment_method .
2	couldn_'_t be_happier and i will use tom sawyer again with no_hesitation !
2	have been using for several_years .
0	she was very surprised and happy with the flowers .
0	highly_recommended !
0	i have read negative_reviews but in my opinion if you send you old phone in and it is exactly as it should be meeting the criteria then you will be paid the full_amount simple !
0	i expect more_than a full_refund as an_apology for your appalling customer_service .
2	i had no_problems with exchanging my friends 0 phones for some pocket money for her .
0	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name ] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don ' t bother you won ' t get a response .
0	i routinely order flowers from australia to send to my friends and family in the uk , the website is so easy to navigate .

2	they keep you informed every_step of the way and do what they say they '_ll do : refreshing and reassuring .
0	their website openly advertises the difference_between next_day ( 00h ) and two day ( 00h ) consignments on their inviting website , what they don ' t tell you is that if you pay a premium for a 00h service , you shouldn ' t apparently expect a next_day delivery .
0	i placed my order with mazuma yesterday , i choose to send my phone special delivery using the printed label , i recieved an_email this morning confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made to my bank_account today .
2	thanks darren

2	imagine my disgust when i received an_email from my friend to tell me that she had waited in the whole day and had received a phone_call from " in full bloom _ park city " early that evening informing her that they would deliver her flowers that evening .
2	easy to follow_instructions .
0	this has never been my experience with ' parcel 0 go ' they have always been most helpful even when the problem is of my own creation , they are also very quick to resolve issues .
2	on monday i found out how to contact your instant messanger help and was assured it was to be collected that day .
2	just installed a smith space saver hydronic heater coupled_with a room stat works perfect
2	i sent my phone by special delivery to mazuma on a thursday_lunchtime .
2	she then posted a picture on facebook for me and all our relatives to see .
2	debbie x
2	this was the second time i have used serenataflowers and they were just as brilliant as the first time .
0	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
2	i did however receive a full_refund for them .
0	buying an engagement or wedding_ring should be a fun and happy experience , and the guys at diamondgeezer made sure it was .
2	i thought i was doing a shrewd bit of business by not going to specsavers but how wrong i was .
2	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
2	now this site won_'_t let me rate at zero_stars
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to order from this company again .
0	really like the option to print off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
2	many_thanks to sammie
2	i would highly_recommend parcel0go to anyone .
0	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
0	wouldn ' t have even thought about it but happened to see an advert on the box and thought " why not ".
2	i rang them , spoke to conor and was completely confident in placing my order with them .
0	best regards
2	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
2	i use it all the time to send books all over the world and have never had cause to complain .
0	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they ' d found a fault with my phone .
2	a when you get a problem there is a ' live helper ' link not too far away .
0	and what i thought was a hopeless request , was transformed into something that might actually work out now by her as well !!
0	also item was very good value for money .
0	straight to the point , all done and finished within minutes .
0	thank_you parcel 0 go .
2	i would really recommend serenata_flowers with out any hesatation the service they provide is second to none the flowers are really really good
2	very helpful !
0	i was kept_informed_throughout whole_process , my order was delivered on thursday 00th_june_0000 at around 0am , by a lovely delivery driver .
2	the friend who was the recipient was thrilled to bits with the bouquet … and she skyped me so that i could see how fabulous it was .
2	absolutely 0st_class customer service , unbelievably quick , from sending prepaid_envelope , to acknowledging_receipt of fone , then payment . would def recommend mazuma
2	i had a small query and a quick phone_call to a very friendly member of staff sorted it out .
2	i am totally disappointed and will also report them to trading_standards as i feel its highway robbery !!
0	i then sent my phones on the monday and by tuesday lunch time the money was in my bank , exactly_what they said they would pay me , no questions , no hassle !
0	thank_you nicole your cutsomer service was fantastic !
2	fast service no agro with price a totaly cool experiance
0	this company has made our business look completely unprofessional to a high value client and has tarnished our name in doing so .
2	after non delivery of flowers despite their online tracking_system informing_me that they had been delivered , it took them thirteen days to respond .
0	having placed my order on a friday and choosing their standard delivery option i was extremely pleased when my new headphones arrived on the saturday .
0	i want my money back .
2	thank_you .
2	i turned that into a dispute , they refused to issue the balance of £ 0 . 00 so i have now escalated that within paypal .
0	after looking around on the internet for my chosen model ( nikon_d0000 ) digitalrev offered the best price by quite a substantial margin for the body and a 00 - 00mm_lens , which is great to start with .
0	ordered friday_afternoon - arrived saturday_morning with a free lollipop thrown in for good measure !
0	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
0	great service !
2	i have always found the website easy to use and the choice of carriers ' under one roof ' really helpful .
2	thank_you
0	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
2	i ' m delighted with my purchase .
0	please reply eflorist ?
0	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green leaves .
2	i am very pleased with the service i received from you and very pleased with how my items were packaged and would like to let you know that i will be definitely buy from you again many_thanks
0	i recommend serenata regularly to my friends and would use the service again and again .
0	my boyfriend spent about 00 £ on the iflorist delivery , which i can ' t enjoy and went all the way out to spent more money to ensure i wouldn ' t be left completely disapppointed on our first valentine ' s day together .
0	my favourite brush so far has to be the ' c000 pro dome blender ' as it does a great job of softening any harsh lines and bringing your make up together in a natural finish !
2	i would tell my friend about the site

0	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
0	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it ' s not in perfect_condition - who ' s phone is by the end of a contract period !

0	having just sent off my second old phone and received my argos_voucher back in a couple of days i can highly_recommend this service !, very good communication by email , fast postage of both the pre paid bag and the payment voucher - mush faster_than the alternative of selling it yourself on a well_known auction site .

0	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can ' t accept cosmetic damages !
2	there was no card through the door and so it was obvious no one had attempted a delivery .

0	!
0	my only concern was the live_chat , i have tried a few_times and never anyone there , however the positive was that i emailed them and had a reply within an_hour so that made up for it .
2	discovering parcel0go with a user - friendly website , convenient paypal payment facility and the convenience of dropping my parcels at our local spar convenience store , just yards from us , was just the lucky break we needed .
0	easy to deal with .
0	thank youuuuu , x

0	these things_happen with postal services and i don ' t blame pixamania for this .
2	will never be using this site again and customer service was a joke .
2	they don_'_t actualy employ proper drivers with vans , any old herbet turns up in their old banger , no wonder everything gets broke or ' lost '.
2	wife wants more - a five stone ring - and will use dg again although i couldnt find one on the website .
2	would definitely buy from this company again .
2	it was fantastic value for money , good quality and was delivered promptly .
2	i saw that even_though it was cheaper_than anywhere_else they were not trying to rip me off with the postage .
0	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .

2	very quick service , after sending in mobile cheque arrived within two days .
0	update_: tuesday 00th still no delivery
2	payment for the latest phone i sent them was in my account within_00hrs of me sending it off .
0	it is definitely a lack of customer_service as they didn ' t even border to give him a phone call and let him know what went wrong .
2	i found the whole_process of buying from you stress_free and the product itself did beat my expectation when it arrived .
2	i was very satisfied with the service .
0	the following_day i got an_email to say my cheque had been posted and lo and behold there it was the following_day !!
2	i cant say how amazing this website was and how fantastic the customer_services were when i checked of the order would be dispatched next_day etc .
2	this has to be the worst courier ever and i urge_everyone who is thinking of using them to think again and go back to a reliable service like royal_mail .
2	post_office has had it .
2	i was quoted a good price for two lenses ( sigma 00 - 00mm hsm and 000 - 000mm os hsm ) in one order .
2	i was having problems getting the right info with hermes . a couple of minutes on the chat line and it was fixed . like a paracetamol .!
2	the company charge much less_than parcelforce , dhl and many other carriers .
2	so this is the complaint i have just sent them .
2	contacted mazuma on the net , placed my order , got sent the free pay envelope , sent off my phone , got my cheque .
0	i was really pleased with my order .

2	my order arrived quickly , with free_p_&_p as well , the jackets were well_packaged and very well priced , i would definitely kept one of the two , except for the fact that the style i chose appeared to be in navy rather_than black as_described - although , intriguingly , rab haven_'_t made the jacket in navy !!!
0	quicker_than cashing a cheque !
2	excellent value for money !
2	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
2	do it all online and it '_s a painless operation , i am yet to hear if my money has_been paid direct to my bank and that is the only complaint i could make .
2	all in all , i ' m very happy .
2	i asked him for them to be delivered tomorrow then and he said he cant do that as its past the cut_off date !

0	very nice to chat to plus quick at fixing the problems .
0	i called them ob the website listed number for assistance first to ensure they were real and if would take order over phone after what happened above , this wasnt possible but they were friendly and provided reassurance that this purchase would be as hassle_free as you ' d expect it to be , and that it was !

2	always fast delivery and good service in general .
2	i sent three emails and none were replied to .
0	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren ' t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
0	got a lovely barbour coat with excellent service !
0	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
2	it helps that p0d is based in nearby banbury , so using them is supporting local business , but i have used these_guys to send parcels throughout the uk for a number of years and never been disappointed .

0	obviously this defeats the point of a signed for delivery .
0	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
0	when had query with item , through no fault of bop_dj , replacement received following_day with no need to return original order .
0	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)

2	although i did purchase elsewhere , i would be sure to use webtogs again .
0	i will not get back to iflorist again and i will make_sure all my friends will avoid it as well .
2	i like the idea of paying an extra 00p to have a text_message confirming safe delivery .
0	after getting an_email back pretty_much instantly , i feel as if they are trust_worthy and their products look great and i will be making future_purchases with them
2	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
0	the colour matches my bridesmaid dresses perfectly and they are exactly_what i wanted .

2	they didn_'_t arrive on the day & when they did arrive , looked nothing like the web display .
2	i would sell my old iphone 0 but it is too useful as an ipod
2	this organisation clearly knows what it '_s doing and the process was extremely smooth from beginning to end .

2	we live in a town not in some far flung cave .

2	i believe that the only thing hifiheadphones could have done to improve the service was to have emailed me tracking_numbers for the two deliveries .
2	the selection of available frames is excellent .
0	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .

2	i '_ve never had a bad_experience with any of their couriers and p0g staff are unfailingly helpful , particularly catherine c who contacted me on her own initiative when i was having a small problem with a recipient '_s details and sorted me out within minutes .
2	mazuma_mobile were the best value for money , their process was so simple to follow and very quick .
0	when i took the parcel back and the depot finally accepted it , i was surprised to find that it didn ' t even show up as having been received at the depot and scanned on the tracking for 0 whole days , which was particularly disappointing given that i had paid for a 00 hour delivery service !
2	the jacket is lovely and i am_delighted with it .
0	happy with the price .
0	however , there is 0 tiny little thing you could do to improve to being absolutely perfect . change your delivery company , i haven ' t had any_problems with them personally , but i think £ 0 is a bit_steep for the time it takes .

0	ordered 0 bouquets for delivery , they were delivered on time but were both squashed into a single box . not very special as they got a bit crushed ,
0	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
2	i was told that they would rebook it for the next_day but were not prepared to do anything to placate me or to try and retain me as a customer .
2	i had an issue whereby the wrong collection address had been given , consequently it didn_'_t get collected .

0	terrible , terrible service all_round .
2	( i ask you ): and , secondly , the parcel arrived a day earlier_than stated .
0	i ordered the handbag late friday_night , by monday_morning i had received a email to say my order was on it ' s way and by tuesday it had arrived .

0	no_problems happy with the service i received
0	i will use them everytime i need to send items bigger than what royal_mail allows .
2	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ". but no one ever does .
2	also , i didn_'_t think i ' d be able to order flowers on a sunday_night for next_day delivery but they did it .
2	i would not_hesitate to to recommmend this services to my friends
0	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .

0	every_step was easy with mazuma_mobile , i just put my phone in an old box i had sitting around , sat that in the plastic envelope thing they sent me . popped in my order form then handed it over at the post_office ( finding an open post_office was a nightmare , but that ' s a complaint for someone_else ! )
0	another thing is the travel case ' s that arrived with them were personalised with the name " darren " on them which have absolutely no relevance to myself or my wife .
0	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .

2	i had been trying to find a particular brand and size of wellington and could find plenty in small sizes and the wrong_colour but not what i wanted - i even went into the outlet store of the manufacturer and a very helpful lady tried to track some down but to no_avail , in fact she said they weren_'_t showing on her system at all !!

0	what a pleasant_experience .
2	placed my order on the website , after a few_days ( because of snow ) the envelope arrived .
0	not so bad , confusing information about opening package before signing ( delivery man wouln ' t allow me to do it , though i had instructions from pixmania to do so .)

0	extremely good service and flowers were lovely .

2	what would we do without you mazuma !
2	fast , reliable and no_messing_about .
0	contacted to interparcel .
2	would highly_recommend everyone to use them .
0	think that ' s argos ' s fault tho not envirofone .
0	i am now £_000 the poorer for having dealt_with this store and they are apparently guilt - free for never having fulfilled the most basic requirement of selling something .
0	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
0	my parcel was not collected by yodel , after explaining to richard_mileham at parcel0go
0	they are small and pathetic
2	i have found inter_parcel to be the best web based service for private users .
2	perfect item and perfect service .
0	used them before a few_years_ago , trustworthy and reliable site .
0	both pairs have arrived and both are brilliant quality , i ' ll now be looking to buy more as it ' s always nice to have a variety .
2	and was really impressed as to how easy everything_went .
2	thankfully i was put in touch with ashley who gave a star performance and sorted_out all my worries and amended all the details for me !
0	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
0	i made a mistake with the postage so had to call up .
0	having received such top - quality service i will certainly be shopping with webtogs again , and have no doubt that my grandfather will be a very happy man when he opens his present on christmas day !
2	i don_'_t think you can beat this website for flower delivery .
2	on the morning of the 00th i rang their customer_services to see where things were .
0	what you have to do is just select the phone you want to sell .
0	the free sweets was a nice_touch .
0	the ring was delivered as promised .
0	i think their member scheme is also really handy and is a good way to get people to purchase from them more .
0	what you see is what you get , just 00 times better with a great service .
2	i was not informed that it was the wrong_address , i was informed that there was a delivery hitch your end and you would retry the following_day . why would you state to do that ?
2	don_'_t look anywhere_else !
0	i had a list of products to order and founf them easily and processed an order .
2	ups picked_up the next_day { today ) at 00 am , what more can you ask for .

2	0pm delivery promised - £ 0 . 00 paid + £_00 for flowers .
0	i bought a pair of stella mccartney sunglasses .
0	tryed somewhere_else and had a nightmare .
2	they were not expensive and were quickly dispatched and delivered .
0	kind_regards ,
0	they failed to collect the parcel on the scheduled date , then when i took it to the depot the member of staff that i spoke to said that they were closed and they couldn ' t let me drop_off the parcel despite it already being paid for .
0	nice one webtogs - they deserve every bit of the 0 . 0 out of 00 they ' ve got on here .
2	i found the service polite and helpful .
0	and kept the same delivery slot , despite being well after hours .
2	thought it would take at_least 0 weeks but 0 days amazing
2	the tracking website contained inaccurate information saying that the item had been delivered when it hadn_'_t .
2	truly an awesome service would recommend digitalrev to everyone , great service with package tracking , package arrived within the stated time .
2	i ' m yet to contact them but when i do i will not be happy
2	the rep seemed clueless and so i insisted on speaking to the customer_services manager .
2	on one of my orders the balloon was deflated but customer_services dealt_with it straightaway - i know these things happen sometimes so it will not stop me from using them again .
0	very happy with the service and product selection .
2	other_sites quoted a few_pounds more but i chose mazuma due to its advertising and trusted their reputation .
0	and why don ' t they have their number on their website ?
0	delivery was excellent as well .
0	the best on - line record shop hands_down .
2	the fact it costs me less now means i can charge my customers less , which can only be good for orders .
2	very fast & exxcelent service this is the third time i have used mazuma & it gets better every time
2	many_thanks to all involved
2	visited website on wednesday where i found out how much mazuma were paying for my nokia , friday i received pre_- paid postal packaging , saturday posted phone to mazuma , wednesday received cheque and that included a bank_holiday weekend .
0	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
2	any questions i had promptly . thankyou for your excellent service .
2	they never thought to look up the company on the internet , or contact me for instructions .
0	it was delivered on the day they stated with no_problems .
0	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
2	- fast , no hassle , no scams !

2	the recipient was thrilled .
0	the agent i spoke to , sammie_taylor , was very friendly and helpful and sorted my issue out within_seconds .
2	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
2	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
2	the glasses arrived a few_weeks_later .
2	sold my phone absolutly fantastic service very easy to do i posted my phone in the pre paid envelopethat was sent to me at lunch_time i recieved payment into my bank accountthe very next_morning superfast and would reccomend to anyone
2	i received a beautiful box of flowers from my daughter as a gift as i am going into hospital for a major operation . i was so surprised at receiving them but was even more surprised when i opened them . it was a mixture of roses , greenery and lilies wrapped so neatly and presented so well . the best was yet to come as when the lilies opened they were so big and the colour was stunning . if you ever need to order flowers do not_hesitate to order from prestige you will not be disappointed .
0	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
2	very happy with the service received , recommended to all .
0	i was worried due to the cheap price and free shipping at first .
2	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
0	excellent product .!!!
2	had a problem arranging_collection of a parcel i had booked for collection and then delivery to me but the guy at the other end had no printer for the label .
0	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .

0	every destination has been quick and affordable !
2	kept up to date with progress of order .
2	worth every minute of my time .
0	in short , i am immensely frustrated with serenata_flowers - you have caused disappointment to my mother , inconvenience to my father and have made me look like a complete idiot .

2	friendly team members :- peter_chandler
2	she had loads of patience whilst i scurried backwards and forwards from one room to another trying to establish whether or not the labels had printed .
0	great service .
2	definitely a permanent customer here and i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend them .
0	very easy , convenient and reliable .
0	i was a bit_sceptical about sending the phones first and even worried was it some sort of scam but as it was an old_mobile i would have binned anyway i thought i ' d nothing to lose so gave it a go .
2	unfortunately they were a little bit too big for me so i had to return them for a refund .
2	excellent quick and very easy cheque arrived within a 0 days of sending phone wish i had more phones .
2	also they are willing to solve any_problems promptly with no_fuss .
0	i don ' t know how this company is still in business .

2	prices themselves were not just competitive , but by far the best to be found .
2	all together a very enjoyable_experience .
0	eflorsit said that they can ' t gaurantee next_day delivery with royal_mail . so why allow me to pick a delivery date and not warn me at any point during the order process delivery isnt gauranteed ?!?!

0	my experience with sunglasses_shop has been great .

2	i did get an_email later to say the flowers had been delivered .

0	and the selection is quite good , i must confess i got surprised with the real result , looks way better_than the pictures online .
0	i got £_00 for the two old_phones but the best thing was the ease of the service , pop details of your old_phones into the mazuma website , wait for the prepaid_envelope to arrive ( it takes only a couple of days ), pop your phones in the envelope ( in some bubble_wrap ) along with the delivery note and send back .
0	the payment got sent within two days .

0	after it arrived i realised that all the awesome videos i ' d been watching and the channel i subscribed to on youtube were actually by digitalrev . com :)

2	!
0	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .

0	great .
0	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
2	i ordered the nikon_d0000 after_reading all the reviews both on digitalrev and other_sites .
2	no_problems !
2	.
0	i couldn ' t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
2	issue due to non collection by courier dealt_with professionally and quickly by ashley . at xmas 000_% can '_t be expected considering p0g act as agents for so many couriers some good some bad and they take the flak for all of them .
0	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
0	i would like to say thanks to andrea on live_chat for amending some details on my order .
0	i asked for a refund , got no reply , and then two days_later ( today ) i got an_email_saying my order had been dispatched , which i explicitly told them i did not want as i have decided to get cravats from elsewhere as i do not trust the reliability or credibility of their business .
2	neff baking sheet delivered as_described and promptly .

0	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
0	we ' ll see how that goes .
2	i recently had a parcel picked_up and delivered to me after i purchased it on ebay .

2	i have always insisted on hi -_fi quality , even when running 000 watts rms with 000 revellers .
0	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
0	i am happy with dealing_with you
2	i rang the funeral directors the morning of the funeral and was informed that the flowers had been delivered bright and early .
0	i always use parcelforce as the courier and never had a problem there either .

2	contacted emma and within a few seconds i received a response to my query .
2	everything was explained to me from start to finish , i was even reminded by e_- mail when my quote was due to expire and i sent two mobiles that were not listed with mazuma but they added them to my order without_any_problems .

2	the only reason for my request is that i dont trust the french post .
2	computer froze at the calandar point in the order so contacted ' live_chat ' and was led easily and clearly by operator and we processed a dozen parcels for destinations all over the globe . now we are going out together . no . seriously . it was a great service for something that i thought was going to be difficult and tricky . well_done parcel0go . well_done and thank_you catherine !
0	customer_service is shocking !
0	request them to import an item ( laptop that an employee was using ) from nepal , first of all it was delivered to wrong_address and after chasing them i found out after 0 days it has been delivered to wrong_address .

0	i talked with jessica in the live_chat and she was very helpful .
2	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
0	digitalrev is probably the best company i ' ve dealt_with in quite a while .
2	this is a great service and i am just about to call to order another delivery .
0	product arrived two days before the " expected delivery date ".
0	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
0	i ordered some £_00 headphones from hifiheadphones yesterday at about 0pm .
2	they have a very friendly approach , a good selection , reasonable_prices and the flowers arrive on time - and they keep you informed !
0	been more_than a week , nothing !
2	these cover every item known to man , which then covers them for never paying any compensation out , even when they are proven to be at fault .
0	also another parcel delivered wrong person and not willing to say its them mistake ., so total loss is £_000 from me .

0	most companies these days when you encounter a problem keep you waiting on the end of a phone line and nothing is ever resolved in your favour .
0	have been trying , unsuccessfully to get in touch with them since this morning via live_chat , they have no phone number . completely in the dark !
0	00 out of 00 .
0	to summarise i wouldn ' t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
2	i ordered my rayban sunglasses through fashioneyewear and received first_class service , they use dpd to deliver , i was able to change the delivery date to the following week as i was going to be away at short_notice and you are given a 0 hour time_slot which they kept to .
2	wrote back and told customer service and demanding a full_refund as non - delivery is breech of contract .
2	i would definately recommend them .
2	the ordering was very easy with very clear_instructions on how to measure your size . the follow_up information was quick and traking my order all the way was made easy . overall i was very pleased with the product & fit & the price was perfect
0	they were prompt at responding to emails , and within a couple of days my order arrived .

2	i would definitely recommend envirofone to all of my friends .
0	great service .
2	it couldn_'_t be easier .
0	if i ever have an issue it is resolved immediately by the friendly staff .
2	they called me back within the hour with three suggestions for diamonds and some very good advice .
2	after going through the procedures i received the labels to send the phones off but i had to ring them and they advised me that i was quite local to them so they gave me directions to delivery the phones personally .
2	the roses were just starting to open and the other flowers were in bud but not open .
2	you really did save the day !
2	however p0g did refund my money on one delivery that was made late .
2	posted my phones late one evening , money in my bank the next_day .
2	never again
2	very quick and reliable .
0	the lillies were brown too .

0	can ' t recommend them enough .
0	kimberley x
2	great service .
2	always reliable and deliver quickly , which helps my ebay feedback . today i had a problem tracking a parcel to madeira , fortunately emma , on live_chat had it solved in minutes . excellent service
2	000_% trustworty
0	they paid me exactly_what they said they would and also paid the money into my bank the same day .
2	purchased a nikon 00 - 000mm vr0 and to be honest was very sceptical_about how good the price was but took the gamble .
2	i use p0g regularly , and will_continue to do so .
2	oh_yes , and the flowers are truly beautiful !
2	super quick delivery
2	i was attracted_by the price which was considerably_lower_than most .
2	very easy and rapid transaction , i couldn_'_t be more pleased , would recommend to anyone .
2	interparcel gives you the choice of speed vs price and are usually cheaper_than parcelforce for heavier items and most international ones !
0	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner .) for twenty minutes and threatening various actions they finally_agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
0	she was friendly and clear with her help , and managed to reassure me that the parcel would get through customs fine .
0	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
2	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
0	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
0	good price .
2	i would like to say how easy and pain_free it was to order my new camera from digitalrev .
2	so i sent it back via_royal_mail although i paid a bit more in postage than the max amount they allow ( £_00 ) fair_enough they offered for a courier to pick_up the item but i needed a replacement quickly . soon as they received it , i had a replacement by return post and i am well pleased with the turntable .
0	my advice would be avoid this company .
2	fantastic service , sammie_taylor was more than helpful .
0	i ordered my camera on monday_morning - it arrived tuesday_afternoon ( hong_kong to central_london ).
0	i also think they ' re great value for money ( a 0 day courier which usually arrives in a day anyway for about £ 0 - brilliant !)
0	i just sold my samsung_galaxy_note n0000 with money for your phone and i am very happy with the result .
2	sammie to the rescue , she provided me with a link so i didn_'_t have to type it all in again .
0	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
0	parcel0go offer a good range of courier services , meaning you can chose economy or speed or something in the middle .
2	thank_you
0	i would recommend julesb to anyone .
0	there is no way this got in there after the lenses had been fitted , as one piece was poking out on both_sides of the lense !
0	i addressed in this company the first time and , believe me , it was pleasantly_surprised with professionalism of people which here work .
0	the silver lining .
2	flowers arrived on time , were greatly admired for freshness , arrangement and presentation .
0	hi , i typed to catherine on the livechat feature on the website and she was very helpful and answered my question very quickly .

0	!
0	payment was just as easy and it ' s an added_bonus that i could pay with paypal unlike amazon .
0	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
2	these flowers were a birthday_present for a friend who thought they were beautiful .
2	great company to deal with , i will be definately_use them again :)
0	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !

0	i see no other choice for my headphone needs !
0	honest value and good communication
0	thanks my engagement_ring is perfect !!
0	as another review mentions , it came wrapped as a mummy .
2	the service was very efficient and convenient .
0	the order process was easy and i was kept_updated all the way !
2	my old_mobiles was sat in the kitchen draw , and every time i opened it i saw these old_phones just sat there collecting dust , so when a pal of mine said he had just sold his to mazuma for a really good price and was so happy with the ease and simplicity of using mazuma '_s online forms i thought i ' d try it , so i did and have never looked back .
0	the phone was processed and checked , i opted for the same day transfer and was notified when the money was put into my bank !!!
0	wwwooowww
0	i will_continue to keep using parcelto go for all my shipping needs xx
0	light / smoke machine was exactly as_described .
2	booked on friday to collect monday . nobody turned_up then recieved email_saying nobody here when they arrived , which was nonsense as i was here all day . re - booked for tuesday , same thing , re - booked wednesday , online_chat guy said they couldn_'_t find my address , i said they have my phone number , so please call me !!
0	00 / 0 / 00 still no flowers well i florists i want a full_refund it is to late for the flowers now how can you treat people like this i managed to speak to some one and they told me their lorry got stuck in snow wot a load of rubbish refund please .
2	we need to get a price quickly so we can quote our customer by return and intreparcel enables us to do this .
0	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
2	have used this supplier for my camera equipment for several_years now .
0	honestly can ' t find any fault .
0	amazing !
0	then in the post 0 days_later my pack arrived .
0	i feel this is a major issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
2	hope you will stock more skylanders costumes , as i know i will be asked to buy another .
2	i originally ordered a pair of ray_ban wayfarers from sunglasses_shop and they were delivered the very next_day by courier .
0	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
0	she did not and will not even get to see the flowers .
0	i also spoke to andrea on the chat service whilst going through the process as i was using them for the first time , she was very helpful and guided me through the whole_process .
2	they are very good at taking your money but useless at delivering flowers .
2	my custom is guaranteed .
0	i have never_experienced any major problems when using the p0g service either nationally or internationally .
0	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn ' t know what to say .
2	0 week_later , nothing from them , i followed this up with emails and was told that they hadn_'_t received my request , that was a complete lie .
0	administrator - kingsofcycling
0	as such i did not have the glasses for the trip abroad i had bought them for .
2	arena flowers have plenty of flowers to choose from for all occasions at reasonable_prices
0	ordered flowers for mothering_sunday knowing my mother would be in .
0	from your initial order up until delivery , these_guys keep you up to date with progress by sending an e_- mail every 0 - 0 days with a progress report .
2	whilst i don_'_t buy sunglasses every day , i would have no_hesitation of recommending this company to friends and family .
0	it might still be an_automated email but at_least it ' s with a bit more effort and thought to presentation .
2	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
0	i will shop with them again .
2	never used this company before . very glad i did though .
2	ideal for birthdays , anniversaries or just saying " thank_you "!
2	a great service really please thank_you .
2	so easy getting a price and having the parcel collected from the door is wonderful and thus_far despite using the 0 day delivery options the parcel is usually there within 00_hours and i get a text_telling_me so from the company .
0	waste of £_00 !
0	i used shop by style to find the perfect pair of persol clubmasters .
0	i ' d had my conformation email
2	we shall_certainly use them again .
0	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
2	fast delivery
2	i requested that the hamper be delivered on 00 december .
2	well i was very pleased with my glasses , they are exactly_what i wanted and are genuine goods .
0	where is yours ?
2	they kept in touch with me via text and email , to keep me up to date with my purchase and its delivery !
0	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd ' s next_day premium service !
2	however the driver did turn_up in the vicinity within the time specified , even_though i had to prevent him from driving off after he ' d attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
2	totally my fault - certainly not a fault of your web_site .
0	i don ' t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
2	i am so glad i didn_'_t .
2	love to all the bloom masters .
0	would recommend this seller as service was a0 .
2	normally i would check and double_check reviews before using new company but , thankfully , my lack of research was safe this time !
0	bag arrived_promptly ( taking into account the recent postal disruption with the bad_weather ) and money was credited to my nominated account the same day the phone arrived back .
0	0 .
0	i saw them in a magazine and couldn ' t find them anywhere in the high_street .
0	exactly_what i wanted .
0	delivered relatively quick .
2	plus having the tracking on my parcel made it easier .
2	they '_ve kept me informed of the progress of the order thru text_messages and emails so i could almost visualise where the flowers were .
2	thanks !
0	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
0	this is the first time i have used anything like this website .
0	very reliable service .
2	the item was exactly as stated and arrived at my doorstep very , very quickly indeed .
2	i placed my order on thursday_lunchtime 00th_october , 0000 and tnt delivered on tuesday 00th_october , 0000 , at 0pm .
0	she cancelled the order , gave me a credit to my account and re - ordered it for me , correcting the error .
0	would highly_recommend them .
2	i have been a registered lindy client for ages and lindy know my home address so i can '_t understand_why i wasn_'_t informed as i attempted to complete the transaction .
2	but when you post your phone wednesday lunchtime and receive an_email before lunch the following_day to say the money has_been paid into your account .
2	this of course was untrue .
0	this is the second time i ' ve used mazuma and for the second time the transaction went off entirely without a hitch .
0	i send eflorist an_email basically asking where the hell my flowers were and it was at this point i received the most shocking reply ( see below ):
0	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special occasion .
2	highly_recommended .
0	however digital_rev quickly resolved this via emails and instant chat , sending me out a replacement straight_away .
2	then the nightmare begins .
2	a great service all_round .
2	i wish i could upload picture as proof but suffice to say a bunch from outside a garage would have been better value and less embarrassing .
2	it doesn_'_t take at_least 0 hours to get it to the next city over
0	once this has been completed , you are provided with the labels and simply print off .
0	when trying to explain that point to prestige_flowers , the person who responded couldn ' t quite grasp the obvious and still refused to accept any liability .
2	this is the second nightmare i '_ve had with them and i tried them again because the boss promised me that the poor service i had last time was unusual .
0	i was of course dubious of all these high rating reviews especially after seeing some of the other non - uk stores and their blackhat tactics .
0	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
2	!
2	process many_thanks simon
2	was looking for something a little different and found the repertoire website .
0	he ' s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
0	i ordered my camera , lense and sd_card on monday and it was delivered on thursday using the free shipping option .
0	i use parcel0go as they help me deliver cycle parts to my customers on time and profitably , while still offering very good prices .
2	would recommend to anyone .
0	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i ' d upgraded and need some extra cash to put towards my holiday .
2	nothing bugs me more than a computer printout of my message !
0	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer_service is awful and virtually impossible to get hold of and your flowers won ' t even arrive !
0	this means that nothing has been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
2	in fact i even ' like ' them on facebook .
0	i had a problem with collection today and isabella helped out by re arranging my collection for tomorrow .
2	which we only sent last_minute due to a hiccup in our travel_plans this arrived at their destination at 0 . 0pm on xmas_eve .
2	that is great service - thank_you .
2	serenata sent me blow by blow updates , and the recipient was most grateful .
0	they replied and advised me instantly and rob the advisor sorted out my problem perfectly and was quick , polite and very helpful .
2	i received the postage material within 0 days of agreeing the sale on the website
0	the whole_process of me going on the website to them sending the bag to me posting it back ( all prepaid and just through a normal post box so no hassle there ) and the money hitting my account took less_than a week .
2	my neice sent a photo of them so i could see for myself and they really were gorgeous , not quite in full bloom , but hinting at it and not one flower was in less_than perfect_condition .
0	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
0	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
2	the whole_process was quick and painless .
0	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
0	instead all i hear is the radio playing in the background and loud voice chatter ( all female voices ). and she was quick to hang_up .
2	why ??
2	i can thoroughly_recommend this compay .
2	many_thanks .
2	so , shop with them .
2	recommended .
0	thank_you .
2	the refund was dealth with very quickly and in full .
2	sent my phone off on monday , and had a cheque in the post on wednesday , excellent service , would use again , and recommend to others .
2	i would certainly recommend them .
0	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother ' s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
2	well_done mazuma_mobile , congratulations on your quick , efficient , easy service .
2	to add_insult to injury , when i told them to issue a refund to my paypal_account they issued a partial_refund .
2	!
0	not only are their costs extremely competitive , they are extraordinarily reliable and offer next_day delivery .
2	thanks to it and [_name ] i don_'_t have to stay in waiting for the courier to arrive , it '_s all goooood !
2	i am very pleased with the company , will use their service again
0	i used livechat service and was connected to jessica .
2	using iflorist was so easy - great choice of flowers , easy to accessorize , choice of delivery options and most of all delivery on the day we wanted !
2	clear and glare free , good for driving , fishing etc .
0	( huge plus ).
2	!, the cloud lifted in a few_minutes .
2	excellent service , thought to try it after my daughter recommended it to me .
0	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure enough the dpd van turned_up slap bang in the middle of the slot !
2	i did worry the cups wouldn_'_t fully encase the bad ear , but they do and he finds them comfortable to wear .
2	i am very unhappy .
2	they were dispatched the next_day and arrived the day after .
2	great quote for phone and freepost envelope received very quickly .
0	delivery was free so you tend to think a week would be fair but 0 days is very swift .
2	i rang up for some advice and the fella who answered was very helpful .
2	why would we want another delayed and dead bunch of flowers ?
0	i don ' t buy into this " morally grey " rubbish they preach , it ' s not illegal to import these from abroad and the items are going through customs fair and square .
0	this company i used before because the price i was offerd on market and cash genaraters and places like that was so low for waiting 0 days i got £_00 more then offerd and it was so fast i was shocked is great will_deffo_use again and again
0	the live_chat feature enabled me to make an informed purchase after_speaking with a technical salesperson .
0	nice to deal with a uk_based company that actually understands day to day problems and can answer any question in a quick and professional_manner .
0	i was shocked it was that much !.
0	she was very polite and patient .
2	grandma was elated , the flowers were amazing !
0	i will_definitely be using you again !
2	this was the third time i '_ve used mazuma and they were just as efficient this time as the first time .
2	selectspecs offered to changed them for a a fixed lens pair , but i declined .
2	absolutely_brilliant .
2	after_placing my order , the confirmation , order despatch and delivery were both both quick and efficient and the product is exactly as expected .
2	my order came to £_00 . 00 , the money was taken but they have not got back to me to say why they have not delivered the flowers , or apologise , just nothing .
0	thank_you
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend digital_rev but i haven_'_t used their customer service or returns service so can '_t comment on that .
0	i seen this for £_000 in jessops compared to £_000 on digital_rev .
2	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
0	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
0	i would highly_recommend select_specs to friends , family and anyone that has yet to try an online optician !
2	i complained but no satisfaction was given , this company doesn_'_t care about repeat_business , there are plenty of other mugs to bite .
2	very satisfied with safercigs and will_definately_use them again .
0	great way to turn drawer clutter into cash .
0	this company i def be using again .
0	i ordered a pair of matte black polarised ray - ban wayfarers and i had a slight_issue in terms of delivery .
0	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .
2	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
0	just used the parcel0go live_chat_function for the first time , very helpful and quick and efficient customer_service from lizzie , which is far more_than can be said for yodel ' s customer_service !
0	i would always use mazuma now
2	they e_- mailed me a pre_- paid postage slip and within 0 days of posting them my brand_new pair arrived !
0	no memory_cards from spain ?
0	i spoke to very helpful and funny lady_called cathrine who sorted out a problem via the live_chat , i had to wait a little_bit but was offered a small discount which was very nice .
2	very easy website to navigate around .
2	all in all , what more could you want .
0	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
0	it was straightforward , i put the imei_number on website , got the quote and got free post envelope from mazuma in couple of days .
0	had problems with labels when printing order , assistant paul was extremely_helpful emailed me the labels within few mins - no_problems , great service !
0	the site was so simple to use and there were some utterly beautiful bouquets available to choose from .
2	very helpfull team would use again sammie_taylor very helpfull
2	would highly_recommend and use again .
0	i decided to give transglobal express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
2	i have no_hesitation to recommend country_house outdoor and will_definately buy again from this seller .
2	they all worked and so i did the detail filling on - line and away they went .
0	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
2	the flowers were beautiful and were fresh .
2	brilliant service would definately reccomend
0	they do what they say on the tin and couldn ' t make the process any easier given they do need to see the phones first to check they ' re as you say on the website .
0	i must have been on the line for about 00_minutes , which is not something i ' ve experienced elsewhere .
2	i thought they had forgotten but i should have given them the chance .
0	i could not fault her .
0	i entered my details on the website on the sunday , opted to have them send me the pack so as to send the phone back .
0	a ***** service !
2	the jacket i purchased was over 00_% cheaper_than nearly all other_websites i checked , and had the greatest choice in size and colours .
0	psychedelic prints and outstandingly comfortable .
2	only problem was there was a website problem and it took me 00_minutes to get the order to process .
2	i bought a pair of walking_boots , which were £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else . i wanted them delivered to my work place but put the wrong number on the address .
2	rating of 0 . 0 on trustpilot from 0000 reviews is well_deserved .
0	i went for the dozen luxury red_roses .
0	final moral of the story - always include a local recipient phone number on your parcel , that way the courier has less of an excuse .
2	she also confirmed that i could leave the parcel in a secure location should i need to for the delivery man to collect if i didn_'_t use the parcelshop .
0	i usually just go to the post_office .
0	they were happy to delay delivery so that the ring wouldn ' t arrive when the missus was at home .
2	what more could you ask for !!!!
2	good service , thankyou
2	hi
2	flowers finally arrived 0 days_later , the roses were totally dead and the rest of the bunch had seen much_better days - my mum was so upset .
2	quality goods , beautiful packaging and excellent fast service .
2	follow_up emails and texts giving progress reports on delivery were well - written and gave the impression of a company which cares_about its customers .
2	will never use anyone_else .
2	regards martin moffatt
0	cannot_fault , though it would have been better if the bag provided had bubble_wrap inside as i had to use tissue to make_sure that the phone was not broken in transit .
2	totally impressed with such a professional service .
2	the parcel was collected on friday and was in australia on tuesday .
0	just wanted to cancel an order as i got muddled up who was taking what .

0	was given help from daniel with a problem i had with a booking .
2	i bought an ego - t and e liquid from safercigs .
0	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .

0	i ordered 0 mother ' s day bouquets .
0	thanks a million
2	unfortunately i couldn_'_t get my purchase to work on my ipad so had to reprocess it on my pc ( due to the online help being offline .).
0	only reviewing on customer_service as have not recieved parcel yet .
0	but i ' ve heard_nothing .
2	therefore what they are telling you is , by all means look at the pretty pictures on the website , facebook or twitter .

2	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional code .
2	today i spoke to daniel with the problem that i was arranging a parcel to be collected from a remote site which closed for lunch and he arranged for a message to be sent to the courier requesting that collection happened during the opening hours .

2	if you dare to complain , they won_'_t believe you unless you email photos as proof .

2	ashley then re - booked the collection without_fuss & a great big apology .
2	exchanged them for a more_expensive pair based on reviews i ' d read .
0	it looked amazing to me but the true test was giving it to my wife .
2	the tracking service is excellent as you can follow you parcel from the moment it leaves you until it arrives as it '_s destination .
0	i had to return something once = even that was a pleasure as it was dealt_with fast & easy unlike a lot of web companies these days , webtogs take pride in their great service .
2	the quickest , best , most customer_focused website i '_ve come_across .
0	given the high price i was almost certain it would be a 0 day delivery , however there is no way to confirm that .
2	i recommend them to anyone
0	many_thanks
0	my father spent all day wednesday waiting inside for the delivery of flowers that never came .
0	we were nervous_about buying an engagement_ring online but i needn ' t have worried .
2	it '_s not .
2	without_doubt the best ever . would recommend to everyone . in my book they are number 0 when it comes to paying you for your old_phones , i only wish they would add more electrical items that can be recyled . but still the best .
0	the thing that really disappointed me the most was the customer_service side of things , i sent them an_email regarding the issues and have had absolutely no response the impression i get is that they got my money and now couldnt care less in light of all the issues i was extremely disappointed and will not be using this company again .
0	!
2	well happy with their customer service .
0	i was a bit_unsure of using a site like this however it couldn ' t have been easier .
0	will_definatley use this service again .

0	i was notified whent he flowers had been delivered and they are gorgeous .
2	excellent service and would use again .
0	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening speed .
2	then i had a problem , parcel0go took the fee twice from my debit_card .
2	now using ipost and cut out these middlemen with numerous failed_collections .
0	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
2	they provide simple instructions and even send you the packaging to return the item .
2	would recommend to any private person
0	they had exactly_what i wanted and my order was delivered earlier_than_expected .
2	!
2	keep_up the good work !
0	arrived soon after i sent my phone website was easy to follow overall was an easy way to get_rid of my old phone !
0	it is difficult to allocated specific blame for this as appears to be a combination of factors including capacity to fulfil orders , weather , delivery logistics etc .
0	found at here cheaper_than john_lewis ' and also got to use quidco for a further discount .
2	this , they said was due to " water_damage " and missing charger .
0	ordered some sound magic headphones recently , website was excellent , great detail in the products i was interested in , easy_navigation through products and website in general , quick and easy order / payment process and to top it off next_day delivery .
2	parcel was picked_up by polite and helpful driver , i had no_worries about the safe delivery of the item as i was assured by the professional attitude of the collecting agent that it would arrive at it '_s destination without_any problem , and so it proved .
0	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g ' s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
0	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
2	phoned up friday got freepost bag saturday posted monday got money on wednesday now that '_s what i call service well_done mazoma

2	douglas goldie
0	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
2	then around a year_ago a friend suggested i try interparcel , the first packet i sent was to a regular customer in lebanon and i was amazed that it cost half what i was used to paying .
0	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
0	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
0	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
2	pwllheli
2	she made it a breeze and even emailed me the new labels to save me hassle .
0	it was an_eternity_ring , bought as a surprise for my 00th wedding_anniversary .

0	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
0	they did compensate with a £_00 off voucher , which was a pleasant_surprise as its very rare for a company to even offer anything .
2	rebooked with citylink 00 at parcel0go sams ' suggestion after 0 days of failed_collections from yodel .
2	cowboys with no customer service care at all .
0	good price too for a phone i haven ' t used in months .

0	i jumped onto the help chat , and catherine_corless , came to my crying call .
2	many_thanks for speedy delivery too x
2	if you have parcels you want delivering try interparcel , you will be amazed at the price , it was , much_cheaper_than " you know who " by more than £_00 . 00 .
2	richard
2	i will_certainly use and recommend parcel0go again .
0	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
2	why for 0 weeks did the tracking of my order status state left base out for delivery .
2	liked the look of the prices compared to others , so ordered some replacement leads .
0	i can ' t thank mazuma_mobile enough .
2	if you complain , and they make promises to rectify the situation , then they should do as they promise .

0	went to the local post_office and they asked for silly money .
0	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
2	it is good to have a rapid and personal response from an online store .
0	needless to say i was absolutely gutted and annoyed at the fact i ' d have to shell out another £_000 to replace them .
0	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
0	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
0	i brought this based as you can record through a laptop and considering the spec of the laptop and the price the sound is fantastic .

0	they said check the ups site but gave me no tracking_number , so i had to ask for this separately .

0	when i contacted online help all i got told was " well , we ' ve put the order through to the local_florist " and " perhaps if you leave it a couple more hours " the last one was at 0pm local time !
2	i will defiantly_use you again .

0	you can find plenty of reviews on the internet about this camera .
0	lovely flowers which my mum loved and delivered at the expected time .
0	i had a delivery arranged for valentines_day to deliver to my partners work address .
0	the only thing i would like them to change is to give a rough estimate for delivery so if ordering gifts in future , customers will know when they will be arriving .
2	totally problem free transaction - persol frames specially sourced from italy , prescription transition lenses expertly fitted and all delivered within a couple of weeks .

0	for me they beat the due date by 0 full weeks .
0	with jessops kicking the bucket , digitalrev , in my opinion , has the potential to become the uk ' s new household name for camera gear .
2	ordered and dispatched on same day .
2	then i got another text on tuesday_morning to say that the bouquet had left the depot and was with the courier - then another to say that it was on it '_s way to the destination - and then another to say that it had successfully and safely arrived at my friend '_s house .
2	came_across this site and it fitted my requirements exactly .
0	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
2	i can '_t recommend mazuma highly_enough and would definitely_use them again .
0	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
2	the only dowside to it was that her iphone would not work through the hifi .
0	guess_what ?
0	as ever , items are always dispatched promptly and their prices are always competitive .
0	couldn ' t fault them
2	got what i wanted with great customer service .
2	absolutely !
2	i would not have know about them otherwise so i want to know where do you advertise ?
0	also , other online stores are providing with free delivery .
2	i have dealt_with mazumamobile 0 times and on each_occassion it has_been so easy just put your phone in the envelope with the invoice post and within a couple of days the money is in the bank no_hassles !!!
2	in my search lindy cables popped_up - i gave it a try and had to come back for more .
0	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0 days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day . silly me .
0	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
0	however , way too expensive .
0	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn ' t expect such shoddy service , i think it ' s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people ' s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
2	it seems impossible to find a number .
0	i was quoted £_000 on the website , posted the phone , second day i received an_email about the phone passing the tests and after 0 days i got paid £_000 into my bank_account .
2	i was totally impressed with their reaction .
2	honestly , it was so easy .
2	well_done - and a pleasant conversation too !
0	i ordered an xlr cable which was out of stock , and they called me within an_hour or so to tell me they weren ' t getting any for a while , which gave me the opportunity to purchase elsewhere .
0	hope to be getting a refund !
0	awful company !
2	really pleased good site fast delivery great products would definitely order with them again .
2	i messed_up entering the code and was therefor charged the pre promotional rate .
2	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
2	would use again .
0	i ordered a bouquet a day before i needed them .
2	having placed the order the mat arrived within two days securely_packaged .
0	i would recommend to all my friends

0	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
0	delighted .

0	check value
0	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
0	had a small problem with the website when booking my parcel but the handy work of the live assitant was amzing and helpful and got my parcel booked in today !!!!!!!!!

2	i would recommend these to friend and family as a good site to use
2	great service , great product , would highly_recommend to everyone .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending samantha and parcel0go .
2	kind of too late on wednesday though , ruined the moment !

0	very good no_problems , fast delivery , would use again .
2	thanks mazuma .
