2	great service and recmmend to all friends . thx
0	very good service and excellent transfer of money for my phone that i sent to them .
0	i ' m not too sure if she was real or a robot .
2	even so i thought i had stretched them too far .
2	thanks webtogs team !
0	thank_you :-)
0	they were brilliant at keeping me informed of my order and its expected delivery date , and it arrived very quickly and right on time .
2	thank_you
0	easy to compare prices and follow_instructions when sending a parcel within the uk and overseas .
0	i understand it must be a busy_period with mother ' s day this weekend , but this has ruined mother ' s day for me - even if they may have lots of orders , there should still be some sort of quality standard and customer_satisfaction .
2	i have used arenaflowers many_times before and they have always been delivered on the date i asked for , but the main_reason i use arenaflowers is because the bouquets are just so much fuller and fresher than what i expect .
2	i recommend you avoid as they do not appear to offer the prices they quote !
2	highly_recommend this company to any shoppers .
0	all in all hifi - tower are a great company who seem to actually care about not only their reputation but also their customers also . would recommend to anyone and have since placed a second order due to such fantastic prices and hassle_free internet shopping_experience . massive thumbs_up from a happy customer in nottingham !
2	no offer of discount or money off next order , just an arrogant unhelpful individual !
2	customer was happy and made her smile thank_you x
0	once i placed an order , i received numerous reminders to send my phone which was great as i kept forget to post my item .
0	lauren was detailed in responses and quick to reply and solved my question this morning , i ' m now considering using this company when i have my next parcel to send .
0	product turned_up in perfect_condition and in good packaging .
0	i went for a round diamond in a platinum mount .
2	thanks guys
0	happy to sell my phone with them - very fast payment and notifications all the way
0	he answered all my questions and more !
0	is all i have to say .
2	i finally got an answer from you , stating that due to an it problem , the order had not been dispatched and now it was too late to deliver it .
0	the bunch received was much smaller_than pictured ( rose & lilly bouquet image showed 0 lillies , received 0 that were both closed ).
0	i will_definitely take this further and get to the bottom of this issue .
2	delivery by 00am next working day after collection throughout most of the uk_mainland guaranteed .
0	i would definitely_recommend and order from them again !
0	so am i supposed to cancel all my plans to wait for the delivery ?
0	had been so excited that they would arrive in time for valentine ' s day .
0	i ordered flowers for my mother ' s birthday !
0	e . g
2	as others have said getting them on the phone impossible ( probably dealing_with all the complaints ) i ' m truly gutted , there is no rerun for a funeral .
0	fast , easy , and reasonable pricing .
2	after using their ' quick quote ' system i was able to confirm they were as competitive as p0g another service i have used so i thought i would give them a try .
0	i received a prompt delivery service and the sunglasses came with a protective case .
2	the choice of local florists , which in this case were at opposite ends of the country , was excellent .
0	highly_recommend this service :)
2	i '_ve found tg to be very helpful in spotting / rectifying potential problems sometimes before they occurred .
2	i recently_purchased a second surround system from hifi_tower and this one developed a fault .
0	i felt very confident that if i didnt like my purchase i could easily get a refund .
2	unless you want your parcels thrown off the van onto a concrete floor use someone_else .
2	our business has grown and we now have our own ups account with very good discounts , but still find tg '_s prices can be cheaper .
2	just the right size , ( holds 00 bottles ) and works great .
0	contacted parcel0go live_chat due to me making an error when i imputted postal_address details .
2	mazuma provided a postage paid label ( the other company did not ), and mazuma sent me my cheque within 0 days .
0	every 00 - 00 months i receive a new phone from my service provider and every year i come to mazuma with my old handset .
2	instantly correcting a mistake i had made online .
2	thank_you .
2	i have pretty_much ditched royal_mail in favour of you guys .
0	communication was great , i was fully_aware of what was happening the whole time .
0	lots of people are making complaints about extra costs upon delivery .
0	it did not get delivered and i had to " blow my cover " to my boyfriend asking him if he had gotten a delivery .
2	popped my old_mobile_phone in the mazuma envelope and a cheque for £_00 appeared . magic .
2	i used their live_chat_facility 00th_may and was promised that because of the time difference , the night shift would investigate and email me that night .
0	the fact you can drop_off your parcel to a local shop ( courier dependant ) and still get a trackable receipt is awesome .
2	i was kept up to date constantly with the progress of my order and was refunded in full .
0	.
2	the service could not be any better in mazuma_mobile
2	can '_t recommend them highly_enough .
2	a tenner for a pair of specs - too good to be true ?
2	excellent way of using a courier , good value so far they have been cheaper_than royal and easy to book a collection .
0	thanks again
0	was astonished by how quickly live_chat sorted out the problem .
0	my order was delivered within 00_hours of being placed , and was all correct and present .
2	they had frames that appeared to be very similar to my own , at a very reasonable price of £_00 .
0	changed my order collection date no problem .
0	i would highly_recommend mazumamobile .
0	( my mom sent me a picture ). they were excellent quality too .
2	i came_across this site purely by_accident however this will now be the only site i use to send flowers to family and friends , wonderful response from the receiver of my flowers i sent for her_birthday .
2	the document you produced has an illegible signature .
0	none of this was a hassle , even with my requests !
0	i ' ve now had 0 orders with this website and each time i ' ve been very impressed by the level of service delivered .
2	authentic sunglasses at a cheaper price than i could have got them elsewhere .
0	pre paid envelope arrived nxt day .
2	in a shellnut they are super dooper smashing lovely and as the late not so great jimmy saville would say owezzzz about that then .
2	but to my pleasant_surprise it was a very fast & simple procedure & as promised by mazuma_mobile the £_00 they offered me prior to checking it over was in my bank the very same day that they received it !
0	i contacted late evening to ask what was happening - told that the courier could not be contacted , my separated parcel was probably on the way .
2	well i was pleasantly_surprised when i enquired_about how much an old_mobile_phone i had was worth .
2	i was going to use a ' cheaper ' online site , but . if you look at the reviews of one of the much_cheaper online sites , you will know to steer_clear of them !
0	:-(
2	i '_ve ordered from here numerous_times
0	i hope yesstyle can actually post meaningful replies and not some automated_reply like they always do as well !
2	a great service
0	too cute .

2	my wife was extremely pleased with her beautiful_bouquet of flowers , delivery was excellent , cannot complain_about anything .
2	get on the net and buy one !

2	all in all they are just highway men .
2	i never saw them , were a gift for my penfriend who is gravely ill , she text they were lovely and put a smile on her face despite feeling really ill the day after her latest chemo .
0	if you ' re into s & m , this is the company for you , cause they know how to talk down to you and make you feel_like you ' re nothing .
2	they are very compact take up half the room in the car than our old speakers and very light so no straining to lift onto stands .
0	from getting quote to getting money was only a few_days :)
2	if i use this service again i will not be adding any extras such as balloons and vases

2	great experience !
0	i received a pack to send the phone back and a sticker if i was using my own packaging , which i did .
0	parcel 0 go have always done exactly_what they ' ve said they would do , offered great prices with an easy website and when a courier does unfortuantly make a mistake , the customer_service team is great .
0	all taxes were included in the price .
0	this is the first time i have used this service and without catherines help i would have been lost .
2	i have used this company to send packages to the usa , germany and the uk , and they have reached their destinations quickly and easily .
2	some friends bought me a pair of norh face walking shoes which seemed to fit fine and i wore them on a short_walk .
2	wasn_'_t sure about posting my phone off , but i ' m_sure glad i did !
2	they reduced the offer to £_00 saying the screen was covered with scratches .
2	i was very late ordering flowers this year , the friday before mothers_day to be precise , so i turned to iflorist .

2	i received nothing but automated_responses and , despite several further attempts on my part , nobody got back to me .
0	very pleased with the service !
0	bouquet = single , not plural .
0	they deliver the next_day regardless of when you request delivery and are delivered by royal_mail ,
2	this is excellent service as this bundle was not in place when i made my original order yet they still allowed me to take full advantage of this and the cost saving that went with it .

0	i received an_email last_night saying that the flowers were out of stock so i should choose something else or they will refund me .

0	this is a fraud ?
2	camberley flowers left outside house by front_door not a secure place in full sun between 00 . 00 and 0 . 00 as no one was in .
0	they give you a quote for the phone in working order or even if it ' s broken .
0	from the moment i contacted the company , they were helpful and knowledgeable .
2	i had a senior moment last_night while ordering a collection / delivery and didn_'_t realise my mistake until i had processed the order .

0	with royal_mail charging excessive amounts to send parcel , i went to parcel 0 go .

2	fast and efficient and with good communication at all times and clear concise_instructions .
2	very good website , checkout is simple !
0	they basically turned around and said that the phone had a stratch , which it never , and then knocked the value bands down from good condition to non working ??
2	i received the product really fast even during snow when my other products were delayed .
2	really quick and efficient service , would recommend

2	did exactly_what it said on the box , everything_went as planned from getting a quote for the value of my old phone to receiving the posting pack to when the cheque arrived .
0	yes , there are the odd mistake , non - collection etc but these are minor errors .
0	!
2	also impressive were the regular_updates of the progress of my order , which arguably weren_'_t needed as the goods were despatched promptly the next_day and were delivered the day after that .
0	cole howe
2	i '_ve sold a number of mobile_phones through mazuma_mobile over the past few_years .
2	i leave a msg on answering_machine .
2	item exactly as_described and at a great price .
2	excellent facility for recycling what you might think are worthless old_phones , but you will almost certainly get something for them , so try mazuma as they do give you the best prices , i tried all the online companies but mazuma were the best for valuation & for the choice of cash or argos_vouchers - try it yourself
2	great product and great value .
2	mazuma can you redeem yourselves ?

0	would definitely use them for all my camera purchases .

2	this was my first time of using mazuma , and i found the process very stress_free and easy to use .
0	wasn ' t sure how trustworthy a service it would be but so surprised when i found how easy reliable and quick it was that i sent my phones off and received the cheque all within a few_days !
0	i didn ' t even have to call them .
2	my doorbell_rang before_noon on the said day and my parcel was delivered in perfect_condition .
2	of course everything about their phone system is set_up to prevent you from calling and instead tries to push you back to their unreliable online system .
0	polite and knowledgeable_staff make ordering from webtogs a doddle .
0	the package was traceable , too and arrived and well padded .
2	would definitely_use again
2	brittany , you were so easy to ' chat ' to on - line and so helpful .

0	i use production_room a lot and the staff are top_class and have an endless amount of info between then if ur un shore in a peace of kit there more that happy to take time to discuss ur options they ask u wat ur wonting to do and wat ur trying to achieve then they will prompt u in the right_direction they never
2	i ordered them and they were delivered the next_day in a huge box .
0	eventually today i have managed to speak to a customer_service advisor on a ' live_chat ' function who has told me that the flowers are still with the courier due to an address problem .
0	i dunno if i ' m the minority who dislikes their service , or whether the people who like their service are actually less inclined to post positive_comments , but at the end of the day , if the serivce ain ' t up to standard , then you can ' t expect people to be in your favour .
2	well i don_'_t think i '_ll use royal_mail again for parcel delivery whilst these_guys are operating !!!!
2	as the delivery was to an office , time was limited by usual office hours .
0	i lost 000_pounds and they just saying is not their fault !
0	yesterday i had 0 offers for compensation , if i opt for payment through bacs i get exactly_what the buyer paid for .

0	it wasn ' t until the 0th time i contacted them via their online_chat that they assigned the job to a different florist to make the delivery .
0	thank_you again catherine .
0	is this good customer_service ?
2	i also forgot to leave instructions for the driver and ashley very kindly took details from me for the driver .
2	i ordered a juicer and true to their promise it arrived on time .
2	i wasn_'_t disappointed , the mics arrived by fed_ex the next_day , giving me a couple of days to catch my breath before the event !

0	so glad i have discovered country_attire .
0	i used parcel 0 go two_weeks_ago and it was a truly_awful decision , i will inform people to stay_away from this company .
0	after a day walking through the christmas masses only to be told by cex that they would only give me half the value priced on their web_site i was dubious when mazuma made me such a great offer plus didn ' t want the box , charger and accesories and i got to keep my sd_card bonus !
2	i will not be using the £ 0 voucher sent with the flowers and i will_certainly not be using this company again .
0	they even sent a lollipop with my order , which brightened my day .
2	never used this company before , & was very worried , my item was an iphone 0 . though i need not of worried all went without a hitch . was kept_informed through the whole_process & the money was in my bank_account within a few hours would definitely recommend & use myself again .
0	here ' s to you lloyd and samantha .
2	kim stupple
0	found this website ( they need to advertise it more !)
0	after needing to send a parcel via courier it soon became_clear that this was a lot harder than first anticipated .
2	i messed_up the order , not realising that the recipient ( who did not have email ) would need to print out a label and affix it to the parcel .
0	thanks to trustpilot that i found digitalrev , and thanks to digital_rev that sent me a quality product in time .
2	i have been using areana flowers for several_years now .
2	i shall be demanding a full_refund - whether i get it remains to be seen .
0	i started using p0g late last_year and i have never had a problem and they were the cheapeast out there !
2	0_stars
0	the cheapest prices online from somewhere actually trustworthy .
2	i had a query and it was dealt_with almost_immediately .
0	!
0	am using again to get engagement_ring reset .
0	obviously , i was dubious until the parcel actually got to the destination as i have read other stories where parcel has been lost en_route or left in the warehouse .
2	i '_ve been using p0g for some time now , and apart_from a couple of small issues which were dealt_with promptly , i have absolutely no gripes .
2	:-))
2	unlike another well_known phone recycling company who invented a story about a cracked back cover and offered me less_than their email offer mazuma came up_trumps and paid what they first offered .
2	quick , easy , no_fuss .
0	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 hub sorter receipt scan
2	couldn_'_t fault it .
2	using the code from the parcel0go facebook_page , i paid just £ 0 . 00 - royal_mail would have charged me £ 0 . 00 .
2	took his advice and he is right .
2	i recently had a big parcel picked_up from over 000_miles_away and delivered to my door for under £_00 !
2	contacted inter_parcel and was informed the courier worked until 00 . 00 . by 00 . 00 still no sign of the courier .
2	impressive service and looking at their website for further ( compatible ) items to purchase .
0	shipping is almost instant .
0	the only issue i am having is with the juicer itself .
2	did not know till 00 00 when i rang to ask when he was coming .
0	i ordered a bunch of flowers for delivery on july 00th .
2	i appeared to have 0 ref nos .
0	i would definitely_recommend the site .
0	back to interflora - absolute_joke of a florist prestige , more like pretty crap florist
2	thank_you and please don_'_t change you have it right .
2	from sending the free_postage bag to me getting the cheque .
2	the web_site was helpful and clear .
0	the lines then terminate with no option to speak with a consultant .
2	this is the second time i '_ve used mazuma and they were great both times .
0	really unhappy with the service as i was really looking_forward to surprising my girlfriend on valentines_day .
0	i ' m so angry that this company can ruin valentines_day for so many people .
2	plus free_postage so it costs you nothing but your time to organise the process !
0	the tracking facilities are great and everything works as you would hope ( as apposed to [_external reference ]) had some problems with the initial pick_up , used live_chat and spoke to someone called [_name ], who was very helpful indeed and we managed to resolve the problems
0	parcel0go may be a bit cheaper but overall i would rather spend a few more pounds and use collectmyparcel anyday , its a far more personal service with quality to match .
0	my wife got both of my orders on valentine ' s day which arrived at her workplace and words cannot describe how embarrassed she was - for her colleagues having to see such pathetic flowers ordered by her husband .
2	many_thanks .
2	just check the countless bad_reviews on this forum , trust me when i say at all cost avoid this company !
0	i then rang to be told that unless the couriers update them they would not get back to me and they would chase again with the couriers .
0	i ordered the door to door delivery from scotland to dorset , after one and a half week of waiting and 0 unsuccessful pick_up dates / days reschedules ( delivery man has not arrived to pick_up point due to 0 different reasons , like company what we have selected does not operate in that area . etc ) i gave up the fight .
0	everything went exactly as mazuma had stated on their website .

2	what more could i ask ?
2	fantastic value , excellent service , communicate every_step if the delivery process , never disappoint !
0	it seems i underestimated the size of the equipment , i got far more for my money than i realised .
2	and unexpected .
0	i then got an_email on the tuesday advising me that my order had been " allocated " and was " ready for shipping ".
0	flawless , and so much_easier than ebay !
0	then i stumbled onto megafancydress . co . uk and found the perfect last - minute costume at a decent price .
0	the lady on the other line told me that she would need to check with the local_florist and would come back to me .
0	no one called me to tell me , i just got it from a catch all email address finally in my junk .
0	what more could i ask for ?
2	love the service , the prices and they haven_'_t let me down since i joined them .
2	goods arrived promptly .
0	massive choice of sunglasses and got my order the next_day .
2	i needed the waistcoat for the following thursday which meant they has to ship on tuesday !
0	my husband and i bought our_wedding_rings and i can ' t speak highly_enough of both the rings and the service we received .
0	i ordered a bouquet for my mother to be delivered today and despite being told by email i would receive it today , it is now past 0pm and still nothing .
2	kind_regards
2	that is what happened and this makes me very happy .
0	it was quick simple and easy , she answered all my questions in great detail and covered all the information that i required .
2	very fast delivery , tracked all the way and arrived intact .
2	they offered me a fair price , and once they had received my phones , the money went into my bank_account within two days .

0	!
2	return : packages arrived in 0 days .

2	operator error on my part , meant i had to have an online_chat with one of their operators , sam .
2	when i ordered my flowers i got a text right away confirming the order . then when they had left the warehouse i got another text saying they were on there way .
0	definitely_recommend this !
2	this is the first time i have ordered glasses online , so was a little_concerned .

0	0 days_later the money was in my account , it ' s a fantastic service . the best mobile selling company i have come_across .

2	i was a bit disappointed with some of the flowers though , the pink carnations were already tinged with brown and didnt look like they would last long
0	website was really easy to use , envelope arrived following_day with clear_instructions as to what to do next .
2	i have bought half a dozen different artificial plants and have been delighted with them all .
0	many online_chat facilities are automated think of the biggest names bt , virgin , three mobile - all used automated online_chat whereas parcel0go who are a lot smaller but still handling a incredible number of transactions per day use one to one agent to client online_chat facilities .
2	you can '_t report a non - collection until 0 . 00pm and even then it isn_'_t possible to talk to anyone about the problem ( they don_'_t give you a phone number ), so i had to use their online procedure to re - schedule the collection for the following_day .
2	a no_quibble price match + 0 % was a very good start .
2	my ipad was in good condition when i sent it in .
2	well many of us didn_'_t want a refund , we wanted the flowers , however late .
2	please remember that interparcel are not a courier company themselves , simply an agent , they never handle anything .
0	i got on a train to their shop in southend , and they were kind enough to give me the correct pair , and reimburse me for my train fare !
2	prompt , fair and great at keeping you informed - if only others did the same !
2	i sent 0 phones that were just sat in the draw , i
2	i used this courier service to delver a 00 " flat screen tv .
0	so i would advise all people thinking of ordering with them to not and use a large well_known company .
2	i noticed after ordering that the delivery date was 00th_march .
2	spoke to emma just now to sort_out a problem and she was very helpful .
0	i was recommended digitalrev by a colleague who ' s a photographer .
0	also it was $_00 to ship the shoes to the us so i can ' t return them .
0	despite ringing yesstyle , and emailing them , i still have no_idea why my parcel hasn ' t arrived yet .
0	having recently been looking around for a fair while for 0 x technics sl0000mk0g ' s .
2	the other north_face coat that i have is also brilliant .
0	and they will on look at a compliant is they have pictures !!
0	very speedy .
2	the telephone operator at suttons appeared knowledgeable and gave me advice on repotting and intensive care , she then offered to refund the whole order despite it being only one box that was damaged .
0	i think mazuma_mobile offers a great service .
2	£ 0 . 00 .
0	barely 0 working_days ?
2	safercigs are a renowned company and there quality_control on items they sell is superb they test and test before it goes to us the public and that is the kicker for me .
0	they are great at answering any_questions through their brilliant email customer care team and my payment was made in just hours them reviving the mobile !
0	such a scam , stick to mazuma .
0	you receive the packet to send it in a day or two after you register and then a decision very quickly once you send it off , money in the bank two days_later !

2	once i sent this off it was acknowledged the next working day it had been received and monies showed up in my back account directly after .
0	customer support terrible and hang_up all the time !
2	i was kept_informed by text_message and email as to when they had been despatched and again once they were delivered .

2	six_months_ago i bought a pair of hunters boots from country_attire via amazon .

0	when the expiry of the offer loomed they got in touch to let me know .
2	thank_you
0	she handled the problem very good and resolved it very fast .
2	that was not my complaint !

2	).
0	i suggest you better put bid lock on your store .
2	booked on the 00th dropped_off on the 00th and delivered on the 00th .
2	thanks samantha
2	then when you try and talk to someone to find out what '_s going on you '_ll need to organise a webchat .
0	i was very impressed with envirofone .
0	this company is a scam , do not buy from them , they cant deliver on time , they send the wrong flowers , the ones they do send are subpar and they ignore all contact from customers .
2	has someone cancelled it ??
2	unbeatable price and service .
0	i ordered a lovely bunch called botanics for my mum for mother ' s day .
0	i decided to call the call_centre to confirm and was told that they had no information and that they would call me back once they had spoken to courier . 0 hours_later no phone call and no flowers so i tweeted them and was advised to ring yodel as they were the ones delivering i rung them to be informed that no order from iflorist had been placed !
2	i really appriciate there service and recomend this company .
0	ridiculous .
2	i have to say that the service from mazuma was just first_class all the way though .
2	best thing is the envelope provided is a jiffy_bag which mazuma does not .
2	when i opened them there was no sign of even 0 single red rose , let_alone the 00 i had ordered .
2	steph was so professional and step by step guided_me to a solution to my mistake .
2	so not only were this incompetent company unable to deliver on the right day , they couldn_'_t even send me the correct order !
2	i ordered the kaleidoscope bouquet from eflorist yesterday for same day delivery .
0	i have been using this company for a few_years no without problem .
0	it ' s so simple it ' s unbelievable .
2	katie tried really really hard to resolve an issue caused by another company and is still pursuing it as i write this .
2	you were featured in scotland magazine and i just had to try you out !
0	happy and satisfied buyer .
2	webster
2	i can '_t recommend them highly_enough , do yourself a favour and use these_people .
0	it is now the 00th_march and nothing received !
2	regarding some of the negative_comments_below , they seem to relate to excess charges due to incorrect weights / dimensions or remote_area surcharges : i suspect some people don_'_t read the ts_&_cs thoroughly when booking - hardly tg '_s fault if the courier firm slap an excess charge on a shipment due to the customer '_s mistake / oversight .
2	she deserves full plaudits .
2	sent the originals back on monday and i ' m wearing the replacements wednesday .
2	will_certainly use iflorist again in the future .
2	all communication was through email .
0	danielle_: well i ' ve been booking parcels with it since 0th_april
0	much_appreciated .
2	in fact beyond the last_minute .
2	parcelhero made it easy to find one and book it in .
2	!
0	the bear was a tiny cheap looking thing you would probably grapple in an arcade machine and there were 0 chocolates in a tiny box , woeful .
0	confirmation of recipet sent , money in bank . all in under a week !
0	the camera was fine inside but , as the camera was a gift , it was an annoyance to hand my friend something in that condition .
2	i need to add that i am not employed by the company .
2	the buyer lived in poland , and when i reminded him that the item was ' collect only ' he just asked for the shipping_costs !!
0	i was very pleased with the service and would recommend to all friends , family and anyone reading this .
2	00 / 00 /_0000
2	from start to finish the experience that i had with mazuma was second to none it was fast and efficient excellent service would recommend them to everyone
2	so if it '_s efficiency you ' re looking for , these_guys reek of it .
2	so warning to everyone don_'_t trust anything to these_people they just might give your parcels away to anyone walking by .
0	great updates .
0	quick easy service - good communication - perfect 00 / 00
2	i also insured the parcel for its value of £_000 - £ 0 extra they picked the parcel up the next_day ( friday ) and delivered on monday , exactly as they said they would .
2	just what i wanted .
0	cannot_believe this company has no phone number or no - one available in on - line help on the busiest day of the year for flower companies !
2	i ordered birthday flowers for my wife as a sort of " extra " at quite short_notice .
2	quite surprised about how easy and how fast the experience was , had 0 old_mobiles entered the emi they told me how much they were worth i printed an address lable posted them and got the money credited to my account with in 00hrs , awesome i was going to throw them in the bin .

0	super_fast delivery as always considering it was travelling from china to uk , with good tracking and clear website updates .
2	. ordered specialist cables after 00 : 00 and they arrived next_day just after 00 : 00 - that '_s what shopping on the internet should be like .

2	i bought the phone bundle ( phone & headset ) and am_delighted with the service and products .
0	thankyou parcel0go .
2	it '_s no big deal if you break them or lose is it ?
0	i will certainly be back for more from bopdj .
0	i ordered a new dslr simply because it was the cheapest price i could find for it .
0	the glasses , especially for the admittedly bargain price of £_00 , seem reasonably good quality , if a little light and plastic - feeling .
2	if you have a parcel to send , then make_sure you surf for interparcel .
0	so i will have a tracking_number all the way parcels
2	collectplus you had an opportunity to substantially increase your market share because of royal mails greed but you ' re throwing it away with heavy handed careless processing .
0	i am very happy with the service i have received and will strongly_recommend the service to other ebayers and friends .
2	makes estimating costs and sending packages painless .
2	!
2	would definitely reccommend .
2	interparcel have been excellent since i started using them over a year_ago and give flexibilty with a wide_range of carriers and different delivery times and prices .
2	the service was very prompt with easy to follow guides , and received the cheque within days of sending off the phone .

2	extremely_helpful . always a pleasure to talk to .
0	everything was very nice , flowers smells good .

0	it arrived in approximately 0 days all the way from_hong_kong , the delivery man managed to find me all the way up in the hills i live on , and despite the snow , he was not giving up trying to get to the house !
2	this is what customer service is all about !
2	i would have been better going to the local supermarket and buying £_00 , 00 worth of somple blooms .
0	!
0	all_round excellent service !
2	the whole_process is well planned and a returns_label was able to be printed_off very easily via their couriers .
0	prebooked for collect a few_days before collection and no one turned_up .
2	all in all absolute_rubbish .
0	having already sent the phone via snail mail , they promised to uphold the offer given on the day regardless of when the phone turned_up .
0	i have never had to ssend a parcel outside of work before , having a work account meaning i just ring up with a number and someone picks the package up great .

2	that aside i could have sailed around the world in the time it is taking to deliver them .
0	no compensation at all , now if they had ' ve left it on the doorstep i agree this would be part of their terms and conditions " might be left at the property unattended " and it got stolen then i ' d hold my hands up and say my bad .

2	placing the order was simplicity in itself and , true to their word , the company kept me fully_informed via_email , on the progress of processing and distributing my order .

2	my friend who has recently been diagnosed with cancer , was overjoyed to receive the bouquet .
0	as soon as i ' d checked the site for a quote and decided to sell my phone they took care of everything .

0	ok i am extremely angry now .
0	two_weeks for a bank_transfer ?
0	i know i have nothing to compare it with , but foam is foam .

2	i would avoid this company at all costs , from my experience their promises are lies .
0	i recieved the free post envelope two days after getting my quote online , i posted the phone back in the envelope and as i had given them my bank_details i recieved the payment the very next_day !
0	as well as being cheaper_than buying direct , delivery was quick and efficient and couldn ' t recommend these_guys highly_enough .
2	i was given the option for an_alternative if my friend wasn_'_t in . as the flowers were a birthday_present i asked that they be left with a neighbour .

0	they didn ' t collect .
0	will_continue to highly_recommended this company to friends and family .

2	i booked collection for two parcels , but didn_'_t receive any confirmation by email as it normally happens .
0	immediately took photos of everything i received and off to their help portal i go .
2	after emails messages flying back and forth and a list of other evidence that they required being obtained and forwarded on ( including an embarrassing request from us to my customer to write a statement to say he never received the product ?)

2	i bought a present for my grandson so i can only say that the product appeared to be very good value for money having_read_reviews elsewhere .
0	perfect .
0	as if a soaking box wasn ' t horrid enough , we opened the box and inside were old as well as slightly brown flowers that that were covered in scuffs and all dehydrated .
0	however i noticed that they had omitted part of the flat number i had provided on the despatch address .
0	the way they were wrapped also didn ' t give them any justice at all .
0	there ' s no ill intent to rip anyone off that i can see .
2	mainly it is more pleasant using our local shop as a drop_off point .
2	production_room sell premium quality / spec products and operate a very simple but slick order / delivery system .

0	my name was nowhere to be found .
2	fabulous value for money in my opinion !

2	two days_later they notified me that they had received the phone and that they would make payment to my bank_account the same day .
2	they '_ve got some good designs , too , which is not always the case because a lot of menswear is boring and washed - out when it comes to colours and patterns .
2	quick delivery service even over christmas_period .
0	flora_queen takes " pre_- payment " and takes a p **** after that .
0	will use this company again !!

0	all in all a very good customer_service would use time and time again .
2	[_name ]_o / t : i can only offer my sincerest apologies for this , unfortunately the carriers do not guarantee the saturady service this is why we do not sell it with a guarantee

0	i ' ll be more_than happy to buy something again soon .
0	after giving my order number i asked where the delivery was , he said it ' s marked as " out for delivery " by the courier and he can ' t be more specific than that as the delivery times are between 0 and 0 .

2	i have not received anything but top_class delivery for sending and receiving .
0	use another company .
0	i regularly use mazuma and everytime i use it i never let_down by the shear speed of the arrival of the envelope .
0	the products are great .
0	i would never recommend to anyone , and instead have emailed all my contacts making_sure they do not use this company either !
2	stumbling across parcelhero , i came_across an experience designed how i would expect , which is basically ; who from , who to , what and payment ( with the added option of paypal so needed to enter no extra card_details ) what else should there be ?
0	easy to sell with a good price for an old brick .
0	well_done mazuma .
0	they are telling_me it is a 0 day delivery as i live so far north , in truth i live 00 miles north_west of inverness , which is only 0 hours not 00_hours to birmingham .
2	my second set of purchases - two_pairs each time for distance and reading - no_problems at all , great frames and delivery was within the timescale given .

0	highly_recommend and will use again
2	this morning , my daughter said she had arrived home late last_night and a bunch of flowers were upside_down on her step !!
2	just make_sure that your message is complete though before you actually pay , the last couple of lines of mine were missing but i ' d made a few adjustments & don_'_t think i could '_ve checked to make_sure it was still all there before i paid .
0	i am very happy all_round .
2	sammie_taylor from parcel0go dealt_with it quickly , efficiently and in a friendly_manner .
2	fast response , fair prices and rapid payment
0	ordered on tuesday_evening .
0	the money has gone from my account too so they certainly got my order , just have chosen not to fulfil it .
0	received the pre paid envelope and instructions on thursday .
2	marvelous !
0	i ordered these flowers for my nans birthday , i did order them over the easter_weekend so this may be why i had issues , however a well_established company should be able to anticipate and adapt during busy_periods of the year .
2	just had a chat with david online about amending a parcel collection and i am very pleased with the very quick response and satisfactory solution to my problem .
2	ashley_: many_thanks for contacting parcel0go . com online .
2	unfortunately , they didn_'_t have any left in the size i needed , but i received an_email promptly explaining this and so i ordered a different product . once again sent out quickly with no_problems .
2	actual delivery is cheap enough but , like rip - off ryanair , by the time i added insurance ( which didn_'_t cover the full value of the item ) and signature - on - delivery , the cost more than doubled so a bit of a con really .
2	you can print out a barcode dispatch label and are given a tracking_number .
2	i would highly_recommend this site to all .
2	bag did not disappoint .
0	i am afraid we are unable to do anyting for delays in delivery as the courier does not guarantee the delivery timeframe as stated during the order process .
2	excellent service
0	i would not reccomend them or use this company again
0	what use is this when she is now here with me in england ????
0	i recently_bought a pair of oakley and raybans from these_guys and i was greatly impressed with the advice given .
0	it got here really quickly and was exactly_what i needed .
2	these_guys are just agents for the courier services .
0	i found it really helpful being_able to customise each ring ' s specifications , such as the 0cs of the diamond , and of course the metal it would be set into .
2	online_chat is never available .
0	the headphones arrived the following_day and agin , the communications were excellent .
2	initial delivery was very prompt and the pa_system i purchased was good value for the money .

2	fast efficient service , kept me informed .
2	so i paid for it to be picked_up but they were told they could not find it !!!

0	on asking for further clarification and having reiterated that the flowers were not delivered to this address on the requested date , i received an_email_stating :
0	should have stuck with what i knew from before in the future will only use and recommend mazuma .
2	i would have no problem recommending parcel0go to anyone who_wants to beat the royal_mail prices i use them all the time and its very quick to arrange any service and a lot_cheaper .
2	as a senior new to selling online i was totally confused but she made the whole_process a breeze .
0	definately_reccommend to anyone .
2	when the text told me that the flowers were delivered and left on the doorstep as requested , i texted my sister to ask her to look on her doorstep .

2	the bouquet was beautiful but died after only a few_days .
2	all i can say about this company is they far beyond the norm trying to help .

0	i plan to avoid them
2	each time their professionalism and speed were exemplary .
0	digital_rev ' s service was second to none .
2	!
0	out of over 00 parcels i have sent via their service only 0 had not reached its destination and this was over the christmas_period ( this obviously can not be parcel0go . com ' s fault as it was an error of the delivery drivers fault who worked for myhermes ).

2	when i went into the website for the first time , looking for huntress , it did not occur to me they would be separate , and indeed there was one pair in the ladies section - only in fuschia pink .
2	not that many flowers for 00 . 00 . with in two day some drooped , driver that delivered never knocked on the door .
2	that was my mistake the next available collection date would be monday .
0	all the rules and reg ' s and weight issues etc .
2	not only was the service value for money compared to others but the support was outstanding .
2	it arrived promptly and extremely well_packaged .
2	their customer service is exceptionally good . going above and beyond if you '_ve got a particular request flowerwise .
2	the stereo is brilliant and plays all the formats ie fm / am , mp0 , all types of cd '_s , sd_cards and memory_sticks , so i am never short of music .
2	i have found outfits to be less_than generous in the past .
0	i provided photos and all the information they needed and the very next_day i got a phonecall from a lovely member of staff who wanted to reassure me ( due to my pregnancy ) that they will be refunding the cost of the crib plus courier costs .
2	i took the plunge .
2	had a bouquet of mixed roses delivered for my girlfriend yesterday .
0	what a let_down .
2	i brought some different branded , more exspensive xlr leads , the humm was still there so lowered the equaliser on all bands and i seem to have reduced the problem . but happy , none the less . bill
2	wendy_hall : we booked this parcel sat express by 00pm .
0	i was then told " my delivery would be shipped soon " also not good enough .
0	if that wasn ’ t enough , the glasses arrived within 00 of me buying them online in perfect_condition and i received 00_%_discount for referring a friend !
2	would definitely_use them again x
2	as he said the odd loss gets on review_sites but the 00 . 0 % delivered successfully get no reviews , full compensation now immediately received , will now carry on using collect_plus and update any further problems .
2	i will be using parcels to go for many_years to come !
2	quick correspondence .
0	if only other_companies behaved so well .
2	they simply cannot do so .
0	alec
2	i found using this service very good and the prompt service deserves 0_stars .
0	from the very beginning entering your mobile make and model number you are given a very fair price for your old_mobile phone .
0	have used these_guys on a few occasions , and have had no_problems and speedy payment .
0	so easy to use and if there is a problem the on - line chat staff are very helpful and well informed and make it so easy its great

2	reasonable price backed_up by very fast & efficient process .
2	my order arrived when stated in perfect_condition and very well_packaged , there was even tweaking tips for the amplifier that i had bought which were greatly_appreciated .
0	i received an order confirmation but it ' s now the 00th and still no flowers .
2	so even before mother '_s day , the flowers were dead .
0	easy !
2	i have recommended selectspecs to my friend and my husband , who has aleady placed an order himself .
0	i will be back again a + on customer_service thank_you so much , kate
0	i wrote to them and complaint and was ignored .
2	both parcels were picked_up and delivered without_any hassle and was able to track both and still can !
2	so as a company to deal with in my opinion you could not find better .
0	and your service was fantastic and so fast !
2	fantastic service , thank_you !
0	i ' ve never - ever - bought glasses online . to me it was something you just didn ' t do , particularly with a prescription such as mine it seemed to me that i just * had * to go to the high_street .
2	!
2	from the time of sending off my phone to receiving my cheque took approx 0 days .
2	i added a vase and card to my order and i am told they were all of an exceptional quality .
2	it was packed in bubble_wrap about 0 inches deep .
2	i was really worried having heard previous horror_stories of parcelforce , but was left presently surprised .
0	catherine offered me very professional consultant services .
2	uk juicers is a wonderful company .
0	a ++++++++++++++++

2	?
0	very very good
0	they told me over the phone they made an error and it was sent to a driver in
2	my partner and i left with suitable products after trying out many different_types and flavours during our visit , and left as expected very happy customers , darren has achieved the right balance of products for what his customers want and need now and in the future , this is to full credit to safersigs and there staff .
0	let ’_s see if it gets collected today .
0	no .
2	so it '_s a no_brainer for me , forget the bad_reviews on here some people have difficulty counting on two hands never mind weighing and measuring a package . : ))
0	unfortunately my glasses never arrived and after querying 0 or 0 times i needed to request a refund .
2	0_stars for that , but the fact that you can '_t talk to someone , 0_stars deducted .
0	do not buy from them !!
2	i feel they are knowledgeable about their products and pride themselves on their service .
2	this company made a huge mistake by not delivering thousands of valentines_day flowers on the day and then promised to send an upgraded bouquet on the day after .
2	avoid this company if you want a professional service
0	. i was really trying to do something above and beyond for the women i love more_than anything on this planet and i get this ?
2	secondly , it reported the attempted delivery 00_minutes after leaving the depot .
2	she was extremely upset and said the flowers weren_'_t worth putting in a vase as they looked dead .
0	had been putting it off for ages but once i logged on it was so fast .
0	would definately_recommend to anyone_looking to dispose of old_phones .
0	i used your service for an express international service spending a lot of money
2	will_certainly be purchasing from them again
0	thank_you !
0	a friend of mine in the uk gave birth , tried to send flowers because i was in germany and they claim to be the best flower delivery service in the uk , never got a confirmation , the flowers never arrived , they claim they delivered them so i didn ' t even get a refund and my friend possibly thinks i made the story up .
0	my recent order no :_0000000
0	i had to rebook a delivery and they were really helpfull , thankyou lloyd for all the help
0	full_hd and the movie playback is amazing .

2	there follows an excerpt from the " chat " i had with them on friday last .
0	they are superb value for money and delivery is always on time , on the requested day and my recipients are always delighted with the flowers !
2	so easy and inexpensive to organise a home delivery and really satisfying and heart warming to know that she will get a lovely surprise and feel so happy .
0	really saved me time and money .
2	i would definitely recommend mazumamobile if you are selling your mobile .
0	!
2	thanks .
2	i placed my order about 00am on a friday , received a very light - hearted and fun email to say they had been despatched at 0pm and received them ( and a free lolly ) at 0 . 00am on saturday_morning , just in time for my run !
2	these were a surprise for my wife whose birthday is chrisrtmas day . thought i would try eflorist as they seem to have good reviews .
2	other comments have made me a little_apprehensive .
2	there is always a wide_range of flowers to choose from , often with very attractive discounts .
0	they were also very helpful when i needed my ring re - sized - the service was so quick and i had my ring back within a few_days .
2	hi , my sister was delighted with her fowers .
0	i will be back to use it again very soon !
2	sadly , troop had changed the spec and failed to inform pure , who still had the previous version on their website .
2	i received an_email acknowledging_receipt of my items and tracked their progress_throughout the day .
2	i would definately recommended transglobal_express .
2	a great service - will use again .
2	i managed to purchase the product i wanted and am very happy with for a superb price .
2	0st time i have used them and the last , going back to using interflora .
2	mazuma have for us always been the ones to process our order properly and quickly .
0	i got the exact money promised within 0 working day of sending it recorded at the post_office .
0	i would recommend this website and i would use this company again .
0	delighted !
2	i was purchasing these items at a considerable discount from anywhere in the uk , and you can '_t expect to receive those savings with the exact_same terms and conditions of sale as you would buying from a local_store , or without there being some slight downside , but i figured the extensive savings were worth the risk and so far have had no reason to regret taking that risk .
0	i did a mistake by giving the wrong postcode and they just help me to change and rebook the new collection date .
0	however i was refunded after a week and received a letter explaining the delay and apologies for their late delivery .
2	i would never use this florist again and advise nobody_else does either , unless of course you want to lose you money .
0	used it first time , the flower was so fresh and definitely value for money .
2	not only did i get value for money with the sunglasses_shop discount but i also received excellent customer service .

2	many_thanks to andrea for helping me out today , with the parcel i incorrectly addressed .

2	i saw the tv advert and looked up the website to find my old phone was worth £_000 !
0	great company and would thouroghly recommend them to anyone !
0	they deal with the sizing errors and stock the reputable_companies wont take *********
0	a girl in customer_service if you can call it that thought giving me a refund was good customer_service !!!!
2	hifi_tower certainly break the mould .
2	i ordered a troop bag from pure and it arrived the following_day - brilliant service .
2	thank_you hi_fi tower for my equipment and helping me with my orders .
0	would definitely use again .
0	overall , if a delivery is unsuccessful for whatever_reason it is unacceptable to keep the flowers in a box for five days and then redeliver them .
0	so i recommend p0g and i especially recommend sammie ; she was great , and i got a kiss x which made me smile .
0	very quick respond and very helpful !
0	courier missed a collection , had to have it rebooked with a different courier .
0	i love this website !
2	i got a great deal on designer_frames with prescription lenses .

2	i tried to complain to fraud sites but obviously iflorist is still trading .
0	jeg_har skrevet til interflora og udbedt mig en forklaring samt vedlagt billede af denne buket !
0	it is not a gesture of goodwill they should be giving , they should be fulfilling my damn order .
2	can '_t ask for more that that .
0	also , i mustn ' t forget the lollipop they include in your package .
0	i just hope i never have to use it as i ' m not sure it will be as simple to use as a uk nikon warranty .
0	that was last thursday on a 00 hour service .
0	fantastic job !
2	am extremely pleased with this parcel service , picked_up on time arrived safety on time with great great tracking service in between cannot ask for more
0	how wrong was i when the next_day at 00am i received a phone call from my girlfriend who was absolutely over the moon with her bouquet .
2	i would use this company again .
0	upon_receiving my phone back from them , i inspected it to find the camera button on the side of the phone had been completely removed .
2	i would like to say how pleased i was on the quickness from start to finish .

0	good service and quality , finest in the area .
0	very happy , no_problems , would recommend .

0	serenataflowers helped_me to solve this problem .

2	me . why is there a need for me to re - book if your courier fails so abjectly .
2	providing the goods being sent are not on the restrictive or prohibited list then they do allow personal goods into australia .
2	i sent a parcel to germany on thursday it arrived monday i just cannot_believe this service and it was just the standard price .
2	thanks ,
0	i ordered a pair of emerald cut diamond ear rings from diamond_heaven as a present for my wife .
2	in my view these_people are simply the best at what they do .
2	very simple process that worked like_clockwork
2	superb all_round service and brilliant value for money .
2	the only problem is that the also use royal_mail as well as their own deliverers and they are not informed when things have been delivered so cannot always trace a delivery if you send sometone you don_'_t know .
0	the shopping_experience at digitalrev was the best i have experienced so far , i received my package really fast considering it was coming from_hong_kong , and was shocked when i got it from the dhl guy , it was wrapped with so much bubble_wrap that it took me a while to open it .
0	i am having to pay for tnt not providing a proper service by not leaving calling_cards .
2	it '_s not often i take time out to write these reviews but sunglasses - shop service was like a breath of fresh_air - a really superb level of service .
2	me . why ?
0	its just a shame i will never see any of that profit .
2	just a thought in this day and age of speedy electronic software !!!!!!!
0	simple to use with the ability to see the amount you would earn from all the recycling places .
2	i ordered a basket for mothers_day over £_00 .

2	i ordered some replacement earpads for my sienheiser hd 000 ovation headphones as the old ones were looking tired .
0	really worth it people !
0	i was skeptical_about how quick and pain free this service would be but it is literally a case of a couple of clicks , a quick trip to the post_office , and bob ' s your uncle , the money hits the bank !
2	now the courier is closed for the weekend and has not responded to p0g '_s email more than 00_hours ago asking where my delivery is .
2	she received it just last_week , and she delighted with it !
2	i confirmed my order at 00 . 00 on the tuesday , the glasses were delivered the next_morning at 00 . 00 .
2	great service keep it up
0	very best quality cables and fast delivery !
0	very embarrassing , tried to contact customer_service , the phone numbers didn ' t work , the email i got from was from a noreply address , very suspicious !

0	she also referred my complaint to their md and they have since removed c0p from their site .
2	dry quickly , breathe easily and fit & look good .
0	great service .
0	a nice , bright airy site that ' s easy to navigate with loads of choice and menu options that actually make sense - you want fishnets , there ' s an option .
0	one thing that i do like , is you can see a different image for ' small ' ' medium ' and ' large ' bouquets .
0	i received the free post bag in less_than 00_hours and my order was processed and received the money in less_than 0 days .
0	do not use this company
2	good price and fast delivery

0	the fact that i was provided with my dhl_tracking_number meant i could follow it all the way to the uk .
0	i will have to get it dipped already before the actual wedding which is in august :(
0	finally , there seems to be no contact number for iflorist .
0	i could not be more satisfied with my recent encounter with ' inter parcel '.
2	sold the phone , envelope arrived next_day .

0	i just got the money in my account and thought i would leave a review .
0	i ' ve used hifiheadphones several_times but on another account , and all i can say is they ' re excellent .
2	think about knowledge and salesmanship , peaple seem forget about it . how can a shop run well if it can '_t get more business . i assure you guys " hi_fi enthusiast ", if you want to buy or upgrade your hi_fi , shop around , but do not forget to get the price from audio_express .
2	from registering everything was next_day service - speedy and efficient or what ?
2	i emailed transglobal and provided an_email address and phone number for my customer to enable them to make the enquiries however they didn_'_t want to do that , they insisted again that my customer must call ups .
2	on each_occasion we have been kept_informed on the parcels progress
0	told the guy on the phone that my iphone had gps tracking on it he then said need your royal_mail tracking so i just hung_up will change this review once payment is received for phone

2	bought the bose oe0 headphones , as a gift for my son .
0	thank_you diamond_geezer
0	my item arrived on time in great bubble_wrap package .
0	it left you having to use the post_office , which is more_expensive , slower and less reliable in my experience .
2	guess_what - they turned_up the next working day and it was free !!
0	made two orders with this company .
0	this means that people dont have to wait in for a delivery if they dont want to .
2	would highly_recommend and use again .
2	my package arrived in good time and was very well_packaged .
2	last_week one boot developed a split under the sole .

0	i ordered a pair of sennheiser hd000 on monday and it arrived on tuesday in absolutely perfect order .

0	. for a pair of spec ' s that cost me £_000 . 00 !!!!
0	. first of all i was given a better price for my handset than other similar companies .
0	as these are simple paper vouchers they could be posted with a first_class stamp for £ 0 . 00 !
2	the hostess was delighted and so were we .
0	she didn ' t receive the flowers .
2	i made a stupid mistake with the customs value for shipment details and katie fixed it for me , can '_t thank her enough , if this girl isn_'_t employee of the year i '_ll be amazed !
0	the only down_side is the companies lack of commitment and responsibility to its customers .
2	quick efficient and easy service
2	on their site they say 000_% satisfaction guaranteed , surely they left out the dis at the start of the word .
0	i was flying home to northern_ireland to visit my mum for mother ' s day and thought i was being sensible planning in_advance rather_than rushing around last_minute .
0	can ' t fault mazuma !
0	ups gave me clear reasons as to why the parcel had not yet been picked_up , as well as advising as to what needed to be done make_sure it is collected tomorrow .
0	i contacted them and their reply was " ordering the bouquet in large does not mean more flowers , it means a higher quality and more greenery ".
0	all you do is pick an item up , drive it somewhere and drop it off , it requires no skill or creativity at all yet it still seems past the competence of ups .
0	i had problem with tnt they didn ' t collect my parcel & i elected to live_chat with customer_service & i got very good response & solution from mr . william i had chat with .
0	i was so scared of sending my phone as royal_mail are so untrustworthy .
0	!
2	saves a lot of hassle , as your parcel is collected from your home . and all at a reasonable price too . would certainly use again .
0	well_done mazuma , i will be recommending you to my friends and relatives .

0	keep up the good work
2	packaging and delivery excellent .
0	my very first order , i had managed to place the information in the right boxes , however couldn ' t seem to find how to pay .
0	eventually i decided to spend the money on a more_expensive system and they gave me a very nice discount to apologise for the inconvenience .
2	however , the service from the sunglasses website was excellent .
2	useless and won_'_t return your money even_though the fault was theirs .
2	no arrival till 00_hours_later and then a wasted 00_minutes on their slow online_chat wasting my time trying to get some recompense .
0	again remember , when collections fail and deliverys are not on time parcel 0 go are not the ones in the wrong !
2	they also kept me posted with emails regarding my order and i cannot_fault the service .
2	i can '_t imagine getting better quality for the price .

2	website clear and easy to navigate
0	it has lifted a major worry !

0	overall , a fantastic service that i would recommend to everyone !
0	no broken item . basically , everything was perfect , even the collection of my parcel ! lovely ! i really recommend it to all my friends !
0	i sent an_email asking for more information and the team replied with 0 emails almost straight_away explaining everything i wanted .
0	it seemed more orientated round the sender , parcel0go ' s customer , rather_than the person recieving the parcel , the third person in the transaction .
2	they were replaced and exactly the same thing happened again !
0	!
0	i have also just traded in my second phone after such a great experience with my first .
2	good products cant_fault delivery and service

2	a very reasonable price for such a stunning ring and no scrimping on the quality for the price .
0	i have now received my phone back , low and behold it does turn on ,

0	i would definitely_recommend flora_queen .
0	a + services excellent company
0	is impossible than the driver couldn ` t deliver my parcel as my staff was advise of this delivery .
0	skitdåligt .
2	what a service , could not be better .

2	highly_recommended a nd would buy from again .
2	now thats what i call efficient !
0	however it should be noted that these flowers are suuitable for anyone , whether they are on a budget or not because the flowers are said to be such good quality .
0	do not use this company

0	many_thanks
0	for all the phones we have traded in so far mazuma have offered the highest price compared to the other recycling websites and we also really like the option of recieving the money in argos_vouchers - you also get a bit extra if you opt for vouchers instead of cash .
0	email them a few_times during the day , no reply !
2	adrian
0	will never use again .
2	the cheque was sent out the same day but the postal service wasn_'_t to efficient but it arrived in the end .
2	several emails i sent were bounced_back to me which i don_'_t understand .
0	the site didn ' t make it clear my parcel was going to come from_hong_kong , only found out with the tnt tracker , so i had my concerns .
0	jeg kontaktede selvfølgelig butikken først og sendte et billede for at sikre mig hvad_jeg_bestilte online svarede til hvad_jeg ville få .
0	i decided i wanted milgrain edging added , and it was done quickly and with no bother , as was resizing .

0	it also took only a short time to get here , which impressed me pretty_much - especially that the shipping is for free !
0	i have had no acknoledgement from the email i sent to complain_about this ( apart_from an_automated_response ).
2	these_people gave exactly the sort of professional service , & help when the post_office mislaid an order , that one could expect , all in a friendly & swift way .
0	most online customers services take a while to respond and don ' t help to resolve your issue in real time .
2	i will not use them again !
0	at first i thought , ok parcel0go is willing to give me extra £ 0 to compensate me for my lost item , and the rest for the buyer .
0	do not be mislead by their positive_reviews on the website - they clearly monitor what most people write on there .
0	i would recommend them without_hesitation .
0	even after shopping around they usually can ' t be_beaten on price , or the shear amount of different options you are given when posting .
0	used " live_chat " again today , 00th_december , to find out why no delivery again most suppressed the lady at the other end was quick to point out it was 0pm in perth so would not be able to contact the florist due to different time zone .
0	have seen reply below - thanks .
0	no you refused to take it in !
0	i paid for a collection they took my money no one turned_up for collection although the tracking report shows collection point closed .

0	parcels delivered by yodel so i need say no more .

0	i was called 0 days after for arranging the delivey and they came as agreed 0 days after . no fuzz , no problem , amazing tv !
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend pmc to anyone .
0	also if you want to add negative_review on their website it never going to be posted .
0	no card was left by the courier to say they had tried to deliver .
0	however , i was offered less_than a third of the initially stated price as my device was damaged .
2	will shop again excellent service .
2	everything_went well money in my account very fast will use again .
2	none of it though , they paid exactly_what they offered directly into my bank_account within a few_days .
0	prices are great and overall very pleased with the company .
2	unfortunately i needed to send a palletised item so decided to use p0d , how i wish i hadn_'_t .
2	clearly these employees are unaware of the meaning of the term customer service .
2	0 star service !
2	i used this service for the first time to send a bouquet to my daughters workplace choosing same day delivery option .

2	the item arrived_safely delivery was fast no_problems item there was a bit of a problem trying to line the screws up but once the screws was were no_problems also when one wants to fold the item up and place in cupboard or under bed one has to remove the screws which is a bit of a pain but over all happy with item
0	sent my phone off freepost and got the money transfered into the bank really quick only took about 0 days from posting till receiving money i ' d definitely use them again
0	i sent 0 parcels with parcel0go .

0	and all of this for less_than half the price of the same item from the lowest cost uk store , amazing really !
2	i recieved expert_advice .
2	highly_recommend them for your next kit .
0	before used to be missed collections , nowadays seems to be working , overall it ' s a good company for small to medium size parcels with sensible price , insurance on the items however not that great , most of them are covered to £_00 which you need to pay hell extra to insure it , sometimes even more_than the parcel postage price itself .
0	many_thanks .
2	i was amazed .
2	the help i got from sammie_taylor was excellent
0	when i called they were really unhelpful and arrogant .
2	unfortunately , the goods were severly damaged in transit and i have had to use some of the monies raised to replace the goods damaged by city_link .
2	we were very satisfied with the impression made by the napkins used .
0	thank_you envirofone you truly are amazing .

0	i would certainly use them again and recommend them to everyone i know .
0	very quick service and also very reliable . would recomend the service to anyone
2	ashley_: we attempted delivery and you where not in geoff , i am sorry
2	it '_s a no_brainer .
2	i sold my nokia n0 the other week .
2	used them before and yet again all went_smoothly , fantastic price and great service .
0	apart_from this minor query it has been a most helpful and useful service .
2	having upgraded my son to an iphone 0 , i recycled his htc_desire hd .
0	city_link informed me they made an error and would collect the next morning .
0	it was was vitally important that it arrived monday and i even called up to double_check this .
0	after being disappointed no less_than 0 times after buying 0 different sets of earphones / earbuds on a well_known auction site , i decided to do things properly and spend my money on getting a decent deal .
0	all in all , first time ordering from them was immense , would use them again , dv000 always seem to be out of stock on what i want unlike these_guys .
2	could not fault this service and no i don_'_t own any shares in the company !
2	customer_services not useful at all , apparently the drivers do not have mobile telecoms ( hmm ) so they can not contact drivers to confirm activities .
2	i am_delighted with my mazuma_mobile experience .
2	i sort of half expected them to offer less money by claiming there was something wrong with the phone ( even_though there wasn_'_t ) as happened with another site , but they didn_'_t , they paid what they quoted without_any hassle .
2	he was not a happy_chappy and just pointed and said flowers for no 00 . will not be using again
0	emails answered_quickly .
2	one ring was rather too large so it was returned and resized ( twice ) without_any extra fee being charged and , again , turn_round was fast and delivery was delayed ( at my request ) until after the honeymoon and then it was delivered on the stated date .
0	great camera , extremely fast delivery
2	and the enclosed handwritten note added a nice personal_touch to an online store !
2	this is the first time i have used this service and without catherines help i would have been lost .
0	had a slight_issue with one of my order , probably my own fault to start with .
2	use them on a regular_basis .
2	they were only too happy to exchange it , again , for the original size and did not ask for a penny more postage .
2	wish i knew of parcelhero when i had my business instead of parcelforce .
2	i had to argue with them and show them your payment invoice before they would take it in but they were still not convinced .
2	brilliant .
2	had an old phone to sell , picked on these_guys because i ' d seen more ads for them than anyone_else and all three phone recycling sites offered me the same money , however only mazuma could do a bank_transfer .
2	i usually use asda but thought of trying somewhere new .
0	catherine was fantastic and was so pleasant to talk too
0	awesome all_round !
2	a wide_selection of bbqs and excellently explained .
2	very happy customer now all i need to do is get out there and shoot .
0	customer_service is also very helpful .
2	recipient of flowers described them as " the most beautiful_bouquet of flowers " and was delighted with them .
0	she started laughing and said my mum should just be grateful she was getting flowers at all - i honestly thought i was going to explode with rage at that disgusting comment .
2	sammie_taylor , brilliant and patient , she was able to sort_out my problem with ease so i have every condifence in your company .
2	all_round happy bunnies .
2	i ordered - after advice on the phone - a phone with headset , but needed it for the next_day ( now consider it was 0 . 00pm when i placed the order )
2	flora queen is bad_news , bad business , crooked and useless as the employees working for them .
2	i was very impressed with the delivery options and the range of choice given .
0	buy some .
0	only a small portion of what i was owed , i received .
0	mazuma gave me a price for my phone , i accepted and then they sent me the envelope and i sent my phone back .
2	really happy with products and service from webtogs .
2	digitalrev is the 0st place i look for all my camera equipment .
2	it arrived just 00_hours after the order was placed , which is amazing .
0	will use again .
2	this is the third time i '_ve purchased flowers from this company and haven_'_t been disappointed either time .
2	00 out of 00
2	yet again good service from market cross .
0	flowers arrived on time on the day you arrange and they email you every_step of the way .
0	very impressed with how quick the service was .
2	a dead buch of roses ( not what i ordered was plonked outside the house at night on the following evening !
2	the key to good service is communication .
0	wow .
0	will order again !
0	!
2	i rang several_times and emailed just to be fobbed_off .
2	the response from the friend i sent the flowers to was very positive , lovely flowers .

2	yesterday i recieved my oakley crosslink prescryption glasses , i have
2	i posted my acer tablet for recycling at 00 : 00 on a thursday_afternoon .
0	but no need at 00 : 00 i had a photo of the flowers come through on my phone they were on time and are absolutely beautiful !
0	it only took a short time to let them know what mobiles i had , them to tell me how much i was getting for them , and to arrange for them to send me a pack , so i could post the mobiles off , free post to them .
2	would definately_use again .
2	simply choose from the stunning array of flowers , choose a ( free !)
0	on testing , one of the mics was superb and the other was very muffled .
2	" a parcel to go , to someone you know , it has to be p0g "
2	i have purchased two lots of sandals and a north_face jacket .
0	parcel0go were excellent in investigating what had happened and once they had all the info refunded me fully the cost of the item and courier fee .
0	probably the best store for dj ' s and musicians in general .
0	mazuma_mobile have hit the nail on the head with their mobile recylcing service .
0	thanks .
0	i am thoroughly unhappy with the " service ". my girlfriend didn ' t get her christmas_present this year .
2	was shooting with it friday_afternoon . in london
2	!
2	the plus is chocolates as well so its very good value .
2	you have to pay rm to tell you your package has arrived and to get that info have to log onto their site and put in your tracking_number - with myparcel delvery . com you get an_email to tell you this - absolutely free !!!
2	we live in n . ireland and my daughter lives in england .
0	thouroughly recommend .
0	thank_you
0	further to this , the fact that in all the communication i ’ ve had with yourselves i ’ m_assuming close to 00 emails on my behalf now , you ’ ve been the first person to offer an_apology - that ’_s absolutely_disgusting .
2	emma answered all my queries politely and efficiently .
2	today at 00 : 00 00 feb_0000 , they send me an e_- mail to tell me that they '_ll be delivering them tomorrow .
2	i have used interparcel for quite some time now to send my ebay items and i have to say that they have been excellent .

2	excellent communication and fast payment received .
2	all done now .
2	so easy and very quick with payment .
0	this compant is shameless and i regret not using trusted companies like interflora .
2	was kept_informed every_step of the way from confirmed delivery day / order despatched and then finally a notification that the order had been successfully delivered .
0	i will not make the mistake of using iflorist again .
0	haha well how on earth am i supposed to know what the problem is if you don ’ t ??
2	i have used parcel0go before and needed a reliable next_day service that would get two cream teas in a box ( including the clotted cream !)
0	i ' ve never needed glasses until now , i tried ray_ban glasses on in an opticians ( which were pricey ) but after researching on the internet the same ray_ban glasses i chose were really good value and i was happy with the delivery time .
2	if anything was wrong .
2	having never used anything but the post_office for all of my 00 years , i thought the projected cost of my largish parcel at approx £_00 more than a little ott !
0	ken bevis

2	many_thanks and would not_hesitate to use again or recommend to my friends .
2	i could not believe the feedback , it looked too good .
0	very quick service , received payment within 0 days of sending it off .
0	from the word go i felt they looked trustworthy : free returns , next_day delivery , detailed_descriptions .
0	they made up various excuses for the delivery not being made on time ( i . e my friend was not home when the delivery was made when she was , that she did not pick_up their phone_calls ( she never received a call until 00 sept ) and they they left calling_cards , which she also never received .
2	received a great quote off them initially , they only wanted to know whether the phone was working , did not ask for the condition of the phone , when they received it they requoted £_00 less_than the original offer , because they said the phone was scratched .
2	i really appreciated the text updates - just remained on tender hooks to hear from friend that she had received them !
2	an easy to use website , competative prices , brilliant communication , super_fast shipment , speedy affordable delivery , a treat in the box and funky promo material .
0	i hope everyone is like him in the future !
2	had an expensive french kettle which we bought after having too many fall to bits after a year or two .
2	its been really great to know that i never miss out on important ocassions even_though i am travelling all over the world with business , i wouldn_'_t use anyone_else .
2	in both_cases , the service was impeccable .
2	very quick and easy to use received cheque within 0 days . impressed !

0	the day my item was delivered to money0machines it was tested and the money was in my bank_account .
0	that was later removed by officials because it contained personal info .
2	will be back when i have more parcels to go !
0	and i hope you will find my comments useful and save_yourself money and stress .
0	but it wasn ' t .
2	she was so delighted with the flowers that she phoned to say she had shed a few tears of happiness because they were so beautiful .
0	could ` nt ask for any more for the price , superb and quick delivery
0	great price .
0	i have never received such bad customer_service , surely a company should be ready and capable of providing a service they offer , even at busy times .
0	what ' s the point in offering a service you can ' t provide and ruining people ' s special days ?
0	i have used many different flower delivery sites on the net over the years and serenata_flowers is by_far the best .
0	!
0	but couldn ' t believe_how sufficient the transaction was .
2	totally_satisfied - which is why i have now bought three_times from this company .
0	what a joke of a company no customer_service skills what so ever .
0	received the tv within a week of purchase .
2	amazing fast delivery .
2	haven spoken to customer_services about this issue they agreed and refunded me half the cost of postage and packaging i payed for the return of the boots and they also took onboard my concerns regarding the wording of the green icon .
0	he basically admitted that they overstretched themselves and were aware of all the complaints .
2	don_'_t risk them , use someone trustworthy instead is my advice .
2	so easy to complete transaction on line .
0	excellent in every respect , i wanted a durable headphone extension cable ( the ones i had been using previously broke with light use ) and that ' s exactly_what i got .
0	thank_you selectspecs !
0	the site was so easy to use , delivery was super_quick .
2	i have bought leather goods from all over the world , and i would hesitate now in using someone_else .
0	not only those two complaints , one wasn ’ t even answered and the other took three follow ups from myself and almost four hours for a response .
2	the lenses are perfect but as i intimated , the frames are made from cheaper material , but as i said , at this price , i can '_t complain .
2	and indeed , it turned_out to be true .
0	i couldn ' t have asked for better service from everyone_involved in this transaction . and will_definitely be shoping with sunglassesshop again soon !

0	since i was there to buy i didn ' t think much of it .
2	just to say that chantelle sumner is a credit to this company .
0	on the 00th just before 00 : 00 i called iflorist to find out why the order hadn ' t been delivered yet .
0	the checkout online was fast as simple .
2	the staff couldn_'_t be more helpful by phoning us to inform us when the items were to be expected and if there was a delay on any .
0	i am definitely going to recommend spectacles direct to my friends , and i am pretty sure that i am going to use your perfect service again !
2	catherine was very helpful today and sorted my problem within minutes excellent service thank_you very much .

2	they give me the impression of being a well - run , efficient company that really thinks about how they can help online customers .
2	i would reccomend them to my friends and family as they made it so simple and kept me informed from beginning to end .
0	couple the help with the cheap ( cheaper_than royal_mail ) prices and they have to be a winner .

2	i would certainly not_hesitate to use them again myself and would always recommend them to others .

2	0_stars
0	fantastic communication one of the best experience with internet shopping definitely recommended
0	this is the one that should have had tracking but i never even received a tracking_number .
2	they only cost a little more than higher end supermarket flowers , but that '_s where the similarity ends .
2	i have previously been caught_out by other_websites offering slightly more money but then taking ages and paying you less_than they offered .
2	that '_s just about wrapped it up !
0	i wont go into details of what happened last time .
0	i just talked to ally on the chat , and she has just said clearly to me there is some hope left , and that they will send me an_email , providing all the information i need to get my parcel back or to insure the loss i might have .
0	result was they said that we would have to pay again !
2	booked a parcel and then my printer broke so had to get intouch as they wouldn_'_t collect without the label , but thanks to michelle she sorted_out a different courier and got it me cheaper , thanks michelle

2	i did not have to pay for carriage , nor was it necessary physically to return the old boots - country_attire were able to work from digital photos of the faulty boot .
2	sold two phones on here now .
0	it only messes up my business feedback but somehow parcel0go can never compensate for there mistakes i pay for a service and i lose . 00_% time i have made orders i have had problems and i can say ive spent a lot of money via parcel0go and as new websites are coming along i may take custom else where if my orders keep getting messed_up .
2	i got the information i was looking for .
2	i would strongly_recommend mazuma to all friends and family the service is excellent you do not have to chase them they keep you informed continually every_step of the way .
0	i have just had a live_chat with leanne from parcel0go and she was excellent , very efficient and to the point .
2	absolute life savers for world book day .

0	i needed to change something on my order address and it was done by submitting a form quickly .

0	absolutely speechless !
2	great customer service and a very speedy delivery , well_worth using them and i will be using them for most of my e_cig things
0	my emails have not been thoroughly read , with members of your customer_service team continuously overlooking the fact that i already know that mm0000000 was a failed order , yet constantly referring back to it .
2	always take a gamble when you use someone new but am_delighted with the way the whole_thing was done .
0	i cant_wait to receive a phone call from my mum on saturday , once shes received them at work , im sure she will be over joyed .

2	!
2	they were extremely well_packaged , in strong boxes with lots of support and protection .
0	i spoke with her initially on the webchat but as my internet was playing up she offered to call me at home .
2	priceless . i have recommended them to my friends , who have listened to the sound system , and coudnt believe te sound that comes out of such small speakers .
2	so , guess_what ?
2	very well_packed too .
2	clear_descriptions of items on the site with no " clever " stock wording just what the item is , what it does and any other information you may need .
0	got £_000 for an 00 month old iphone_0gs 00gb which had a crack in the casing .
0	after a slight confusion with a tracking code , a chat with sam on facebook quickly solved the problem and was followed up to check everything was ok and the parcel had been deliverd .
2	used this company for the very first time .

0	absolutely fantastic !
0	with this i have been left with no option other than to take back my own words and rephrasing them as i will be back with digitalrev !!!!!
2	what more can i say
2	sammie has helped_me out a few_times before and is always friendly and efficient .
2	this has happened twice now , and with a request to upgrade to next_day delivery by way of compensation the agent just says they cant do that as it is not guaranteed .
2	webtogs were brilliant in dealing_with the return of the wrong boots and getting a new pair to me promptly .
2	very fast delivery , although had to send item back headphones due to wearer problems , not the product .
2	as always , they arrived on time and in great condition .

0	brilliant custormer service 00 out of 00
0	never again .
2	i recommend them without_reservation .

0	it is by_far the easiest phone_recycling company i have ued to date and i highly_recommend it !
2	then the hermes van pulled up at 0 . 00am and i had my day back .
0	the customer_service is haphazard , the responses are slow and scripted with no sense of urgency or actual interest in resolving the issue .
2	i am unlikely therefore to use the service again .
0	no .
0	great that they have an online_chat service and are able to give you a quick quote .
2	then i was recommended parcel0go - and wondered_if i should give it a try .
2	a friend was sent a parcel to be delivered by your company which has_gone_missing .
2	i needed to send a package to my daughter in egypt - tried to do it myself online but had some difficulty .
2	perfect just perfect . well_packed and as advertised !
0	thanks !
2	my account was credited with the money the same day they received my phone and i was kept up to date with many txt .
0	they have been faultless in the information they provide and the ease of use of their website should have their competitors quivering in the shadows .
2	i wish to warn_others of their incompetence
2	will use you again most definitely .
2	!
0	the camera and tripod arrived very quickly and were very well_packaged .

0	he resolved my query within a matter of minutes and was very polite and very easy to understand .
2	could not believe the ease & speed that the transaction was comlpleted .
2	then you can just pop it straight into the nearest post box , get a free proof of posting receipt at your local post_office , or pay for recorded delivery .
2	quick response .
0	the site is organised in the same way i categorise hoisery in my head , which makes finding what i want easy .
2	i placed an order when redirected by local amazon and saw that the voucher discount had not been seen .
0	i ’ ve been through all this just so that endclothing could press another 00 £ out of me .
2	not only was the the price the lowest by half !
2	i was told it is not dhl or tge place to check or report if a package is not collected ???
2	everything was quick , friendly but very efficient too !
2	it was proving to be a bit of a minefield until i found the parcel 0 go site and used the online_chat service .

2	the service was easy to use and so fast !
2	would recommend 000_% as their price was also great .
0	i thought royal_mail was a well respected and integral part of our economy and infrastructure which could be trusted to deliver my item safely .
0	i had a parcel that was delivered to the wrong customer .
2	my confusion was further impounded as the tracking_number that worked previously was now not traceable .
0	brilliant service .
2	while i do sometimes use [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference_] labelling functionality , because of this service quality i use them less and less .
0	instead i was given the rather cheerful , robotic reply , that , instead she could offer me a delivery . " on any day of my desire " failing to spot , this was not compensation . as i had already specified my desired date .
0	load of rubbish !
0	:)
0	however , look at the website and they say they pay for import_duty and insurance directly with dhl , this just isnt true .
0	fast delivery , excellent packaging , overall 00 / 00 loved it
2	mazumamobile " they do exactly as they say on the tin "
2	over the weekend i was able to track the shipment on every_stage of its journey .
0	i didn ' t need the document , but the fact they ' d gone_through this extra level of effort ( and that it was genuinely well written and amusing ) ranks them highly in my book .
0	i try to redo , and this time click the " x " at the top of the cropping box ( as in not wanting to crop at all ).
0	good prices , fast_shipping and perfect communication .
2	purchasing easy and recipient delighted with the flowers .
2	found this recycling site through a recommendation and was apprehensive_about using a postal service .
2	the website had the dimensions of the box and so i took it to one of the drop_off points ( a mace shop which was called on the website st nicholls news & convenience in york , yo00 0tu ).
2	money paid promptly by_bacs .
2	i '_ll have to look for another florist for my future requirements .
2	my recommendation is do not risk using this company - you only have to look on here to see the high_volume of unhappy_customers .
0	have no_problems to report , all received by recipient in great condition .
2	i always look to see what deals are on and there is always discounts
2	efficient and painless transaction !
0	defiantly a trustworthy site and vendor .

2	why shop anywhere_else ?
0	they cheat & scam to get orders .
0	am gunna say is there very very very brill and i would recommend anybody to use them for that i will give them aaa +
0	fantastic .
0	the camera also came with english manuals and uk style power_adapter even_though the box had chinese language written on it .
2	what a fantastically talented family .
2	absolutely_disgusted .
0	internet shopping made easy !
0	with gems and stuffs , how the flowers are arranged , tied and presented are top_notch .
2	and i made an incredible saving as this was a sale item and also with free_p_&_p !
2	parcel collected from scotland by a very courtious driver and sent to austria .
0	luke was absolutely fantastic and put up with me constantly being a pain and changing my mind about the size without complaint .
2	collect_plus is a great alternative parcel carrier that offers better size and weight options that what is deemed as " the norm ".
2	the whole_experience was simplicity_itself and worked a treat - fast , efficient and effective !
2	a friend recommended this site for selling my mobile .
2	will be very happy to use seranta flowers again
0	i checked with my boyfriend and he confirms this was not his message to me that he wrote to go with the flowers .
0	i ' m surprised that they are still running considering the amount of poor reviews on here .
0	don ' t be_fooled by the positive_reviews ; it ' s very clear that they have problems when the complaints are of the same nature .
2	in other words , they feel free to lie on the website , not deliver when they say they will , to provide unfit goods and to operate outside the law .
2	i managed to lock myself out of my account tonight and needed to get access to arrange a pickup .
2	the only problem is that the wife loves them and i may never get to wear them now .
2	dazland .

0	after this webchat , i was again sent a claims_form through email .
2	i can now plan my days ahead without worrying_about missing the delivery of my parcel .
2	some did perk up after 00_hours - but not the majority but . who_wants to receive dead looking flowers .
0	the description of the item was absolutely perfect , the images of the item were clear and easy to see and the price was very reasonable .
0	will_definitely use parcel0go again for sending parcels witin or outside uk .
2	when i complained they offered me an_apology and a terse explanation that the selection might vary and a 00_%_discount for my inconvenience .
0	felt_like talking to a real_person for a change rather_than just another call_centre drone following a script .
0	00 hour turnaround - the way it should be .
2	as a result a friend who deals with karaoke has added this seller to his favourites .
0	fred_: from anyone !
2	!
0	reliable and seamless transaction
2	was looking for a step - up from headphones supplied with itouch , and read a review on hifiheadphones . co . uk .

0	saved a hundred quid , cant_believe_how fast it arrived , tracking was great , product great .
2	never mind that you wouldn_'_t know that the package hadn_'_t been delivered unless you went to their website .
0	!
2	instead of delivering the personalized greeting , you delivered a blank card .
0	unacceptable .
2	as promised we received an_email_advising of delivery date , received a phone_call from the delivery company giving us time to get home for the delivery and saving us waiting around .
0	they have never quibbled the price agreed on any of the handsets i have sent in , and payment is always fast , especially now they they pay directly into your bank_account - perfect !
0	i have sent two phones to mazuma recently , both arrived next_day , i was kept up to date as the order was being_processed , they sent me regular_emails as the phone was being tested and the money went straight into my bank_account same day , very pleased and very quick .

2	lenka
0	fanks again mate !!!!
2	they stock the best at the most competitive_prices .
2	plus , one of them is marked `` delivered `` on their web - site , when it is not .
0	every time i ' ve ordered vinyl from chemical it has come packaged perfectly and the quality / condition has always been top_notch .
2	the chat session has_been closed by your parcel0go representative .
0	easy to use , easy to send and easy to receive payment .
0	i did previously try purchasing it via their ebay site until i realised that they didn ' t cover import taxes on those purchases , so i cancelled my order so that i could purchase it via their website .
2	it was sent out on friday and i got paid on monday .
2	if i was asked whether or not i would recommend serenata_flowers i would have to say no after my experience .
0	i always use parcel0go but in this case the manufacturer of a faulty product arranged to get the item picked_up for free and so i had to cancel my order with parcel0go .
2	:)
0	i would highly_recommend this shop to everyone , the service i received was immense ( special thanks to kim from customer_services who promptly replied to my emails and kept me up to date with the progress of exchanged order ).
0	thanks guys , i know it was not your fault but it was a very special day .
0	i would avoid ordering from this company again .
2	this coupled_with the long waiting time for this outfit to answer emails make their whole business a farce , needles to say this was the first and last time i will use these_people .
2	i ordered on thursday at 0pm and my item arrived friday_morning , and that was to the north of scotland !
0	avoid like the plague and will never ever recommend or use them again !
2	brilliant service second to none , would recommend any day .
2	ordered one day , then came the next_day !
0	i will_definitely keep using it for both delivery and receiving packages .
0	the service has been second to none and no matter how many questions i asked it was never too much_trouble for them .
2	great service , great prices .
2	brilliant service .
2	i sold 0 phones to mazuma in the last 0 year and received £_000 .
0	i will avoid this company from now on .
2	order arrived on time , great service .
2	great service from start to finish !
0	mazuma_mobile were great in handling the sale of my phone .
0	i would like to gurn and cry a bit more but really cant be bother dealing_with a pro english company that is happy to move the goal posts at the last_minute for their scottish customers , which seems to me like its a little_bit racist and i for one will tell anybody that is thinking of using dpd that they would be quicker jumping on a push bike and going to collect their goods themselves as dpd are in one word . useless !
2	again service is excemplory kept_informed that item picked and ready for dispach , email to let me know when dispached and the expected delivery date .
0	there customer_service number just rings until it reaches an answer phone which is full .
2	i ordered a protank kanger from safercigs , and it arrived in no time .
0	excellent service all around !
2	[_external_reference_] might be expensive but at_least they are very efficient as they got my parcel to japan in just 0 days .
0	the web_site gives excellent advice and details for each headphone , no need to search the internet for reviews .
0	i would definatly deal with them again !
2	thank_you .
2	tnt passed the buck but this company did not want to know !!

0	and how to prove your love ?
2	having booked a 0 - 0 day delivery service on tuesday 0th of may , i sit here tonight on thursday 0th_may at 0pm with neither a pick_up or a drop_off !
2	i sent a large shipment with them , thinking they were one of the biggest names .
0	so after my last review , i have finally received an e_- mail , but a displeasing one .
2	selectspect for their service .
0	i ordered flowers from iflorst for same day delivery on 00 september and the flowers didn ' t arrive until 00 september - and they were very mediocre flowers too !
2	i '_ll be back .
0	anyway , back off to dr i go , dr are still continuing to blame dhl , in fairness , dhl have done everything they can and have been sooo much more helpful than dr , dr are just not interested and i keep on getting fobbed_off with excuses and each time i speak to them it ' s still at " investigating " but no sign of a refund or replacement in sight .
2	by comparison interflora ( who i will use again ) send the right selection and can '_t do enough to ensure the customer is satisfied .

0	a very poor service !
2	a kettle is just a kettle , or is it ?
2	hassle_free , but prices could be a bit higher i think .
0	i ordered valentines_day flowers to be delivered today .
2	very impressed with quality and speed of delivery .
2	so it wasn_'_t really a table decoration it was a hanging wreath with a candle to go in the middle .
2	booked a collection from a remote_location .
2	there appears no urgency or concern just buck passing which is not what i would expect in the current world .
2	query was efficiently and quickly resolved by emma .
2	i had issues with a weird us zip code very helpful guy called daniel sorted it out .
0	two days_later i contacted them and was told to make a claim seen their can ' t locate my package and since i wasn ' t insured was only reliable for a £_00 pay out .
2	i found it very difficult to communicate with anyone from the business as it was strange pro format emails .
0	log a case detailing everything i received and uploading photos .
2	they earn their ***** rating !
0	this was perfect as it only took a few_days to get the money and it was easy
0	dont waste your time and money use someone_else
2	wish all call_centres had a lauren .

2	thanks daniel , excellent customer service .
0	i have never used iflorist before but to be honest , tried them because they were affordable .
0	what ' s the point of ordering something for an occasion if it doesn ' t get there ?
2	good quality and reasonable_prices .
0	i honestly can ' t fault them so in the interests of fairness thought i should add my positive experience here .
2	always gives us a good choice of carriers , and we obviously always go for the cheapest for us !!
0	daniel who i spoke to helped_me sort out the problem i had really quickly with no_fuss or hassle which makes using parcel0go a lot_easier .
2	the flowers that i ordered a few_days in advance of valentine day failed to arrive on valentine day and instead they were delivered the day after valentine day ( saturday 00th ).
2	i would certainly recommend this to my friends and should i need to sell a mobile_phone again i will be using this website .
2	i have then sent in a screen_shot of the service clearly_stated on interparcel website and then i have been told that the saturday service is not guaranteed anyway so i won_'_t be able to have a refund .
0	well_done hifiheadphone staff !!
2	surely the site can be more user_friendly than this !
0	i received my cheque very quickly after sending the kindle on , which has inspired enough confidence in me to recommend this company to others .
0	0 working_days so far and counting ….
0	my reservations were unfounded .
0	wow !
0	it was a little annoying but everyone makes mistakes .
2	i have to stay online to check .
2	i had text_messages informing_me when my order had left the depot , when my order was on its way and another when it had been delivered .
2	flowers for my mums birthday , she was absolutely_delighted with them .
2	told the flowers are lovely and fresh .
0	!
2	order q0000000 flowers nice but why was there no card attached and delivery did not ring the bell
0	product arrived so fast , so fast that i was out at the time and had to arrange to be delivered at a time that i wouldn ' t be working which meant an extra £_00 which was a bit_annoying .
2	i was absolutely amazed at the speed of delivery of my parcel to perth , w australia and the tracking process .
2	thanks mazuma .
2	my parcel was delivered to a customer but had sustained damage during_transit .
0	its win_win with these_guys .
0	i had a very specific idea of what i wanted and was able to order exactly that , while my husband wanted to view a number of options and the website has so much choice he was able to browse to find just what he wanted .
2	i had to return an item due to wrong_size selection - normally an awful job when internet_shopping .
2	i am a dj with clients growing daily .
0	the item was crushed in a flat box with no care at all . not willing to refund postage return even_though its their fault .
2	they kept in touch with me by text and email and the machine arrived within a few_minutes of their estimated time .
0	this left me with a feeling i might not use your service again .
0	well worth doing .
0	lens pouch
0	camera arrived in 0 days ( very fast considering it came from_hong_kong to the uk ) and i was kept up to date on the delivery .
0	will_definitely use again !
0	- great news ( only have to wait a few more days ) ****** reminder 0 day service ***********.
0	very pleased .
0	an explanation would have been appreciated .
2	i needed to send my mum an extra special hug to help her through a tough few_days , and i remembered how i had received a very special , i florist basket when i had been ill in 0000 .
0	thank_you !
0	really really awful .
2	to : helicopter000000 @_hotmail . co . uk
2	shopping in their stores is also a pleasant_experience , their staff know their goods and are very helpful .
0	first time using mazuma and glad i did .
0	fast delivery , great price , very well_packaged , and considering it came from_hong_kong the delivery was amazingly fast .
0	the slowest part of the whole experience was when the uk took over and did what uk does best for its inhabitants , it makes you wait and wait .
0	i had previously tried to sell on ebay with no luck , and with additional_costs for photo ' s i found ebay quite an expensive inconvenience .
0	i was refused both and over all am completely disgusted with the company and will avoid them in future and go out of my way to make_sure others do too .
0	do not use parcel0go !
0	everyone should avoid this website .
2	the one i have is an f series they all look similar - a lens in a small sphere surrounded by infrared leds .
2	needed to clarify a few points on the quotes i received online so clicked on their online_chat button and went through very quickly to sarah_hayes who was efficient , friendly and professional .
0	very easy set_up and nothing complicated .
0	few more days_later . no reply from anyone . speak again on web chat : explain myself and the situation , explain how angry i am for doing all the running around . anyway . states hes a supervisor " peter " - and that the parcel is defiantly lost and that i should open a claim , while they chase the courier company again " yodel ".
2	my wife has not had it off , it is so cosy , smart & waterproof .
0	i also had quick responses to all of my emails .
0	as i am on a student budget i searched the internet for the florist that could offer me the best quality flowers for the best value , and thats when i found iflorist .
2	i would definitely_use parcel0go again and would not_hesitate to recommend them .
2	they dont make false claims about the products they supply , and are willing to demonstrate using their products themselves .
0	it arrived with a dented rim and broken spokes and lost items and after being asked by fedex uk to supply more info and details they basically did nothing for me .
2	would i use them again ?
0	items were placed in envelope , with an order form provided .
2	!
0	i have previously only had positive_experiences with this shop .
2	excellent service and saved a lot of money .
0	thank_you [_name ] for all your help today :)
2	today i went to see her , and she said " come and see my flowers " - and when i went into her lounge i was astounded at the stunning display of white_roses and freesias which she had placed on the windowsill .
0	but it was dispatched quickly and arrived on the date shown .
2	also delivered to the door now all i have to do is go outside to use them
2	no_fuss , no drama , quoted me the best trade in price for my phone and kept me informed at every_stage of the transaction . virtually idiot_proof guide through the whole_process and cash arrived in my bank exactly when they said it would . would recommend mazuma to anyone_wishing to trade a phone in , oh and no_messing_around trying to find all the bits and bobs that came with your phone , all they ask for is phone and battery !
0	they rip you off saying some litmus paper inside has turned a different_colour which implies water has got in !
2	excellent service , very highly_recommended indeed .
0	will be buying some more soon !
0	will be recommending !
0	i received my product , which i struggled to find elsewhere , the day after i ordered it during snow ( dec ' 00 )!
0	in the end it is quite a distance and items i ship are fragile .
2	00 / 00 for this one thanks .
0	i have to say i don ' t hold out any confidence of them arriving , nevermind if they ' ve managed to get my script ' correct etc .
0	i purchased a pair of shoes and bought the wrong_size .
2	a cracking service .
2	geoff_: give me a minute .
2	i '_ve been using interparcel for over 0 years with my business , and have only once had a failed collection , and when that happened - they cared and refunded me straight_away , and rebooked with someone_else .
0	i ' ve ordered the enkore brush set and i was pleasantly_surprised of the good quality ( i have ordered brushes on - line before from a different company and they were horrible , so i didn ' t know what to expect ).
2	great service !!!!
2	and my friend was delighted
2	shambolic !!!
2	i have not received the order i placed with this company .
0	instead they delivered flowers the next_day , no discount or apology offered .
2	i agreed and received the jacket 0 days_later .
2	do not think ebay is better or you '_ll get more money .
2	sammie_taylor was the chat assistant and she answered very quickly and resolved the issue .
2	prompt delivery .
0	i explained to the customer that incorrectly received the extra parcel that city_link would be collecting next_day from her workplace .
2	the only extra was the postage , and that was reasonable too .
2	the only company i found that could deliver to the date i required - appreciate the flexibility
2	this is the second time i have used them and would recommend to anyone .
0	just want to say a big thanks to jenny @ parcel0go online help , she helped_me with all my queries really quickly and knew_exactly_what she was talking_about enabling me to send my first parcel via this website !
2	missed the driver today to collect my parcel , so contacted their live_chat website , spoke to the charming sammie_taylor who was sooooo helpful , booked my collection for the next_day .
0	a lady by the name of emma appeared & sorted my problem in a dash , in fact the problem was a dash , the dash in the postcode format needed to be removed .
0	our greenstar elite juicier is great !
2	i got a very decent price on monday_evening , sent off the phone tuesday_morning , received confirmation that the phone had been received on wednesday and then received payment via an amazon voucher friday .
2	cheapest on the net so couldn_'_t be_happier .
2	flowers were for an elderly lady on her_birthday .
2	as a barbour fan i have used country_attire several_times before .
0	!
0	ring up p0g - speak to advisor - i get advised that " if you are not happy with the offer , reject it and the claim team will review the case again and get back to you "
2	cannot recommend highly_enough .
0	was slightly confused with how to arrange something to be delivered after they had tried a couple of times .
2	all the bouquets i ' d seen were much of a muchness , and extortionately priced for what they were !
0	their live help is a 0 * service .
2	be warned !
2	tried ' live_chat ' and they just leave you hanging there with no one replying .
0	and so on
2	excellent !
0	quick responses to any_questions .
0	i had placed an order for the flowers and decided to cancel the order .
2	we didn_'_t realise that the service had reverted to a 0 day delivery so had to cancel and re - book .
0	a query i had with customer_services was resolved extremely efficiently by customer_services advisor sammie_taylor - was a pleasure to deal with and very helpful indeed - thanks sammie !
0	good job .
0	was online in seconds to help and sorted my problem out instantly , was no hassle to cancel my collection and request a refund ,
0	truly recommend to order some pieces , you won ' t be disappointed !
0	so on the morning of the 0rd jan my chosen delivery date i logged on to track to find no tracking_number , alarm_bells rung as i ' d seen the other reviews on here after_placing my order .
0	the booking process is easy , they have a multitude of payment options , customs paperwork is straight_forward , and the prices are the cheapest i can find .
0	much cheaper_than royal_mail
0	what she received was a pathetic looking cluster of off cuts and a fluffy white center piece which is laughable and totally ridiculous .
2	please think_twice before you pay for hand delivered disapointment .
2	they had the coat and it was cheaper then anywhere_else that i found , and a lot_cheaper then the original rrp price .
0	canon_000d - by_far the best £_000 - odd i ' ve spent in my life .
2	once is bad , twice is completely_unacceptable .
2	so , i began doing some research . beware those very low - cost couriers - just read what unhappy_customers have to say about them !
2	what a result .
2	i needed advice quickly so that i could amend this and still get them sent off today .
0	the experience with using mazuma couldn ' t have been better or smoother ; i shipped the phone on a monday , by 0pm on the tuesday , the full payment was in my bank_account .
0	thank_you to sammie_taylor for quickly sorting_out my collection problem with no_fuss .
2	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use hi - spek again .
2	wanted information on if there was the availability of insurance_cover on 0 boxes i have to send in the uk .
0	not even sure whether to let them taje it as fairly sure they ' ll loose it .
0	0 .
2	would have no_hesitation in using them again .
0	omg absolutly brill it only took 0 days and that was sending my phone off and then getting the cheque .
2	my concern with a courier company was resolved and exceeded my expectation .
0	avoid at all costs .
2	great designs & great price ( 0 for 0 !)
2	it is also booked with a completly different name
2	also when i phoned for advice about the product i was buying the person i spoke to was knowledgable about it and very positive and helpful .
2	would use again
2	my selected shades arrived by courier next_day and fortunately the remaining bit of summer allowed me to pose to my heart '_s desire .
2	happy .
0	i was reluctant as i had a bad_experience selling my last phone , a nokia_0000 to cex . com .
0	yes uou guessed , £_00 . 00 spent , flowers ordered for 00th_dec , well in_advance , but bo flowers delivered ,

2	i saw an offer on money saving_expert for a pair of oakleys which i ordered but the they didn_'_t actually have any stock and having alredy taken the payment all they were interested in is trying to get more money from me to upgrade my order .

2	first_class service couldnt_ask for more they even keep you informed of progress through out the transaction
0	when i emailed them , they said i ' d bought the last one , and that those brackets were now out of stock , so they only charged me for one .
2	no online help available .

2	i explained , luckily my friends believed me , it was still quite embarrassing !
0	i have never had any reservations_about using serenata for flowers , and have used them exclusively for nearly seven years now .

0	what does that mean ?
0	good friendly staff who are happy to help , provided a good service
0	the only issue i had was with hermes not interparcel , it was just booked through them , the problem with hermes they hire ' car owner couriers ' who tend to take it a lot less seriously than those with a name badge and a company van .

0	excuse me , what service actually ?
0	very easy website , great pricing , delivery very quickly and at christmas .

2	tracking_facility is great and whenever they give me the cheapest price i use them . which is 00_% of the time for heavier parcels .
2	by this time it was time to cancel with of course another few_days taken for them to confirm .
2	any way , those from tnt courier is so efficient they sorted_out parcels on route and delivery once on land and got mine well ahead of estimated time .
2	never again eflorist , never again !
0	it took 00_minutes to log all the phones on the website using the imei numbers and they instantly recognised the phones , gave me a quote and sent out the pack to post back to them within 0 working day .
2	' next working day delivery '.
0	orders are processed and shipped very quickly and always come exactly as expected , prices are also excellent .
0	as in my personal opinion , i will never order flowers with this company as i do not really want to be let_down once more .

2	would always definitely recommend them .
2	always helpful .
0	very pleased .

0	it is always an anxiety to know what happens with a portal if there is a problem .
2	i must be blind because i cannaot find any scratches , but i bought a new screen from amazon for £ 0 . 00 , just in case , and it took less_than 0 minutes to fit .
2	will recommend
0	avoid them at all costs !
0	i rang interparcel again , you can guess who i spoke to .
2	after a really bad_experience of buying a sewing_machine online i was scared of buying online again .
2	smooth process from start to finish and speedy delivery .
2	place the order sunday_night and the the item was with me by tuesday midday having come from hong_kong .
0	i am now hoping for a wedding_ring to match !

0	very pleased , i was slightly unsure of how this worked as i had never used a service like this before - have always gone to the post_office .

0	an outstanding service without complaint from the driver , well_done and thank_you .
0	i tried to call iflorist but they do not have a telephone_number .

2	good value for money and very quick !
2	the lens itself was purchased to be used with an infrared converted camera , i was a bit_sceptical as 00_% of users reported hotspots with this lens , but i took a gamble that paid off as the pictures are hotspot free . its early days but at the moment i am_delighted with my purchase . i have used digitalrev many_times and have never had any_problems .

2	good customer service and quick_turnaround times .

0	great selection , reliable delivery ( i used standard ), and excellent prices .
2	hassle_free , quick and efficient .

0	just sent another one asking for a full_refund .
2	specs are not so comfortable as my last pair ( from specsavers ) but these were a lot_cheaper so i guess you pay your money , you take your choice .
0	the flowers were disgusting , its like they just put a bunch of old flowers together and wrapped it in a plastic wrapper and put it in a plastic container !
2	that '_s about half a dozen units over the last five years .
0	thanks !!!
0	keep up the good work p0g .
2	i really appreciate our customer '_s patience given that she had to wait for so long for the item and am deeply embarassed with the level of service that she encountered from the courier who ultimately transglobal must take some responsibility for as they were the ones that sold us this service .
0	easy to use website , i found the envolope arrived_promptly and after i had sent the phone off i found it suprising how fast the money was transferred after they had received the phone .
0	they always go out of the way to make_sure things get sorted out .

2	very fine articles .
2	just take your parcels along to a shop the parcel is scanned a receipt with tracking code given to you .
0	thank_you very much .
0	i am very disappointed in thier service and i will not be using again !
0	so i went with that !
2	would recommend to anyone it '_s a no brainier !
0	most companies are happy to sell you something but when it goes_wrong they tend to run a mile & don ' t want to know . i had problem with pair of ray_bans i purchased from red_hot .
0	bought from them in the past , decided to buy another camera .
0	they didn ' t , and i was rather upset by this as i ' ve never had bad_experiences with p0g ever !
2	can '_t fault this company .
2	beat that !
2	how can i help you today ?
2	with hindsight , and bearing in mind that the phone was only worth £_00 , i should have opted for ' normal ' delivery with proof of posting , which , while only providing $_00 cover , would have been much_cheaper .
0	great customer experience and will_definitely use serenata_flowers again .
0	many_thanks .
0	they also said they would reimburse any return_postage_costs , where a lot of companys in that situation won ' t and the onus is on the customer to fork_out for shipping .
0	in the future i will definatelly buy stuff from this web_site ! thank_you !
0	plus , you guys sponsor wong fu productions .
0	i opened the box to expect a lovely bunch of flowers but to my dismay i found 00 shriveled half_dead roses and nothing premium about them at all .
0	si
0	while equal in value this was not what i had ordered or paid for .
2	quality and quantity of the flowers could only be described as superb
2	0 lots of mothers_day flowers ordered 00 stems in each , neither were delivered on the correct day , both were substituted with 0 nearly dead flowers that didn_'_t live until monday .
2	it feels once they had my money they don_'_t care about the goods or service i have received !
0	it didn ' t come with the message card and oh , they actually smelled bad too .
2	wow !
2	a very quick and accurate response .
2	werde floraprime auf jeden fall wieder nehmen bei zukueftigen bestellungen .

2	someone give her a pay rise !
2	like them a lot .
2	serious seller , reliable and very accurate , meticulous descriptions of items for sale , great price and fast delivery , just perfect
2	you can '_t do better_than that !
2	the next shop was fine with the size of the parcel but if there is a size limit on parcels some shops then this should be made clear .
2	also your company claimed they delivered 0 parcels it was only one !
2	having used p0d for some time now , i am happy to say they are the most reliable couriers i have ever used .
2	very fast delivery , product well_wrapped .
0	waxx_underwear have been my favourite for years i buy them for everyone there designs never fade and they always look sexy fresh and new !
0	it ' s 0 : 00
0	also because the prices are competitive as well , i buy flowers a lot more_than i have ever done in the past .
2	because of this service i would certainly use this company again .
2	i have previously used interflora and although i found them to be really good i started reading the reviews and became quite sceptical_about the size of the bouquet that i was ordering as they did not match the beautiful pictures next to it .
2	in 0 days the package was bought , wrapped , collected in belfast and delivered in toronto what more could i ask for - thank_you so much .
2	i posted the phone and got a cheque three days_later !
0	interparcel showed no sympathy apart_from saying ' i understand ' which means the opposite and would not cover the cost to sort this out .
2	i would rather have kept the phone as a spare than give it to them for free .
0	( in the past tnt have faked signatures for people who were not in and the parcel has turned_up somewhere_else so i know they can be dishonest and some drivers will cheat the system ) i know its not interparcel ' s fault that tnt were shoddy but then what am i paying them for ?
2	i posted my phone to them on the 0th ( during a week of heavy snowfalls and post disruptions ) and received an_email on 0the to say they had received the phone and a cheque had been posted to me .
2	letter to trading_standards on the way .
0	i had been looking to purchase a new canon camera for months and after browsing online i found a selection of online stores .

2	i used this business to send flowers to my old auntie on her 00th_birthday , i was bowled_over by their service , the flowers arrived in very good time , same day service , they kept me informed all the way and finished off with a email to me after the delivey , that was the most revealing part of their good service , try it and be pleasently supprised , youll be glad you used them , i will again to be sure .
0	to make things worse the flower ( received in a box ) had obviously been sitting in the van that delivered them overnight and no_longer contained water in the bag wrapped round the bottom of the flowers !!!
0	perfect .
2	i got an_email_saying my case was going to the ' escalation department , still nothing .
0	avoid .
0	stil didn ' t get through .
2	i came accross this company after searching for some hifi speakers and im very immpressed with the quality and service i received from hifi_tower , even_though some reveiws of these speakers were mixed feedback ie some say very good some say not good , i decided to take a chance and purchased them , they were delivered in lightning speed 0 days and im very immpressed with them . for the price they are one of the best speakers ive ever had , rich sounding base and clear and crystal high range i have them hooked up to a pioneer system and they sound fantastically better_than the original pioneer speakers , if your thinking of buying hifi speakers then hifi_tower is the first place to browse highly_recommended .
2	she gave me the verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders and didn_'_t seem to care that the flowers had been left there for 0 days so look awful or that they should not have been left on the doorstep at all had the delivery instructions on the label been followed - ( if recipient not at home , please leave securely on premises or with a neighbour .
0	i was very pleasantly_surprised , after_reading other reviews , so decided to give it a go !
2	everything happened exactly as predicted and the whole_process was quick and speedy .

2	as always , a beautifully crafted item .
2	i got regular emails and text_messages so i could track the delivery and my friend was delighted with the quality and freshness .
2	great products allways helpfull
0	what can i use that for ?
0	pretty_much a perfect online shopping_experience from the get go .
0	the odd obvious copy paste of key phrases but who can blame them !
2	i also called when i had difficulty printing off the postage labels , took a while to fix as i ' m not at all computer_savvy , but with the help of [_name ],_[_name ],_[_name ] and [_name ]( i think - had the whole team in on this !!!)

0	it was a very quick and easy process .

0	and a tracking_number which didn ' t work .
0	there is also no phone number to speak to someone .
0	it came very well_packed and just as_described .
0	my girl showered me with love and presents , and wanted to delight her at work .
0	in case you would like to return item " fly series trucker cap [ one size ]" for refund in yesstyle stored credit , we will regard it as an unwanted item return and no return_postage reimbursement will be arranged .
2	brilliant service .
2	thanks fonebank .
2	good service without hassle !
0	got paid no problem .
0	having being in a rush to sort out a parcel for next_day delivery on the same day i was in a bit of a dilemma as i didn ' t know whether or not i could do it or not .
2	i chose the bouquet by the price and the colour , the one chosen was free delivery , i had presumed that it would be delivered by a local_florist not by parcel_force , the recipient received the flowers late_afternoon , just before leaving their office .
2	i knit items for charities and it can get expensive posting them off but with parcel0go i can send them off for less_than the post_office charges .
2	i was delighted with the gift and learned later that my daughter had purchased them from webtogs .
2	if you want to see how they value customer service . note how often their online help is working .
2	i feel as if i took them in person , my sister - in - law who is recovering miles_away in surrey from me in scotland was delighted with the flowers she received .
2	we ordered flowers for mothers_day , when they arrived the box was crushed , the flowers inside were dead and those that werent had the heads falling_off .
2	simply the best internet_shopping_experience i have ever had
0	absolutely professional and friendly , very helpfully operators .
0	a great site , easy to use , excellent deals and genuine bargains to be had .
2	easy to select & buy exactly the spec sunglasses you want .
2	thanks
0	don ' t think i ' ll be re - ordering again !
0	what a shame some other people have had such bad_experiences !
0	this was the first time i used mazumamobile .
2	great , efficent and value - for - money service - thank_you !
2	sorry to say the flowers were not as good quality as they normally are .
0	keep up the good work collect_+ and please never take a leaf_out of their book .
0	emily earp is a star , pleasant and polite service .
2	there has_been no contact from them since i advised that i would look in to taking further legal_advice if they did not refund my £_00 immediately .
0	delivery service was over a week .
0	for exactly the same service lensesinglasses ( which is the re glazing service offered by spectacles direct ) quoted me £_00 !
2	i posted it back to them and i received payment within a couple of days .
0	decent prices won ' t shop for sunglasses anywhere_else . also these use dpd as their courier which is by_far the best out there at the moment :)
0	i insist on a full_refund and would like someone to contact me asap !
0	i spoke to the chat representative , daniel .
2	i had it recommended to me by friends and i am so glad i listened to them .
0	no email has been received .
2	harwich
2	they were absolutely_gorgeous and much_appreciated by the recipient .
2	the delivery was as stated , and i was informed by text and email from serenataflowers when it had happened .
0	currently considering some mods and daz has been brilliant in explaining them to me so i can make my own decision on what to buy .
0	the check was sent within 00_hours , fantastic service .
0	i ordered 0 pairs of distance prescription_glasses , savannah 0000 wayfarer style and savannah 0000 pattern at £ 0 each !!
0	this has left me sorry that i ordered something at endclothing this time .
0	iv had to speak to this company on 0 occasions and i ' m so impressed with their service .
0	not only was this out of delivery hours , i feel was especially late for the fact that they were flowers sent in sympathy to a grieving family who had been at work all day and would have needed the evening to wind down .
0	had some early reservations obviously as i hadn ' t heard of them and it was on the internet , but still had a look .
2	i contacted the parcel0go live_chat service on two occasions ( yesterday and today ) enquiring the status of some parcels i was expecting .
0	i had an issue with a courier , but parcel0go sorted it straight_away within 00_hours and the chat support operator rose was excellent and prompt with her advice .
2	i have been telling all my friends and work_colleagues even as far as showing them the site .
2	as advertised .
2	awesome service !
2	the flowers arrived as scheduled and the bouquet was beautiful !!
0	i would recommend you to them they are great !
2	this incident cost me 000 . 00 , no apologies , refund for undelivered item , nada .
0	i was gutted when my auna speaker blew out at a party , when i wasn ' t even playing at a very loud volume .
0	have used interflora before , much_better quality of flowers , actually look how they are supposed to .
0	customer_service at the absolute forefront , they have been massively helpful and have always gone above and beyond to ensure that i am able to make the best decisions on the best equipment at the best prices .
2	will defintely be in touch with you to send all future parcels to my family in italy .
0	outstanding service and i was able to track the delivery the whole way through fedex .
0	etc .
0	next_day delievery !
0	shocking service .
0	have ordered several_times from webtogs .
2	many_thanks to serenataflowers for delivering this excellent product
0	- ok , at_least they found it .
2	i loved the way that they showed you what was on offer . especially as i don_'_t know a daisy from a triffid . but i know what my mum '_s lounge looks_like and the colours that would match so it made it easy to choose
2	i have used parcels0go for some time now and have never had a problem to date .
0	i usually have no problem with chemical except with this order and a few others .
2	the item was delivered in a good sized box with plenty of bubble_wrap ( the item was b stock and without the original box and had just a very minor blemish on the underside ).
2	best price i could find anywhere .
2	the picture displayed on the website does not in anyway represent the plant we received .
0	on top of this their website advertised the flowers i ordered as coming with a free ( albeit small ) box of chocolates .
2	i declined and now wait to see if they will refund the money as promised .
2	my first visit to this site but i am a veteren of many others .
2	i ordered , from the lindy website , a lindy usb active extension hub ( i have already have one ) to allow me to move another computer box to a cupboard so that i can have a bit more peace & quiet .
0	the delivery time was outstanding , the prices are unbeatable , the packaging was even great !
2	there is cctv showing the driver went in office for few seconds then filled in some paperwork and left .
0	delivery was promt and in perfect_condition .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i highly_recommend this company , which i think chooses very carefully the products it sells and stands behind them with the best guarantee possible .
0	i totally recommend selectspecs to anyone_wanting bargain high_quality glasses .
2	again i complained to online_chat / emailed , they appologised & said they would resend the correct bouquet on mon 0th . my daughter waited in all day but again they did not turn_up , they arrived this morning after 0 wrong ' bunch ' & 0 days too late !!
2	so , overall a mixed experience , but the prices are competitive .
2	this is the second time i use collect_+ and i am please to say that this is a great service , this time i had a question about my parcel and used the chat line ; catherine helped_me not only with the enquire .
0	i love the commitment of this company that is always more satisfying your target audience .
2	thanks to peter_chandler for suggesting i add a review here .
2	ordered flowers for my wife for our wedding_anniversary , the ordering_process and contact from serenata was great , only problem was the delivery , using the provided tracking data i saw that the flowers had been loaded_onto the delivery van at gloucester depot 0000hrs in the morning yet it still took until 0000hrs in the evening for them to be actually delvered when they were literally thrown through the front_door with no contact from the delivery driver , now yes i know that looking at the small_print on the website serenata say in exceptional circumstances it can take up to 0000hrs but .
2	ordered the friday_afternoon , got them saturday_morning but the foliage was all poor and wilting , expected better .
2	even the recipients who received the parcel was astounded by the service .
2	so i havce been none the wiser .
2	it was well_worth the wait , the glasses are just what i wanted , i have been looking for some like this for at_least 0 years .
2	luckily they did send me a bag of " goodies " thanks they really saved my day .
0	and above all i paid less_than i would have done anywhere_else !
0	!
0	anyway nothing has been delivered and to my embarrassment she has sent me a gift to work .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending wild flower favours - thank_you !!
2	placed order for same day delivery only to revive email in the evening stating same day delivery wasn_'_t available in the area .
2	i found a good choice to suit at sunglasses and with their sale price nobody_else came near .
0	the customer_service is good , i asked them about payment_method .
0	superb service .
0	the p0g staff are excellent and i am 000_% sure its only about customer_satisfaction for these_guys as they impress me more every time i use them .
0	i was looking for this particular pair of ray_bans - every shop and website i tried just kept telling_me that the line had been_discontinued .
0	i discovered that whilst in transit , my parcel had been labeled with the wrong_address and found the website very one sided .
0	easy way to get your things sent , great customer_service from sam via the facebook_page have used parcel0go a few_times and would recommend them to anyone :)
2	parcel 0 go , just do it !
0	from discussing my requirements to the ongoing communication during the making of the ring , they were brilliant throughout .
2	so much for the full_refund if they mess up .
2	would definitely recommend .
0	i did get a bit irate going around in circles at first .
2	good value , delivery as promised , excellent !
2	these_guys spent about 0 hours on the phone to me , explaining all the options , pros and cons and didn_'_t pressure me in to spending a penny .
2	i have sent a lot of phones to mazuma and have had no_problems very fast and reliable service up to now i have received over a thousand_pounds and can recommend this company to anyone i will_continue to use mazuma in the future .
2	why choose anywhere_else ?
0	my parcel was picked_up by the courier on monday the 00th_november at 0pm .
2	ordered flowers at 00 . 00 pm and they were delivered by 00am the following_day by a local_florist .
2	live_chat with [_name ] sorted the problem immediately and without_fuss .
0	very efficient , good prices given and get paid quickly
2	product - my awesome eos_0d mk0 - was delivered well_packaged and in good time , plus delivery was free .
2	when is trading_standards going to intervene with this cowboy company ?
2	love the flower it realty put a smile on my faces
2	no item and a litany of excuses together with a refusal to refund as the item ( which i honestly believe does not exist ) is ' tailor made '
2	i could not believe_how quickly i received my order .
0	the price was also much less_than similar product on other_sites and i was kept up to date with every_stage of the production process .
2	i would like to thank_you from the bottom a dying father ’_s heart .
2	the dishwasher i purchased is excellent & exactly as advertised on the website , really , really pleased with it .
2	have had the flowers for 0 days now and they are already badly wilted ?
2	apparently they were really nice too .
2	the previous system is on a well know auction_site and will sell i am sure .
2	the items arrived next_day , as promised , and were very well_packed .
0	they still_haven ' t been delivered to this day , despite having sent three emails to iflorist support .
0	oh .
2	it only took about 0 days from when i requested the return pack , sent the mobile to them , to receive the money .
0	i have used parcel0go from the very first year they started trading and yes every company has its ups and downs with regards to products and services however they always seem to be helpful and efficient at what they have done .
0	recieved next_day .
0	great to send alot of parcels .
2	quick and easy , received the money for my phone the day after i posted it
0	couldnt ask for better service .
2	[_name ]_o / t : my email address is [_private data ]
0	i couldn ' t have asked for better and highly_recommend this company based on their high standards of customer care and empathy for my personal situation .
0	i . e .
0	these incidents have made me lose all faith in both royal_mail and mazuma_mobile .
0	the layout is easy to get around .
0	i would not recommend iflorist to anyone , not only did my flowers not arrive , but i have not yet received an explanation for where the flowers are ( or why iflorist are now ignoring my emails ).
0	saves lots of time !
0	a few minutes later , i recieved an_email from serenata offering me 00_%_off if i retrieved the contents of my basket and attempted to order again .
2	it seems high_street retailers stock very few choices these days - i hunted everywhere to find a simple pair of black stockings ( not holdups ) to wear with a special dress for my birthday with no luck .
0	package sent 00th_dec , according to tracking_number online the package was delivered on the 00th to the customer but this was a lie .
2	phone posted friday , email_confirming_receipt monday_morning followed_by another email_advising cheque in the post .
2	very quick delivery well_packed and second to none communication by email , simply the best company i have used for ages .
2	weds , sold my mobile on the site , ( which is very user_friendly ) thurs , they sent me the envelope which i posted back same day recorded delivery .
2	i did have a slight_problem when the camera arrived , the hardcopy owners manual was only in japanese but went on line completed a ticket had an answer next_day to say sorry and an english_version would be sent .
2	delivery was swift and easy , the item was just what i was looking for . i don_'_t currently own a reccy player so this was ideal , the sound is ok and the cd_player and radio are a welcome bonus , altogether for the price you can '_t complain so thanks alot .
0	great service which was quick and easy to use .
2	i said i wasn_'_t happy , and that three day old flowers would be half way through their life , and asked for a refund in line with their guarantee .
0	the flowers finally arrived at approximately 0pm on monday 00st_march , the day after mother ' s day .
0	great selection , and very quick delivery
2	i ’ ve asked a number of questions both before and after purchase and on each_occasion i ’ ve received an informative answer delivered in a relaxed and friendly style .
2	problem_solved double quick .
0	awesome website , always gives the best prices , selling all my gadgets !
0	they contacted the delivery company and made sure my order got to me the next_day , at a specific time and place i requested .
0	thanks :)
2	the staff at my local drop - off shop are polite and efficient .
0	ups say they will try and make an_emergency delivery by 0pm wednesday but they fail to do so .
2	bought these late on line hoping they would arrive the next_day .
0	customer_service is excellent - couldn ' t ask for more !
2	it cost half the price that parcelforce wanted to charge and a third of the price that ups wanted - not only that but they accept paypal so i didn_'_t even have to pay until after the parcel was delivered .
0	i just wanted to say the online_chat customer_service people are very friendly and helpful !
0	had a minor_issue with payment ( seems to happen quite_often with online ordering on other_websites too , probably due to my address format ) but was quickly resolved over the phone by an extremely_helpful and friendly assistant .
2	the service was the best xx
0	was looking for flowers for valentines_day and after checking some reviews i decided to book with iflorist instead of the other high_street florists
0	shipping to sweden ( where i live ) is generally fast .
0	i wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend digitalrev to anyone and will_definitely use them again .
0	!
2	unfortunately my daughter decided to go out the day the flowers were due to be delivered .
0	i used fonebank . com recently to swap an under - used old kindle for a cheque .
2	the refund was eventually processed but no bouquet was delivered .
0	i was quite dubious_about ordering from a site i hadn ' t ordered from before but they were fab .
2	you can connect your ebay account to collectplus , they even print out on the bottom of the label what your item is so there , s no way you are deceiving them with what you are sending .
2	numerous attempts to contact them either by phone , live_chat or emails were ignored .
0	i sent another phone in on the same day from the same location that has been processed within 00_hours .
0	thanks mazuma :)
0	sorted my problem straight_away .
2	i '_ve despatched all manner of things through interparcel , 0 metre long fishing rod tubes , a wheelbarrow , fullsize men '_s bicycle , car roof rack , expensive photographic gear , computer equipment etc_etc . and to destinations all over the globe .
2	she was very touched !
2	finally new very comfrotable size 0 merrell arrived and i can wear them all day and they are lovely .
2	and the recipient tells be the flowers are gorgeous .
0	there was no number to call and it took a few hours for a reply so i had no_idea what was going on .
0	i will_definitely be using the company again based wholely on their respect treatment of customers .
2	informed they were on there way , all the family
0	ordered saturday_night .
0	unfortunately the flowers that arrived are nothing at all like the picture your website displayed and had hardly any flowers .
0	i think that we have got a lot more for our money and the ' money back guarantee ' if you dont like it within the first 0 days is fantastic .
0	i highly_recommend hifi_headphones !
2	!
0	despite my husbands panic we found the ring was easily within our budget and managed to upgrade the diamonds !
2	you ' re in a queue at 00p_per_minute plus the vat .
0	then reordered a different one .
2	i have been emailed a £ 0 voucher to use on my next purchase as this is very unlikely to happen the voucher is useless .
0	he is quick and very helpful , solved my problem with no stress .
2	!
2	she was a great customer service operator .
2	you won_'_t be able to get the similar price from uk .
0	i would highly_recommend them !
2	interparcel certainly makes comparing courier services easier and uptil now , i '_ve found it '_s the best price website to do so .
0	i have solt my second phone with mazuma and had brilliant service , very fast and have had no_problems i would recommend to anyone .
0	made the order at 0 :_00pm sunday_night
0	the address was changed in an instant and sammie emailed me a new address label right away .
0	i was thanked by the recipient however and she called them beautiful .
0	arrived the next_day no_problems .
0	have now been told my glasses will be out for delivery this week , and i really dont believe them .
2	almost all the comments are positive , which gave me much more confidence to purchase a camera from a reputed site in hongkong .
2	only_downside was the manual was in chinese but english_version was on the cd . would recommend to anyone .
2	it was amazing .
2	excellent customer service on the phone , and the coat arrived as promised .
0	i was told by their customer_service before placing the order that digitalrev has a warehouse in the uk so that was why there was no duty , this was clearly nonsense but they must have foot the bill as it came through with no_problems .
2	if i want top quality , then buy more_expensive frames .
2	i was concerned that they seem to think that they provide excellent customer service ( the total opposite of what i encountered ).
2	!
0	now how can i do that when they don ' t come on time , don ' t deliver it to the right person or even have my name on it ?
2	their offer prices are quite competitive and their same day payment service is so convenient .
0	usually companies tend to wait ( other florists i used before ) until the flowers are actually delivered !
0	waiting for payment now .
2	definitely rapid response !!
2	very helpful firm and i recommend them completely to all .
0	i ' ve been using them for some time now , the only issue i ' ve had is with a lost parcel with yodel and the subsequent claim took some time , most_likely because p0g have to work with the couriers to sort it out .
2	they couldn_'_t have been any faster if they ' d tried .
2	0 perfect pick_ups and 0 perfect collections .
2	pity some of our larger companies could_learn a lot , you could close down their complaints_procedure .
2	ashley_: it would only be requested geoff
0	he gave me a fantastic price on gia triple excellent cut earrings .
2	i ordered from iflorist as i wanted a plant rather_than a bunch of flowers for my dad in his seventies who had just had an operation .
2	staf were very professional and andrea was faultless with the help she gave me
2	!
2	i would recommend these to anyone !
2	they arrived quicker_than_anticipated and i am very pleased with my new designer prescription_sunglasses .
2	how good is that ?
0	as a company should work .
0	nothing more to add : )
0	;)

0	), but doesn ' t matter as digitalrev provide a 0 year_warranty regardless ( although i ' ve not had a chance to test this aspect thankfully ).
0	great customer_service .
2	hi
2	flowers were not delivered for the date i chose ,
0	sent request for an mazuma bag on tuesday and received the envelope 0 the phone on thursday .
0	i have not found this with parcels0go ' live_chat '.
0	i am still trying to ring them , in the hope that somehow , this joke of a company can rectify the situation , but i am having no luck .
0	there has been absolutely no contact between iflorist and myself apart_from the ' live_chat ' i have initiated , had i not done this , then who_knows when a bunch of dead flowers may have ended_up arriving at the recipients door .
0	!
2	it only took 0 days from start to finish .

0	thank_you !
2	phoned up to check whether correct colour was in stock - one left that was put on reserve for me .
0	i ' d never use any other mobile phone buying site !
2	their website and their livechat is no use . you will not get any joy if you have a problem .
0	re : sammie_taylor
2	i replied to the mails , indicating the same address as i had done at the time of the order .
2	website is useless with ringback etc not available .
0	i found mazuma ' s website very easy to understand , and the prices given for my old_mobiles very reasonable .
2	!
0	the prices are great , and saves the hassle of going into_town and there ' s more choice too .

0	a further email arrived from both emelie and stephanie to say they weren ' t happy with something on the ring and asked for a further day , which was fine .
2	after some reservations from various other website reviews , not that there were many negative_reviews .
2	am recommending to everyone :-)
2	truly excellent .
2	can '_t ask for anything better_than that .
2	ho hum , never mind i thought , as i simply then placed lindy into the ' useless ' technical_department category .
2	!
2	look out amazon and the rest , this could well be the future .
0	i have nothing but praise for collectmyparcel . com but there was a problem with dhl .
2	emma was excellent in helping with my query for my parcel .
0	over the years i ' ve worried that i ' ve left the iron or straighteners on so this is easy to check and turn off if necessary .
2	but katie helped_me with can do attitude and was great .

0	now , the only reason i ' m writing another review , is because there ' s a chance to win $_000 .
2	i found this company through google i had not heard of them before but was so glad i recycled my 0 phones through them they paid the best price for my phones by far beating other_companies by as much as £_00 on their best prices i would recommend this company to all
0	how come there are no pictures of the dresses every time i go on the website all l get is a bold question mark instead of the pictures how on earth am l meant to select and buy the lovely dresses :-(
2	catherine is one of the most helpful people i have ever_encountered , her friendly and professional approach is top_rated .

0	the deliver was quick , product as_described .
0	sent them my old sony x0 , tracked all the way to them online , logged_into mazuma and could see that they had processed the cheque , cheque came first thing the next morning !!!!
2	the recipient was extremely pleased .
2	!
0	i started my order on a saturday_night and got immediate_response thanking me for my placed order .
0	if this is the case then they should not be using quantifiable terms when explaining the details of their bouquet .
2	ordered flowers on 00 / 00 for delivery 00 / 00 / 00 , they were not delivered .
0	the only negative i can think of is they are not linked to ebay which would make it perfect !
2	i have spent the best part of 0 hours today trying to sort this out , i have received 0 ring back from kerry , apart_from that i have been passed from_pillar to post and had every excuse in the book as to why it hasn_'_t been collected !
0	fast delivery , brilliant pricing .
0	a few_months_ago my fiance and i decided to have my 0ct white gold engagement_ring re - made in platinum .
0	ps_: i ' m not even the type to write_reviews so for me to do this show just how good they are .
2	the goods were delivered quickly .
0	ordered the camera 0am sunday morning and it arrived wednesday at midday !
2	if this is " grey " service and quality then i have a new favorite color .
0	suffice to say the only option i have now is to contact trading_standards / cab / bank to see what exactly i can do in this situation .
0	i have to use boxes to avoid breakages .
2	?
0	ordered flowers for my girlfriend 0 days before valentines_day - mainly to avoid last_minute influx and make_sure they arrive on time .
0	i chose this company because of previous good reviews but what a shocker .
0	even if package not shipped via them .
2	you gave us a quote , we sent the phones and the money was straight into my account - no waiting !!
0	will_definately use again :)
0	ok , so i live in bristol but didn ' t need my goods in a hurry , so opted for the standard 0 working day delivery option .
2	had great assistance on the live_chat many_thanks to emily .
0	they claim that they haven ' t even_though you have confirmation stating the obvious .
0	the first time i paid for before 0pm delivery the next_day and though the flowers did arrive before 0pm , at 0pm when i still not been told the flowers had been delivered i rang yodel ( the courier ) who informed me that the flowers had never actually been marked as a ' before 0pm delivery .'
2	easy to use web_site with video demontrations to show how to do things .
2	i used the im service which was slow and impersonal .
2	the range of flowers to choose from was good , and they arrived promptly , after a text to me to say they were on their way , followed_by a text to say they had been delivered .
0	all i can say is that the service from this company is unbelievable .
2	when i found tightsplease it was like walking into an aladdin '_s cave !
0	she didn ' t want me to have the added stress of waiting for a response from dhl so she said that collectmyparcel would refund the costs today and they would then take the risk of getting the money back through dhl .
2	placed an order ( good price ) but next_day noticed it cheaper on amazon by £ 0 . 00 .
0	never used mazuma before but had no need for my old phone , so decided to go for it .
0	i am extremely happy with my ring and wouldn ' t hesitate to recommend diamond_geezer to anyone . fab job !
0	good service .
2	the goods arrived perfectly wrapped .
0	i had a couple of phones lying_around but couldn ' t be bothered to sort them out .
2	!- who would want to haul heavy , cumbersome parcels to their local or not so local post_office , probably incurring fuel cost as well , when they could await collection in the comfort of their own homes , knowing their item ( s ) were covered by insurance and all for a hugely better price ?
0	it took them 0 weeks to get back to me , then some guy in india sends a bogus delivery attempt record that is not even for the same week as when i ordered the flowers .
0	was kept_informed at every_stage of the delivery , which arrived a lot sooner_than i was expecting which was excellent .
2	thank_you very much .
0	if i could give more_than 0_stars then i would .
2	have used digital_rev a few_times now and the service is 0nd to non , prices are very competitive .
0	they were very leafy rather_than floral .
2	pete
0	i thought perhaps i ' d forgotten my password - i tried to recover my password but it then said my account had been blocked .
0	guess_what ???
0	i opted for a myhermes delivery ( again won ' t do that again either ) but being as i didn ' t ask for signature on delivery it was deemed acceptable to put the item in the bin !
0	so long_story short do not risk using them .
0	i tried to make them understand i quoted for 00kg and get prices in the website for 00 kg and booked for 00kg !!!
2	the bouquet delivered contained mostly lillies , bearing no resemblance to the flowers ordered .
0	not to mention that my father is on a wheelchair and at home 00 / 0 to be able to pick_up that order so any excuse of that kind is out of the question .
0	i was unsure at first , but the whole_process was very simple and payment was made immediately .
2	she thought the flowers and cake were beautiful .
2	i bought these flowers for my auntie today , they arrived the next_day and she was so please with them they were lovely and fresh , so if you ever need flowers in a hurry then this is the place to get them , and the price was very good to .
0	ordered the cm00pro to use with my university year project .
2	i wonder what the next lie will be ?
2	although all bookings are done on the internet i still feel as if i am dealing face to face with a person .
0	so i asked him if instead of the voucher i could get an additional item worth the voucher value in my order .
0	my mother birthday arrangement arrived on the 0th_march as request . wait for it . all the roses in the arrangement where dead , not just a bit wilted , but brown petals on each and every one !!
0	thanks
0	that ' s what makes customer like me coming_back to your services .
0	one thing which i found bad .
0	of a few people i know who have used transglobal express , i have heard only good things about the company - on this basis , i would most definitely_recommend the brand to others .
0	sent phone off and received email next_day to infom me that the money would be in my account by lunch time !
2	the free re - sizing is a real boon and as a result of my sizing ' mishap ' the man at diamond_geezer is going to send out a wide sizer for the wide rings .
2	fair price , easy to navigate web_site , clear understandable and straightforward system and fast payment into my bank_account
2	many_thanks

2	thank_you !
2	the courier , dpd , are the best courier company that i know of currently since they give a 0 hour delivery slot which always seems to work ( for me anyway ).
0	although i can see they are a reputable company , the idea of having a problem and having to sort it out worried me .
0	the information pack was quickly delivered and once i ' d returned my phone , the payment was made straight into my bank_account on the same day that it was received !!
2	delivered with no_problems or fuss .
2	good service will use again
2	as for price , what a saving !

0	we made payment 0 weeks_ago .
0	the communication was excellent from them with several emails updating me on the order and , as i opted for a bacs transfer , the payment was very , very fast .
0	they said it was scratched heavily so wasnt worth £_00 , absolute_rip_off_merchants . all in all , if your selling a mobile phone , use mazuma , and dont forget to use quidco for an extra 00p cashback !
0	i saw mazuma advertised all over the place but didn ' t trust it and as i had heard mixed_reviews never bothered .
0	great
2	in another 00 yeras or so i '_ll need some more !

2	today i have received the ring .
0	we waited in all day for them and despite receiving a dispatched email along with a delivery confirm email from serenataflowers , nothing showed up .

2	sarah_hayes helped_me by booking my parcel online .
2	i come home early and call them at 00 : 00 but office closed despite saying 00 : 00 closure onsite .
0	to add_insult to injury , the rude girl told me i would have to collect the parcel mysel from bolton as they will not send it back to me via courier !
0	i was a bit_sceptical but could not believe the level of service we recieved !
0	i ordered something from ebay and they shipped with collectplus .
2	i am_delighted my parcels have been delivered so promptly in just 0 days and the quote was the most competitive of many i looked at .
0	their prices are very keen and their products first rate .
0	to save you from ultimately killing one of the ups workers i advise you to never use them .
0	the service is excellent and i had the payment within my account within a week .
0	flowers were beautiful and made my girlfriend really happy ( we are picky and really i was worrying that it doesn ' t look good but hopefully it was great !)
0	overall we were really pleased with our purchase and won ' t hesitate to use the website again !
0	thanks mazuma
0	the packaging of the one we got was sturdy and attractive .
0	i had got insurance out on all the parcels which was pointless as they seem to find a way to say they weren ' t covered , only paying a small amount back in a ' good will gesture '.
2	ordered pm and was delivered next_day .
2	i will write to md but probably won_'_t get a reply .
2	thanks
2	?
2	but found this service and sold them both for a great price have told all my mates about mazuma .
2	on thursday , the online system said it would be delivered thursday .
0	i understand that there might be things out of their controls however they should have in place a tracking_system and be able to advise customer what is going on . at_least have some customer_service you could actually contact .
0	0 - claimed for damage , told i can ' t claim because i ' ve send a ' restricted item ' ( computer monitor ).
2	bouquet was delivered at right time and mum just loved them ( so did all the staff ).

0	thought it was too good to be true so i put it on the credit_card to be safe haha .
2	i have been served well and quickly by rob of this company .
0	next - day delivery was ideal for my situation as i was leaving england for a holiday to dubai just 0 days after i ordered them .
0	made my day !
0	i have contacted many courier companies like tnt and post nl , but they have all said that they could not help me .

0	payment was made immediately upon_receipt , using faster_payments so it hit my account same day !
0	rubbish that their is nobody to call .
2	communication_throughout the problem has_been excellent and i don ` t even have to return the faulty ones .
2	appalling service , no way of contacting the company when it goes_wrong .
2	the process was effortless from beginning to end .
0	as an it professional , it ' s great to have a one - stop - shop for cables and connectivity , and it ' s great to be able to order for next - day delivery and know the product is going to a ) turn_up and b ) be just right for the job .
2	would still like to know where flowers are sourced .
0	after a few attempts they said they would redeliver at a time of my choice obviously i said asap .
0	however , there was zero level of artistry used when arranging my mum ' s flowers .
0	i cancelled my order and promptly received a refund .
2	it wasn_'_t .
0	parcel0go charges you if you want to cover your item over £_00 .
2	mrs packer

0	thay wash well the designs are awesome and well worth the money .
2	i spoke to sammie_taylor this morning at parcel0go as i had made a mistake on the delivery address .
0	within 0 - 0 days of the sending the phones away mazuma confirmed they ' d made a cash transfer to my bank .
0	i have never used the site till i bought these flowers , i would recommend the company to anyone that i know .
2	the money back guarantee stated on their site is rubbish , a lie and crap .
0	i would always use serenta for my flowers now .
0	i got fed_up of fedex and tnt - p0d was a great relief ( even_though they broker tnt / fedex services ).
2	very well_done !
0	they didnt respond .
0	i like that the selection of designers aren ' t your staple brands .

2	i can '_t believe_how quickly you delivered my camera excellent service .
0	we would like to recommend this contractor , as my fault you have not received item ordered , he gave no valid postal_address .
2	chatted to sarah_h who was very helpful and polite .
0	by looking at the tracking updates : which hermes delivery person did that delivery on friday the 00th of november , obviously has it and didn ' t return with a signature and hasn ' t tried ever since or the parcel has mysteriously vanished in the depot .
0	fantastic service !
0	as the whole point of ordering from them was for my partner to receive the flowers on valentines_day itself , i emailed back in the morning explaining that the flowers had still not arrived and requested a refund .
0	hats of to digital_rev !
0	excellent flowers , so pretty and well arranged .
0	easy to place orders , no nonsense and secure_payments .
0	im going to keep this review sort and simple and not concentrate too much on the product itself ( canon powershot g00 ), as anyone who is going to purchase this camera would have already done there research and know what this camera is all about , & btw the camera is lovely best image quality and control i have ever_seen on a compact , it is definitely an_alternative to a dslr without the bulk .
2	it '_s already booked .
0	when i placed my order i was really excited because i had heard_nothing but good things about the brushes , the processing and shipping was phenomenal !
0	the 00hr courier did not collect the parcel - so i contacted catherine and she rebooked a different courier to collect from us the same day and deliver next_day !

0	ordered flowers for same day delivery on monday 00th_july - it is now end of the day wednesday and they still have not been delivered despite us receiving a confirmation that they had been delivered .
0	text from the old man , " you will be disappointed with the flowers , they are not very fresh at all "
0	it made me look like i went to some cheap dodgy company i found on the internet .
2	not possible , as this was for a friend on her_birthday and , receiving flowers from various others , she didn_'_t realise until she opened them , that a duplicate order had been sent .
2	pembrokeshire , gb
0	i sadly decided you to use their services via transglobal london to send two boxes of all my personal items ( all of things very close to my heart ) to india on 0th_february_0000 .

2	a company that really puts the customer first .
0	john c
2	it holds plenty of water ( 0 . 0 litres ); the lid has a button opener that doesn_'_t burn your fingers ; the handle is exactly right for balance when lifting a full load of water and the blue / violet light that emanates from the glass bowl while the kettle is in action is a work of art in itself .
0	now its mothers_day and i have no flowers to present my mother , iflorist i don ' t understand how you can think this is acceptable as its obviously happened to more people than myself looking at the reviews .
2	i needed to change the shoes i had ordered for a different size .

2	this sale was all done within a week !

2	i tried to send flowers to the uk with all of the major florists and their websites are useless ,
0	and i ' d be tempted to use them again in the future without spreading word of my experience .
2	the website is easy to use and gives lots of information about the choice of stone available .
2	i would be much more satisfied if you could also accept the chargers with the mobile .
0	bought a camera from here at a much cheaper price than anywhere on the internet .

0	it would be great if you could give a description on how this should fit . ie .
0	great shirt , had to return it due to it being too big , no_qualms and they sent me a smaller_size - boyfriend obviously needs to go to the gym more ha_ha !

2	would i recommend this coat and company yes i defiantly would , i had made a mistake on ordering and they rectified it for me straight_away .
0	i was a little unsure on the best way of getting my package to india or even how the address worked !
0	then just go to postoffice and get a proof of posting .

0	thank_you !

2	fantastic service from serenata as always , up dated right the way through from order or despatch to delivery and good value for money in my opinion .
2	after using parcel0go at first i was unsure , it looked to be to good to be true , prices were cheaper_than i was paying at the post_office and the firm collect from your door , saving the hassle of a drive across town to catch a post_office open .
2	i have used mazuma in the past and the service is truly wonderful
2	they turned_up on 00st around midday ( the monday ) which kind of ruined the nice mothers_day surprise from the kids .

2	i had no need to worry with serenataflowers . com though .
2	what makes this company really stand out is their customer service .
0	just a middle_man company not a proper company at all .
0	det_har virkelig været en fest at være kunde hos dhl og for fremtiden vil jeg selv samt anbefale andre at undgå dhl da deres chaufføre åbenbart er fulde af løgn .
2	the item was a return and was damaged when delivered , therefore the receiptient is refusing to refund the money
2	as for the flowers , the recipient told me they were really lovely .
2	!
2	there was a problem with our system when it arrived , it appeared to have been damaged in transit .

2	a company dealing in floral tributes should be sensitive to fact that flowers have their own significance and messsage for individuals and should take into account the personal tastes of their customers and recipients .

2	it '_s now 00st october !!!
0	thanks
2	this is after i have had to go out of my way to deliver them to one of their drop_off points .
0	i bit the bullet and applied for an envelope .
2	it showed that they had delivered it to not only the wrong_address but the wrong country !,
2	well_done serenata .
2	would highly_recommend . good clear website , goods exactly as_described , plus a lovely free gift to go with coat .
2	usually very competetive with prices and have a brilliant range of manufacturers and items available .
0	only point i would like to make and this is more for hifiheadphones knowledge is that maybe you could add a way letting your customers know when an item is back in stock .
2	i wanted the new nikon 00 - 000 lens that came out in august_0000 .
0	would definitely_recommend !
2	they sent a postage paid delivery bag , which i recieved of friday .
2	wendy_hall : [_name ] - i have just sent a screen_shot to you now
2	flowers were ' successfully delivered ' yesterday - they weren_'_t they were just left on the doorstep and were only found several hours_later .
2	i have complained to the firm who sent out my item that i won_'_t be using them or recommending them for as long as they continue to use dpd .
2	from experience , i know that biggest is not always best .
0	and excellent price .
0	this was a complete_joke and i was looking_forward to this being a good experience and convincing all my friends who spend the same amount of money with mroe reputable florists , to switch to iflorist - this will obviously not be happening now .
0	both lines simply state that they cannot take anymore orders for valentines_day , despite it being passed valentines_day !
2	the people who delivered the flowers claimed that i had ordered the flowers for the date on which they were delivered , the so called basket does not look anything like the photo on the website .
0	the item is as good as_described too !
0	had two lots sent one to my mum and they were they worse ones as_described above where as the second lot which was over 000_miles_away the heads of the carnation were burnt .
0	0 * for parcel 0 go customer_service
0	!
0	they were able to sort out my enquiry very quickly .
0	( also , ashley - you ' re the best !)
0	the price was far better_than anything_else i could find by over £_000 .

0	( hvis de_havde været der kunne de jo bare lægge en sedl i postkassen )
0	hope fully i will be with them as long as i get best service from them also thr majority for best product and prices and long_lasting guaranty .
0	i have to imagine that the fragile handle with care information on the box was not understood by them .
2	my son is delighted with the quality , and listens to his classical music on his daily train commute .
2	i have already told my customers to use your service as the customer service is the best i have come_across in over 00 years of using courier services both in my job and now as a self_employed business .
0	£_00 cheaper_than other website !
0	within about 0 minutes , she informed me of the closest drop_off point and sent me a new label to use .
0	i went through all that hassle just so i can receive it in my hands and not wait extra days or have to travel to pick it up somewhere .
0	what more do you need when you ' re panicking about a last_minute present ?
0	however , this was not a problem , we ordered our outfits and they were shipped the next_day and arrived in plenty of time .
2	suitably re - assured , i placed an order worth £_00 with one of their agents .
2	they also send you an_email once your parcel has reached it '_s destination , which is an excellent help and gives peace of mind .
2	bought one from wimborne market , leaked when i got it home , was unable to return to the market for 0 weeks and was called a liar when i asked for a replacement , definitely cheaper_than other_places but you get what you pay for shoddy product and poor aftersales
0	i was really pleased to have it arrive ( sign - for , which gives me peace - of - mind ) within one week , complete and all in working order .
0	good price , quick sending of the bag and quick payment .
2	i have checked back several_times each day , but the ' online service ' is always off line .
2	i myself was unable to find and print off the returns form on my log - in account page solely because i thought the green - return icon button on that page would divert me back to the home page if i clicked on it , not so - this is where you will find the printable returns forms . i found this out after having had to pay the cost of having to return my books back to the company for a replacement size .
0	phenomenal communication .
0	when i first saw the advert on the tv i thought , they will change the price they quote on the internet , but they don ' t .
2	i ordered the day before and my mum was delighted with the flowers that were delivered without drama and on time .
0	great prices and great offers .
2	i ' m very impressed and just wish i had more old_phones to sell !
0	that did annoy me somewhat especially as i ' d allowed myself to be upsold based on having the discount .
2	any service is good until you have a problem , when they are tested . some don_'_t care , this company was on the ball , immediately , kept me informed and earned my trust and therefore my business .
2	bottle was delivered within the specified timescale and was well_protected with plenty of padding in the box to ensure that it arrived in perfect_condition .
0	their service is quite superb .
2	i was very impressed with the website and ease of ordering the flowers , together with the regular emails and texts informing_me of progress with my order , even down to when it was on its way and had been delivered .
2	order placed wednesday , delivered lunchtime thursday using standard [ royal_mail first_class recorded ] delivery .
0	--- anyone who has this problem , keep pestering .
2	they have provided excellent service .
2	vielen dank
2	i was connected to catherine coreless who took me through everything through the whole_process .
0	the service is terrible and there is no customer support .

0	( a day early )
0	i ended_up signing_up for an account as i will_definitely use this service for my business .
2	i love the juicer and am looking_forward to experimenting with a variety of fruit and veg .

2	i bought some technics hinges on ebay and they arrived next_day - free_postage too !!
0	this is my first dslr and i ' ve enjoyed it , digitalrevs youtube vids are definitely handy in picking the best camera and tips on getting started once you have it .
0	cheers p0g .
0	my experiences have always been positive .
2	telephoned the company , but they were as much help as their package handling skills .
2	by sunday only one lily was alive .
0	the prices are phenomenal and the speed in which they dispatch items is fab !
0	i didn ' t know rm posted on a sunday !
0	brilliant service .
0	in all my years of working in customer_service i have never come accross an agent like yourself .
0	even_though the products were sent back for being poor quality and not fit for purpose or the silly high price and not fitting the description properly .
2	shopped everywhere - saved more than 000_pounds with digital_rev - well_protected with bubble_wrap - a very security concious company
0	totaly 000000000 / 00 .

2	would defiantly recommend this service .
0	i received a reply from this email , which seemed to make absolutely no sense when compared to the rest of the emails i received from them , finally offering me a refund .
0	they never delivered on time and the parcel has still not been returned to very after 0weeks .
2	the quality was excellent and fulfilled what i head read on the reviews on their site and others .
0	she herself described them as ' past their best ' and ' looked as though they had been boxed for quite a while before sending '.
0	how unprofessional

0	seriously think no more when it comes to photography equipment and not only .
0	the rep i spoke to , richard , couldn ' t have been any more helpful .

0	the flowers are awful - they ' re on their death bed and the chocolates all contain nuts so no good for me at all !
0	the speed of delivery was amazing , just 0 days from_hong_kong to uk .

0	resolved quickly and fairly , which saves me from rating a 0 star .

2	best to avoid .
0	i think the digitalrev website is very well_designed , easy to use and appealing to the eye and i basically have nothing negative to say about them !
2	were let_down on the big romantic day of the year .
2	my suggestion : if you ; re not wanting to sit home waiting for _whoever_ make a friend at a local shop with long hours , pay him / her a pound to have your parcel sit and wait for the delivery courier - and forget about it .
0	to my surprise and delight , kathy , the customer_services associate got in touch with me and reassured me that i will not have to face any more grief .
2	cheers

2	andy
2	not so with interparcel .
0	the simple guides to the headphones were really helpful to a novice like me and made me pay the couple of quid extra to use this company rather_than other larger ones , in short , i got quick registration and payment , emails to let me know when the order was received and dispatched , a punctual delivery and well_packaged items .

0	not only did they fail to delivery flowers on valentines_day as promised , the customer_service was non_existent .
0	i tried tnt and fedex for an import - but they assume you ' re trying to send a package – and not a package you want to import ( even if you try their import options ).
2	this company knows its products inside out .
0	when i contacted the customer_service they required me to send a picture of the day i received the bouquet , stating that they couldn ' t take into_consideration any complaint after 00h from the delivery .
2	very quick and very reliable .

2	daniel was a great help couldn_'_t have done it without him !

0	i emailed them but there was no response at all !
2	the only ones that enable me to have a different size ear bud in each ear and stay in .
2	this is something which they did not carry out ( with reasonable care and skill ), and which , is in breach of the contract taken out with them , and paid for in good faith , to deliver the items to the location intact .
0	really happy with this website .
2	they bought my old phone for a good price , even_though it was an older_model smartphone which many of the other_sites wouldn_'_t even make an offer for !

2	they are so quick to pay , the money was in my account the day after i posted the phone to them , wow .
2	the flowers delivered to her were battered and she said that they must have been frozen overnight as they were dead and wilting - she thought that i should ask for my money back and apologised again .
2	the website offers " same day " or " next_day " courier delivery .
0	it was well_packaged with lots of bubble_wrap .
2	what can i say , i knew the value of my phone and envirofone gave me exactly_what i was looking for .

2	i had requested the house plant to be delivered on 00 / 00 .

2	online_chat with sammie_taylor solved my problem without_any question !
2	from ordering the flowers to delivery i had regular funny updates to keep me informed of progress .
2	brilliant .
2	what can we do ?
2	they promised to refund , which they did eventually but it took about 0 weeks .
2	would be nice to have more people in customer service like jenny .
2	fast , safe , trustworthy , efficient , reccomendable
2	would definitely_use again .
0	it was a simple order and tekshop000 didnt cock it up .
2	so invested in a dasan keypad and retell 000 which has made my life so much_easier .
2	despite some damage to the case of the otherwise perfectly working order blackberry , my son was very pleased with the price he got .
2	no stress , all good
2	couldn_'_t be_happier with my purchase !
2	thanks
2	ordered a nikon 00mm_f0 . 0g lens and a manfrotto unica iii shoulder bags and have to say i ' m delighted with the purchase .
0	i can ' t believe their audacity , worst customer_service ive ever recieved .
0	[ posted using a friend ' s facebook account ]
0	usually , you see an amazing picture , click it , and then find that large is an extra £_00 . 00 - which usually means that the amazing picture you ' ve seen is small - and your flowers are going to look poor .
2	i asked to speak to the owner if the company " no can do " only by email .
2	with full tracking throughout its journey , risk and anxiety were minimised .
0	great for the ' one camera one lens ' philosophy , if you had to choose just one lens for this cam it would be this .
2	very prompt service combined with excellent products , i can only highly_recommend them .
0	would recommend others to use mazuma
0	even if i get a refund there is no way to replace the cpk ' s lost as they were over 00 years old .
0	i will definatly be using them again .
2	secondly , i ' d rather chew nails than entrust my parcels to yodel or dpd , or parcelfarce ( who makes cash by faking the dlievery attempts and charges you for redelivery ).
2	once again just excellent
0	do not buy totally untrustworthy i bought some monday and they said there is no contact number i send them the contact number and no reply to any message i have sent there is also no contact number this is a scandal and a ripoff
0	i message them straight_away to return my package and was told i will get my package the next_day and that it was at their office .
0	the last one being ." as soon as a response has been received we will be updating you accordingly ."
0	cheque arrived within a week !

0	the item left at 0pm and arrived at 00am the next_day in the netherlands !
2	i lost my sack recently and the macinasac people sent me a replacement so quickly - can '_t ask for better service than that !

0	many_thanks [_name ]

0	shocking
2	am still_waiting for replacements to be sent , i asked why they couldn_'_t be sent that day
2	i needed some birthday flowers for a friend who_lives 000_miles_away .

2	i would need an " ontime " assurance before i place my next order with iflorist .
2	i just dropped the parcel off at my local shop , got the receipt and that was it .
0	i recommend any company to use this company as there is not a single bad_word i can say about them or natalie .
0	disgraceful
0	i ' m not happy at all and really feel to go down to their stores and wreck the place !
2	read the above
0	booked several packages on different days , first thing they never collected , so close to 0 pm i got in touch only to be told from a script , collections can go up to 0 :_00pm clearly not because no one arrived , then had to rebook , and lo and behold no one came and collected , complained and was told , " its not a guaranteed service " but they still took my money for next_day delivery .
2	rather_than coming_back with the usual sales rant i received a mail back within an_hour which actually advised me to make_sure the system i was thinking_about wasn ’ t too big for my room !
0	also i had to claim on a damaged parcel which parcel0go accepted with no hassle just a few pictures and they are giving me more_than i requested talk about good will .
2	alison
0	thank_you so much for the service .
0	adam

2	selectspecs were prompt in answering a q i had regarding thickness of lenses and once order is placed their website provides details of where in the process your orders is progressing .
0	daniel and catherine were very helpful .
2	both the service and product cannot be_faulted .
2	them over the next 0 days ups updated their online tracking to say they tried 0 times and returned the parcel .

0	i registered my mobile online , 0 days_later i received my bag to send my phone off .
0	i like the idea that i pay it online and take to the shop .
2	they rely_on the national and international delivery companies to do this .
2	it is in the name of my partner simon ward
0	i asked the question and she said yes :) i made a mistake on the ring size however diamond_heaven managed to alter this for me so i wasn ' t left with a problem .
0	my phone even had a tiny little crack in it , and they still gave me the full_amount .

0	i created a shipment with interparcel on the 00th_march_0000 .
0	so , now everything ' s sorted , right address , and no extra_charges !
0	in addition the available contact number is an 0000 number which would be costly to call , and i am reluctant to do so given that iflorist have already had over £_00 from me for flowers they did not deliver and their customer_service to date has been appalling , despite their claim to provide the " highest_level of service " ( frankly , at this point i ' d settle for any customer_service .)
0	very quick to take the money out your bank !!
0	i felt that it was serenataflowers responsibility to resolve the issue , however , as they were refusing to listen to and deal with my complaint so i decided to find out for myself what really happened .
2	peace of mind as i could track my parcel .

2	not too difficult in principle .
2	i have complained about the lack of balloon and have been told i will have a refund for this .

2	well monday_morning came along without a delivery .
0	they like so many other_companies advertise same day delivery but having ordered this morning they ' ve only now informed me that they actually can ' t deliver them ( to the centre of bristol , not exactly a difficult delivery ) and i ' m unable to order elsewhere as its too_late .
2	they are , however , just as dishonest , claiming to have e_- mailed me , ( so why is there nothing in my in - box , or spam folder ), and to have telephoned me , ( but my phone has an answering service , and their number does not appear in missed calls ).
2	parcels0go is simply resetting the boundaries of delivery service .
2	i emailed again and asked for my money back if the order was not being_processed .
0	very highly_recommended , music matter is my go to shop :)
2	having used other phone recycling sites before and having to wait for over a week for payment i thought i ' d try mazuma .
0	i wouldn ' t get a white gold band again , maybe would go towards a platinum band .
2	entirely underwhelmed and will never use again !
0	the prices are very reasonable too .
0	having had problems with interflora before , i was hesitant to try another online florist , but decided to give eflorist a go .
0	integrates with ebay nicely , so saves so much time .
0	of course at the end of the day , the site ' s primary objective is to make money , even if it means deviously manipulating customers and being purpousfully discreet and incoherent about certain things *_cough * shippingtimes *_cough *
2	they even claimed to have phoned me earlier today , but i have been at home all day .
2	i ordered a pair of audiofly af00 earphones from hifi_headphones .
2	i '_ve used interparcel quite a few_times now and i '_ve found their service faultless .
2	fantastic service , absolutley brilliant glasses mine would of cost at_least £_000 elswhere , got these at a fraction of the cost , my daughter was so impressed she has bought a pair of glasses from here , even_though she has just bought some 0 weeks_ago from a high_street optician and says the ones from selectspecs are far better , please do not be put off by this being online the service provided is second to none
0	flowers received where not only of poor quality most of them were dried out to the point of dying .
0	very lovely customer_service , fast delivery and a fabulous end product !
2	he was very efficient and sorted everything straight_away .
0	amazing !
2	after 0 days the tracking showed it was still on the delivery van .
2	best mobile recycling brand in all_aspects , price , reliability , efficient .
0	spoke to martin and he was more_than helpful and knowledgable .
2	would definitely recommend to anyone .
2	i logged_onto live_chat and was connected to [_name ].
0	now bear in mind that we are an office , we contacted them at 0pm and hadn ' t been told this and i have a cctv camera on the front_door i knew this was a blatant lie .
2	throughout the transaction up to the point of delivery hifiheadphones ' communications were second to none , very reassuring when internet_shopping .
0	ordering from digitalrev is painfree and simple , products arrive from_hong_kong in 0 - 0 days , without hassle , and there ' s no horrible uk pricing as its nearly direct from the manufactures , i love using digitalrev and they always keep my custom .
0	i emailed in case my " live_chat " message had not got through and after two days there was no sign of anything being done about it .
0	after having trouble with my account and printing i contacted the live_chat with 0 representatives the first was sarah she was very helpful , though unfortunately we were unable to fix the problem , however she did sent me everything i didn ' t receive via_email which was excellent .
0	i assumed this meant if there was any_problems for the delivery they would contact the customer .
0	the moment for delivery and for my surprise has now passed , and i can ' t understand how you can promise something you can ' t deliver , and having read reviews i am not the only one .
2	( after seven weeks !)
0	will look_forward to dealing_with them again .
2	eventually i did tell him the bouquet was poor and sent him a photo of the dying flowers , warning him not to use the site again .
0	alexandra and daniel are a credit to p0g !
0	totally ruined the surprise and our day .
2	i have used parcels to go for a few_years now and always found them helpful i , ve just came off a chat session with a operator named william and the service was 0st_class !
2	well_done from a very satisfied customer .
0	they even gave my engagement_ring a clean and polish whilst fitting the wedding_ring to it .
2	my new jacket arrived within a couple of days of ordering , and was exactly as_described .
2	!
2	i recently started using hermes parcel0go and find it very user_friendly and very good prices , if you don_'_t want to stay in for your parcel to be collected , you can take it to a number of collection points local to your home .
0	i was told that i should have sent it by recorded_delivery , but why should i ?
0	no flowers .
0	messaged again late last_night - and still nothing .
2	lens arrived in perfect shape , very well_packed as always .
0	parcel0go . com is such an easy site to use , and the fact that you can chat with staff_members immediately for help is tremendous .
2	i have been very happy with the service .
0	to say i am angry is an_understatement !
2	as there was no ' confirm purchase ' button or similar , i assumed that this was indeed the case , and i redid the order only to find email_confirmation for two orders in my email inbox with 0 different order numbers .
0	i have bought flowers from them previously , but the just screwed me up on the most_important occasion .
0	messaged the seller of the item i want collecting from , he told me his wife wasted a whole day waiting for the courier .
2	sent the phone away and money in my account same day .
0	the shipment was booked with fedex and all details were provided .
0	money not received yet . but fingers_crossed this has been resolved .
0	excellent .
2	no refund until today .
2	very , very pleased , thank_you pmc .
0	they are really worth using !
0	mazuma paid a great price for my nokia e00 and delivered great customer_service throughout .
2	i paid the £_00 . 00 which was also for a ' same day delivery ' and awaited for a phone_call from my delighted mother in law .
2	as for the 0d mark 0 - what an amazing camera .
0	stacey , oxfordshire
0	very fast and efficient service .
2	bravo .
0	superb .
0	sound familiar !
2	it had been packed very well to avoid damage and the instructions on how to set it up were quite clear .
0	this is great news however it isn ' t ideal because of getting quotes for repairs or having to send the unit back to hong_kong however it does gives piece of mind .
2	best regards
0	my local_florist shop sends out a dozen black bacara , eucalyptus and cherry blossom yesterday for 00 . 00 .

0	i then googled cheap parcel companies and got parcel_hero , read the reviews and most people scored them highly . i then decided to use them .

0	i do all the running around , waste my time , money and effort . then to be nice and responsible on a court offer . and get what ?
2	i then posted it the same day then a day later received confirmation of reciept and then followed_by a cheque in the post .
2	i ordered sympathy flowers to be delivered to germany and was given a delivery date of 0 march_0000 and payment was taken - by friday 0 march_0000 the flowers had not arrived - i tried to contact iflorist without_success but eventually managed to engage in a " live_chat " with a customer service operative who did not make a great deal of sense - they gave me some sort of tracking_number that seemed to indicate that the flowers were somewhere in the netherlands !!

2	you read such bad_reviews of companies that aren_'_t entirely honest in their dealings , but mazuma have been 000_% straight both times i '_ve used them .
2	i consider the latter to be an endorsement and shall use your services again .
2	serenata_flowers offer an excellent on line service with an easy to follow site .

2	company certainly seems to have designed their offering with the customer in mind ; they offer two ways of receiving payment ( cheque or bacs payment ) and sending your phone ( request envelope or address your_own ) i took the quickest option in both_cases & the money was in my account within_00hrs .

2	i ordered my rock ' n roll skirt flue red , and petticoat ( for the full effect ) me being 00 i wasnt sure what i would look like , but it came within a few_days and how happy was i when i put it on .
0	disgusting service .
2	despite me having a problem with my bank blocking the payment (!)
2	spoke to sammie_taylor today with a problem that she was able to deal with very well and with no_fuss or questions asked very helpfull and would highly_recomend .
2	very impressive .
2	it '_s really as simple as that .
2	when i phoned them to see what was going on they dont seem to give a dam , and its not there problem !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	she was over the moon !
2	the process was quick , easy and pain_free .
2	!
0	spoke to alexandra and was able to sort it all out quickly , thank_you !
0	the transaction was fast from start to finish , will_definitely_recommend and use again .
2	nothing more smoother than their transaction .
0	chatted another representative , and she replies with , " oh the flowers will be delivered from 0 - 0 , they ' re on the truck now ."
0	thank_you so much .
0	it is no wonder uk market is struggling with fixed minimum pricing model , crazy taxes , unwillingness of any uk retailer to budge from fixed prices ( or even a throw in a token freebie ), coupled_with sloppy service , especially_considering the savings to be had vs the low risk .
2	that way you won_'_t have to stay at home for days on end for a collection that is late .
2	sarah_h assisted me advising me that the label could be printed from the confirmation_email that i would receive .
0	i got the pack very quickly and received the cash into my bank the day after i posted it .
2	so far excellent service and no_problems .
0	it takes them over 0 days of ' rebooking ' for collection until i lose my patience and book it in for recollection myself - at my own cost .
2	great service and really efficient .
2	a wide_variety of garden_furniture . even plants and garden stuff as well !!
2	does what it promises .
0	received an_email two days_later confirming they had received my phone and were testing it .
0	i was a bit reserved about the next_day transfer but it really was !
0	the item from repertoire fashion was oversized [ was meant to be a large more like an x - large ] as i had bought the t - shirt 0 weeks previous they just sent me a email_stating i couldn ' t return or ! exchange !
0	i will always use you for my parcel needs !
0	finally i have managed to talk to someone who has in turn offered for the flowers to be delivered by the florist on wednesday , this will be 00 days after_placing the order and also when one of the two recipients will be leaving the country in the early hours , never having received the flowers .
2	i had these phones lying in a drawer at home , you were reccomended to me by a work collegue . i will_certainly pass your service details on . thanks for your quick professional service cheers james reilly .
0	i don ' t have any reservations .
0	besides which , sending an item by recorded_delivery only shows that you posted an item on a certain_date and would certainly not stop the item from being stolen anywhere on its journey .
0	till slut fick jag gå omvägen via_paypal för att kunna betala , men nu i efterhand ser jag att jag blivit dubbeldebiterad - det_har tagits betalt både direkt och via_paypal .
2	great price , faultless service and communication , speedy delivery .
2	i would definitely recommend and will be coming_back again !
2	slightly confusing website instructions .
2	no good :(
2	there isn_'_t any !
2	i was really pleased with the service that i received from eflorist , the website was extremely easy to navigate , everything was well categorised and i was able to find exactly_what i wanted without_any problem at all , i paid for same day delivery , but i had my flowers within a couple of hours , plus the delivery person was extremly courteous , i will_definitely recommend eflorist to all my friends , family or indeed anyone looking for a first_class florist .
0	parcel0go have not even refunded the cost of the courier let_alone any compensation .
0	i agree with many of the other posts here and i am more_than happy recommending conor / bopdj to my friends .

0	it was fast delivery , great ordering updates .
2	first time user and will go on using now fantastic delivery from the start of the journey , to the actual delivery .
2	i have no_hesitation recommending p0go to ebidders / ebayers or others who send parcels on a regular_basis .
2	since royal mails extortionate price increase have used collectplus and out of the 00 parcels none lost but the damage rate is high but only in the last 0 weeks - so what has changed or was i just lucky initially .
2	easy to log on and complete instructions on how to complete the form .
2	i had expected to have to wait a good while for my camera .
0	the delivery was fantastically fast !
2	no telephone_call or email so not good at customer service .
0	so quick and easy !
2	great company good communication very quick transaction
2	she_loves them and i am so pleased she is nice and warm and cosy .
2	many_thanks .
2	they had terms such as ( and i ' m paraphrasing here ). would not return a phone if it did not meet the original quote standards and the price needed to be adjusted downwards , they also said ' you are not able to cancel the contract whether under regulation 00 of the distance_selling regulations or otherwise ' ( this i found very disturbing indeed ).
2	needless to say , i have no affiliation with the comapny other than as a highly satisfied customer .
2	the service was quick and without hassle .
0	this was my first parcel with them and it won ' t be my last for sure .
2	they are the worst company i have ever come_across .
2	once again , my item arived the very next_day - and this has happened every time i have used webtogs .
0	this company really cares_about its customers fast response to all emails , great delivery times and carefull packaging .
2	this is the second purchase from this company , i would definitely recommend spy camera cctv . com .
2	cash was transferred to my acount within a few_days .
2	i '_ve used the site a few_times now and always had excellent service .
2	easy to use website , good prices and really quick delivery .
0	i was picky and chose frames which needed to be ordered in specially for me , i also needed my glass bottle bottom - like lenses to be thinner so suit the frame a little more .
2	avoid at all costs !
2	sold mobile , very pleased with amount offered and once accepted , i received the return envelope the next_day .

0	00 / 00 for these_guys .
2	the money was in my account the morning after i sent the ' phone !
0	a plastic fuel pump was broken in the delivery but collectplus paid the compensation without excuse .
2	arranged for 0rd collection and again no one turned_up .
0	just had a great experience buying an engagement_ring through diamond_geezer .
0	called up about the tempest drum machine . richard called me up the next_day with a finance deal . wouldn ' t have got the unit without his initiative . unit is awesome . free leads a welcome_bonus . unit wasn ' t in stock but was dispatched promptly when it arrived from the usa . 0st time customer , would definitely shop with them again . professional staff , but friendly , recommended .
0	a 00 . 00 order she executes gives her £_00 . 00 00 days_later . i florist make a profit from sending her the order !
0	cannot_fault the product , price or service - will_definitely be using again .
0	i needed to exchange a travel bag for a smaller one , customer_service team where knowledgeable and extremely_helpful .
2	during the entire_process webtogs were simply superb - they obviously place a high priority on customer service which will be rewarded by customers both trusting them and hopefully returning to them for future business .
2	how can you rate something that does not happen , even when they promise to resend and be there on time and never arrive , but your monies are taken , this company should not be allowed to trade
2	my raybans were delivered within a couple of days which i thought was fantastic service .
0	nothing negative . just share my ideas if your willing ;)
0	although being resonably cheap for posting parcels we soon found problems after parcels started going missing , whether this was the websited fault , we dont think so , but after reporting these problems we found our experience with the customer_service team disgraceful , nobody did what they said they would do , they never responded to emails and were rude on live_chat ,, do not use parcel0go !
0	highly_recommend , never used a service like this before , but very glad i have !
2	stealing peoples money is wrong
2	thank_you one very happy mum = one very happy son
0	it would have been nice if they had apologized for the missing order or even asked if i had wanted a new record instead of just automatically refunding it , but it was more like filling out an insurance claim .
0	i would definitely use them again and recommend them to others !
2	it is absolutely a case of its ' what is says on the packet '. from an easy to use site , easy ordering , quick service , helpful staff who respond quickly . and yes if there is a problem with a product . the service is every bit as good . top_marks for webtogs
2	when i contacted parcel0go on facebook , the operator resolves it without_any hassle .
0	i cannot describe to you how much frustration they have caused i do not need to write any more_than this . every reveiw underneath is so true flowers that were sent died in a day wrong type sent still no contact from the customer_service team terrible terrible company .
2	we both bought a mothers_day balloon and card .
0	i dealt_with richard_mileham who helped_me with my item going missing , i have now been approved a refund , no hassle and brilliant service , many_thanks
0	he was great throughout , simple and precise with the information he required .
2	!
0	good job guys !
2	website easy to use , fast response to orders , even faster payment .
2	best and fastest service i could find anywhere .
0	i love the way you get a text to let you know about the status of your order .

2	i have no_hesitation is recommending highly to use this company .
2	so , all in all , good products and good service .
2	very good service , quick and efficient would recommend to any one thinking of recycling there phone
2	there is a major problem in that this is a franchise and the depots insist that " they are nothing to do with fedex ".
0	who can possibly think that ' s an acceptable place to leave a parcel .
2	definitely not good for business , we have lost the faith of a good customer and lost money on the project .
0	parcel0go kept me updated with emails and the help on their online help facility was excellent , when i couldn ' t find my tracking_number .
0	i do like their products but customer_service is very bad .
0	will_definitely_recommend !
0	easy to use and clean , simple to assemble and disassemble and the juice is delicious .
2	it was so easy to do , check my frame size numbers on the inside of my glasses to see best fit , browse the web_site , buy and its your choice if you want more add on '_s .
0	excellent selection of products available on the website .
0	my order was for mothers_day .
0	but wait . they took my guaranteed next_day delivery money did they not ?
2	glasses arrived and quality is a0 , they also do designer_frames .
0	pay for it and it works .
2	well_done hifi - tower .
0	i was then sent a dispatch email and told they would be here today 0 / 00 / 00 .
2	brilliant . all i can say is . wish i had known about them ages_ago ,
2	their aim is to make a refund within two days and two_weeks_later i am still_waiting !
0	after the weekend i contacted the customer_service ( scripted online_chat ) and asked for a redelivery as the flowers would arrive dead .
2	the reason for the non delivery was that the delivery man was trying to get into an electric gate which had a huge sign on it stating .
2	i .
2	i was very impressed with the level of service and also by the excellent delivery process , allowing me to track the delivery to within minutes of its arrival .
0	ruined the day totally .

0	it was quick and informative chat .
2	[_name ] was very helpful and polite .
2	i went for the argos_voucher option where you get a bit more and had spent it about a week after posting the phone off .
2	this us no way to run a company .
0	when i needed help i got through to live_chat really quickly and spoke to sammie_taylor and my problem was resolved within a matte of minutes !
2	the lady at webtog whom i rang when i got into a mess with my credit_card_details sorted_out everything .
2	she was efficient and provided the information i needed quickly and clearly .
0	well dont worry , this one does !
0	only one thing i would say is they need to sort out their website as its very slow !
2	thanks emma , you are a credit to your company .
0	very helpful and freindly staff made the buying process simple .
0	the quality of the brushes is amazing , definitely on par with mac and sigma .
2	they '_ve always done it .
2	second time was an_eternity ring - also before the internet .
2	wendy_hall : i have just hovered over the green question mark and it does not state this service is not guaranteed - so where are you looking at
0	they did not deliver my mothers_day flowers on time , then when i tried to contact them by phone , web chat , email and social_media i recieved no response until the flowers were delivered .
0	great website .
0	extremely_satisfied with the service william provided me .
0	correct money as stated and fast service .
2	the parcel tracking service was a bit jittery ( only showed it was out for delivery one hour before it arrived ) but the whole_process from order to delivery was less_than five days
0	came back disappointed again , contacted p0g live support and the only option they decided to give after all the pain they put you through is pay more for another service or get a refund .!
2	why look anywhere_else when good service is there for you at the tap of a key !
2	they didn_'_t .
0	wasn ' t my favourite flavour mind , so i may just ring up and at_least have 0 thing to complain_about .!

0	update
2	the jacket was a present for my son , who was delighted with it .
2	brilliant :-)
2	great service and cash paid straight in to my account & cleared in an_hour .
2	the tracking is great too , some of the other courier services i have used claim you can track your parcels but actually when checking to try to find out wheremy parcels are , everything is coded ( ie only a number shows up on the tracking_information which means nothing to me , the sender !)
2	best ever flower company !
0	i have used them around 0 times now and the service i received was second to none .
0	simple - enter the ' from ' address .

2	just booked my mistake as parcel not ready to go .
2	i cannot_fault them , they could not have been more helpful , i would 000_% recommend them , to make your bouquets for your big day ,
0	top_notch service from start to finish .
0	[_name ] was very helpful and solved my issues straight_away . 00 *
2	will_definitely_use this company again .
2	if like me and you want them in loads of colours that is what i do i have got ( gulp ) aroung 00 pairs of glasses now in every style and colour including all with anti - reflect coating and even sunglasses and when some on comments i give them the site details i have used other specs shops on line but find these the best and have never once in all my orders had a problem , all i do is go get my eyes checked and ask for a copy of my prescription i used to worry that i had to use the optition where i got my eyes checked but now saving over £_000 per year i def do not so as i sit here in my fab pink glasses with anti reflect coat and cloth and case for less_than £_00 . 00 i feel smug , now not all glasses are as cheap as it depends on the lens you chose i am short_sighted so need distance glasses so do not need a complex lens but even if i get to needing a more complex lens it will still be a lot_cheaper then what i would pay in a shop .
2	once again many_thanks to your team for such a wonderful service , this is the first time we have ordered from you but won_'_t be the last , and we will surley recommend you to others .
2	collect parcel and delivered ahead of schedule .
0	brilliant , resolved my issue with ease as i could not put in the customers delivery address without an error , sarah p processed order and even hung on whilst we struggled to log_into paypal .
0	will_definitely be using again and recommending !
2	i especially liked the fact that i was e_- mailed to inform me when the flowers had left the shop and when they were delivered .
0	in my experience , the guys available on livechat have always been on hand to answer any silly and unnecessary questions i may have ( answers are usually in the product description ), and have been such an excellent help time after time - a real credit to end ' s excellent website .
0	the information that i have asked from online i was great quick .
0	you can even post via parcelforce using interparcel for a fraction of the post_office price .
0	sorted the query within a matter of minutes .
2	thank_you katie
2	thank_you .
2	i was getting in a tizzy as i couldnt find my bank card , sarah_hayes stayed professional , polite and friendly throughout till i found it !
0	we relayed this back to pf , asking for a refund , instead we were told they do not offer refunds and cannot even supply a new set of flowers , as we had taken too long to let them know .
0	dont waste your money go elsewhere
0	i sent my phone to mazuma via special delivery and by mid - day the next_day i had the full_amount in my bank_account .
0	i bought 0 dresses and 0 blouses .
0	very disappointed obviously il never buy anything from them again .

2	big thanks to katie for assisting so i can send a label to one of my customers .
0	you have given me the chance more_than what your fantastic flowers and gifts can give to my fiancé , and that is time .
0	!
0	!
0	simply fast excellent customer_service .
2	efficient service from this company .
0	but parcel0go clearly employs some stellar people to keep the cogs turnin and all i can say is that if you can deal wiv me on a bad day you can deal with anyone !!!!
2	it does exactly_what is says on the tin !
0	the glasses are perfect , with a stylish look and case .
2	i place the order and it was there , as_described , the next working day .
2	well_packaged , well priced and very quick delivery - couldn_'_t ask for more
0	like i mentioned previously i believe the website mislead people with nice pictures of flowers that are nothing like what you receive .
2	i have found it quicker easier and cheaper to send a box or case ahead of me abroad rather_than take a case on the airline . no ligging to airport , few restrictions , picked_up at your convenience and 00kg instead of 00kg for a few_pounds less . especially when i have to use a double hop flight .
2	they also commented i should look into sending my goods by another courier !
0	she identified the problem , and amended it accordingly , she talked me through the whole_process and got my parcel booked !
0	super helpful , really friendly - you couldn ' t ask for better service
0	will stick to interflora next time
2	good , website , easy to navigate and find what you want quickly .
0	they are wonderful and soft .
2	i will recommend everyone to use mazuma
0	they delivered next_day , provided me with regular email_updates as to the status of the order , and the earphones came very well_packaged .
2	i was very impressed with this service as i '_ve never experienced_such quick and efficient service before , after 0 days the whole_thing was done and dusted .
2	this site is it for all your tie needs .
0	from the moment i emailed asking about the different options they were great .
0	so i came_across digitalrev when i was trying to find some good user reviews on youtube for dslrs - being a complete newbie and all . this was a couple of years_ago and i remember watching a video that said the rebels were good beginners cameras , of which i made a mental note .
2	however my local pickup point could do with a bit of training and possibly a new scanner as they seem to have [ roblems with theres , and some of the staff dont know how to use it .
0	and within a few_days the package arrived .
0	- i don ' t have to put up with old_phones cluttering my house .
2	good to buy at this store , quick and good marchendise
0	as soon as i entered the store i got a great vibe from the staff and the layout .
2	!
2	i had my money by return and no hassle some shopsoffer you a lot less and then
2	they are very quick in sending out your cheque .
0	i have just spoken with katie and she was extremely_helpful and polite .
0	!
0	looked around and taking into_consideration the fact that most other_companies didn ' t pay postage i went with mazuma because they saved me a trip to the post_office and paid about the same as everyone_else .
0	thanks
0	then on sunday i got an e_- mail to say thanks again and hope to recieve my phone once i sent it .
2	this company delivers a good quality product at a reasonable price ,
2	thanks
0	beautiful flowers with lots of choice .
2	sending_parcels could not be easier and the customer_care is fantastic , i recently had a problem with a parcel recipient but customer_care assistant andrea dealt_with it very efficiently .
0	i sold an old iphone 0 which they gave me the best price out of quite a few companies .
0	city_link may aswel call them shitty link excuse my french but once they left a parcel in a bush in my garden that was of value of over £_000 and did not have no card through door to say it was there and stayed out for few_days .
0	i found digitalrev shop and they rock !
0	excellent company , fast delivery and realiable .
2	i feel they have only put this response online to make themselves look better and are not the least bit sorry and have no_intention of honoring their promise .
0	lillies in bud which is perfect to ensure the bouquet will last for a decent amount of time .
2	my £_00 . 00 looked like it will be thrown by tomorrow as will be dead !
2	down - loaded and printed free - post label and despatch note in about one minute , packed phone and despatch note in a jiffy_bag and posted package same day .
0	i sent my phones off on the wednesday , and the money was in the bank on the friday !
0	the phone appeared to have repaired itself to the true condition .
2	spunkymonkeystattoostudio @_hotmail . co . uk
0	i strongly_recommend !
2	this is the second parcel ( 00 kilos ) to france and i am stunned at the speed and efficiency of this company , not the cheapest but worth every_penny for the service , picked_up large parcel from my home on time , courteous driver with a smile and a ' no problem ' attitude !
0	thanks .
2	my daughter ordered these flowers for mothers_day
2	keep_up the good work .
2	brilliant fast & efficient service
2	what more could one expect ?
2	i am very happy with them and wish to thank
2	i ordered some mini display port adaptors for some imacs and some hdmi_cables .
0	this is the second time i have used mazuma_mobile to get cash for my old_phones .
0	i had problems booking and selected the live_chat option .
2	email comunications with staff was excellent .
0	flawless , money in my account same day !
0	emails were replayed too fast .
0	cost to me of £_000 without including cost of time and packaging materials , ebay and paypal fees etc , there services arnt worth taking the insurance on as they never pay out anyway , you ' d be better giving your parcel to the next punter on the street and hope he passes it about enough it gets there , will probably be as quick and as reliable , with the same amount of customer_service when it all goes_wrong ( i put when on purpose , its not an if with this company !
0	they never sent me an e_- mail , which they claim they did , stating that my junk box must have deleted it !
2	emma helped_me confirm that a parcel had been picked_up . online_chat is very helpful and quick , and gives confidence .
2	thank_you so much and i can go to bed tonight with peace of mind .
0	posted on wed should have arrived by fri .
0	i am not happy with this , ad wish i had ordered the flowers from a more well_known florist .
2	ashley_: you are speaking to the online supervisor , you will need to pay for this to get it sent again , i am sorry
2	nice email back from peter too .
0	i was a little_wary that it was shipping from_hong_kong , but having previously bought cameras from digitalrev a few_years_ago wasn ' t too concerned .
2	my nokia n00 0gb was 000g in weight and therefore i had to pay the po £ 0 . 00 to deliver it and also insure for loss up to £_000 .
0	i will_definitely_recommend the sunglassesshop to my friends and purchase here again .
2	( less happy with trustpilot as the new terms and conditions wiped the first review so i had to write it all again )
2	rest_assured you will get a good deal .
2	i was sent an_email on the wednesday_morning to say that my phone had been received and then a further email later on to say that my account had been credited .
0	i did after and it was much cheaper but alas too_late !
2	delivered as per instructions and kept_fully_informed at each_stage .
2	please keep it up !
2	very , very good service .
0	the company has excellent customer_service with a very rapid_response time to any inquiry .
0	this was over christmas , they messaged me to say they had received my phone the day after boxing_day and i received my funds the same day , exactly as they quoted .
0	stay_away from e florist !
2	at 00 . 00 today ( 00th_july ) i received an_email from mazuma to advise me my phone had been received .
0	i regret ordering anything from this site and should have opted for a more trusted name like interflora , i ' d have rather paid a bit more to at_least receive the bouquet than be left waiting from 0am - 0pm , a clear waste of time and no consideration for it being a special day .
0	top quality item , arrived quickly and much cheaper_than the high_street .
0	one of the best , hassle_free companies i have dealt_with .
0	cannot_fault this service .
2	posted my mobile back and had my argos card / voucher back within days - and all this during the xmas holliday period .
0	0_stars !
0	then by just stating the driver attempted delivery . he didn ' t deliver so how is that an excuse ?
0	the teddy was also very good quality .
0	i was referred by a friend to use their service so i decided to give parcel 0 go . a go which turns_out to be a parcel no go !!
2	promised to call back didn_'_t !
2	( i '_ve found this has_been well received by several places , who all see a new way of making money by offering this as a service ).
0	this was extremely disapointing and sadly on such a day caused some upset and distress which is simple unacceptable .
2	however , i ' m told the flowers themselves were beautiful so i guess the state of the packaging was down to the delivery people ( yodel ) rather_than serenata_flowers .
0	huge disappointment !
2	i found that the mazuma website was easy to use and within a couple of days received my pre paid_envelope to place my phone in and return .

2	will order again .

0	i booked a collection through interparcel .
0	i could see that , someone had put a lot of time .
2	bit_worried that the price came out about half that of vision_express .
0	they didnt look much like the picture so was disappointed .
0	fingers_crossed it should be sorted now and i should have my package by friday .
0	im not normally the complaining type and have never written a complaint before but i feel ripped_off by interparcel .
0	money went into account quickly and correspondance was great .
2	after my text she went out again and was just so delighted . she got my text three minutes after the delivery !
0	she was incredibly_helpful and pointed_out the right deirection for inputting the delivery address !
0	if there was less_than one star i would rate them that !
0	i talked to sammie_taylor she is very good , nice , helpfull
0	i had a few queries regarding the shipping and mailing service .
0	the company were a pleasure to deal with , and as a last_minute gift you couldn ' t complain with there next_day delivery unfortunately when delivered the flowers had little to no smell and the life span were only about 0 days
0	katie was very helpful , she helped_me fix the problem step by step without losing her patience .
0	i enjoyed using the site , easy to navigate and exceptional prices .
0	jamie .
2	i thought i would send some flowers before i arrive :)
2	the savings i made buying from digitalrev were nearly enough to cover the cost of the new sony hx000 and a private photography lesson !
2	i liked that .
2	simple really
2	!
2	i chose the drop_off at local shop service not only was it much_cheaper_than other carriers but much more convenient .
0	colouring of boots slightly different to website picture but love them regardless .
2	payment receieved on the exact date as emailed
2	the boots are excellent , but should i have wished to return them , a returns_label was enclosed , including instructions on how to send them back .
2	she took all the details , processed it all with a helpful ' chat ' and i felt i had a real service provided .
2	best price i could find on the internet for guaranteed genuine ray bans .
2	requested return packaging online returned unwanted mobiles received money directly into bank_account .
2	needed no further endorsement .
2	i responded advising that i live in a place where the population is over 00 , 000 hardly rural by any description .
0	it ' s these sort of actions that make a capitalist society great .
0	your kidding me !!!!
2	the company kept in constant contact .
2	would definately_use again .
2	using the online service is easy .
2	the upgrade was that instead of delivering the confirmed 00 tulips , you delivered 00 tulips .
0	i email them no one got back to me .

0	( david , very frequent p0go customer )
2	ordered a green waistcoat a week before my firm '_s christmas bash and it arrived well within time as promised .
2	forget trying to buy headphones on the ' bay ', get the real deal here and experience a fantastic level of customer service .
2	this was the cheapest 0 day service , nothing special .
0	well they can !
0	the flowers were showing as " allocated " in the online tracking tool however nothing happened and they never arrived .
2	having used interflora for quite some time i decided to try a company i had not previously seen or heard of .
2	they assured me that a reply would be emailed to me first thing in the morning .
2	half the contents were missing but they didn_'_t know !
0	in honesty i havent always had the best service from live help and it has sometimes been very frustrating .
0	in the small_print digitalrev do say they will be billed - but they also say when the package is with the courier ( in most_cases dhl ) the sole responsibilty lies on the new owner . which is me .
2	!
2	the product was exactly as advertised , came at a very competitive price , was easy to order and arrived very quickly .
2	very easy to deal with , from enquiry to payment took only 0 days which included sending me the bag and me returning could not have been smoother . no_quibbles about payment or trying to reduce payment .
0	the mobile posting pack arrived next_day after posting details on the site .
0	i started a chat on the company website as i was having trouble with the online system whilst trying to book my collections and emma did the job for me whilst i relayed all necessary_information to her and she saved me a delay in transporting my goods .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to anyone , they do what they say a refreshing_change in todays age .
2	if you '_ve got phones lying_around colecting dust convert them to cash now !
2	after posting my mobile to mazuma i received payment the next_day .

2	i complained & was told they would be delivered the next_day 0th_feb , they was delivered but the wrong ones were sent !
0	i sold two phones off the mazumamobile website recently and i can_honestly say it was a pleasure_dealing_with them .
2	would definitely recommend and use again if the occasion arises .
2	they think they are safe because they sit in spain , well they are wrong on that count .
2	my order did eventually turn_up ( a day too late ).

0	the flowers never arrived .

0	i was dubious of whether the company was a scam as so many are these days , but when i went on their website and saw that they would send me the bag in which to submit my mobile for free i though - well i have nothing to lose .
0	i was a little unsure_about customs_charges ( some other reviews said they ' d been stung ) but i was one of the lucky ones .

0	she waited in all day as i said there was a delivery coming .
2	in case people don_'_t know in the uk whoever tests you has to give you the prescription - you don_'_t have to buy of them - it would have cost me about 000_quid to get sports glasses of them whereas selectspecs was 00 quid .
0	i have been greatly impressed with them both_times .
2	cheapest offer around , excellent service , free next_day delivery .
2	i dropped my phone off at 0000 .
2	i have now been in touch with the citizens_advice bureau / trading_standards and watchdog .

2	excellent company who i would definately_use again .
0	the pictures on this site are false_advertising .
2	their service was out of this world .
0	guess_what , the day was screwed due to the non compliance to the instruction box for the order .
2	i made a mistake in the pick_up address for an ebay parcel , something i only realised when i got home from work and yodel had been to my home address instead of my mum '_s , where the parcel was !
2	accepted order , didn_'_t provide labels !
2	a previous attempt to order i thought had failed as i had no confirmation and i was not registered as a customer on their website .
0	i had arranged for a parcel to be collected and delivered to me but the people who it was being collected from were out and i was unsure how to re arrange collection but after using the livechat service a very kind and helpful man called lloyd rearranged it all on my behalf even adding additional collection instruction !
2	there '_s no more to say other than i will happily use fonebank again
2	i ( ordered them @ 0pm they had been delivered by 0 !
0	communication from giggear was excellent .

0	would definitely_recommend .
0	i sent my £_000 iphone to them they are saying its not been received i ' ve called royal_mail they are saying it would have been received 0 days ago , and all mazuma say is it will take 00 days for delivery when this is not true what they mean is they can ' t make a claim for it until the 00 day mark although i ' m assured by royal_mail it ' s been delivered , i ' m now informed its most_likely lost but they can ' t confirm this and when questioned they just send out the same standard script stating they ' re delivery times
2	have used fonebank several_times , exellent speedy service .
2	dont_bother paying for extra flowers to enhance the bouquet -- ordered an increase and the flowers looked like they were a pile of weeds and daisys - nothing like the photos shown , whole table of 00 guests and service staff appalled by the quality .

2	so i spoke to the customer service team who promptly directed me to returned these freepost without_any fuss or hassle . my new trainers arrived a few_days_later ( minus any scuffs ). the trainers are as good as the reviewers say and will give will last me sometime . but i have to thank the country_house team for a simply excellent and 0st rate customer service . i recommend buying these trainers but i would recommend you buy them from country_house who also threw in a pair of outdoor socks for free . cant_beat that .
0	if it is too heavy for the service , i don ' t understand_why parcel0go quote for it and why they sell it to me in first place .
0	very impressed and pleased i went with zoom fish , what a great way to recycle your electronics .

0	i ordered next_day delivery , but on not receiving the flowers within 0 days i contacted them and to be fair , they were very helpful and sent out , as a sorry double the amount of flowers .
0	i had a bicycle shipped from new_york .
0	the prices for speakers & amplifiers might put you off as they are great value but the power from the systems is fantastic .

2	in recently_purchased some flowers from serenata as it was our wedding_anniversary of 00 years i requested delivery before_midday they di not arrive until after 0 - 00pm i had left a note on my door to leave with my neighbour who was at home .

2	tracked as leaving hong_kong then to paris .
0	keep up the good work parcel0go !
2	the website was so easy to use and provided an instant quote , and for the item concerned was much_cheaper_than the post_office + it was collected the following_day from my home by courier . the e_bay recipient was very impressed by the super speedy delivery , so thank_you parcel0go , and i will_definately_use your services again .
0	the only thing i would say is the whole_process is quite pricey but flawless service .

0	really ?
0	now we ' re stuck with some irritating livechat interface .
2	i found this website via_google , it was easy to use , i felt that i got a real_bargain and my order arrived quickly .
0	in a nutshell , people like sammie_taylor are doing a great service to the customer_service world and my sincere thanks go out to her / him .
2	with paypal chargebacks and ebay disputes in mind , bad_reputation and poor feedback would be killers , so making_sure parcels get to the other end is really important .
0	i never received the lower offer from them .
2	photos do not reflect actual size of the bouquet and there stuffed in a box when delivered .
2	dotcompete

0	0 .
2	would recommend diamond_geezer to everyone , look here first !!
2	it was also great to liaise with a friendly , extremely_helpful member of the team .
2	they offer great products at great prices but so do many other_companies .
0	the courier gave a £ 0 off voucher to my mother , saying it was because of the damage ( serenata say they give £ 0 vouchers with all the orders as part of a special offer - erm wouldn ' t the people who purchased the flowers be more appreciative of this voucher then ?
2	[_name ] very helpful sorted query out professionally
0	these were a valentines present .
2	they would send one out to arrive at my home address on thursday 00th_august .
0	use it for a year now and made my life_easier !
0	all of the numbers on their website are dead and they had the audacity to e_- mail me in the afternoon and supply me with another dead number , with the catch phrase " don ' t hesitate to call us if you have a problem "
2	so , to prospective users , take off about £ 0 for you having to insure &_p_&_p .
0	on my second attempt at calling , i got through .
2	are you still there ?
0	thank_god for serenity .
2	it was really that quick and easy , am very pleased and would reccomend to anyone .

0	tried cash0phones before mazuma as they offered more but came back with less_than half the amount and had to pay to return the phone to myself .
2	next_day , the driver was waiting for us when we arrived from the train !
0	thanks richard_mileham .
0	i will not be using mazuma_mobile services anymore and will certainly not be recommending them to any of my friends .

0	i telephone p0g - speak to adam - explain everything again . confirms " if you reject the offer , that ; s the end of the claim ". so i ask nicely to speak to the claims team . i get though to " oliver " . he states the same_thing , but says he can reinstated the £_00 offer on my claim . i explain this is not good enough . i have then reasoned with " oliver " and asked to spoke to his supervisor ." ian " . oliver replies that " ian " is not there at the moment , but will get him to telephone me back , but this may take 00 - 00_hours . i reply " ok " . i then all on to say .

0	thank_you !
0	fantastic !
2	a first - rate service .
2	they don_'_t really have to worry because their insurance rates are so high it often costs more than the service itself and their standard insurance covers only £_00 , if you can ever get them to pay out .
2	a promised return call from a manager did not happen .
2	she is very happy at receiving not one but 0 beautiful bouquets in 0 days .
2	!
2	however , i bought the sd_card and the case seperately from uk online stores , which i can get them cheaper .
0	then i had an escalated £_000 bill saying i now face holding charges !
2	customer service like this is rarely seen to this degree - realise now that we ' d been paying a lot more at vision_express just to sit in swish offices and to get our hands held , and minor ( non - existence ) tweaks made to the fit .
0	emails and answered_quickly and efficiently .
0	post_office have informed me that mazuma are lying about the proof of purchase cover and options are risk in freepost or pay insurance !
2	the only snag was that dhl tried to charge me duty , but one phone_call to digital_rev and then one call to dhl and everything was sorted .
2	i was told they had been delivered but the person who i sent the flowers to never received them .
0	lauren_w was so helpful and i managed to do it fuss - free !
2	no_hesitation in recommending .
0	i have requested 0 times now that they refund this customs import fee to me becuse of the hidden_fees but , more_importantly , poir service , and they persistently refuse .
2	after posting my review on parcel0go i was asked by peter_chandler to post on trust_pilot so here it is :
0	the next_day , i received an_email letting me know mazuma had received my mobile .
2	!.
2	i will review this lens properly when i have more time .
0	one was made incorrectly so it would fit someone with a 00 inch rib cage , and after a couple of wears , the crouched collar began to split off from the shirt .
2	!
2	easy to deal with , quick and efficient .
2	i mislaid my original reply from him and forgot the name of the shop but was delighted when i found a great deal on ebay and it turned_out to be the same dealer .
0	throughout the whole_process i was able to track the progress of the delivery using the dhl_tracking site .
2	to say that i am very , very disappointed with the service from arena flowers today is a complete understatement .
2	normaly very pleased with purchases from e florist unfortunatly the chrismas order was a bit of a disapointment the flowers looked great on delivery but unfortunatly they only lasted two days i would still purchase from e florist as they do give a very good service
0	loved the super ted costume , great value , and speedy service thank_you
0	with mazuma the only thing you have to worry_about is what to spend the money on !
0	i recently mistyped a parcel , but getting in touch with their customer_service i was able to sort out my parcel issues in no time at all !
0	when it came to valentines_day , waited all day , received no e mail or phone call until 00 : 00 , when an e mail was received starting my order had been ' allocated '.
2	thanks again
2	my mother in law was absolutely_thrilled with the combination for lilies , roses , carnations and more .
0	mazuma is a great place to get_rid of any unwanted phones .
2	unfortunately due to a packing error i only got one set - not 0 sets as ordered .
0	it shouldn ' t take that long to despatch in the first place !
0	can ' t fault the service .
2	i contacted livechat and emma gave me a hand .
0	richard understood and evaluated my problem efficiently and within minutes the problem was solved with the best of manners and curtsy .
2	i have used mazuma twice and the experience was excellent , logon , fill out the form , post the tech and get paid for it .
2	how long can this go on d ' y think ?
0	sent them a message through their online account system and got a response at 0 . 00pm which was clearly a scripted response they send to everyone , was not personal to what i had asked them in message at all !
2	you may strike a great site , but there '_s no guarantee that you '_ll hit a quality product .
0	i have just had to use the live_chat service for the first time and had the pleasure of talking with daniel .
2	michelle was most helpful .
0	top_notch service and very helpful to me when i lacked sufficient knowledge .
0	i ordered the flowers sunday .
0	all the items here are well quality , highly_recommend customers to shop for their clothes !
2	surely it incumbant on you to discover the reason and rectify the problem ?
2	easy to use and a simple transaction .
2	the service was fantastic !
0	i will be recomending them to anyone who will listen !
0	contrary to advice on website
0	i would shop with them again if they had what i needed .
0	great service - would definitely_recommend to others .
0	at first i was a bit_nervous_about spending a lot of money online , with a company that had ' geezer ' in the title .
2	i have recommended them to somebody i know - who bought a cctv system immediately .
2	or try my sir name with the funeral directors .
2	ordered these for valentines_day , some joke hey !
0	one problem was the bag fell_apart on first use but either quick and reliable delivery .
2	payments into bank accounts are very quick .
2	i found it very easy to place my order with serenata .
0	so easy to use , print labels , purchase and track etc .
2	delivery next_day at no extra_charge
0	x
0	fast service , with a decent amount paid for my phone , i would happily_recommend mazuma to anyone and will use again in the future
0	i must give a big thank_you to ' kate ' and ' sam ' the facebook dream team who helped_me set_up an account to put my pre_- pay into - the hidden gems of parcel0go !
2	had the money within a week .
0	it has a slip in it from digitalrev which is a warranty card .
2	i chased again this week and was told that if i simply provided evidence of purchase of the item that i sent then as i had taken out their insurance then it would all be hassle_free to get resolved .
0	never got any voice_mail or phone call .
0	next_day delivery , no_fuss , no_problems .
0	i live 000_miles_away and wont see her until the weekend , the flowers would have been a surprise for her as i said i hadn ' t sent anything to her as i would give her a card and present when i see her .
2	i was appalled that she actually wanted to blame the wrong information given to me on a ' foreign call_centre ' when i had actually spoken to a very nice english man who did try to help by promising he would look into why the delivery hadn_'_t been made on friday and get back to me .
2	i am just waiting for someone to treat me to a bunch from arenaflowers now !
0	so so easy to do and didn ' t cost me a penny and i made £_00 . 00 !
0	wicked .
2	goods as_described .
0	' kirsty ' then informed me my parcel wouldn ' t be delivered as it takes 00_hours for the address change to happen .
2	the latest issue is i cannot spend the £ 0 . 00 unless i pay a minimum £_00 top up .
2	i went on line & got a load of quotes .
0	!
0	its a shame there isnt an option on this website to not leave any star_rating !!!
0	they agreed it was silly , and offered to send a replacement as a gesture of goodwill .
2	if you do require any further assistance please do not_hesitate to come back to us .
2	g mcardle
0	requested a refund at_least down to the service received and denied .
0	yodel home delivery couriers ( not all , just the incompetent ones and there are many ) can just continue whatever it is they do swinging from light to light or more like tree to tree like the baboons they are .
0	also i always look_forward to the lolly they send in the package , just a nice friendly touch !
0	either they employ people who can not read or who are too lazy to notice that the phone does turn on but it is just the screen , there is nowhere to state on the website when ' selling ' the phone what damages it has so you can ' t point it out to these morons .
0	customer_service big_fat zero .
0	i ' m really impressed with the service , both myself and the recepient ( on the other end of the world ) was able to tracked the status on the parcel and it was delivered on time as well .
2	i '_ve found ups to be the most efficient cost_effective courier for my needs , and frankly anyone who needs a reliable carrier for your heavy , high value goods would do a lot worse_than booking a service via interparcel .
2	worked great .
2	days of posting phone .
0	very happy with the service provided and the speed at which it was delivered .
2	!
2	yours faithfully brett stephens .
0	i was told i would receive a phone call to tell me what was going on 00_hours_later no phone call .

0	i spoke to sammie on live help after i needed to change the delivery address of a parcel i had booked .
2	lindy always have the solution to complicated connectivity problems , the service is second - to - none and their prices are hard to beat .
2	when i opened the box , the scanner glass and side panel were smashed and i have had to send it back .
0	so i had to send them back for a refund .
2	i had varifocal_lenses which i got used to in a couple of hours .
2	hiking friends have recommended rab and now i know why .

0	the lady , catherine , that helped my grandad out today was very helpful and patient considering he ' s not too good with technology .
0	firstly i was trying to see what details were required for my credit_card and the numerous options present on the page was somewhat confusing and when i thought i was just checking the validity of my credit_card , it went through as a payment .
0	no one from either yodel of iflorist has got in contact with me however to resolve the issue .
2	i recently ordered a pair of adidas gerlos walking shoes , as webtogs had a promotional offer on adidas products .

2	emma you have put my mind at rest , and i can get back to my buyer and let him know .
2	he was dressed in casual clothes and driving a private car .
0	heads need to roll for the embarrassment that i have suffered whilst trying to do something nice for the love of my life . she deserves better that what iflorist ' s half assed employees appear to think is acceptable .
2	on opening it , i discovered tired looking roses of which 0 had been decapitated , and melted chocolates .

0	!
2	that was rubbish as her mum was home all day waiting in for them !!
2	unfortunately the french kettle lasted no_longer_than the cheapest , the handle came loose , it leaked to scold , it spat when poured and the lid was very difficult to remove .

2	you can '_t ask for any more than price competitiveness and reliability .
2	would use music matters again .
2	once again i and my son are extremely disappointed and angry with this company .
2	i know he is taking this further but my message to all is go use m & s or interflora or support your local florists .
0	the flowers ordered were the same species that were pictured but a different_colour and the message i typed out to go with the flowers wasn ' t there .
2	always available to answer any questions or queries , always there to advise and help and topped with an early delivery of the most perfect engagement_ring .
2	thanks alex your a star .
0	will use again :)
0	i would like to firstly thank_you for the great service you provided me .
0	its ok though , they ' ve taken my money !!!!

2	thank
2	prompt efficient service .
2	there were no bananas , but a fantastic array of beautiful_flowers .
0	i wasn ' t aware of another company i could trust and that gave good value for my device .
0	parcels have been collected and tracked with ease , only 0 customers have complained about boxes looking squashed but items inside are ok as i wrap everything well .
0	didnt even have the courtesy to phone back when they said they would .
2	good service and product from these_people , use them
0	i have never had an issue with either of the cameras i have ordered , so can ' t comment on how well digitalrev perform on returns etc .
0	i had to return 0 motorcycle helmets to from the uk to the us and the company has specifically requested either to use fedex or ups .
2	finally found live helpline and chatted to rowan , he soon sorted_out the mixup and rearranged collection with correct address . will use this service again if needed .
0	i am absolutely appauled and am questioning weather i even want to keep the phone when it finally arrives if it does .
0	i can ' t recommend them highly_enough .

0	would definitely_recommend mazuma .
0	the assistant rose was very professional .
2	the staff are fantastic and very helpful and aim to please , i would definitely recommend and use parcel0go again .
0	i then found out that if i had gone with a different company i could have got more money .
2	and
2	not happy at all having paid top end prices !
2	have confidence when you deal with this company
0	i have had some very bad_experiences with other courier companies on the net that are all talk and no action - when your package becomes a problem it is you who has to do all the hard work .
2	!
0	there ' s loads of choice of all the best stuff .
2	i am looking for a simple cost_effective drop - off service and interparcel is just not consistent enough .
0	this is the first time i ' ve ordered and i am so pleased !
2	i ' d booked the wrong_address and the wrong day .
0	the item wasn ' t delivered till after 0pm & there was water inside the packaging which_resulted_in the card becoming wet .
0	payment via bank tranfer quick & easy
0	at the end of the day you are stupid not to use this service !
0	excellent service suitable for working people and fits in easily on the way home from work .
0	i have previously bought my canon prime lens from dr and i certainly will be back for more photography gear when i ' m ready for my next adventure !

2	country_house outdoor is certainly a company to trust .
0	best regards ,
0	simples !
0	thank_you for this service .
0	stephanie and emelie were alwasy quick to reply to emails and more_than happy to answer whatever questions arose .
0	they arrived in fair time , but were really really poor quality and way overpriced .
2	. only one '_s i '_ll ever use .
0	so now despite spending a reasonable amount of money - my grandma won ' t be receiving the flowers i ordered .
2	i am back to m & s flowers who i have used loads in the past and have been very reliable .
0	will_definitely use again .
2	held on the phone line this morning of 0 minutes and gave up !
0	thank_you guys :)
2	we then had stephanie spend time helping us to choose our perfect ring .
2	great quick service and understanding with a wee problem a pleasure to talk to and she knew her stuff
0	the buds were just starting to open so my mum gets to watch them open which she enjoys .
2	this is somewhat hard to fathom as they claim that the fiasco only affected a small number of customers .
2	i find that any_queries are rectifed by qualified and expert people and done in a manor where it leaves you with compl ; ete satisfaction , i would recommend hi_fi tower to anyone .
0	will_definitely use this service again !
0	0 .
2	the flowers were fantastic looking at the photo my daughter sent me .
0	for anyone who has lost loved_ones , we all know that the only real ' gift ' we can buy them is flowers .
0	happy days .
0	pointless keeping dead flower in my home !!!
2	check out with paypal : a blessing when in a rush .
0	people often forget that parcel 0 go are there to cut out the middle_man when arranging collections !
2	they did not turn_up .
2	i returned one item as it didn_'_t suit my needs and it was refunded very quickly indeed .
0	great online buying exoerience !
0	i was skeptical that this could be a genuine offer , but trusted the reviews on trust_pilot and sent off my glasses .
2	i used your services to purchase a canon_lens as you were advertising the best price .
2	never buy flowers from this company .
2	i am flabbergasted that it can take so long to get a parcel from cambridge to herts 0 to 0 working_days is a joke , the tracking says it was collected on 00th_march and taken to hermes depot on 00th_march where i assume it still sit 00 days_later . order details as requested and sent 00 march order 0000000 follow_up emails sent and request for return phone_call as parcel needed this saturday 00 no one phones back and when you call them they are always on another call , poorest customer service response in a long time .
2	for under £_00 you '_ll be hard pressed to find an equivalent amp of this quality !
2	i have used transglobal for several_years now and have no_hesitation in recommending them , way better value than using carriers directly if like me you only send a handful of consignments outside uk each month .
0	edit_: flowers arrived this morning , both lots as they replaced them as the original were no doubt pretty dead by now !
2	i bought a sigma 00 - 00 hsm ii lens on the 0th_june .
2	the first 0 years were fine , so i had a reasonable expectation that this one would be ok too .
0	well_done money for your phone i will be using the site
2	i entered my details online on a tuesday , recieved the pack to send my phone back n the wednesday and the money was in my account by the thursday .
0	keep up the good work !
0	i will be using bopdj again and would recommend their services to anyone
2	to add_insult to injury following further emails to parcel0go i was then informed that to obtain a refund my case had to go to a refund co - ordinator who would review the request and either approve / reject it !
2	cleared funds in a / c tuesday .
0	i went new school and bought one the gigaset viop phone with its corresponding base .
0	pathetic , they don ' t even have a contact number or an_email address to file a complaint .
0	finding this website was a treat .
0	bought a samsung 00 '' tv off their site ,
2	he immediately checked and then issued a credit_note for the difference which i received immediately by email .
2	a big thank_you again .
2	!
2	highly_recommended
0	i was dealt_with a lady_called emma in regards to a parcel that needed to be sent elsewhere rather_than the registered address that i had entered .
0	futile . marked urgent yet no response .
2	flora queen spain .
2	ordered my canon_0d with battery_grip and additional batteries thursday_evening about 0pm it was picked , packed and shipped to the uk arriving on the sat at 0pm .
2	the card with the message to the recipient had fallen deep inside the bouquet and was difficult to find .
0	it took me a while to get all the old_mobiles in from our staff , so we actually missed the deadline for posting , but this wasnt a problem , as one quick email to mazuma extended the deadline for us .
0	cheapest online for the product too which was great .
0	it sparkles so much i can ' t stop looking at it !
0	very happy with the service from mazuma .
0	leanne
0	i was so happy with the bouquet my daughter sent via the marvellous interflora that i thought i ' d let everyone know .
0	being so close to christmas it was also beneficial to get more money throgh accepting argos_vouchers .
2	i have learnt never to select yodel nor city_link , they just do not deliver .
0	the delivery was quick and free .
0	arrived very well_packaged with 00m of very carefully_wrapped bubble_wrap , box and item in pristine_condition .
0	erm the point of using the company is because i don ' t have time for these things !
2	nothing seemed automated , i then asked a couple more questions , & i got straight answers immediately .
2	bought outfit for rock and roll night on cruise - got really good comments
2	perfect service , would definitely_use again .
2	the ordering online was simple i chose the date and the flowers were delivered when they said they would be .
2	0 *****
0	this adapter was extremely dangerous , i could literally hear it buzz and could see electricity running up and down it , in future , digital_rev really need to look at into their plug adaptors ( chinese to british ).
0	i will never use again and neither should you .
2	ordered flowers on a bank_holiday monday , email_confirmation of order , email_confirmation of dispatch and even email_confirmation of delivery on tuesday_morning .
2	i purchased some seed potatoes , which took over 0 & 0 / 0 weeks to arrive ( from stock ), and then found that they ' d sent the wrong one '_s !
0	a grade , 0 star service .
2	i had elected for payment into my account which they did same day they received the phone .
2	the flowers are nice and fresh .
0	look_forward to the new designs !
2	i learned from the experience and ordered the earrings in plenty of time so that even if there was a delay , i ' d have them on time .
0	fantastic service !
2	emma was more than willing to help me book a parcel , and completed it very fast , this is how companies should be run with excellent customer service .
0	even after i emailed them over 0 times asking about it , they did reply the first few_times but never after that and i never got the glasses !
2	would certainly use them again in the future .
0	when i noticed a deep scratch in my supposedly scratch - resistant lenses after no obvious impact , i simply contacted selectspecs and they asked me to send them back for inspection , and quickly got back to me to say they ' d re - glaze them for free .
2	but what do i do with the box , charger , heaadset , cds , instructions etc . where do you recucle these ?
2	jon golding , ceo , liability management ltd . london .
2	flowers delivered within 00_mins . recipient over the moon
0	my advice - do not use this florist , no matter how desperate .
0	wow , great service .
0	the only slight_issue was the envelope they sent , while kind enough to provide one , it was clearly a envelope designed for a phone and not an ipad .
0	which were rrp £_000 , and i got them for the fantastic price of £_000 . 00 .
2	very happy with the fast delivery and services again
0	after having a discussion over the phone i had decided on my ring which was delivered instantly .
2	!
2	bought these flowers at short_notice and as promised they were deliverd on time , first_class service , first_class flowers .
0	so in approx 0 - 0 days i had applied , posted and received payment .
2	iflorist did not deliver the flowers
0	i got the full_amount i was quoted on line .
2	if you '_ve been to the post_office since the last increases , you know how cross many ebay private_sellers are , and the ladies in my local post_office , who i have got to know well over the past five years tell me their customers are deserting them in droves - very sad in a way , but i ' m happy with my change of sides !
0	would definitely use again
2	today is the 00th_february and i still have '_t received them .
2	massive thank_you sam , youve saved my reputation :) x
0	dispatched the item within 0 hours of ordering , received first thing the following_morning , would recommend to anyone
2	fast and efficient service , excellent !
0	anyway the issue was the hermes person took_ages to deliver a parcel to my customer once , i ' ll never use hermes again , but interparcel is great , i hope they drop hermes off they ' re list .
0	all in all i am very happy to have a reasonable sum of disposable income for a 0 year_old handset that i have been itching to get_rid of since the first month i had it .
0	sent my phones on the wednesday and i got my money in the bank on the friday very fast
0	i recommend this florist to anyone_wanting a bouquet of good value .
2	should have known better - no sign of yodel couriers and no sign of the roses !
2	whilst they rebooked the collection ( which was further delayed by the bank_holiday ) they had no interest what so ever in trying to make amends and hid behind " terms and conditions " stating next_day delivery was the next_day after collection , completely missing the fact that the collection had not taken place on the day it should !
2	highly_recommended .
0	the iflorist website told me they would be delivered on the 0nd january .
2	very impressed by the speed that the order was despatched .
2	thank_you for delivering flowers to my daughter in macedonia .
0	i don ' t know how a company could send out such a poor product please don ' t buy from these .
0	next_day delivery was also included at no extra_cost , i honestly thought it was all too good to be true and didn ' t hold out to much hope going on past experiences with different companies .
2	efficient and troublefree service .
0	i ordered flowers for the 00 / 00 and 00 / 00 .
0	easy to order , fast delivery .
2	i always trust lindy products to be of good quality at a reasonable price .
2	the products i purchased have been top quality for the moneis paid .
0	i can ' t believe i used to go to other recyclers before , with fonebank , everything was easy and straightforward , i dropped my iphone at their branch , on my way back home i received a confirmation that my phone was received , few minutes after another email_stating that the phone was processed and the money has been sent .
2	bravo continue very good .
2	birthday_present for friend and she was over the moon with them .
2	i then had a call from the recipient to say how beautiful the flowers were
0	everything works .
0	so you ' ve basically taken his money and not delivered anything ??
0	bought an_eternity_ring and the better half is delighted with it .
0	i asked some questions early today .
0	all in all , its a massive 00 / 00 from me !!
0	thank_you bop_dj , i ' ll buy from you guys again , maybe a sl0000 , who_knows ?
0	they then couriered the finished ring back to me with two days in hand for the wedding .
0	the flowers i ordered were not delivered on the specified day which was a real disappointment as they were for a sick friend just out of hospital .
0	i sent 0 of my phones to mazuma , and i received a text the next_day about payment being sent .
2	i have had a problem with one package somebody sent me the other day .
0	i got all of my equipment form production_room and i really enjoy coming in and talking to the staff , they always know what they are selling and will give the best advice possible .
2	followed_by great followup on their part .
2	delivery took about 0 weeks from time of ordering , which i was ok with , especially as the glasses were at_least £_000 cheaper at selectspecs than anywhere_else !
2	i got an option to have an upgraded order delivered the “ next available day ” or a refund of my money .
2	thank_you peter_chandler and parcel0go .
2	he then did something in the background and sent me a link to use that helped to sort_out my parcel to be picked_up .
0	i was told they were left in a safe_place although they were no where to be found .
0	my current order , some loake buckinghams were dispatched promptly and i was able to track their progress .
2	oh did i say that the value of the coat is worth a lot more so you are getting a damn good bargin !!
2	i have used parcel_hero twice now , once delivering abroad .
0	shopping online can be a rather faceless business .
0	last conversation was they would ' try ' and get delivered tomorrow to which i said as they were three days late i wanted a full_refund for their terrible service to which they replied they could not do .
2	transaction was very swift and money in my account in a few_days .
0	i was dealt_with in a professional_manner and never_experienced a problem .
0	0 .
2	!
0	i tried and was not disappointed as the parcel was delivered on time .
2	the downside ( not specific to digital_rev , but to all ' grey imports ') is that you don_'_t get a manufacturers guarantee , but you do get a guarantee from digitalrev , which involves returning the item to them if there is a problem .
2	i was having difficulties sending a document abroad .
2	unfortunately there was nothing available within my price range and i have decided to collect myself , but i will_certainly keep this service in mind for any future parcel deliveries !
2	their website is easy to use and booking a service is simplicity_itself .
2	as this was the first time i have purchased from you i read a few reviews .
0	having used mazuma in the past i will never doubt the service you get , sent my phone special delivery and next_day i received my money in the bank .
0	able to ship to a different address .
0	matthew was very helpful gave quick responses and sorted my issue straight_away very helpful and will_definitely be using this service in future .
0	thank_you so much parcel_hero you really saved my day .
0	i decided to surprise my wife and brighten up our home with some arrangement of flowers just before_christmas .
0	a friend who also runs a small business recommended interparcel and they have taken all the aggravation and unprofessionalism i had with my previous parcel carrier away .
2	ashley_: she would of sent this request on but it appears it had already been processed for a return geoff
0	unpresentable and the quality of the bunch was rubbish .
0	have given five_stars as i could not have asked for more .
0	!
2	the total_cost of my order had been £_00 . 00 .
0	i ordered several items from them for myself and christmas_presents , pleased with the range of items they have available and how quickly my ordered arrived in the lovely branded boxes .
0	the ring exceeded my expectations and my girlfriend is over the moon .
2	well the process from start to finish was very fast indeed
2	geoff_: enough for one day i think .
0	i ordered a pair of polarized aviator arista ' s with a brown lense and a gold frame !
0	i was a bit_hesitant to order this product all the way from_hong_kong , given some concerns about sigma ' s quality_control , but it was 00_% cheaper , arrived quickly and was well_packaged .
2	i ordered my headphones on tuesday_lunchtime for normal 0st_class delivery & they arrived the next_morning ( wednesday ), as i say " unbelievable " especially in this day & age .
2	interparcel is very easy .
0	i ordered the bag on friday , received it in the post on saturday , posted the phone in the bag with the delivery note on tuesday and had the money in my account on wednesday_afternoon - extraordinary
2	i ordered a basket for my mum in new_zealand .
0	from the very start , i spoke with tnt uk and india office and at every point i heard a different_story .
0	instead i see a company who appears to deem special occasions as trivial , unimportant dates , that they can either choose to oblige their commitment , at a date that suits them . if at all .
2	thanks for the great service again .
2	if you care about your loved ones receiving the flowers you want to send them - don_'_t order from this company .
2	i understand you use local_florist for your orders , however they are not doing your business standards any help at all .
2	tottally avoid these worthless cowboys .
2	doesn_'_t get much_better_than that .
2	i shall_definitely shop_here again and recommend to my friends .
2	this type of service is truly awsome , and in the words of arnie " i will be back ".
0	if you would like to contact me regarding this - i will offer constructive advise on how i use the site as a client of yours . more then happy to help and give ideas , given my profession .
0	i was worried_about vat and customs duty etc . but i had no_problems when receiving the package and that means great value as i saved hundreds of pounds .
0	the items were packaged safely and all correct , present and accounted for .
0	this company is a joke .
2	my first experience of an online courier booking service and i would be happy to use again .
2	i have several things from this company and the quality is exceptional .
0	will change rating if i am proved wrong .
2	ordered flowers for my mums birthday .
0	i could not have been more wrong .
0	received freepost_bag within 00_hours of raising sale request , sent phones via recorded_delivery the next working day via recorded_delivery and had the full_amount quoted paid into my account within 00_hours of mazuma receiving the phones , all done withing 00_hours , amazing !!!
0	i have highly_recomended this companies service to friend and colleagues alike . thank_you mazuma .
0	no_fuss , no hassle .
0	plus i got a cheeky £ 0 off if i liked them on facebook .
0	on all three occasions i have spoke to this team i have had immediate , helpful and friendly responses ( the smiley faces make everything seem even nicer ).
0	all i can say is thank_you diamond_heaven !
2	there was a problem with my post_code ( my error ) and the chaps at hifiheadphones phoned me to put right when the system would not process the order .
0	delivery was the next_day too so that was even more awesome !
0	the price that mazumamobile gave me , was higher_than any other place that i looked into .
2	ordered flowers to be delivered on mothers ' day .
0	comparemymobile . com earned me an extra £_00 for my samsung_galaxy_s0 .
2	apparently the flowers were very nice and the service was very good too , i was kept_informed by email and text about the there expected eta and again after they were delivered which was very good .
2	many_thanks to katie !
0	this was great customer_service and helped_me to place the order there and then , rather_than worrying that i had not filled the info out correctly .
0	in less_than a week i applied for to sell my old phone , received the pack i needed to send it and received payment very promptly .
0	i ' m sure most people that come_across this site are / were in the exact_same_boat as me and are worried_about fake items .
2	this only turns_out to be valid if the item is virtually indestructible , otherwise it is not covered .
2	just received excellent service from customer advisor catherine .
0	i looked on a forum , and emailed paul at collect_plus in a last ditch attempt to have my items refunded .
0	very helpful assistant called [_name ].
0	wish i had read these reviews before ordering mums flowers !!
2	superb service !
2	products great and quick delivery .
0	i trusted them with one of the most_important orders i have ever made and they screwed it up .
2	i attempted to purchase the insurance at the time of purchase but couldnt get it to work , in hindsight i shouldve tried harder as collect_plus managed to lose both parcels .
2	i am always pleased , and assured that you are my favourite trusted choice in times of need and speed .
2	i shall take_note from my wife in future and that is to go to the local supermarket
0	the website is clean and informative .
0	ordered flowers on monday , did not receive them yesterday and have been told that they were delivered to a secure location at the front of the property .
2	they got back to me very quickly and gave me a couple of options , i decided to return the system and get a replacement so they sent me the freepost returns labels by email .
2	i ' m thinking of putting next years order in now !
0	i had to return a couple of items and exchange one which is usually a pain with online shopping but this was free to return them and all processes were quickly dealt_with and i have now received my exchanged item which is perfect .
0	i did ask for a kompensation for the late delivery and he offered me a 00 pound voucher .
0	fast forward to present time , i found myself trawling to find the review i watched , only to find a new model had been released and reviewed - and i just had to have it in my life now that i had the funds !
0	initially i thought it was a joke , why had my mum sent a photo of funeral flowers ?
0	i placed my order on monday via parcel_force with an undeliverable cheapest price for my 00 " lcd .

2	i will_definitely_use this company again .
0	the product is perfect in every way nothing dodgy with it
2	clearly_marked with standard delivery on the box .
0	their rates are competitive but being_able to swap my phone for another phone is brilliant .
2	stupidly i forgot to include the weight of the box .
2	collection and delivery were within a few_days : i was happy and more_importantly my customer was happy .
0	a day later it was with me but sadly i had ordered a size too large ( completely my fault ).
0	efficient did not waste time , money in my account the same day .
2	great service thank_you .
0	outstanding service and great assurity .
2	would certainly use this company again and would fully recommend to others .
0	highly_recommended and better_than letting your old_mobile gather lint in a drawer somewhere .
0	i can not fault how quick this service was !!
0	hopefully won ' r be back buy buy another wedding_ring !
0	i sent my phone off on a tuesday and money was in my account the very next_day .
2	fantastic !!!
0	after finally getting a prescription from the nhs i decided i ' d look online and came_across selectspecs .
2	they were so happy to receive them .
0	i spoke to them on the phone when first noticing this and their response on the phone was ' sure , no problem . send them back and we ' ll refund the cost ', to which my response was an amenable customer .' look , there is no need for a refund , just credit my account or call me and we ' ll chose another frame '.
0	obviously will stick to what i know is best .
0	the switches on the mics offer easy operation .
0	i think the product supplied is of good quality for the price .
0	extremely_satisfied .
0	usually the service is excellent and trouble free .
0	i orded fairytale love bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend , but this morning someone in serenata_flowers email me saying that my flowers were been misrouted to the wrong depot for delivery .
2	more often than not i have booked a tnt collection from my house - sometimes citylink - and all have been good .
2	it restored my faith in the british tailoring industry .
2	order flowers and chocolates for early delivery , on saturday - in time for mothers_day .
0	flowers not delivered .
2	i found serenata completely by chance and i ' m really pleased i did .
0	we are going to contact bank , police and lawyer this weekend .
2	i used " live_chat " to find out how to find the fedex tracking_number , and had to search the pdf file for the information , and guess which was the second tracking_number .
0	postage - £_00 ( prove provided )
2	from the moment i placed my order until they were delivered i was kept_informed by text and e_- mail on the progress . from now on i will be using serenta_flowers .
0	amazing live_chat service , remi answered my question within a second !
0	it is easy to navigate , easy to stick within whatever budget you have and see what choice you have within it , and all bouquets come in three sizes , so if you can ' t afford or don ' t want a big bouquet you can always choose the smaller .
0	due to me being late in sending said present i had to use the " next_day delivery " option .
2	the lady i spoke too was so understanding and accommodating and without_question , explained that she would email me a returns_label in order for me to return the boots .
0	i ' d like to thank her because my parcel got sent off really quickly and on time , making my day much_easier !
0	i am most unhappy as this still leaves me out of pocket by around £_000 which is owing to me .
0	by day 0 they were completely dead and brown all over .
2	have used parcel0go before and will be using them again .
2	unfortunately on both_occasions one of the speakers did not work .
2	the best he could do was exactly the same length of time which of course was far to long .
2	i unreservedly recommend this company if you want to buy anything to do with headphones .
2	i ordered my fancy_dress costume late on monday night and it arrived on wednesday - how quick was that ???
0	i now have ebay bubble rap sorted for the next 0 years :)
0	everything arrived very quickly and i was kept up to date via emails with what was happening with my phone .
2	excellent bellicon rebounder made to my specification .
2	ordered " next_day " flowers on a saturday .
0	quick and efficient !
2	i received emails and text_messages at every_stage of the process , from and order confirmation , a despatch notification and a delivery notification !
0	what makes it worst was the package was lost at their office depot after ups returned it to their front_desk due to them been unable to deliver .
0	this company is devoid of decent business practice and i can only imagine a lot of these reviews on trustpilot are fake .
0	sent my phone in the envelope ( after waiting 0 days for envirophone to send it back as they offered only 0 / 0th of the money fonenabk offered for my non working galaxy_s0 ) and the next_day , the money was in my bank_account !
2	0 emails were ignored so i raised a paypal complaint for non delivery of goods .
2	brilliant !
0	after a lot of panic , the online_chat saved the day with an urgent parcel collection that failed twice before hand !
2	i was very impressed and serenata will now be my first choice for sending flowers in the future .
0	no matter what , if you have a problem , you lose out .
2	i ordered a large roses medley bouquet , which seemed very nice on the website for my mother on mother '_s day ( 00th_april_0000 ).
2	found this site by_accident , glad i did , had acouple of mobile_phones i was just going to throw out .
2	i will_certainly order from you again .
2	interparcel & parcelmonkey ) i am very impressed with parcel0go '_s booking / order system , speed and cost .
0	!
2	unfortunately the cost is being passed on to my customers with higher postal_charges , but i won_'_t be using collect_plus again until they dump yodal as a carrier .
2	service was quick , reliable and totally hassle_free .
0	had a great experience with mazuma and found everything easy and fast .
0	at the second attempt i got through to a lady who informed me that due to problems with weather at their warehouse the order wouldn ' t be delivered until the 00th .
2	fast delivery of correct product .
2	inter flora charges were very expensive , so i kept looking on the internet .
0	thanks again and i will only ever use your site for phone_recycling .
2	easy ordering and received very quickly .
2	i ordered the outfit and within days it was at my house
2	tried to claim and after approx 00 emails submitted pics talked to different people and still no refund . out of pocket £_000 !!!!

0	very fast service even with the bad_weather during this christmas_period .
0	with money so tight this seemed too good to refuse , and of course i did so .
0	excellent as always
2	a very easy transaction i was surprised at the speed the whole_transaction was
0	five_stars baby ;)
2	this is one of the best on line shops i have dealt_with , the service was excellent and the choice is amazing .
2	card & payment_method & voila !
2	blumen sehr frisch und sehr gutes arrangement .
0	love that you are kept up to date with delivery status .
0	peter owen : i don ' t understand - your company and i paid city_link to collect yesterday and they did not provide the service paid for .
0	excellent amount of information on the site to help getting the right headphones , good price , and very quick delivery .
2	late on valentines
2	because i decided to keep the bag , pure gave me a 00_% refund as compensation .
2	just this week i used hermes and the service from them was absolutely appalling - two missed collections and not able to make contact with driver despite having telephone_number to call .
2	on the very few occasions i '_ve had a problem and called them the service has_been polite and efficient .
2	no problem what so ever and quick
2	then paid me the fee due within 00_hours of me returning the envelope .
2	i am glad i used mazuma .
2	great service , and reasonable price .
2	rearranged for monday .
2	will_certainly use this company again
0	my only ever issues are usually with the carrier companies themselves , who seem to have a tape measure designed by a man , ( where there ' s three inches to every one inch ) and once in a blue moon manage to re measure my parcel at twice the size resulting in my getting another invoice for twice the cost of the initial shipment , however , such issues are normally resolved very quickly through transglobal , and all is ok again :)
2	and very efficient process .
0	the delivery service is awesome also it ' s amezing only today days they send my item from_hong_kong .
2	my husband used serenata yesterday to send me some roses .
2	thank_you .
2	they arrived on time and looked good via the photo that i saw .
0	i bought a single white rose , ' i love you ' balloon and a card for my girlfriend all for under £_00 , for delivery 0 days_later , i got a message when the flowers left their depo and when they arrived at hers , she_loves them and sent me a photo of them , they look better_than they did on their website .
0	i booked the first collection myself on 00th_june for monday 00th_june i booked yodel through parcel0go . com , so wait in all day 0pm comes and i contact parcel0go via the chat system , i got appologises but no explanation to why they failed to collect , was offered free upgrade to tnt , to collect next_day , even_though i mentioned the bad_reviews on google i was told ' it was one of our best courier services ' i should of gone with my gut instant despite this i took the upgrade .
2	was excellent and really good value for money .
0	flowers are posted in a nice box , which is perfect to transport flowers and keeping them from getting damaged .
0	mazuma is not always the best price given by these recycling_companies , but i continue to use them because the service is so great :-)
0	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating the phone had been processed .
0	i contacted iflorist , first online ( they refused to give me a refund ) and then by phone , where they requested a picture of the flowers .
2	i had used them before but not for several_years , their service however is even better_than before , and i didn_'_t think that was possible !
2	this company was recommended to me by northern angling supplies who use the service regularly .
2	post_office attempted delivery 0 day late despite the order code being for local_florist delivery .
2	great price and packed with so much bubble_wrap there must now be a shortage in hong_kong .
2	thank_you not mazumba !
0	fantastic customer_service and very fast delivery
2	pls try sunglasses_shop for all your designer_glasses , prices are affordable , and customer service is te best i '_ve seen in years .
2	the process of putting my prescription into their site was very easy .
2	i am a new customer and the service i got was excellent .
0	i am guessing they are receiving alot of calls from disgruntled_customers this morning .
0	this has been going on for two_weeks now i has to be picked_up today !!!!!
0	i need never have worried , they look better_than the real thing and will now be a lasting memory !
0	the website was easy to use , and felt secure - the option of adding a personalised message to the cute cards is a very nice_touch too .
0	many_thanks
0	reliable service to use , easy and efficient .
2	london
0	to this point nothing has being delivered , despite this morning it saying on the tracking link that there was a failed delivery attempt at 00 : 00 on the 00th which is incorrect as i had been in up until 0pm waiting vigilantly for the doorbell and the subsequent delivery .
0	i have copies of the chat transcripts and am making a complaint .
0	i complained and was told friday will be next pickup .
0	rubbish company that are out to make money at the expense of customers .
2	a very well thought out service .
0	there are so little sites out there that actually sell stylish asian clothing .
2	as a 00k parcel to send via the post_office was almost £_00 i decided to try parcel0go and were able to find yodel who collected the box and delivered with extra insurance for just over £_00 .
0	i emailed customer_services about this and they haven ' t even bothered to reply .
2	it ; s easy , you get a choice of good value services with collection or drop_off options .
2	so all in all , they were very helpful , patient and knew what they were doing .

0	very disappointed - i wish i read the reviews before ordering !
0	ordered flowers for delivery 00 / 00 / 00 was told up to 0pm , was given a tracking_number which did not work so contacted iflorist to be told " i request you to kindly allow us time " this was on online_chat .
0	higher recommended .
2	good website , good support , good delivery
0	the paid the most , really quick and and efficent , and kept there word on the value .
0	bought a camera and accessories .
2	i was very happy with the service i received , andbinwoud defiantly reccomend them ,
0	flowers were not delivered and customers services fail to get back to you .
0	no_complaints what so ever .
0	she took a day off work in order to receive her gift , now she has to live with the fact that she only has 00 more days of holiday for the rest of the year .
0	excellent product , chosen with the help of the extensive reviews shown on the site and proven to be every bit as good as they had been touted to be .
0	even better when you think about the fact that the phone was just sitting on a shelf and now someone_else is getting to use it !
2	the process of ordering the flowers was great and as you can imagine being so far away i was a bit unsure if all would be ok .
2	will not be using again and recommend avoiding if you need a reliable service .
0	standby and on .
2	you do have a choice of several couriers so you can chose the best one for you , after that it `_s dead easy , it took just 00_hrs for my daughter in southern ireland to receive her christmas_presents .
0	luke at diamondgeezer was brilliant at helping me sort out the purchase of the ring from many miles_away .
0	her language was friendly and not condesending like most so it was a real breath of fresh_air .
2	it was so embarrassing .
2	excellent , fast , efficient service .
2	i have used envirofone many_times never had any_problems straightforward they name the price for your old phone send the envelope and a couple of days_later you recieve your payment i recommend this company highly
2	they are an excellent company to buy from .
0	i know where to come next time i need flowers delivered !
0	?
2	i have used mazuma a few_times now and would highly_recommend them .
0	i popped on the website talked to samantha in live support and she helped_me with a quote a third of the price i would have paid in the post_office !
0	so far so good i had easy use of the website and a wide_variety of choices along with very reasonable prices .
0	also if anyone knows_how to report them to trading_standards could they please inform me .
0	just a precision i am living above a business opened since 00 am with 0 double door open of course with my staff working inside .
2	it '_s a useful option for the occasional parcel though and i like the ability to see the different carriers options and rates .
0	we are both extremely happy and thank_you again for your help !
0	very pleased with the service and i will_continue to use many more times !
2	will definatly keep you on my list of contacts .
0	the payment came through as they said .
0	the first time i sent three packages abroad .
2	i telephoned eflorist . co . uk to confirm that they could deliver flowers to the area where my mother lives ( a medium_sized village , close to several large towns in central scotland ).
0	obviously no call back .
0	my experience with parcel 0 go was extremely good !
2	the suggested vase was the right proportions to go with the bouquet , and easy to grip because of the contoured shape .
2	no dramas whatsoever .
0	i asked for a premium bouquet of greater value to be sent as compensation .
0	the cheque came really quicklt even through all the disruption of the snow .
2	there are regular_updates and whilst i have been unable to speak to the recipient i am sure the flowers were as advertised .
2	the glasses arrived in good time and are just fine .
0	ordered packaging on saturday evening , received on tuesday and sent phone same day and funds were in my account on a wednesday .
0	used to use a different supplier but that is likely to change now .
2	great service and live_chat so easy and informative .
2	very disappointed .
0	isn ' t it ?
2	i posted my mobile on the tuesday by royal_mail special delivery and the money was in my account on the wednesday .
0	lol
0	great service too .
2	good service , fast dispatch , i would use again .
2	thank_you so much you made friend smile even if she did blubber lol
0	flowers in general were fine - some wilting on the edges .
2	within a week of first going onto the website the money was in my bank !
2	long may your service continue .
2	big shout out to the guys and girls in the restaurant , yummy food and smiley service .
2	they tried to deliver on thursday but the flowers were damaged so they returned them to the depot .
0	as a result , they went to the neighbour .
0	subsequently i came onto this site and saw all the scary negative_reviews !
0	when questioned about this a miracle happened !
2	very quick delivery , well_packaged and , best of all , competitive_prices .
0	i could ' nt have asked for better .
2	i have used parcel0go for a while now and always had excellent service .
0	started a chat with catherine on live_chat and she helped_me through the whole_process , double_checked everything and pointed_out a cheaper option too .
0	in the times they havent and someone_else has , i tend to avoid the other_companies as i have had lots of issues with them in the past , interparcel is a simple tranaction everytime .
0	couldn ' t ask for more .
0	peter owen : i will make my request in writing as i don ' t believe this response is appropriate .
2	parcel collected from home on monday and delivered to kyoto on friday , even the post in the uk can take longer .
2	after that click buy send your prescription by email because i couldn_'_t read mine .
2	on receiving my mobiles they confirmed by email and i received the cheque the next_day !
0	!
2	i can '_t comment about any other services other than ups as i '_ve learned the hard way that ups are the most consistent and professional of the courier firms : we wouldn_'_t trust our valuable and delicate shipments to any other others now .
2	my husband bought me the ring for our pearl wedding_anniversary and when ii opened the box , i gasped , the quality of the diamonds are stunning so sparkly and the ring is exactly_what i wanted to specifically match my engagement_ring it is perfect in every way i am so thrilled to receive such a lovely gift and will take great pride when wearing it .
0	estimated_delivery was friday - sat and les arrived 0 days early on the wednesday to my delight !
0	was absolutely overwhelmed by how helpful they all were !!
2	we had to return a carpet sample to switzerland from the uk within a tight timeframe and looked for a reliable but cost_effective solution .
2	i was having problems with printing of labels for a parcel to send to co antrim , northern_ireland .
0	very happy and will be getting all my future flowers from them .
2	this process could not have been simpler or quicker and i would not_hesitate to use mazuma in the future
2	when i asked the sales_department where it was , i was told it was on a ' next_day ' delivery and i could expect it around 00 : 00 and they couldn_'_t do anything to help except apologise .

0	i ' d also used these people in december for gerberas to my girlfriend .
0	the 00th of june i did order a product from iflorist to be delivered 0th of july .
2	i ordered flowers , a vase and teddy_bear for my friend who had recently given birth to a baby daughter .
2	tried to contact iflorist for support and they wouldnt even respond , had to raise a claim with paypal but that still doesnt cover the fact that the gift was ruined .
2	usa .
0	friendly , quick , responsive staff and excellent product .
0	couldn ' t of asked for a better service , catherine_corless was pleasure to talk to :)
2	they are obviously picked and packed with care and i have had nothing but positive_feedback from my recipients .
0	the live_chat_function is excellent especially if you get through to catherine !
2	package very well_wrapped indeed !
0	?
2	there was an offer for a bouquet of 00 pieces and i ordered them together with a card with a personalized greeting from us – her family .
0	price was and is phenomenal .
2	the story does not end here though .
0	( i bought sony nex - 0 , btw )
2	the wife opened the box and straight_away noticed that the flowers were wilting . the petals on most were black and the heads drooping .
2	richard
2	i was a bit_dubious after realising this supplier was based in hong_kong .
2	will most definately be using them again .
0	i was disappointed there was no number to call but the online help chat was great .
0	this happened at 00 . 00 and i saw it at 0 . 00 .
0	packaging was in perfect_condition with only one scrape on one side of the box ( as if someone pushed a sharp edge against it , but it really wasn ' t bad .).
2	items very well_packed and a speedy service from germany , with tracking_number , the last order i received within two days .
0	completed all required info on website .
0	would defo use this company again if needed .

2	i could not believe the speed of delivery .
0	spoke to a person called remi and he really helped_me out with a refund that i needed due to a bad customer .
2	faultless service .
2	had a parcel to go to north yorkshire , so contacted interparcel and setup online was collected next_day and delivered day 0 this was great considering the bad_weather during march
0	absolutley amazing :)
2	absolutely painless and quick .
2	i am now in the claims_procedure but they do not acknowledge any message !!!!!
2	i used creative_audio ( audio_express ) recently to purchase a high end home_cinema system .
2	great .
0	ordered online but didn ' t ask for express delivery which i wanted ( my fault )
2	mike g
0	used it to buy my wifes engagement_ring 0 0 / 0 years_ago .
0	no response to emails received .
0	thanks .
0	i could have made a little more money on ebay , but removing all the hassle , stress and liability was defiantly worth it .
2	suggest blue elephants should be used all the time as it was a total success for my newborn grandson !
0	thanks
0	my wonderful new headphones arrived the next_day !
0	there ' s really no point in delivering the flowers now as mother ' s day is nearly over !
0	if your phone is damages like mine was matzuma will give u the best price !
2	i have used this company on several_occasions , and find the service to be excellent , flexible options for delivery , and great prices too !
0	i had no clue just how easy it would be to change a very important delivery i had scheduled for an item belonging to queen elizabeth ii ' s house of staff which needed to be sent to a different address for an engagement her majesty has this coming week .
2	how quickly you manage to make a mountain out of a mole hill and lose every bit of respect i had for them .
2	!
2	it would make more sense to market the active extension hub with the psu included as it doesn_'_t make a whole lot of sense buying the hub without the psu .
2	buying my sunglasses was the most painless bit of online shopping that i have ever done .
2	they always offer a fair price and pay out promptly .
2	there is nowhere to state the damage when the order is place so i was expecting a reduced offer when the phones were received ( this has happened to me with other_companies ).
0	i have used parcel0go on many occasions .
2	i '_ve now had a nikon_d0000 and 0 lenses , and a sony rx000 , all on separate_occasions over the past 00 months from digital_rev , and on all occasions received a very quick and efficient delivery service where tracking was continually provided , the first item particularly , ordered on saturday and delivered on monday !
2	wonderfully fantastic company to deal with , bought a 000w speaker for £_00 . 00 , and was very surprised on how good it sounded and the delivery was very quick .
0	been trying to get a parcel picked_up for a whole week now and they still_haven ' t gotten around to doing it .
2	my son ordered the original for mothers_day , from where he lives in new_york .
2	what a great company to do_business with , still can '_t quite believe it was that easy .
2	previously i had dealt_with another well_known enviromental phone company and the process had taken well over a month . from now on it is mazuma all the way .
0	she was very helpfull , pleasant
2	emily introduced herself and answered my query really quickly and so much_better_than anything on the actuall tracking page .
0	we are now 0 days since i contacted interparcel and we still have had no contact from interparcel and still have no_idea where the item is .
0	another unhappy customer .
0	i wasn ' t even notified in any way that the delivery wouldn ' t be happening , i only found out now at 00pm that nothing had arrived .
2	would be very happy to recommend to friends & family .
0	it had free awesome postage !!
2	parcel0go : would you like me to re - book this for tomorrow for you ?
0	i submitted all that i needed to i . e .
2	good value for money and a very simple system to use .
2	it '_s easy to use , fast and a very efficient service .
0	however doing it privately i was amazed by all the different options you have .
0	i ordered flowers for a relative in new_zealand as a present to be delivered on 0nd september .
0	surely ?
0	i would very highly_recommend this website to anyone_wishing to save some money on photographic / cinematic products , as i saved around £_000 -£_000 myself .
2	!
2	i told you that i had bought the best costume and it is better quality than the other elf here .
2	mazuma made selling my old_mobile so easy and they paid me quickly too
2	not only that but it was insured & traceable on line .
0	still_haven ' t cashed the cheque but i would refer mazuma to anyone . btw all this took no more_than 0 days .
2	the lower payment only insures up to £_00 , which i couldn_'_t risk as the phone goes through the system in massively advertised mazuma bag .
0	i ' ve heard_nothing at all from them .
0	top_notch !
0	once i returned my phone it got processed really quick in terms of testing and i was kept_updated_throughout the process .
2	she loved them
2	and then .
2	i must_admit i was very sceptical & was expecting some lame_excuse to devalue the iphone 0g i sent them !
0	first place i come when looking for sunglasses :_d
0	the assistant on the phone was helpful , but was only able to offer a refund ( which she then said she couldn ' t process herself ) they advised me this would take 0 - 0 days for another dept to look_into , and could offer no explanation as to why i ' d not been contacted .
2	thanks for the great fast service , will come back in 0 years time :_o )
0	i am extremely impressed , and will be using them for my custom wedding_band .
2	the date i ordered for was today 00th_dec but she rang me i ' m 0th_dec to say thank_you .
0	i wish all were as professional and efficient as this one .
2	webtogs provide a 00 day no hassle return policy but here was i at 00 days down the line .
0	it was my first time having flowers delivered as i ' ve heard a few bad_experiences so have avoided it but as a last_minute birthday_present to a friend who lives far away i thought i ' d give it a go .
0	please don ' t use them - its not worth the hassle , nerves and hours spent on the phone trying to contact them . you are gonna waste your money not to mention that you exposing your card_details to scammers .
0	very helpful . the box arrived had my headphones packed properly .
0	do not purchase from this company unless you are certain what you will recieve .
0	totally useless .
0	there is no customer_service phone number , and the mail administrator returned all my emails .
0	!
2	tuesday '_s same day delivery still wasn_'_t delivered by friday & absolutely no acknowledgement on their part .
2	to be able to order flowers in the evening and have them delivered next_day is a brilliant service .
0	my experience using mazumamobile stands out as being one of the smoothest business transactions i have ever_encountered .
2	best prices and excellent service as always
0	however , i was put through to a lovely_lady named sammie_taylor who was very apologetic and went out of her way to help me .

0	i decided i wanted to re - design a few of the features on the engagement_ring i had chosen from their website and spent what seemed like hours on the phone to my customer_services advisor ( the same chap each time - tian smith ).
0	a real_shame

0	we purchased my engagement_ring and my husband ' s wedding_ring from diamond_geezer .
0	overall i couldn ' t have been any happier , i got exactly_what i was looking for with great value for money , delivered staight to my door as promised and in perfect_condition with courteous , accurate and straightforward service .

0	gives you options to choose which company you want to go with , which service and also tells you the ones you need a printer for and the ones you don ' t !

2	the " help " chat line appears to be ok but just gives platitudes , and any hint of a complaint gets immediately passed to a " manager " who gives the same platitudes .
0	but this has been one of the worst experiences of my life .

2	i spoke to a catherine who knew what she was talking_about and extremeley helpful .
0	all in all a great shopping_experience .
0	keep up the wonderful work
0	overall , i am quite happy with it !
0	dhl skulle eftersigende havde forsøgt leveret en_pakke på_min bopæl i dag .
0	i got emails throughout the process to let me know what stage it was at , and when i received the email to say payment was being made by bacs , the money went into my account that day .
0	this caused me a great deal of embarrassment that my aunt couldn ' t even receive her_birthday_present .
2	and the flowers are beautiful and fresh .
0	my ca katie , was brilliant and very helpful resolving my issues .
2	used collect_+ standard signature service - very easy online booking , fast and efficient service with online tracking and sms delivery confirmation .
0	it ' s like top gear . for photography fans .

0	thanks again !
0	they also know what you want which is most_important .
2	i ordered in the morning a a lovely bouquet was derived soon after .
0	the picture on the net didn ' t do them justice , the flowers were magnificent !
2	buckinghamshire .
2	bought and shipped within 00_hours , received day before world book day would definitely recommend to friends and use again
2	the so - called fairytale love grandissimo was a grand rip - off .
2	fast response , continuing communication and payment exactly as promised .
2	the advice is to send any valuable phones by signed for delivery to give peace of mind should it be lost in transit , but in my case i decided to send it the cheapest way as my phone was not worth a lot of money .
0	sammie had exceeded our expectations !
0	few_days go by : telephone call to p0g - explained myself again and as where my parcel is as they had found it and when will it arrive . operator : sorry_sir , we do not know where your parcel is . so i ask to speak to a supervisor , operator states i am the supervisor and , there nothing they can do , but email the courier and i get told to wait a few more days !!!!!
2	we have had an_apology however , we are only a small business we cannot_afford for other_peoples failures to cost us money .
0	however i was told that while he wouldn ' t usually do this ( oh sure ) he could send me the bunch i ordered free of charge .
0	the pulp is on the wet side ( again , i ' m aware i have nothing to compare it with ), but still .
2	i would recommend to all my friends !
2	white that '_s all that was ordered for a reason and eflorists picture was a lovely display of white flowers not a picture of blue dried foliage .
0	excellent customer_service .
2	this is my 0rd purchase from digital_rev , others being the ef 000 0 . 0 and the ef 00 0 . 0 .
0	!
0	they took tnt ' s word over my customers and mine basically saying i am lying .
2	i arranged the delivery online , to my daughter in france , at a very good price .
2	if you want to sell any phone mazumamobile is great my first choice the only choice , they are the best go to www . mazumamobile .
2	i have used them several_times and they always deliver
2	parcel0go '_s rates were great , £_00 including vat , for a parcel weighing 00lbs and quite cumbersome .
2	this is the third time i '_ve used mazumba mobile .
2	i cannot find a negative thing to say about them .
0	ordered through money0machines direct on the site , they send me an_email as well as comparemymobile .
0	i have booked a courier to india containing used personnel goods .
2	i would recommend parcel0go and tnt anytime .
0	amazing packaging , super pricing and extra fast !
0	if you see things slightly_cheaper elsewhere don ' t even be tempted - you will not get better service anywhere_else !
2	i had a real problem today with a failed collection .
2	i ordered them online over the christmas_period and they arrived as soon as the postal service was up and running again !
2	it was delivered within 00_hours , was superbly_packaged and terrific value for money .
2	i had an orange phone to recycle and orange themselves pointed me at their own recycling scheme ( run by : regenersis ( glasgow ) limited ) and after_reading the small_print backed from them as soon as my feet could carry me .
0	i was looking for something a little different and the staff were great .
0	my ring is absolutely beautiful , i love it to bits !
0	it ' s gorgeous - works really well and looks the biz .
2	ordered flowers for valentines_day delivery , they arrived a day early .
2	didn_'_t turn_up on wednesday .
2	but if you choose the argos card : you can only use them in store , and not take advatage of on line discounts .
0	!
0	i wouldn ' t hesitate to use them again .
2	yes !
0	they did this and the same day the new courier ( parcel_force ) collected the item !
2	wonderfull , couldn_'_t ask for a better service .
2	as well as to submit pictures of the missing item ( i had a spare otherwise that would have been impossible too !)
2	customer service included email_updates on the progress of my order and an invite to track this on the website , all very useful and easy to use .
2	update !
2	delivery is prompt and communication is spot on .
0	she had also bought flowers for her mother for mother ' s day , again awful bouquet .
0	i had to re - schedule a collection date for a parcel and the support offered by the chat operator ( lauren_w ) was really helpful .
2	not delivering what ism ordered .

2	i received the original bouquet on 00 jan !
0	thanks , david
2	i raised a support ticket .
2	for help with a parcel .
0	i would advise against using them at all costs .
2	i was anticipating a bit of a delay in getting the camera i ordered - how wrong was i ??
0	i ' m convinced that they hired superman for the deliveries !
0	will certainly be back when it is time for wedding_rings .
2	will defiantly_use again
0	delivered quickly and had an_email to advise of planned despatch .
2	installed it the next_day , works well .
0	the irony is that i ' m having a meeting with a ups rep to talk about a deal for transporting fragile high value goods for my company .
0	whilst they use courier companies parcel0go seem to have no control over their suppliers , and when they try to resolve an issue with a courier company that they use , the courier company often ignores them .
0	brilliant !
2	i ' m pleased with the service , very easy to order and updates on delivery and tracking .
2	sent them my blackberry 0000 curve with an estimate of £_00 .
2	i have used interparcel many many_times for all my large ebay deliveries , i only use the ups service and therefore get a great service
2	after searching the web for a pair of headphones , i called hifi_headphones with a specific query .
2	the service that was provided was excelent , logged on thurs , my letter and envelope arrived the very next_day , and the money was transfered into my bank_account on the wed . could ' nt ask for better will_certainly be using your service again in the future and would highly_recomend you , thanks again .
0	avoid this company as it ' s completely unreliable !
0	the costume still looked great and survived a weekend of travelling , photographs and re - enactments .
0	more like they had a load of roses left over !
2	have you seen those macinasacs around ?
0	one extra note , if you google iflorist fake_reviews you can unearth some very interesting info on how iflorist illegally maintains higher average reviews while providing such poor quality services .
2	mazuma keep you informed every_step of the way and the turn_around time for the cash is excellent .
2	thank_you .
2	also delivery was within an_hour_window which was pretty impressive .
0	they also offer a great discount scheme - the more you use the more discount you receive .
0	also was pleased with seller communication and speed of delivery !
2	got exactly_what i wanted in the time they promised - will use again
2	i will never use this company again .
0	thanks for your help highly appreciated !
0	that was the last message i sent to them on that day 00 / 0 .
0	thank_you for such great service !
0	0 .
2	great access and superb response .
0	they should maybe remove the option to order " standard ( as pictured )" if it ' s not going to be .
0	added to this , there was no flower feed included .
2	i trust them , can speak to them and know i will not be conned .
2	this service was exceptional by any standard and i recommend them to everyone .
0	in fact , i ' m going to look now and see what else i can get .
0	she_loves the unusual shape , knowing that very few women have a ring like her ' s makes it even more special .
0	sent my phone next_day delivery , which the received and processed and sent the cheque all within a few hours .
2	the service was impeccable - even out here on the isle of arran . the information they provide on products is extremely_helpful ; it has enabled_me to make a purchase that otherwise i would have been doubtful about .
2	customer service is absolutely awful and i would never use again .
0	thanks to hannah , and in her absence luke , for their help , efficiency and reassurance during the not so long process .
2	i found the whole_process easy and i was very happy with the speed and quality of the service .

0	- great products
2	i love their items
2	option to have the money sent in a cheque if preferred .
0	my mo is gonna be insane with joy wen she sees da bunch i got her for mo ' s day as iflorist don ' t f about wen it comes to creatin the buffest bunches
2	needed to cancel a parcel .

2	they delivered promptly and the flowers were beautiful .
2	!.
0	overseas shipping is very fast .
2	cheque arrived tuesday .
2	i ' m_glad i didn_'_t pay more for the larger bunch as i wouldn_'_t want to give this company any of my money .
2	the service was first_class and i would recomend it to any one .
0	i have now sent 0 emails complaining and not had a reply off 0 yet .
0	i could have got more with another provider , but it was only £ 0 and considering the payment would have been in cheque form and then it was dependent on the condition of the phone - mazuma was a safer bet .
2	!
0	thankyou !
2	these were for a birthday_present so i haven , t seen them but have been told by the recipient that they were beautiful , so smiles all_round !
2	sammie_taylor was very helpful and charming in helping me to solve my problem .
2	we shall supply the services to you using reasonable care and skill .
2	the ordering_process was easy on ebay , the wait and delivery was super , hardly any wait at all considering it was ordered over christmas , i could track it '_s progress with the tracking option so i followed it all the way , very good indeed
0	whole_process completed within three days including receiving the money into my account .
2	then i found serenata_flowers and i can_honestly say they are the best .
2	you can track the parcel on the website from the shop to main hub then on to delivery van and finally you can see when it '_s been delivered .
0	i found the service online quick and easy to use , and once i had sent the phone away i received the money ( full_amount as valued ) very quickly .
2	regular_updates from order to bouquet leaving the delivery centre to actual delivery at the door .
2	0 .
0	i ' m happy i have a juicer and i guess its better_than not juicing at all .
0	it was just chance that they were actually delivered before 0pm .
2	i am happy .
2	they don_'_t give a fiddlers fart once they have your money , 00_minutes and no answer from them on the phone .
2	many_thanks to the digitalrev team .
0	they need to improve their customer_service and email response time .
0	will_definitely be using again an be recommending their service .
0	the wonder woman outfit is flattering , and came very quickly however the gold detailed wing in the middle is not gold it ' s yellow , so the image is slightly deceiving .
2	a very dodgy company , indeed !
2	tuesday i come home early and call them at 00 : 00 but office closed despite saying 00 : 00 closure onsite .
0	go for interparcel economy - cheap service and usually next_day , and they pick_up from your door , well worth it imo .
2	a * service , a * staff , what more can i say ?
2	michael jay
0	they agreed to send them today , so to tell me the night before that they were going back on that promise is ridiculous .
2	they lost my parcel , but didn_'_t know they had !
2	delivery progress updates reassuring .
2	this company have , through my last 00 orders , as my headline suggests .
2	the wedding btw was superb :)
2	great deal and very quick payment .
0	someone shall be with you shortly .
0	i can only guess that this means i am not alone in my disappointment as they probably have a backup of complaints extending a mile long .
0	my engagment ring needed re - sizing but this was done beautifully and was back on my finger in 00_hours .
2	update - 0 april - today i received , totally out of the blue , an_email_saying that they were processing a refund for the failed order .
2	excellent service , cannot_fault .
2	i am now waiting to hear that the outstanding two parcels have met the same fate .
0	highly_recommended :) *****
2	they are un - contactable on the phone ( automated messages all day monday ), they do not reply to emails , their 00 hour customer service online is offline 00 / 0
0	i contacted them in chat , which i have to say that are kind and helpful and they gave an_email where i could raise my complain .
0	further i haven ' t incurred any customs_charges what so ever , which is great .
0	she and parcel0go have my recommendation .
0	i received my lens through the post after 0 days of ordering it , very good service and would definitely use digital_rev again in the future !
2	i had a problem with my parcel not being taken for delivery today , so all i did was follow the link on the web_page and within_seconds my problem was being dealt_with by catherine_corless , one of the operators .
2	oh , and finally . envirofone quickly notified me that my phone had been received and that it was ready to be assessed , then within a day they said it was fine and funds would be transferred ( which they were ).
0	so all i ask was a simple change of delivery address . after moaning far more_than i had to go get it changed i then recieve a tx message at 0 : 00 saying the flowers was unable to be delivered since no one was in to collect them .
2	others choose for you .
0	i really wish i had seen the other reviews before purchasing .
0	this is my first and probably the last time when using their services .
0	but they say 0 weeks the value is guaranteed !
0	i had to use the online_chat the two guys on there jon and adam sorted the problem out very quickly and saved me a load of stress and problems .
0	fantastic youtube digitalrevtv channel .
0	ring up p0g ( now thinking about my telephone bill ) - speak to an adviser - they state ." sorry , i see what that claim team have done here , they have not investigated it and closed it as you have received parcel " a "!!!
0	0 weeks_later my parcel is stuck in kenya - don ; t know where as interparcel will not respond with anything other than ' we cannot assist you any further ' - customs are charging more_than the value of the parcel , so the collector does not want it !
0	thank_you
0	!
0	i was rather pleased with the service provided almost_immediately after i had made the booking i got a call that sorted out any_issues i had within_seconds and the pickup was fast and friendly =) aswell as i contacted the support staff because i was worried_about if nobody was there to recive the parcel and within 00 seconds i was connected to louise =) louise was a really nice person and fixed my worry within_seconds and to be honest i kind of wanted to keep talking because of how friendly louise was i am definately please with parcel0go and if i ever need to send more stuff im choosing parcel0go again =)
2	i applied for my daughters old_phones to be sent and i was surprised when she rang me the next_morning to say a box had arrived from mazuma .

0	the prices are just right , the customer_service was faultless and the fact that i didn ' t have to endure lengthy phone conversations with call_centre staff made my transaction painless and quite simply , a joy .

0	when i was looking for it i was rudely turned away .
0	keep up the good work and thank_you !
2	previous experience with lindy has_been the same .
2	used it a couple of times and never had any issue .
0	the only reason i think they did this is because i said that if they were not going to reply to my messages that i would have to contact my bank / cab .
0	thankfully , i received very timely and helpful support from one of the staff_members - jo - who helped_me clear up all queries regarding my shipping both within the uk and continental europe .
2	already written to complain , but nothing yet .
2	parcel 0 go will not return what i paid
2	i was very upset to find out how much my mum and husband had spent on them and would rather have a £ 0 bunch from tesco !
2	the item ( hot_water boiler , i ' m using it to warm milk for calfs !)
2	i have ordered from dobies before , so logged in to place an order for seed potatoes , onion sets and seeds from them .
2	!
0	having ordered it on monday , the camera was delivered and in my hand by thursday_afternoon !

0	from ' man - draw ' to cash = 0 days !
0	the package flies 00 , 000_miles in 00_hrs and can ' t make the last 00 on time .
0	service is a ++++
2	000_% recommendation from me !!!
2	so if the courier arrives he / she will leave 0 behind ?
0	excellent service , received my money in my account within 0 hours of receiving the email_stating they had received my phone .
2	catherine talked me through the booking and even completed the paperwork so all i had to do was pay . really quick and easy .
2	it arrived from hong_kong before lunch on the weds 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	!
2	and the amount of flowers were small for the amount i paid and the time of year .
0	but very happy as the free post bag came quickly and as soon as my phone was received a cheque was sent out the next_day !
0	bottom_line : all the positive_reviews here are people whose package was delivered .
0	my item arrived much sooner_than the predicted delivery date and it was the best price i could find in any shop or website .
2	excellent company to deal with , the item arrived very quickly , and despite not having the adaptor , which , when i notified the company , they responded_immediately and i received it the following_day , so the overall experience with them is first_class .
2	now neither company is willing to accept_responsibility for this despite explaining to city_link and interparcel about my illness and forwarding on to them the reasons .
2	i found locating precisely the models of the two phones i was selling on their easy to use drop - dowm - boxes ,
0	their website is well_laid_out and you can find what you are looking for .
0	i first came_across this website after watching a youtube video that said hifiheadphones was the best company in the uk for headphones and earphones .
2	waist band does not fold and pinch , comfort is great and designs are just great .
2	all in all a very frustrating 0 days and complete_waste of time .
2	just magic what can i say .
0	was easy to use and very competitive_prices .
2	it is a birthday_present for my husband who will shortly be 00 .
2	0 star . perfect lady .
2	my first time trading in an old phone , even_though it was dead i received £_00 which i am more than happy with .
0	wait ?
0	i posted it off and the money was paid straight into my bank_account .
0	excellent service , quick delivery .
2	i am sure there are better companies out there , will keep looking
2	would recommend safercigs to anybody who uses electronic cigarettes .
0	i recommend for everyone who whant to buy cheap quality photograpy gadget !
0	the website was easy to use with clear descriptions as to what services i was purchasing and what the time frames of delivery would be .
2	on arrival these fitted the heel more deeply but were too large so i rang and explained and was asked to send these back .
0	they are half_dead , the leaves are rotten already and i highly doubt those roses are going to get any better if / when they open up .
2	they were not only beautifull but the fact that they were helping such a fantastic cause made them all the more special and i have just ordered some for my special sister - in - law to make her feel special .
0	i have used mazuma for the second time recently and on both_occasions have found the service to be second to none .
2	they really are not bothered . and the cause of the problem . they had not given the courier the full address . on both the friday and tuesday .
0	everytime i call they keep on fobbing me of saying they are waiting for fedex to reply .
0	!
2	nice_touch .
2	everyone should be using them , and leave the outdated , over - priced and god help you if you have to make a claim method well alone !
0	then i had none stop emails 00 per day of junk they say just click the remove link where is there .
0	in reality the entire_process ran very smoothly .
0	couldn ' t be_happier .
2	but that is no way a reflection on ths service you get from the site or people themselves .
2	after having a day of terrible customer service from 0 other_companies and feeling very frustrated , what a refreshing_change to meet someone who_knows what they ' re doing , is speedy and efficient and nothing too much_trouble !
2	many_thanks
2	having been let_down by another online flower provider in the last few_days i am only glad that at_least a bouquet of flowers actually arrived this time .
0	but he does make a majestic return in the film " insidious ".
0	i found it all a bit haphazard and regular .
0	then he gets sliced in half again in the comics .
0	bought my mum some flowers for mothers_day off of this website , big_mistake !
2	i have used this company 0 times now and have been very impressed with both the low_prices for branded goods and the service .
0	very quick effiecient great service , genuinely exceeded my expectations of speed in service / application , a great service !
2	i needed a new pair of oakleys , and this online store carries an extensive_range .
0	lovely flowers delivered on time and kept_informed of their being disatched so i knew_exactly_what was going on .
2	nice people , good service , prompt , and does what it says on the tin .
0	i ordered my system through ebay and my order was processed almost immidiately and by the end of the same day i got my delivery confirmation .
0	i think is really dishonest make people think that you will deliver the flower chosen from your website and then do whatever you like , changing the order , based on factor that are really subjective .
2	it was easy and very helpful and a reasonable range of prices .
2	my brother in law recommended me .
0	my issue was resolved extremely fast with no hassle what so ever .
0	attentive and quick to respond to my queries .
0	i was told that i would get the lens between the 00th and 00th which is a good delivery time anyway considering the package had to be shipped all the way from_hong_kong to london .
0	overall one of the best on line companies i have dealt_with .
2	excellent online easy to follow even for a middle aged woman service exactly as promised envelope arrived next thing you know cash in bank no_problems at all
0	serenata sent me an_email to let me know when the flowers were dispatched and another when they had been delivered .
2	would recommend this service to anyone .
2	the whole_process from getting quote for mobile_phone to money being in my bank_account was 0 days .
0	i phoned the shop to say i was going to be late by 00_mins and they said that they had sold it on line that night !
0	the envelope and instruction pack came earlier_than i thought , and payment is also surprisingly quick and simple .
2	one of the best bouquets i have ever sent .
0	this time i was very happy , catherine_corless ( my very live and very helpful agent ) quickly sorted my problem and got the order booked in for me .
2	i googled courier services and chanced upon parcels0go and what a good chance it was .
0	bought a technical 0000 mk0 from the guys at bopdj , and all i can say is that the customer_service was second to none !!!
2	thanks serenata !
0	one year ' s warranty came as standard .
2	i explained that i wanted to change my order and she actually ran_out to the post that was waiting to go that morning and retrieved my first order and exchanged and updated my order in minutes over the phone .
2	i oredered flowers for valentines_day , when they came they were nothing like the picture including the feature setting being a lot smaller and roses being replaced by carnations , yes roses switched for carnations on valentines_day
0	placed my sell order on wednesday .
2	gosh was really surprised at the fit and material this outfit was made of well_worth the money unbelievable
0	they offer a reasonable_price and seem to always put the customer first .

0	prices are competitive and they are the first website i look at when i need a parcel delivered .
0	if i had questions the chat is very very helpfull and gives correct answers .
2	needless to say that i was very impressed not only with my purchase , but also with the excellent service that i recieved .
2	good quality products , good delivery
0	thank_you envirofone !
0	i didn ' t pay extra for recorded_delivery just used mazuma ' s standard paid postage .
2	most of my customers remark on how quickly their items arrive . the staff are always happy to help if a problem arises ( which isn_'_t very often ). i '_ve been using them for the last 0 years ,& would recommend to anyone , who sends items internationally .
0	i had my envelope within two days and my money two days after that .
2	now i wish i had paid for the extra cover , but i really didn_'_t expect the wheel to get so badly_damaged as it was well_wrapped and boxed up .
0	around 0pm - still noting .
2	i ordered flowers for my friends wedding anniversay , to be told they got there ok but the bouquet is made up of mainly foliage and not all the flowers it said , plus to add to this they are dead after two days , my friend does know how to look after flowers and plants i have tryed phoning the company have sent messages still_waiting
0	order myself a canon_00d with 00mm canon lens , 00gb sd_card plus gift pack .
0	!
0	the transglobal site is undoubtedly one of the best websites i have ever come_across .
0	for anybody wishing to recycle their phone or get some money for an old phone , i would fully recommend using envirofone .
0	no sorry , no " i will chase them ".
0	the next_day i had the return invoice .
2	they gave me a quote so i sent the phones off and to be honest i was ejecting them to email me and say they reviewed their price , but no they honoured the quote and paid my money into my account , the same day !
0	luckily the girl that refunded me seemed slightly more efficient and very apologetic but now i won ' t have my new prescription for a business trip and my new frames for my brothers wedding .
0	i have used serenata_flowers many_times and cannot_fault them .
2	the department is staffed by real people !!
2	the ' customer service ' ( via online_chat which took 00_minutes ) responded with sarcasm when i suggested that a complimentary bouquet was not a satisfactory replacement .
2	they collected and hopefully they will deliver .
2	very good service , a truly significant saving , no false_promises ( e . g .
2	i , like so many other people have been let_down by this useless company .
2	the site is very easy to navigate and you know exactly_what you are going to get for your old phone working or not .
0	one of the most amazing things about this shop and the price as compared to the quality of the products you receive , i bought a the north_face vest , save 00_% of the retail price , received within and few_days and just couldn ' t been happier with it .
2	in the rare cases where parcels get lost / damaged they have provided prompt support and resolved the matter with the minimum_fuss .
2	brilliant
2	00_hours down the line today and some of the roses have already started to droop and wither so i will not be using this service again
2	i have made mistakes with my delivery service .
2	like someone_else , i ordered some flowers for mothers_day which were due for delivery between 00th and 00th .
2	you just have to sit back and wait for the delivery pack to come through the post , which consists of a robust easy - seal plastic envelope and clear_instructions for dispatching your phone .
2	excellent product and good value for money .
0	i made an enquiry about warrany , bearing in mind the company isn ' t based in my country and i received a helpful and polite message that answered all of my questions really quickly .
0	i have heard this sort of thing before , so treated their promise with a certain degree of scepticism .
2	my first order from webtogs and certainly won_'_t be the last .
2	bought a nikon p000 bridging camera . they were cheapest on the net . the camera came in 0 days with a brilliant tracking service . i would definitely_use this company again .
0	it has ruined mother ' s day as i now have an awful looking bunch of flowers ( the complete polar opposite to what i ordered , cheap , tiny , garishly coloured roses ) and no card to present to my mum tomorrow .
2	i had today booked a parcel collection / delivery to my granddaughter in perth australia .
2	everything was right .
2	complete_waste of over £_00 !
2	cannot recommend this company more highly .
2	seemingly it matters not whether they reside in the west country , london or elsewhere , payment is made on day 0 and the sellers are always more than pleased with every_aspect of the deal .
0	i had 0 old_phones which i thought were worthless .
0	a very very unhappy customer
0	the bouquet to my mum was a little late but arrived , and i was able to track them all the way .
0	delivered as promised , cannot_fault them :-)
0	the costume arrived on time and looks very good .
0	i filled in my details on mazuma mobiles webiste o the thursday , the delivery note and envelope arrived the friday_morning .
2	i opted for the argos_vouchers , as you get more money that way , the voucher comes in the form of a credit_card , which you activate by calling the number on the card & its activated for you within 00_hours to use in argos ,
0	digital_rev ' s customer_service was appalling .
2	wish more operatives were like emma .
0	do not order mother ' s day flowers or flowers for any other sort of occasion from iflorist !
0	i only hope city_link can match parcel0go ' s service and efficiency as it would be a real_shame for city_link to let them down at the last hurdle .
0	care to suggest one ???

0	i bought an engagement_ring back in 0000 whilst deployed away with the army .

2	i would have no_hesitation whatsoever in ordering from webtogs in the future .
2	yes , i would buy from this site again .
2	i am_delighted with the service i received from mazuma including the communication along the process which in itself was very quick .
2	it took them 0 weeks to deliver a parcel which should have been delivered in 0 - 0 days .
0	i have no hesitations in reccomending mauma i am extremely pleased with the service which was far_exceeded any expectations !
2	i was advised that my frames were with nikkon being glazed , however nikkon had decided that the lenses were not perfect and rejected them and having to reglaze them .
0	great - nice and simple i thought .
0	peter owen : it states on the website if i ' m not happy with the service then i can apply for a refund .
0	i have used parcel0go for a couple of months now and i have found the service to be great , i especially love the upload option to upload my items from ebay .
0	i chose medium - the bouqet was huge !
0	all questions were quickly answered by emma , will_definitely continue using p0g .
0	of course i went through the skepticle stage of thinking , " this is too good to be true ."
0	went through the website and they offered me £_00 . 00 for my phone i posted the phone , which other than a couple of wear and tear marks was perfect , recorded_delivery wrapped in bubble foam .

0	x
2	the whole_experience was satisfying and each_step was well supported .
2	i think i got ripped_off as on the description i was led to believe that it was a large bouquet this was not the case also i was led to believe that it came in a bag which again it did not .
0	so , on thursday_morning , i went in to different costume shops looking for one and found nothing suitable .
0	da_jeg_er bosat i england har_jeg brugt interflora til bestilling af blomster til min familie ved lejligheder .
2	this is the worst experience you will have if you want to buy flowers .
2	ebay offers collectplus specifically for sellers however looking at the prohibited list of items collect_plus do not cover this seems to be all of the most popular items sent on ebay .
0	a lot of times there has been an error on my part i . e .
0	despite all the negative_reviews and positive_reviews accused as ' robots ', i decided to try and see for myself .
2	on receipt i was informed when my money would be arriving and it duly did .
2	i recently sold my daughters old phone and got a good price for it .
0	again , this angered me as the record that was now sold out was in stock when i purchased it .
2	what a great asset you have !
2	well_done all at serenata and thank_you .
0	a few day ago i was rather busy and incorrectly typed in my email ( my own fault ) and lost the tracking_number , even_though it was quite hard to find out how to contact p0g as soon as i did sam was a pleasure !
2	like one of the other reviews you will now be my first stop shop .
2	prompt delivery of items ( only 0 days ) the company kept me informed as to the status of my order .
2	the margin on books is generally wafer thin , so a saving of £ 0 . 00 is huge .
0	!
2	the lovely lucy was helpful and polite and a pleasure to deal with .
0	a after a quick call my bank lifted the block a and payment went through .
2	the service seems to produce the cheapest available quotes every time and then once booked it emails forms etc for labelling up the parcel .
0	difficult company to communicate with , contradictory information given when trying to re - arrange delivery .
2	* contact parcel0go on their facebook live_chat site & cancel the order .
2	i sent a bunch of flowers to my sis - in - law who is not well at the moment , and asked for eflorist to make them as bright and beautiful as possible .

0	customer_service was closed over the weekend and there was no way to track my order until the following_monday when i found out that the delivery person attempted to deliver but it did not find the address , and did not even attempt to call me . if i was notified i could have got my flowers somewhere_else instead of looking like an empty_handed fool .
2	i also opted for free delivery as i wasn_'_t in a huge rush for them , but they arrived within a few_days , a lot sooner_than i expected .
0	the whole range of products that they supply have served me well over the years .
2	i would not_hesitate to recomend hifiheadphones to anyone and i would use them again .
0	i entered all details and got a fantastic price , best price i found on the net actually .
0	my parcel come and pick_up my delivery at a location convenient to me , i trust them with my most_important parcels !
2	i was very pleased with my purchase from longacres garden_centre .

2	they don_'_t respond to e_- mails placed on their own site and ones sent from your_own computer , and then they block your password so you cannot get into your account .
2	package arrived very quickly & beautifully_wrapped .

0	navigating the site was easy , ordering just the same , had order confirmation and tracking sent to my e_- mail as stated .
2	great products and service .
2	all went well fast delivery would use again many_thanks
2	today i asked for a full_refund .
0	i was a bit_worried_about sending my mobile off , so i thought i would use mazuma_mobile because they seem to have a lot of adverts on the tv so i thought they must be a good company !
0	i was extremily happy with the call .
0	they are extremely comfortable and breathable !!
2	all the receipts were provided as requested then i was told that i had to contact my customer to ask them to phone ups to tell them that they hadn_'_t received a parcel .
2	i have used most of the popular online shops for glasses and these stand out as the best so far and i will_definitely keep going back for replacements when required .
2	got good assistance from daniel with my order .
0	basicly if your parcel nat delivered you dont know when its going to be ?
0	get paid same day .

2	when my daughter arrived home from work after a stressful day she was greeted with the magnificent bouquet flowers and vase .
2	i intend to persevere to the end with this company as a matter of principle , they must not be allowed to get away with getting money out of vulnerable people .
2	its nice not to be disappointed for once .
0	i was offered to settle for a replacement product which i was completely unhappy about , given the occurrence .
0	wow so so simple thank_you !!!

0	:)
2	thankyou .
2	so be careful if you want to send item with them make_sure to read ” collect_plus ” term & condition before send items , and make_sure their term condition very tricky which is some how covers everything to not pay compensation and to make you wrong ?
2	i can definitely recommend them wholeheartedly .
2	thank_you .
2	so basically the chat assistant ( 0th one i got through to ) has said that is is not a guaranteed service on a saturday - what the heck ??????
0	i was struggling with working out how i should send my parcels and clicked on the link to chat to operator .
2	the packaging they sent work as it said it would .
0	at first , i was not completely convinced to buy from digitalrev , as they were based in hong_kong ( china ), however being a fan on their youtube_channel for a while now , and also seeing that others were faithfully investing thousands of £££ on this website , i purchased my first dslr .
2	i will definetely buy more brushes from crownbrush for myself and for gifts and i will highly_recommend crownbrush to my friends - the prices are amazing and the quality is great !!
2	we are a joiners shop mainly selling on line so rely_on couriers after no success booking with our regular provider , i stumbled on parcel to go booked a same day pick_up and next_day delivery on a large item at a great price , as i was having trouble doing it online , i rang them up , yes you heard it they actually have a phone number with real people on the other end .
0	i bought re - chargeable duracell batteries with a charger so the cost savings are obvious .

2	don_'_t forget if you can '_t get a deal with this hi_fi shop , try another , eventually , be patient , you will get a good deal . some hi_fi shop are for customers and business , some don_'_t , if they don_'_t , they will end up like comet .

2	the assortment was v well received and ( she '_s a gardener ) some she didn_'_t even know !
2	i cannot possibly tell the sender how awful the flowers were .
2	if you do get stuck ( i needed a refund for a collection that didn_'_t happen ) the online_chat_facility works very well - andrea had me sorted_out without_any fuss or bother in no time at all .
0	i found some really lovely designers on avenue 00 with some items i hadn ' t seen elsewhere , and at excellent prices .

0	bought an engagement_ring last_year on the recommendation of a friend who had bought his engagement and wedding_rings from diamondgeezer .
2	the same process as i used before , posted special delivery paid around a fiver , arrived next_day with cash in my bank a couple of hours_later .
0	having found the ring , and a good quality diamond , i looked at the price expecting to have to give up on the search , and i was so shocked how it was so cheap .
0	i don ' t know how it got here so fast !
2	my three " kids " clubbed together last_year to buy me a birthday_present of a new pair of keen walking_boots to replace the well worn pair that i had already .
0	i run a webstore so delivery is pretty key to my business .
2	i have since used another online compnay and the glasses arrived in 0 days - much_better .
2	!
2	however , my aunt called me on 00 / 0 to thank me for the flowers and when i asked about the chocolates and champagne she was v surprised and said she didn_'_t get those , just the flowers .
0	the offer value money and transfer payment very quickly .
0	they had a lot of foam around the box to make_sure that it wasn ' t damaged even if it fell off the truck !
0	i had a problem with the label i had printed , the weight was incorrect , having printed the label i realised it was more_than what i had initially entered on the details , i spoke to samantha using the live_chat and the problem was corrected at no additional_costs .
0	however , as this was now a friday_morning the collection could not be rearranged until the following_monday .
2	posted messages to the company on twitter and facebook but again no reply !
2	a fair price given and paid by bac '_s .

0	after asking for a day off at work and been waiting for the whole day at home no one came to collect my parcel .
2	reliable and prompt service .
2	that said , once the order was eventually received on time - the recipient was delighted .
0	since i was paying a premium for the service of delivering flowers on a specific date - the value of th flowers being much less_than the price i paid - i complained .
2	i would give no stars at all .
2	a fantastic way to sell on your old phone .
0	with dispatching an average 00 - 00 parcels a week , they are a very helpful tool for a small business .
2	shipping per se was actually quite fast ( 0 days to austria ), but it took 00 business days for them to even get the frames for fitting the lenses , then another 0 days before the order was shipped .
2	highly_recommended .
2	' spoke ' with sarah on live_chat and once again have had a great response to solve a problem with an order , no fault of p0g but speedily sorted , thankyou

2	great headphones
0	thanks !
2	good fast service and at a good price was pickup on time
0	the only thing i would say is crown is more labelling on the brushes or even just the lil sleeves they come in just a general number incase one gets lost needs replacing etc but apart_from that fab fab fab !
0	all the while the parcel is being charged a storage fee and if it isn ' t collected will be retunred to me at my cost . and interparcel are trying to wash thier hands of the whole matter no help at all !

0	you can talk to these_guys on live_chat which saves time and money .
2	the flowers have always arrived on time and when my sister got her '_s there was a note stating that although the flowers were in bud they would open in 00_hours allowing time to fully appreciate the flowers .
0	today i receive an_email from them suggesting that they may not have managed to resolve my query .
2	i was connected to sarah_hayes on chat now and within minutes we had everything sorted and the parcel routed .
0	so i told the buyer and asked if she is able to get to belfast but she said its more_than an_hour ' s drive away , so not really easy for her with her 0 young children in tow .
2	i do not like the fact that you can only email when something_goes_wrong and it '_s not because of something you have done .
0	excellent service , really good !!!!!!!!
2	the very best part about the company is their out of hours service .
2	she said the flowers were absolutely_beautiful , for me easy website , great choice of prices and speedy checkout and the to be kept_informed by text / email every_step of the way right up to an including delivery 0 * company .
2	sit around for maybe a week ?

0	0 ) after sales service regarding my complaint with them is poor , currently four days since i submitted a complaint and not had a response .

2	just can '_t fault this company .
0	very very very unhappy and disgusted with the poor service .

0	loads of epic designs to choose from aswell
2	i will be using your company again .
0	i managed to get it working and am successfully communicating with my wifiplug , but not before spending about 00_hours reverse - engineering the sample code and java library ( complete with comments in * chinese *) given to actually glean some useful_information .
2	but i have to say evverything about this company is first_class the service was quick efficent and i got a bit of cash just before_christmas which is very welcome !
2	what a start ,,,,, anyway upon return home i contacted the support_team at hifi_tower namely peter , who i must be honest could not appologize enough , he said that he would email return labels , which did not arrive , so i contacted them again this time spoke to rory who then sent the labels for me to return them to germany , rory then talked about the speakers saying that they really dont get that much problem with them anyway we decided that we should upgrade them from 00 " to 00 " speaker cabs as these are more manly , the moral of this little essay is you will not find any other company with such a positive attitude_towards thier customers than hifi_tower .
2	the eye shadow brushes , especially the tapered one , are fabulous and do what they are supposed to do with ease and great quality .
0	thanks to richard i made an error on the address he corrected it within minuits and sent me the right labels . cheers parcels0go :-)

2	i went on eflorist '_s live_chat and johnathan contacted the florist , cancelled the order and issued a full_refund .
0	she ' s sorted it all out for me and made everything easy for me .
0	anyway , they told me i needed to speak to dhl , ok i thought , so off to dhl i go , explained to a lovely dhl lady in the uk , she advised that as far as their concerned they have delivered the package they were asked to deliver and that they have completed what they are obliged to do ( fair do ' s i thought , they are just the courier )
2	p0g and all their staff involved handled the situation professionally and thoroughly , and bought about a agreeable conclusion .
2	the new ones were sent quickly , with good coms keeping me informed about their status .
2	the only_criticism i have , is the lack of a paypal payment option , but that '_s just a personal choice issue !
0	fast dispatch of envelopes , clear_instructions , fast payment and great communication_throughout the process .
2	use them all the time for all my parcels .
2	a ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2	items sent get smashed despite many many layers of bubblewrap .
2	highly_recommended .
2	there you have it :- parcel0go will carry on failing to provide a contracted service and there is nothing you can say that will make a difference .
2	my friends were very impressed with the vibrant colours of the bouquet
2	i was surprised at how quick and easy the service from mazumamobile was from entering my details online , the next_morning my envelope arrived i sent my phone back on the friday and to my surprise my cheque was delivered on sunday , also i was sent regular_updates on all the process , i was very pleased with the amount i received which was more than other_sites
0	i bought my canon_00d from digitalrev . com as it was the cheapest online price i could find for a brand_new piece of kit .
0	very pleased .
0	for those reading this , make note of what iflorist does so you can too value their guarantees and services , except you can escape paying the price .
0	have used quite a few_times now and will_continue to use them .
0	the afore mentioned conditions also seem more lax compared to competitors .
2	thanks so much to the florist company .
2	diamond . geezer offers a top quality and service and products and you can buy with confidence .
2	i '_ve got no need to go_anywhere_else .
0	i used special delivery to send and the money was in my account the next_day .

0	!
2	webtogs had exactly_what i wanted ; and the order was delivered to my home address in less_than 00_hours , with no postage charge - and at a price that was lower_than i could have expected .

0	thank_you
0	a great asset to buxton .
0	you believe ?!!!
0	what arrived was 0 pink roses , 0 lilies , and one pathetic twig of eucalyptus .
2	its actually easy to follow , unlike_some tracking systems .
0	where things have gone wrong they have been in a very small minority , especially when compared with other services that i have used in the past , and have usually been down to the individual driver making an error .
2	i contacted hifi_tower and they tried to find something that would do what i wanted .
0	well_done .
2	i ordered the peace white lilies flowers and a small birthday cake for my aunts birthday .

2	thanks parcel0go for nothing .
2	it was collected at hotel at 0 . 00pm and arrived at my house 00 . 00pm next_day - 00 . 0 hours_later .
2	and what a beautiful selection of blooms - choosing just one bouquet will be the hardest_part of your shopping from this well_constructed website / shop !
0	does someone not check the quality before they are sent out ?
2	me . and that means ?.
2	they returned only the phone which now means the handset is totally_useless .
2	i have no_complaints at all and would recommend this company to anyone , i export a great deal of items so need a company i can trust and they have proved themselves many_times .
2	the moral of this story is that by making your customer , me , unhappy with your poor service and your attitude to bad service , i will share this message with everybody who like to listen and the next time i am in need of flowers , your company will not even be on my list of companies to chose from .
2	would recommend to anyone .
0	would definitely use again .
0	!
2	the service i received from iflorist is exceptional & i would never buy flowers from anywhere_else .

0	i ordered a bunch of " lemon sorbet " flowers for mother ' s day and while the delivery was faultless , the bunch received was a " mum in a million ".
0	would recommend and will use again sometime .
2	they do what they say they will do .
0	it is also the best website for comparing postage_costs , especially if you are sending larger items , as the prices are much more reasonable than the post_office .
0	i was kept up to date on the progress all the time .
2	they kept me well informed and gave me the option to cancel .
0	very disappointed with the service all the way !
2	i really can recommend them .

0	no refund given due to when it eventually being collected ( no reason given why it wasn ' t ) it was then delivered next_day .
0	excellent price and well_packaged up !
0	i don ' t think it ' s the latter and hope not .
2	at the end of the day a service should give value for money and efficiency which parcel0go provided .
2	the earphones i wished to purchase were not in stock so i bought a pair of similar value which carried a good rating from hifiheadphones .
0	after buying the cdj i noticed it put next_day delivery , being it was during xmas i thought it would not be with me for a while , more like after new year , but i recieved it this morning and i am more_than happy with it !

0	varied price structure to fit the service required by customer .
0	i thought it ' d be a great suprise for her as she lives away .
0	very helpful , efficient and friendly
2	they state there voted number one online florist , yeah by bogus reviews bumped up by there own staff no doubt .

2	found the set_up of cameras and recorder was easy .
0	very fast and very easy service
0	i am more worried_about royal_mail loing my phone than mazuma doing anything wrong .
2	regardless , i cannot stress enough that if you have a need to ship flowers internationally , then choose any of the other_companies listed in a google_search - and there are hundreds .
0	and i only found out days_later - which was already way too_late .
0	is this not the case ?
0	very please with the quick response to the on line help .
0	would definitely be using parcel0go more often !
2	we would recommend myparceldelivery . com time and time again !
0	fill in the blanks on the website , no more the few minutes .
2	the ups courier dressed in uniform with id arrived the following_morning to collect the package and safely delivered it the next_day to my customer .
0	i have no_idea what the other review is on about .

2	great deal .
2	the range and price of bouquets available were very good .

2	thankyou emma for all your help , so quick to sort_out my none collection of parcel and arrange another 00hr delivery for me , what would we do without you .
2	thank_you very much .

0	very fast delivery . that is great
2	ordered the twilight deluxe for mothers_day and as my mum is old_fashioned and will not have lilies in the house it can become quite limiting , anyway when she recieved the flowers she was on the phone within minutes saying they were wonderful white_roses ( 00 ) and purple freesia so a huge thankyou to serenata_flowers because i ` m now in mothers good books . yippee !!!!!!!!!!!
2	it was that simple !!
2	i have used interflora on several_occasions without_any_problems .
0	i made an order 0 days prior to valentines_day and was guaranteed delivery before 0pm on 00th_feb . it is now midday on the 00th_feb and they have turned_up finally , but with a very low quality and some gifts missing !
0	i also find that the customer sevice is excellent , very personal and always draws me back for another look , and sometimes , a very cheeky yet satisfying purchase .
0	i was able to track the item and by the time it arrived there were 00 steps shown on the tracking screen .
2	i do have a small issue with the charger that came with the camera but you are dealing_with this .
0	a lot of the reviewers mentioned mazuma as a better company so i sold my iphone to them .
0	i love the phone and can alternate between viop calls and the land_line .
2	i saw the product .
0	i recommend you to all my photography friends and so far we have all been impressed .
2	, don_'_t throw your old_mobile in the waste bin , zoom it off to mazumamobile to keep it alive .
0	i contacted envirofne number of times they always promise to give me a ring back but it never happened !
2	we pay for a saturday service over 00 quid to be told it is not guaranteed we might deliver or might not - have you ever heard_anything like this in your life .
2	this is my third transaction with them and i '_ve had no_problems at all .
2	unfortunately there were hiccups , but i can '_t fault parcel0go .
0	i couldn ' t be_happier with iflorist .
2	buyer_beware . i orderd glasses , i did not want lenses but had to choose some to place order . i waited so long for glasses i had to buy a pair elsewhere .

0	even when tnt messed things up with one parcel the staff helped_me in their online live_chat .
2	i would definately recommend this to anyone_thinking of selling their old phone .
2	i am quite surprised with how uncompetitive contact_lenses are .
2	i was very impressed with the speed , it took from my initial_enquiry to the money in my bank .
0	will_definitely use them again as the price they gave me was very competitive too .
2	and if you do get stuck there is always a helpful / cheerful member of staff to guide you through the system .
0	i checked severall competitors and the price offered by mazuma was fair and in line with what othes were offering .
2	wendy_hall : r us stupid - what does saturday delivery mean ?????

0	they are terrible !
2	i couldn_'_t find them cheaper anywhere and i looked long and hard .

2	they allow you to insure up to £ 0000 .
2	how speedy is that .
2	i '_ve always found the service quick & reliable and when a problem has arisen , customer_services deal with it .

2	!
0	delivery service used was fantastic , probably the best out of every company i ' ve ever used .
0	the camera was dispatched from_hong - kong , so i was weary of a late delivery , but surprisingly the item was delivered within 0 days of order which was super !
0	glad to be getting my money back but this does not change my opinion of iflorist .
2	next time i have a mobile_phone to sell , i will use fonebank and probably not even bother getting a competing quote from anyone_else .
2	selectspecs have lost a customer for life .
2	i placed my order with mazuma on the 00st_december , i choose to send my phone standard delivery , via the post_office , i recieved an_email on the 00st_december confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made via a cheque that arrived on the 00rd_december .
2	lyn collins
0	good prices and the vinyl was in the mint_condition .
2	delighted with both the product and customer service . will use them again when i need headphone related gear . they now reside in my favourites box .
0	i cannot_fault this service and would recommend it to anyone_looking to get a better price for their used phone than you could find on the high_street .
2	i have used this company for years and generally good , however i book them to collect ( tnt ) a parcel today for a pre 00 noon delivery the following_day . for a parcel which is needed for one of our customers .
0	i ' ve had a play around with the product and it ' s pretty good .

0	i ordered the vision ego starter_kit .
0	speedy and efficient service tho the post_office said the phone was not insured during sending .
2	to top it off , after having the parcel of 00 boxes of chocolates for almost a month , they tried to send some ( 0 ) of the boxes back to me in a plastic_bag !
0	first they ditched telephone support , after people clearly began phoning in their hoardes .
2	they looked as if i had had them for a week not a day .
2	thank_you
2	they represent value for money & when combined with ups & citylink i don_'_t think they can be bettered .
2	i think the box had been opened but i assume this was to register the serial_number for warranty .
2	this is am excellent and genuine company who i have dealt_with a few_times .
0	i would highly_recommend parcel0go to anyone needing to send a parcel !
2	the quality and turnaround time for this purchase was excellent !
2	• corduroy collar ------ this comes up around the neck & clasps another yes from me
0	i called interparcel on their 00p minute help line and someone said the parcel had not left and so would be held at my customers local_depot for him to collect .

2	i ' m definitely going to be using serenataflowers again , it was a first_class service .
2	i said i could wait and asked cho to send the leggings when they could .
0	have been using this site for a few_years now , no_problems and dead easy to use .
0	the price was £_00 - £_000 cheaper_than a home uk purchase , and the model comes with a full canon one - year_warranty !
2	no one willing to take any respoinsibility or even willing to read transcripts of past chats ( even when they are sent as part of the current chat ) iwa stopld a collection had been booked only to find 0 days_later when i asked that it handnt and they hadnt bothered to inform me .
0	an_hour later i received an_email off mazuma informing_me that my phone had arrived and been processed .
0	and disconnected from the conversation .
0	it is nerve - wracking doing something like this over the internet , but i would not hesitate to recommend diamond_geezer , and i will certainly use them again .
0	even if the item is on prohibited item list it doesn ' t explained why they don ' t treat parcels with care .
0	this was not about the flowers or the price i paid for it , it was about the meaning and sentimental value on one of the most_important days of my life .
0	would recommend 000_%
0	spot on as per_usual , dispatch time is second to none
0	second time i have used digitalrev .
2	unsure if i was protected by guarantee , i emailed country_attire on 0th_january to explain the problem .

0	thumbs_up !
2	the best part for me was the home collection that was bang on time .
0	packaged really securely .
2	they actually listened and acted upon customer feedback - now that is impressive !
0	i am not sure whether its incompetence or ignorance .
2	yet another satisfied customer who will let friends know about this company .
0	excellent sound quality with good options and accesory potential that is pretty_much plug and play !
2	so easy and quick i wouldn_'_t use any other service to send stuff .
0	danielle_: ok well i wouldn ' t just make this up .

2	both my daughter and i received our pullovers within two days - can '_t beat that especially at christmas .
0	i am quite surprised to see bad_reviews of this company , i have used these a lot and have only good things to say about these .
2	when this go_wrong their customer service is excellent .
0	and guess_what . today its the evening of the 00th and i have not received any flowers or a refund !

0	the £_00 was in my account by 0pm the following_day .
2	sunday : still nothing
0	before i had a chance to ring parcel_hero they rang me and had already noticed that the package was not collected and then arranged a new collection and followed it every_step of the way because it was an important and expensive item that was time sensitive .
0	i got married back in may 0000 .
0	i used them and my package has disappeared , order status was in transit for over a month , when i contact their customer_service , they asked me to prove if the parcel was picked_up although the tracking history says it was so !
2	can '_t thank him enough !
2	everything_went very smoothly .
0	excellent service , prompt and very helpful , will_definitely being using again !
0	well_designed website , good products and reasonable prices .
0	so where did they all go ??
0	my phone had troubles charging and the gps didnt work , a quick email to mazuma and their friendly staff emailed me back under 00_hours letting me know it would still be classed_as working - so i traded it in !
2	i cannot recommend this company highly_enough .
0	god quality , price and delivery
2	no hassle good price shall defo_use again .
2	will do my flowers just with you !
0	no apologizing .
2	their site was easy to use and setup .
2	mazuma makes it so easy to recycle your old_phones and get a great price for them into the bargain .
0	not going to use the service again so voucher_code didn ' t work in generating return purchases .
0	but the production_room not only had them in , they guaranteed to match the best price in the u . k .
2	what can i say the outfit was really brill .
0	i have bought a 00 long - stemmed red_roses that i never receive .
0	they paid exactly_what they said they would and told me everything as it happened .
2	so it has got to be good .
2	not a lily in sight , and the tulips ( whatever they were there for ) were all droopy and never revived .
2	i picked a £_00 + bouquet to be delivered before 00 noon
0	i have ordered from iflorist before and didn ' t remember anything remarkably bad going on so when i got their email advertising mother ' s day bouquets i decided to place an order .
0	best * fast * flowers
2	would highly_recommend to any prospective buyer
2	very fast .
0	i welcome a response from you as i have pictures on my phone detailing how shocking your flowers are .
2	no_problems at all , and my money in my bank within hours of mazuma receiving my old phone
0	i have used their service for my business 0 - 0 times without a problem and then i get stung with this bill making my original £_00 purchase 00 times the costs with all these charges .
0	and watch out for their hidden_fees !!
0	also they are one of the only online stored that i have shopped from that offer next_day delivery to ireland , the first order i placed was on 00nd of december_0000 and i had it on the 00rd which is amazing considering the time of year .
0	i like arena_flowers because they are good value , user_friendly and always deliver the goods on time every time .
2	!
2	would recommend this site as it offers very good value and service .
2	it '_s easy to use and the communication from mazuma is second to none .
2	mazuma does exactly_what it says on the tin .
2	i placed an order with eflorist mid - morning asking for the flowers i ordered to be delivered between 0pm - 0pm that day .
0	ring is stunning , great price and quick service .
0	my ring arrived in a lovely presentation_box in less_than 00 working_days by special delivery and i am so delighted with it .
2	excellent service from beginning to end , i will be using you again for all my flowers .
2	no telephone service , and witless email responses , so everything takes an age to resolve .
0	the service was brilliant .
0	these items were to be delivered to a hotel in london , to accompany someone visiting the uk back to his home country on the sunday and i explained this to interparcel and ups but both_parties turned a deaf ear .
0	their website is slick , attractive and easy to navigate , items arrive quickly and are always well_packaged plus their refund or exchange policy means you can have absolute confidence in your purchase .
0	have been offered a 00_% refund off my order which has still yet to materialise .
0	it ' s on your website !
0	i got my 000d from hk in 0 days
2	i have used you many_times but never used the chat line before excellent service well_done .
2	great service fast delivery tracked all the way and a fantastic price .
2	recommend .
0	needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses quickly , ordered on wednesday and had them on my desk on tuesday .
0	emails keeping me up to date all the time .
0	the arrange free courier who collected phones . and phones dissapear !
0	thank_you again !
0	the card stated " i called to deliver i have left your parcel for you to collect from : front_door ".
2	what a service , which instils confidence in buying from this company .
0	i think that delivery should take place during the day and not at night .
2	in the last mess up their partners in crime city - link turned_up for collection of an urgent parcel on a next_day before 00 guaranteed service at a manned storage site and claimed there was noone there to collect from .
0	ordered flowers to be delivered next_day they never delivered them . they apologised blaming the courier they use . im now waiting for a refund . very bad service .
0	the whole_process was very easy , none of this send it in and we ' ll tell you what we ' ll pay , you see the price upfront .
2	will use agaub ,
0	so if you select a day for a courier to collect and they don ' t arrive or come the next_day , you nor parcel0go are entitled to any sort of recourse or compensation , apparently .
2	all through tuesday i received regular emails_informing_me of the status of my purchase and on wednesday_morning i received an_email from the delivery company informing_me of the time that my purchase would be delivered .
0	service was great .
2	long may you reign .
0	additionally , i was a bit perturbed when i placed my order but didnt receive any confirmation or notification of my order until 0 days_later .
0	i ' ve never had any_problems with serenata .
0	i got all the information needed , money went into my bank_account as soon as they received my mobile .
0	great same day service , good communication and great flowers .
2	would definitely_use again and recommend to others .
2	highly_recommended .
0	i had a failed pick - up collection yesterday and i wasted the whole day waiting for them to turn_up .
2	thanks
0	i then sent the phone and received the money paid straight into my bank_account the next_day .
0	they were disgusting , that is the only way i could describe them .
2	if not i will_continue with this review .
0	because of their suspectness .
2	if i can do it anyone can everything was straight_forward
2	my only query would be what happens if the recipient is not in when delivery is attempted ?
2	from start to finish mazuma look after you as a valued_customer .
0	i orded my selling pack on boxing_day so i thought it would take a few weeks with it being xmas , but my order was approved the day after boxing_day and my pack arrived the day after that .
2	i intend to take this to trading_standards as the service i paid for was not met and wasn_'_t permitted to speak to the manager as the lines were busy , no doubt with lots of other unhappy_customers .
0	email confirmation stating flowers will be delivered on wed 00th as requested !
0	no nasty_surprises , very professional .
0	i haven ' t seen her for an year and i wanted to make her a little surprise as much as i could .
2	i have purchased from hifi_headphones on several_occasions - both headphones and headphone amplifiers .
0	all i was asking them to be a little human .
0	also got the packaging as new .
0	with webtogs , i had the support of real people behind the computer screen , which made my purchase experience absolutely wonderful .
2	sent off mobile in first_class envelope and cheque received following_day .
0	i love waxx_underwear i used to sell them in a shop i worked at called isis in saltaire .
0	they offer less but you don ' t have to pay for special delivery and you get the money much faster .
2	i will_definitely_use your service again i give you a 000_% , very good service , very happy
2	transglobal '_s website make it so simple to ship parcels to all corners of the world .
0	ordered on friday got it on tuesday even with the item on hold for inspection in uk .
2	applied on line and received documentation the next_day , sent mobile off and received the cheque by return of post , what more can i say !
2	i wanted to send some beautiful_flowers to my mother - in - law after the christmas holidays , i chose this company to take my order .
0	dhl can turn_up at your door demaning x amount and if you refuse - the package simply will be returned to digitalrev . get your money back ?
2	the p0g customer service reps are helpful via the livechat function on the p0g website , and the problem gets resolved in due course , but the business could be conducted in 0 / 0 of the time if it was possible to speak direct by phone !!
2	i ' m very happy with this website and is now the one i look at when i need a new addition to my gear .
2	can ` t recommend mazuma enough .
2	my daughter recieved some flower s from her boyfreinds and when we opened the box we said . wow look at those .
0	!
2	will_definitely_use again .
2	excellent head phones and excellent service from hifi_headphones .
2	no phone number on website and a lot of info about how great they are and will give 000_% satisfaction .
0	even a paypal_dispute isnt getting a reply .
0	how in the world is that an appropriate substitution ?!
0	i have people asking about it every day !
0	as we were having our_wedding overseas i felt fake flowers would be an advantage , but did feel a little_apprehensive that they would not be as good as the real thing .
2	excellent choice and value with regular special_offers .
2	highly_recommended !

2	0 star service !!
2	very spécial price !
2	it turns_out there was no problem however .
2	i can '_t praise them highly_enough , they make my life easy , plain and simple .
0	if you want you flowers delivered . do not use this florist .
0	well_done , mazuma_mobile !
0	not only did the filter get to me ontime , one of the people actually cycled to my house ( in brighton ) to delivery them in person to make_sure i got them and knew how to correctly install the filter .
0	fantastic quality , exceptional service and flawless knowledge .
0	0 / 0 don ' t bother looking elsewhere :)

0	when the second hadn ' t arrived the day before book day i contacted mega_fancy_dress & they sent out another costume .
0	so it was never a discussion but we were informed that it wouldnt happen .
0	absolutely_ridiculous .
0	iflorist managed to deliver on time at peak time and my mother - in - law and husband were very surprised to have received the flowers along with delicious chocolates on the coldest day of the year !
0	the website is fool proof with clear_instructions for sending the phone and completing the process .
0	danielle_: hello , my account has been locked - can you tell me why please ?
2	responses to their service .
2	the short cable is a bonus for me as i don_'_t want loads of cable trailing around , if you wanted a longer cable then there are plenty of extensions available for just a few_pounds .
2	money paid at once .
2	i will_definitly use them again .
2	my relative is now back home and we have both had a message from floraqueen asking for feedback on their service which is incredible considering the flowers have not been delivered !
0	i will use parcel0go again .
0	they are just great , i havent had a warped record yet ,
2	what i ordered was out of stock , but what i recieved is great .
2	as arnie says " hasta la vista baby " i '_ll be back as well for more ordering .
2	i have only used selectspecs once and it was a huge disappointment .
0	i will certainly be coming_back to use parcel0go service even_though in this instance i cancelled my request ( because circumstances have changed for me personally i . e .
2	the machine is of german manufacture it is of good quality and well built , it has plenty of power which is important as i make a lot of bread dough and the machine copes with this easily .
0	this company seems to be fraudster .
0	it was easy to organise a time to view the products and stephanie was very helpful providing good advice on all matters related to buying the perfect ring .

2	i ordered 0 roses with a silver vase , they arrived with a box and no vase .
0	i also found the p_& p charges reasonable compared to other online_retailers , as well as the cost of the hearts themselves .
0	if i opt for ' pre_- pay ' i get extra £ 0 .
0	keep up the great work !
2	several emails later , they agreed to send me a replacement , which arrived today .
0	excellent service , would use again and would def_recommend !
2	would recommend to anyone and if i needed more i will go back to selecta specs .
2	now i know a lot of time when i got glasses from opticion you had to have thenm adjusted ect , i buy a lot of my glasses with a solid nose bit rather_than the little legs that sit on your nose and if you use your script it will have the right width for your nose , i have never had a bad fit all are comfortable and if the come with the little legs that sit on your nose these can be adjusted your self i put thme on for 0 hour take them off and check if there are dints or uncomfortable dints then i just pull the legs out a little then wait_till dint on nose have gone then try again after a couple of goes you will fine the comfortable adjustment and that is it , you do not need to have them adjusted in shop just use a mirror and do this yourself , again if you have a current pair of glasses all your measurements are on the inside arm of the glasses this gives the width of glasses nose depth and arm length , so hope you have enjoyed my first ever review of anything i have ever purchased on line , but i warn you now !!
0	i mean what sort of joke is that .
2	no flowers arrived so i submitted a report ticket and spoke to customer_services this morning , was informed that it would be dealt_with and that the flowers should have arrived yesterday .

2	her responses were good humoured , appropriate and extraordinarily human - what a wonderful change in this 00st_century
2	it is next_day , late evening , they are still not delivered , let_alone they missed the funeral .
2	my wife was delighted with them .
0	all in all a great service from michelle
0	excellent service , was the best price offered for my handset .
2	i then asked what do i need to do to make the change ?
0	no customer help , just faceless website with form to fill in .
0	however even_though we live in a well lit , well ventilated ( but not too cold or hot ) house - these should have been fine .
0	massive thank_you for saving the day with such a lovely bouquet .
0	i had a small delivery address query which was dealt_with immediately .
0	would like a full_refund because i feel_cheated as they look nothing like on the website .
2	headline price is great , but includes next to no insurance_cover .
0	( and wrapped in a good 0 square metres of bubblewrap )
0	i have been using parcel0go for some time now .
2	when i finally got someone to talk to me today on the chat line , i was told that a refund could only be made to me if one of the orders could be returned unopened via the original courier service .
0	however they needed me to confirm my address and because of the time difference , communication took about 0 days , and when they finally posted it the due date was much later .
0	:_d
0	a long delivery to russia .
2	£_000 lamp not delivered to my customer in london , to save embarrassment after chasing parcel0go for over a week for an answer through there non_existent customer service , i had to send the item again at my cost to save face .
2	if you want to give up smoking without_any stress and no irratabiliuty try supercigs these are amazing from the moment i recieved my kit i have not touched or craved for a cigarette all my family and friends have now stopped smoking with safercigs this should be given to all smokers then the whole country would be tobacco free .
0	sen levererades inte blommorna förrän sent på kvällen , vilket ledde till att min_mor inte fick dem förrän dagen_efter när hon skulle gå till jobbet .
2	i am very impressed .
0	fast , easy , effective .
0	after missing my collection time twice i used the live_chat tool , a lady named samantha was very helpful with assisting me with my order , she told me my nearest shop i could use to drop_off and sent me my new label , now i dont have to worry_about missing my time again and my parcel will reach its destination tomorrow !!
0	i would definitely deal with them again .
0	i was almost certain that i would get my parcels late and completely smashed !
2	the whole exercise was so easy to carry out , i wondered_if it was too good to be true but my daughter received a phone_call to arrange delivery within a few_days .
2	!
0	in that respect pretty faultless and puts more local suppliers delivery costs and lead times to shame .
2	the waistcoat fitted like a glove and the quality of all items was of a high_standard .
2	!
2	the first agent allowed the " chat " to time - out , and the second promised to email me the following_day .
2	super sums up all_stages , ordering and delivery as well as the freshnessof flowers ,
2	i wanted the bracelet as a christmas_present for my partner and had originally seen it on amazon (£_000 ).
2	recommended !
0	please stay_away for disappointments .
0	i only wish i had more phones to sell as i know where i would be sending them too .
2	this was when heathrow was struggling and many roads impassable , it took us 00_minutes to get out of the drive !.
2	!
0	really quick delivery and great prices
0	the flowers were so fresh and bursting with colour it really made her day .
0	also the headphones i got , sennheiser hd 000 , are amazing !
0	couldn ' t be_happier !!

2	!
0	a stock email after 0 days of ignorance is not good enough .
0	on my way to send my package !
2	i spoke to jenny via the online help service and was extremely impressed at how quickly my queries were dealt_with .
2	congratulations mazuma you '_ve made a cynical old man reach an epiphany .
0	customer_service on the web chat is useless , with them refusing to provide a number to actually call someone or even provide an_email address .
0	do not use this company .
0	0 star website i will_defiantly be doing_business with them again in the future !
2	it is ok if you have a light and small parcel that is easy to carry some distance , but not for heavier parcels .
0	will_definitely use again !
0	clive was great to work with .
0	not only have the flowers i paid for ( with an extra ' before 0pm ' delivery charge ) never arrived , no one from the website has responded to any email or ' live_chat ' message , im sat here almost a week_later with no flowers , no money and most of all absolutely no_idea whats_going on ?
0	the flowers should have been delivered today , yet i have sent several messages asking for confirmation of delivery , and have heard_nothing .
2	did what they said on the tin !
2	had a problem with a customer giving me the wrong_address , catherine on chat sorted it out for me in no time at all .
2	and one rubber foot was missing from the base .
2	i am one happy customer !
0	payment was sent instantly as promised .
2	they are also so much_cheaper_than royal_mail !
0	!
0	i decided to give them away and bought a much more extravagant bouquet for my partner from the local_supermarket ( might i add , at a much_better price ).
0	would definitely_recommend them and use again ,
0	i had really hoped to give my boyfriend a good suprise with this product on our aniversary .
0	it ' s not very often that you receive such excellent customer_service within this day and age and it was very refreshing to find a business that still does !
0	posted and paid within a few_days , no issues .
0	needed a new monitor as old one was playing up . took me a long time to narrow_down to what i wanted . tekshop000 had it in stock and they were cheapest by only 0 pounds comapred to amazon .
0	i couldn ' t believe .
2	i recently_purchased two_sets of headphones but alas had to send one faulty pair back .

0	good quick service
2	i paid for the medium bunch which was an extra £ 0 and was desgusted at the quality with dead leaves drooping flowers etc for the extra money i thought it would be a bigger bunch than what arrived , infact the £ 0 bunch from asda was bigger than the £_00 i paid for from these rip_off cowboys .
0	paid £_00 for a bouquet to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday and not worth the money at all .
0	i will_definitely_recommend digitalrev .
2	is looking for a designer pair of glasses to visit selectspecs .
0	they offered the camera i was looking for ( canon_000d ) significantly_cheaper_than other online stores and so i was wondering what the ' catch ' was .

2	i sent another parcel to auckland by fedex but booked through parcel0go and before it left i had the date which it was due to arrive as well as being_able to pick the date of the uplift then can track it round the world .
0	pretty shoddy , considering your website states that between the hours of 0am - 0pm , you will reply within the hour , apart_from in peak_times .
0	what a useless service . all day their website chat help was off . and now the phone line doesnt answer at all as if they unplugged the phone number .

2	high_street prices and too much to take in as the prices rise from the sales_assistant ,

2	!
0	the customer gave up waiting just past 0pm and left for his party without any of the decorations i sent him .
2	this was the first parcel that i had sent with them and needless to say , it will be the last unless they start to train their staff and comply with their own terms and conditions .
2	the delivery on this spooky jester outfit was amazing so quick & we were delighted at the quality of the costume . the detailing was great & the mask also v scary !

2	i ordered some " bargain ", described as " designer " specs from another store .
0	everything was very smooth and fast ( collection / delivery ).

0	the service is second to none and the prices are much_better value than the high_street .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i used a price comparison site to see who would give me the most for my old blackberry and fonebank topped the list and gave me exactly_what they promised .
2	saved in excess of £_000 compared to uk shops .
2	theft thats all it can be described as
2	the price was the best i could find from a company that had a presence on the web rather_than just a buyer from e_- bay .
0	my verdict ?
2	the order arrived swiftly and their customer service department kept me informed regarding delivery .
0	very good quality brushes .
2	having said that , i have never had occasion to return anything , and now most of the equipment i have purchased has_gone past the guarantee date anyway ( without problems ) so i can '_t speak as to how this guarantee system actually works in reality .
2	reasonable_prices . kept_informed of the progress and very funny loved it .
2	when the flowers were delivered later that day i asked the courier if he could explain the late delivery , he could not explain_why they were late , but he did mention that he had 00 flower deliveries the previous day .
2	would not use or recommend .
0	i posted my phone on the weds , it was delivered to mazuma thursday_morning and by 0pm i had an_email_confirming funds had been wired same day .
2	when they did finally turn_up they were very sub_standard and not at all like they had advertised on their website .
0	yesstyle emailed me to say if i don ' t receive it by the 0th of feburary (!!!!)
2	a great service .

2	nice choice of flowers and gifts , quick delivery , great communication !
2	three days from sending phone details to getting the cheque .
2	so all in all it '_ll be easy to buy from the production_room again in the future .
2	this has got to be one of the best small camera security systems around , so small and not at all costly , takes no time at all to set_up and the end_result is super , better_than what i thought .
2	i immediately sent an_email and created a ticket stating that there had not been a delivery .
2	but hey , next time you drop me a line informing_me of the delivery , use words instead of numbers !
2	i do apologise for any disappointment and look_forward to hearing from you .
2	in my experience they have always taken my side and sorted the delivery company out and got my refund where needed .
0	thanks alot .
2	emma gave me exactly_what i was looking for , no_messing_about asking thousands of questions , just got the information i needed in double quick time , why aren_'_t all companies like this ?.
2	she offered to do the booking and guide me step by step with clear_instructions and politeness .
2	they are thieves .
0	i ' ve used transglobal express for my business and personally and they ' ve never let me down .
0	did not pay out the same day they received my phone .
0	flowers are meant to signify an important event and this company has ruined these events with such disappointing results !
0	email about 0pm on the day says the flowers were delivered .
0	and maybe a reduction in working hours and more holiday time ??
2	they are absolutely_brilliant , from their choice of flowers to the update on the status of the delivery .
2	what i ordered was spot on for quality , size , colour , and price .
2	can '_t praise them enough and recommend them to my friends .
0	ik
0	i would be able to understand if they would be having a office and send requests to local flower shops to prepare and deliver but no !
2	recommended !
2	the company looked professional , the flowers looked really lovely and they also had the available slot for the flowers to be delivered .
0	my nan absolutely loved her flowers .
0	wish more companies were like this .
2	fantastic company to deal with and i was absolutely_delighted with te help which they gave to me .

0	collection and delivery service is really easy to arrange and price is reasonable .
0	numerous phone_calls unanswered also .
0	you can also print off the postage details at home so you don ' t have to wait for it all to arrive in the mail making the process go a lot quicker .
2	evntually got there .
2	just sent it again [_name ]
2	if you query this with them you are just told that the service is not guaranteed .
2	to be honest i wasn_'_t very impressed with the service i had received up to that point and likely would not have used this service again as my first choice .
0	a quick e_- mail and a prompt response settled my nerves a bit as they confirmed it will be sent that day .
2	dont_bother to try and phone them , they do not have a phone .
0	great service
2	i would recommend mazuma_mobile , great service and brilliant customer_satisfaction - i have used mazuma more than a few_times - good prices and the added_bonus of getting argos_vouchers - never had any_problems with this company
2	i would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for hi -_fi equipment .
0	i sent to of my old_phones , i wasnt expecting much and for one of the phones mazuma wasnt wasnt the highest quote but the company that quoted higher iv never_heard of them and as it was ony £ 0 difference , the blackberry was the highest quote and the fact that id heard of mazuma i decided to send them both im really pleased i did mazuma deserve every star great service and really pleased with how much money i recieved thank_you

0	i packaged it up and posted and the following_day ( today ) i received an_email_confirming_receipt of my old phone and payment will apparently be made to me today by fps !
2	the flowers were supposed to arrive wednesday but arrived thursday_night as they were delivered to the wrong house some days back and they dropped them off .
2	think this wont happen to you . so did i . just wait . it will

2	i got stuck on the forms and the live_chat really was helpful .
2	looked up on the website to see how much my old_mobile was worth , had the envelope and instructions through my letterbox two days_later .
2	the items ordered arrived the following_day , extremely good service , no_problems would definitely recommend them .
0	once placing the sell order , communication was excellent .
0	i get straight on the phone to iflorist ( or try to ) & am greeted with a straight to voice_mail mumbling message ( it doesn ' t sound at all professional ) inforrming me to email them if i have any_problems ( not even leave a message & they ' ll get back or hold and someone will be with you message ).
0	hope to have my money refunded and the order cancelled as the flowers are of no use to anyone now .
0	i had tried to send my packages with another company and the result was disastrous .
0	customer had provided an incorrect address so i needed to get it changed .
2	leggings arrived on the 00th_jan .
0	i kept explaining to them that the flowers were not delivered on the right day , and they kept ignoring my comments and telling_me they had been .
2	have a look at the web_site and register they will also e_- mail you some great deals .
0	i booked for a home - cinema projector and separate lamp to be picked_up in staffordshire and delivered to me in london .
0	quick delivery , well_packaged goods and great communications with emails on order status and whatnot .
2	money from an old phone in your draw is like finding a roll of notes down the back of your sofa !
0	her friendly tone immediately calmed me down and i went away with a resolution and feeling happy with the service i received .
0	ok , so its the new year period . my parcels one day later . ok , no big issue . however one parcel arrives .
0	we have found that p0g have been brilliant towards us and any_problems or issues we may have are dealt_with very quickly and i believe this is down to the excellent customer_service we receive from natalie lafferty .
2	recommended :_o )
0	i found that they had a tendency not to listen at all to my complaint .
2	posted following_day and cheque for £_000 arrived 0 days_later .
0	this service is so quick and easy to use .
0	and i want a refund or i will dispute my order with my bank asap .
2	we first booked our collection on the 00th_nov now 00th , with my parcel delivery , using ups they did not collect after three attempts to get the parcel collected , we changed the courier and chose city_link again through my parcel delivery .
2	i had the freepost option from mazuma but decided to pay a couple of quid (£ 0 . 00 ) for next_day delivery as royal_mail ( not the safest pair of hands ) insure the package up to £_000 in case of loss or damage .
0	after rearranging the collection date it was picked_up late in the afternoon but then they have managed to lose my parcel .
0	after being made to feel_like an_idiot after numerious emails from a charming female on their customer_services team , i even began to convince myself that i hadn ' t placed an order .
2	was happy to receive a speedy service from receiving the return envelope to getting the refund
2	found the website to be informative and to give advice that seems to be balanced , giving good and bad points about headphones .
0	late by 0 week ( they lost it ) and they wouldn ' t refund or compensate because it was delivered !
0	awaiting reply from them .
2	what can be said , other than fantastic , and very reasonably_priced .
0	they didn ' t respond to me until 0 days_later saying it was too_late , 0 hours_later they sent me a tracking_number .
0	i contacted someone within the company and they reassured me that the speakers are good quality so i ordered and the person whom i wrote to was correct and very helpful
2	this said i would probably use them again though they will not be my first choice .
0	my full chat log below :
0	i ' m_glad i used this company as the delivery was quick and kept me updated at each_stage .
0	customer_service is really poor with no contact phone number and only online help .
2	fourth : they won_'_t say when the claim will be settled .
2	i have them bookmarked so i will remember to use them again .
0	before purchase there was a long description about each product and a lot of awesome drtv videos as well to see what you want to buy in action .
0	det_er pinligt og ganske enkelt tyveri , snyd og bedrag .
0	i did not give up !
2	i was impressed by all this but sceptical_about the product .
0	what more could you want !
2	so frustrating .
2	malcolm
2	i '_ve used this company about 0 times , ( discount on the horizon , me thinks ) and they are excellent .
2	who would be bothered by the 0m it took to confirm my details as it ensures safe internet purchase .
2	would be worth_paying a few more pounds for a company that provides a window .
0	they don ' t even have a contact number to call to sort out any_issues .
2	a +
0	it is now 0 . 00pm and the flowers are nowhere to be seen and no attempt has been made to contact me .
0	do everything they say on the site .

0	will recommend to everyone specially family and friends
2	the service was fast and efficient , if you ever want to sell on your mobile_phone , just go to fonebank .
2	i particularly like the live_chat function that i contacted late one night .
0	chris
2	nothing delivered though they said they would have to check first when i asked for my money to be returned .
0	ordered in the evening , called the day after to confirm a product substitution , received the item the following_day .
0	on thurs they couldn ' t guarantee pick_up so we cancelled order .
0	unfortunately , the flowers my mum had received on mother ' s day would not look out of place set on top of a coffin , nor did they bear any resemblance to what i had ordered .
2	it was just three days from the collection of the parcel to the delivery to family in perth and it made their day ( and mine ).
0	i recommend mazuma to any body who has a phone which the no_longer need or no_longer works , if they don ' t have internet access then i offer to do it for them .
2	. so why did it take them nearly five months to find it ?
0	i called iflorist to complain_about the service , they offered no compensation , or resolution to this situation .
0	i have already_recommended the company to many friends and will_continue to make purchases from them .
0	upon doing so i had a message advising that these frames were on back order and wouldn ' t be received for around 0 - 0weeks , a time i couldn ' t live with .

0	used few_times no troubles
2	excellent service and communication .
2	this company excels in what it does .
0	my advice . go to a local_florist .
0	i used the online method to set_up a collection for a parcel and it was very easy to use .
2	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use them again .
2	because creative_audio made it perfect by giving all leads , wire , and the best thing for me was the print out of tips .
2	the item i ordered arrived promptly but was sadly incorrectly sized ( through no fault of webtogs , i hasten to add ).
0	at this point , the communication with serenataflowers was going round in circles .
0	i received a wonderful service .
2	would have no_hesitation in recommending to a friend .

0	richard_: ok in that case they may collect today fred but it isnt physically booked through our system
0	the website was easy to use and the price offered was good didnt have to worry_about charger or original_packaging .
0	more_than that though , and what really impressed me , was the detail the site went into to tell you about the product you were looking at .
2	re : parcel0go . com order confirmation - invoice # 00000000 hi rose i was working through your system for posting a parcel and had just completed payment for the above invoice no when a notice came up that it timed out .

2	excellent service .
0	ordered flowers for delivery on a friday they did not arrive .
2	i '_ve been having all_kinds of technical problems and tonight had to use my son '_s pc as my printer wouldn_'_t work at all with my latest operating_system .

2	( ups take some notes here !)
0	a wide_variety of services and prices to suit all needs .

0	this is the best shop .
2	i wish that all sizes were available for all items at the scotland kilt company .

0	my mother waited in all day as i received an_email_saying that they would definitely arrive ( after inquiry ).
0	they said the driver attempted to pick_up the package but i was home all day and no driver came by .

0	you will not receive such treatment .
2	what a fantastic product !
0	i want this sorted asap otherwise i will be going out of my way to make your customers aware of this .
0	but no explanations .
0	we are unable to specify a time , for example " between 00am and 00am " and can only stipulate that your order will be delivered during the working day ."

0	there was no_fuss and the coat is perfect !
0	guess_what ??
0	0 .

0	they said they would give me a refund .
0	was abit worried with dealing_with a company in hk that i have never dealt_with before , but i had nothing to worry_about .
0	i wasn ' t impressed when saw the flowers that were delivered the bunch was tiny and didnt look anything like the website photo , i even chose a bigger bouquet and it still looked like a bunch from a petrol pump i was highly embarrassed as it was a 0st wedding_anniversary gift .
0	many_thanks
0	they spoilt the very essence of mothers_day and the surprise i had enstored for my mother .
2	easily contactable when a slight_problem with product arose and was solved the very next_day .
0	they gave us a really good price for our camera & the funds were in our account within 00_hours of receiving the confirmation_email_saying that the camera had been received and inspected !
0	we personally liked to track our rings as they were getting manufactured .
2	a hugely competent company to deal with , even the customer_services were a pleasure too , & an english_speaking person too .
2	a lot of the reviews on this site must be fiction as you cannot speak to parcel0go customer service .
2	they explained that the mishap was due to the vendor changing the product style and arranged speedy replacements until i had a complete matching system .
2	the bag i purchased was for my sons_birthday in 0 days time , and was unable to go looking round shops , as i was poorly .
2	i was very happy with the service and would them use again .

2	recieved e_- mail confirmation monday and my cheque tuesday .

2	wow she was over the moon and delighted !
2	excellent product and service , if you are in the market for hi -_fi products , try these_people first .
2	as with most reviews , i ' d read varied opinions , but my experience was totally positive .
0	exactly as promised , paid the full_amount for my phone despite it having some minor cosmetic blemishes .
0	the rumours of a lolipop were true and it was even better_than i ' d dared hope

0	well_done and thanks again .

2	after all , would you like to go back to a group of well meaning family and demand a receipt ?
0	would recommend .
0	!
0	at_least i should have been contacted and advised that they don ' t have yellow flowers but pink so i could make the final decision .
0	excellent service , ordered 0 records tuesday_morning received them all wednesday_morning - well_packaged and fast delivery .
2	once again , outstanding !
2	will_definitely_use this site again , very impressed indeed .
2	i then mentioned that there were two other bouquets ’_s that i would accept – but was told that neither of these was available either !
2	good choice of carriers to pick from too .
0	thanks mazuma !
0	i will recommend hifi_headphones to my friends .
2	my friend if you have a phone you do not use look on there website find out how much it may be worth ask for a bag and post it . if your phone still works ok you get the money it '_s that simple me and my wife got £_00 for our phones that were just sat in a drawer and had just deen upgraded so give it a try best of luck paul height
2	the replacement came .
0	there were no_hidden_costs or extra import taxes etc .
0	well was kept well informed of the progress of my order i paid extra for delivery before noon and in the morning got a text_saying they would be delivered between 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 . woke my boyfriend up so he wouldn ' t miss them arriving and after he text at 00 : 00 saying they still weren ' t there i was panicking .
0	funny that .
2	i sent a bouquet to a friend who '_s just newly widowed and she phoned to say thank_you and how lovely they were !
0	i would recomend this site to anyone !!
2	i have yet to receive a response to this .
2	they ' re not answering the phones .
2	i know who didn_'_t , but i lost out all_round .
0	i would definitely buy from them again without_doubt .
2	would recommend this company to everybody who needs top quality fancy_dress gear
0	as well as that , out of all three times , it has been cheaper to use p0g than royal_mail and even then , the trackability of the parcels is second to none as you can still track via the actual couriers website if you know where to look .
2	would use again even if other mobile companies that buy mobiles were offering slightly more for buying of phones , as i know how quickly the transactions are completed from start to finish and that you have your money within a few_days
0	previously envirofone were always my first choice when i wanted to cash in my old phone , however recently the service they have offered has been extremely poor .
0	expressed an urgent order and got it to me next_day .
0	i florist orders delivered from a wharehouse in the midlands made by migrant workers and distributed by [_link ] distribution who yes . have been on watchdog !!
0	!
0	always a plus in my opinion !
0	i received my tracking_number and was a little_wary about the delivery service ( it looked like a dhl / fedex type caurier , hardly romantic ).
2	i phoned katy and it was all sorted_out in about 00 seconds ,
2	my arse !!
0	!
0	the canon 000ex rt i bought arrived within two days of me ordering it and was perfectly packaged and at a great price there is nothing i could suggest to improve .
2	i was concerned at first about sending a high value phone to a company i hadn_'_t used before but cannot rate them highly_enough .
2	you only get what you pay for , and interparcel are just booking the courier for you .
2	0 days_later i asked what was happening ( again ) and a system error was to blame ( again ) and did i want to continue .
0	william straight_away helped_me and emailed me it instead , so i didn ' t have to fuss with getting a refund .
2	when asked how much they thought the flowers would have cost they are always well under half the price quoted .
0	i didn ' t realize they it was a grey import until i told a friend about the website who then told me it was .
2	i sent the telephone off and was very impressed to receive my cheque so quickly .
2	she was delighted .
2	very fast , transaction , quoted a price on line , sent mobile off , and got payment 0 days_later - all in all excellent
0	couldn ' t believe_how quick and easy it was .
0	i would definitely_recommend tightsplease and i will certainly be purchasing again from them .
0	and will_defiantly be using them in the future .
0	sammie was very helpful , very quick , overall there ' s nothing that i can fault .
2	do give itashot you won_'_t regret it .
2	it pays to have a good agent .
2	enquired on line - received my evelope te next_day - posted off phone - received cheque 0 days_later .
0	0 .
2	sincerely
0	the bottom_line : if your afraid to buy from overseas - keep it that way or take a huge chance .
2	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	i repeat do not use serenata_flowers ever ,
2	i have been on your website and opened a " case " but still no response ,
0	no hassle or worry .
2	if there is a delay on anything , the communication and updates are second to none .
2	will_definitely be ordering from you guys again .
2	i would not even think of using any other company to seek my phones , they are totally_trustworthy as wel as competitive and speedy .
2	fred wooldridge
2	tom drysdale .
0	also as my printer has decided to die today , they even said they would sort the labels , what more can you ask ?
2	thank_you so much for brightening up her day .
2	to add_insult to injury i have not had a reply to my complaint .
2	the website was easy to understand even for a novice like me .
0	the advisers on the livechat were called sarah - who helped with the larger parcel surcharge .
0	the system is simple yet very effective and the e_- mails at each_stage was very helpful
2	the headphones are superb ( beyredynamic dtx 000 ) .
2	well_done , chemicakuk , you surpassed my expectations .
2	excellent service !
0	was worried_about wasting the order who_knows the excellent customer_service , emma was the person assisted me who did not hesitate to solve the problem .
0	!
0	it was a complicated design , so i began contacting jewellers in london to get quotes ; some didn ' t even reply , and some quoted very high prices .
2	so the lesson is if you want flowers for a special day , don_'_t use prestige_flowers or expect them to care .

0	a day after i requested for the free post bag , in came through in first_class mail .

0	not only did digitalrev have the best price available on the camera i wanted ( eos 0d ) but their service was exemplary .
2	dead simple service to use , from checking what your mobile is worth to getting paid .
2	really easy to use .
0	i sent it off then the next_day the money was in my account and recieved the package to send it off in really fast
0	?
0	when they arrived in nz they were held up with stephen at pediwear reassuring me that this can sometimes be the case .
0	an embarrassing experience !
0	- the service was easier than i thought it would be because the i didn ' t have to fumble around with decisions about postage methods and costs - mazuma does it for you !
0	turnaround 0 / 0 days .
2	will_definitely_use this company again !
0	considering the camera was sent from abroad , the dispatch time is fantastic and you can track you parcel all the way .
0	i just wanted to comment that i recently dealt_with mazuma and thought they were brilliant .
2	i finally received the glasses yesterday - 00th_january_0000 !
0	ability to get a label printed .
2	well in the case of digitalrev . com it really is true .
0	i ordered flowers and some additional products for around 00 pounds for my girlfriend on valentines_day , it ' s now the 00th and still nothing arrived to her house .
0	thanks !
2	this was a bulky item to go some distance and the delivery was made with simplicity and speed in a friendly and efficient manner .
0	0 days have passed no flowers ?????
2	tony
0	loved this great value for my phone & quick payment :)
2	i was looking at selling my mobile on ebay but they were not selling for much so i decided to use this service instead .
0	it came with all the original bits and pieces and packed in the original box .
0	i was so annoyed for my mum ' s sake .
2	the recipient was thrilled .
2	order arrived well_packed . excellent service
2	i had problems with an address for delivery so booked the whole_thing with catherine on live_chat .
2	i am emailing to say thank_you so much for a superb product , very polite & helpful service , and unbelievably speedy delivery , it is a superb fit and my husband is completely thrilled .
2	this was a really good move .
0	very pleased !
2	the price quoted before sending in the phones was exactly_what was received and the money was paid into my account very quickly - highly_recommended
0	( 00 / 0 /_0000 ) admitted error in the address on city_link side and issued a refund .
0	one thing i never get right is a decent pair of shades , and always buy some cheap local_supermarket knockoffs , then walk round ibiza looking like a blind man who has lost his stick .
2	but apart_from that , it was perfect .
0	no_complaints .
0	i always go to parcel0go . com , to book with tnt to send my parcels , it ' s fast and convenient .
0	i ordered a lovely plant for my nan and did all the choosing and ordering through the website .
2	excellent customer service and i will be using parcel0go exclusively from now on .

0	i ordered some soundmagic e00 ' s and some comply tips , the order was dispatched the next working day , arrived a couple of days_later in the post in a good heavy duty padded_envelope .
2	the help and advice from d . g .
0	i am completely disappointed in this service and i have not had any replies to my emails .
0	i received an_email later stating that they thought the flowers had been delivered at midday on 0nd september .
0	sceptics have no fear .
0	i ' d definately_recommend and use chemical_records again .
2	the staff are friendly and helpful and nothing is ever a problem .
0	i got up this morning and tracked it again , i saw my dad has signed the delivery in kuala lumpur while i was still soundly asleep in scotland .
2	everything_went_smoothly and i loved the way the order and shipment were tracked .
2	the signature was the key feature when customers said something hadn_'_t arrived , yet tracking revealed somebody had it .
0	just wanted to tell my experience with parcel0go , sent a parcel through parcel0go with collect_plus which i believe use yodel , i sent it off on 00th of april and got delivered the next_day !
2	thanks again .
2	if this is the service you get then this is the place i will buy from .
0	samantha saved the day after yodel let me down for the 00th time , waited in all day once again for yodel not to turn_up .
2	but after this latest disaster i will not be using them ever again .
2	you really brought a smile to this grumpy old fart '_s face .
2	excellent service goods arrived by return
0	the sale was a breeze as they sent me the bags - posted and received payment in a few_days .
0	i ' m pretty sure i have never been this pissed_off before
0	first , the frame legs are not at the same height , if i put the frame on the table , the right - side leg will incline upward !
2	ordered on boxing_day , arrived on 00 . 00 / 00 at the specified time .
0	cant get better_than that .
2	they blamed the sender for not packing it properly .
2	compaird with others that i used at the same time , i would come and use this company again , because i was not messed about and lied to , other_companys are deceitful , i sold 0 phones all to difrent companys and had trouble from all apart_from envirofone .
2	will order again using wowcher .
0	after all , they were happy to point the finger and put blame on me (' the order wasn ' t completed due to lack of input on my behalf ) so maybe they were right . maybe i was the moronic customer who was unable to place a simple order , that they ' d made me out to be !
0	i didnt have to waste my time finding the box and charger etc ( unlike with cex ), mazuma just wanted the phone and battery .
0	the checkout_process is easy and i received my packaging the next_day .
2	easy to use , quick , no_nonsense service & will_definitely_use again .
2	never had such excellent customer service like this before from an online company .
2	would not_hesitate to use your company again . thankyou . 00 / 00 .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	once he received them he rang me to say thank_you and that the flowers were beautiful .
2	fantastic price
0	they had the raybans i wanted for my winter sun holiday ( why is it so hard to find sunglasses in the winter even_though it ' s really sunny outside !).
2	i attempted to contact customer_services ( an 0000 number ) to no_avail .
0	absolutely_shocking service .
2	i received an_email_confirming my order straight_away and another email letting me know when my delivery had been made . my friend phoned me straight_away to let me know how beautiful the flowers were , so we were both very happy .
2	microwave arrived on time as advised , but it was only after i had signed for the package and turned it round that it became obvious to me that the packaging was damaged and the screen of the microwave was completely shattered .
2	i went back on ' livechat ' thursday_night .
0	i have been using p0g for around a year now and i would gladly recommend the service to anyone .
0	well_done mazumamobile :)
2	easy to access website .
2	once i got home from work i looked at them and was disgusted , i felt let_down , so much so i went to my local_florist and bought a decent dozen of roses that were not already dying ., so now i have paid twice . my wife is worth every_penny but i don_'_t expect to pay £_00 . 00 for dead flowers .
0	i ' ve had no reply , can someone please let me know when they ' ll be here ?
2	my juicer was in the cupboard for over 0 years as i had lost the food pusher .
0	i try calling several more times , but get the same message .
0	the fact that around 0 different people were messaging me made the whole situation a lot more confusing and stressful .
2	when i contacted them , they said " we need contact details for the sender ".
2	for me they are the only trusted source of courier prices and booking service , all in one place .
2	we have used this company a few_times now and everyone who has received the flowers stated how good they were .
2	i had already tried a competitor who tried to reduce the price saying my phone was water damaged which it wasn_'_t .
0	i was initially quite apprehensive_about buying jewellery online but now we won ' t hesitate to shop with you again in the future . the ring is so gently and beautiful and the size is
0	very efficient , very helpful and much_appreciated !
0	this is my second purchase from hifiheadphones . co . uk and they havent disappointed .
2	i have used fonebank for a number of years now to sell old_mobile_phones and have always found that they offer far better buyback prices and faster payment than any other company of this type in the marketplace .
0	i recently sold some phones to mazuma , they offered more money if you had the money put onto a card which you could use in argos , so i took that option . mistake , they make it so hard for you to spend the money , emails , activation_code , several telephone_calls to 00 numbers , it has probably cost me money to get_rid of the phones !
2	flowers basically said tough , won_'_t acknowledge that they are a fault at all and refuse to refund the payment .
2	she rang me to say she was in tears as they were beautiful and i ordered the teddy which was a dog being perfect as she has 0 dogs
0	very frustrating as it was needed for the saturday_night .
0	over the last_year or so i ' ve given webtogs more repeat_custom than any other online_retailer .
2	however , the day after i received an_email_saying the camera was despatched it arrived via_dhl .
0	one happy_bunny :-) would definately buy again as currently my wishlist just seems to be getinng bigger and bigger !
0	i definitely do not recommend !
0	item exactly as_described .
2	a truly first_class service and would highly_recommend to anyone .
0	having read all of the reviews and complaints regarding iflorists poor service i am getting increasingly anxious that a ) my girlfriend has not received her flowers , b ) i am not getting any kind of response from your so called ' online_chat ' and c ) i have no way of tracking / tracing my order .
2	i was over the moon when i saw that they could deliver the next_day , and i was even more impressed when i saw the price .
2	i was very pleased with the faultless efficiency of the service , being kept up to date of the delivery process was excellent .
2	the customer service was very helpful and i got all the information that i needed .
2	ordered flowers for my cousin '_s birthday had confirmation of delivery and my cousin was delighted she sent me photo and they did look beautiful .
2	good price , good service , highly_recommended thanks .
2	i must_say that your service is very outstanding , for free delivery , and notificaions when the order has_been despatched and arrived . text_messages and emails are received for tracking orders .
0	always there to help until an issue is fully resolved .
2	thank_you girls .
2	i had texts and emails_keeping me informed as the flowers were despatched and delivered .
2	mark
2	great .
0	i ' m absolutely_disgusted with this and won ' t be ordering from iflorist again .
0	keep up the good work .
2	the card included was not the advertised valentine card that i had chosen , but was instead a gift card with printed text .
0	such fast service !!
0	anyway , this happened on 0 occasions and really was embarrassing for me as they were for a birthday .
2	!
2	when there has_been a problem a phone_call or email is all that is needed and one of their staff is straight on the case .
2	excellent communication and sometimes day after delivery .
2	try them .
2	used the service several_times now and always been able to track items and all have been delivered in goo time
0	ordered a lens on monday_morning via the website and wednesday_morning it was in my hands !
0	richard_: hi fred i will have a look for you
2	operatives at the office very helpful when ever i have had to contact them .
2	she was so pleased with them , big hugs all_round .
0	easy to use , efficient and cheaper_than having to go and queue up at the post_office – an_absolute no_brainer !
0	their correspondence continued with them claiming to have sent me an_email confirmation for my original order - i can_assure you that this was not the case .
2	i raised with paypal , who after some ridiculous conversations said that delivery times were outside of the paypal guarantee ( bear this in mind - it was news to me ).
2	i wish i had looked this site up before as i quickly found a replacement in the spares section ; it was delivered very quickly and for a tenner including the postage i can now make apple juice again !
2	yes !
0	i would award them more if it was possible .
2	emma was very good .
2	thanks for everything .
2	i especially like the fact that they add the actual measurements of clothes on their website , which makes it so much_easier deciding on the right size to choose .
0	they were four days old and so had four days less time being alive when my girlfriend finally received them .
0	i bought some flowers from this site to be delivered this valentines_day .
2	thank_you and here '_s to more raw healthy meals
0	i work for an e_- retailer so i ' m only too familiar with the unexpected events that can occur during an order , however the quality of a company is defined by how you deal with your customers and how far you are willing to go to placate them in order to retain their business in future .
2	what an excellent service and so easy to process .
2	thank_you for a great experience !!!
2	a to b in less_than 00hours
0	sammie_taylor is very helpful .
2	first_class service just be aware of the postage you have to pay for the to the phone it can be very expensive as i found out
0	definitely a very good deal , o0 only offered me £_00 for the phone mazuma paid £_00 on .
2	i then checked my bank that same day and the money had been paid into my bank_account !
2	don_'_t used them .
0	recomendado .
2	it was sorted in double quick time .
2	why not , most companies can !
0	i found it very easy and simple , hassle_free , and definatly a site i will be returning too .
2	i placed the order 0pm and the recycle pack was with me next_day .
2	great service
0	also the battery pack has non uk connections but dr include an adaptor and the supply itself works across multiple voltage systems - all good !
0	and so well bubble - wrapped so my package was in perfect order .
0	i have already escalated your order for delivery status .
2	sadly most don_'_t care this much about their reputation and customers .
2	well package , not over killed , in case of accident one would realized how important is the good packaging .
0	got connected to a lovely advisor emily and she was very helpful and solved my problem within a few minutes !
2	i then discovered money had been taken from my credit_card .

2	we have spent thousands with this company over the years and it is not the first time this has happened but the first time they show no interest in our parcel being delivered on time except we will re - book it for you .
0	i prefer mens ones as they look better on me .
0	i would 000_% recommend this company to everybody .
0	i ' ve seen replies from the company on previous reviews that envirofone claim that delays are occurring due to high numbers of phones being sent in .

0	i ' m a long - standing fan of digitalrev and it ' s the only place i go to for my photographic equipment .
2	thank_you emma for sorting_out my delivery , your a star xx
0	obviously i am disappointed that less_than half the stuff i ordered arrived and that stuff that did arrive was not what was advertised / sold .
0	product arrived in good condition .
0	definitely recommended !
0	not sure whether this would be down to city_link but the contract was with interparcel so held them mostly responsible .
2	she is delighted with the gift and has_been telling everyone who will listen how beautiful the flowers are .
2	it was safe in my hands on the mon , excellent , fast professional service , thank_you .
0	i was expecting to receive a lower_price but not by more_than £_00 !

0	now i ' m getting phone_calls from firms i never_heard of stay_away from these con artist they sell your data
0	but if you take out all the fee ' s from ebay / paypal and the hasstle i was much_better off !
2	a simple apology would have meant so much , but this was too much_trouble from serenataflowers .
0	i will be buying from you again excellent service " and response from yourselves .
2	people believe me these e_- cigs are not " gimmicks " they actually work and if you really want to help yourself and perhaps your family / friends etc then try one , you will not be disappointed i guarantee you .
2	so the driver had the wrong_address maybe but parcel0go would not assist at all .
0	the site was very easy to navigate , making a purchase was simple and i received my order in less_than a week with no_hidden_charges .
2	there were no_problems at all as everything is clearly detailed along with options_available .
0	very polite and easy to talk too !

0	i received my good promptly ( 0 days before the expected arrival date ), everything was in good working order , no damage to the product or even the box .
2	still no flowers so rang again only to be told that they weren_'_t scheduled for delivery until today , when questioned about the emails and receipt all stating delivery date as yesterday her classic response was i don_'_t send the emails and i cant do same day delivery so you couldn_'_t , oh and its mothers_day tomorrow so she '_ll still get them in time . so much for satisfaction guaranteed .
2	i had to return the ladies tall pair i did buy as they were too_tight around the calf , but again the speed with which they were exchanged for huntresses was remarkable .
0	thanks !
2	a fast and efficient turnaround was achieved .
2	very helpful and sorted_out a problem that seems to be in the p0go software .
2	a text arrived 0wks later to say flowers were out for delivery , then another a few hours_later saying they ' d been delivered and at what time .

0	their glasses are even more beautiful in reality than they were in the pictures !
2	!
0	quality products at good prices .

0	i could not believe it .
2	the best and the people are very helpful
0	i ordered flowers for a friends birthday which never arrived .
0	i think my next step will be contacting_trading_standards regarding eflorist ' s poor product description .
0	only things that would make the service a lot better is 0 ) i thought £_00 for my phone was a little_bit cheap but it was so hassle - free i could cope with that and 0 ) they should have a section on there website which explains whats they do with the phones that they buy .
2	stunning in fact !
0	however , one of my customers cancelled their order so i attempted to cancel collection of the package .
2	great service from online_chat help : emma was very patient and helpful and made it so easy to to use this service

2	00 out of 00 just doesn_'_t seem enough , i shall be a returning customer .

0	still_waiting to hear from the company .
2	we had been looking for something to send to our clients as a gift that reflected our personalities too .
2	or if your mad enough try finding their contact telephone_number .
2	the customer service department is simply not interested in rectifying our problem , with comments of " these rose will eventually open to look like our website picture "
0	anyhow i will never use this service again !
0	complete and utter joke .
2	sent a few out to my 0 ' 00 '' daughter who is living in china and can '_t get warm tights long enough .

0	worst thing i have ever bought . nothing like what its supposed to , they delivered only a poxy 0 flowers which were not even supposed to be in the bouquet , who_knows what happened to the ones that were .
2	there wasn_'_t a card through the door door , so had they been stolen , i would never had known that they had been there .
2	communication was excellent , items as_described , ordered friday_evening - received monday - excellent ( uk customer ) - two_weeks before_christmas !!

2	i use it for taking photos of mineral specimens , which i will post on the digital_rev forums soon - but the new focus capability , sharpness , and metering is so much_better_than the mark 0 - video is awesome - in video mode , you can now focus almost continually by half pressing the shutter release , so although not constant , your vids stay in focus much more of the time .

2	i never write_reviews normally but felt it was worth it this time . it was the best price i could find for this lens ( without worrying_about duties and tax ).
2	if you want something thats on ebay and says " collection only " just ask if the seller minds you using a courier .
2	extra insurance is easy to add for valuable items e . g .
2	i could not believe this price included anti scratch and anti glare lenses ( and a case and cloth !).
2	hilarious that after order id it says it will make easier for them to reply to your review .

2	i mis_- weighed a parcel .
0	i can ' t fault the service received from digitalrev and dhl .
0	the wallet was the same price as it was on bellroy ' s site .
0	the problem was that they needed to match and i needed two of them !

0	i too have received awful service from collectplus , twice in a week , the first item arrived completely damaged after being thrown over a 0ft fence in different packaging to what i had used , they refunded me for the damage but nothing else , so i now have a completely_useless item that cost me over £_00 which is useless .

0	collect_plus charge £ 0 . 00 for the same size and weight .
0	found extera direct whilst searching for a supplier for legacy system phones , not only could they supply these at a fantastic cost but also supply us with our other telephony needs at a much reduced cost .

0	royal_mail really let the delivery down , but webtogs did everything in their power to get the order to me .

0	for all those who turn their noses up at it ' s apsc size and toy - like features , it ' s so small i take it absolutely anywhere , opening up opportunity for amazing snaps which would have been lost when lugging around a bulkier ( however superior ) camera .
2	i know that after ringing their kent based optician out of sheer desperation , who incidentally couldn ’ t do anything to help .
2	then after many more emails and 0mth later i got an_email that said that 0 parcel was in istanbul ( over 000_miles_away ) and the other were still in essex awaiting_collection ?

2	second time i '_ve used transglobal to ship computer parts to australia .
0	they refused to call me to sort it out - a next_day service has taken a week thus_far .
2	due to the recent changes for postal_charges lately it was apparent that i had to investigate a new way of sending off my ebay sales so as to avoid huge costs to both myself and the people buying from me .
0	alexandra was very helpful and friendly !!
2	thanks to the hifi_tower team regards sam whit
2	sort of spoilt the surprise really .
0	selectspecs genuinely need to invest in a small contact management team / call_centre and there is nothing more frustrating than trying to vent your frustration and sort an order than the lengthy and drawn out process of emails .
2	i have never use this or any company like this before , posted the phone on a monday and by thursday received confirmation that order was processed phone checked and cheque in the post very impressed and will be recommending this company to friends and family

0	0pm came and went so we had to leave the house , despite being very frustrated at this , knowing the fact that there were other people in the house who could have collected the delivery in our absence .

0	i needed to get_rid of my old phone and was hoping to get some money back for it .
0	it was my bank lloyds that put a block on the payment due to fraud .
2	a lady_called catherine assisted me with a simple query today .
0	would recommend to everyone .
0	super_fast order processing and an amazing turnaround on product .
2	thanks to alex i was able to find a pickup point close by as the seller was not prepared to sit around for 00_hours or more , and i do not now have to travel 000_miles to get my parcel .
2	my experience was fantastic .
0	had a query about a delivery so went on to live_chat and straight_away i was helped out by an adviser called sammie , went out of way to help me and was very polite , solved my query no_messing would like to thank sammie for all your help wish other firms would take a leaf_out of your book ,

0	cannot_fault the service one bit .
0	easy to use service , convenient pick_up times , very good value for money .
0	i ' m normally pretty excepting when things go_wrong , it happens .
2	the assistant then tried to sell me a uv coating , an anti - scratch coating , a non - reflective coating and a ' loyalty card ' for a discount on the £_000 + bill .
0	also the site offers three tempting rewards from depositing the cash directly into your bank_account with out any hidden_charges or get even more money if exchanged for an argos card !
2	i ' m more than an hours drive from the depot , so unless collect_plus use some sort of time machine , or star trek transporter , then i can confidently say they are liars & as such i ' m still_waiting for my parcel to be delivered .
0	0 star service !!
0	said my phone wasn ' t working just because it had a cracked_screen and offered me a ridiculously lower_price .
0	the live_chat is a great idea and proved very helpful .

2	i can '_t afford to lose that amount of money .
2	these wildflower seed packet place names will make a lovely addition to our wedding table .
2	sammie_taylor is the best , a0 , superlative .
2	i was slightly worried as i had sent 0 phones off so did send them by special delivery but needn_'_t have worried , within_00hrs i had my cheque !
2	would use again .
2	the option of a confirmation text at either end , for 00p , was a nice_touch !
2	i purchased a canon 0 x converter from this company .
0	every time i chat to them i have a feeling of being treated like a valued customer .
0	all good . keep up .
0	this is absolutely_shocking customer_service , and they ' re flagrant disregard for the quality of their service is frankly shocking .
2	parcel '_s 0 go all the time .
0	and i am still_waiting for the 00 / 00 delivery , expecting the same once opened .
2	i had tried a good number of places , but all i could get was a delivery for either the monday or tuesday .
2	full order delivered on the agreed day .
2	my email are always answered swiftly and professionally and my needs are met every time with a friendly email .
0	after much persisting , they gave me a phone number to call and they were much more helpful but none of them fed back any updates or the status of their findings at all despite my specific request for this on each occasion and their confirmation that they would advise me .
0	it was removed from my account , when it would have been easier if i could just renew the details .
0	my front_door was wide open since 0am as i had builders in the flat so where the driver actually left the card beats me ???
0	easy user_interface while online .
0	i read the hundreds of positive_reviews about the lens and the company so decided it was worth saving the £_000 against the current amazon price .
2	0 star service - would recommend to all .
2	great upgrade from my sony .
0	i was concerned_about what they would consider the phones condition was in , but needent have worried now £_00 + richer , cheers mazuma !

2	my issue was resolved within minutes !
0	it is so lovely , so awsome .
0	alix challis was so helpful and managed to arrange for our brother to receive a special wedding present .
0	my mum is very hard to please when you give her things but when she saw these beautiful flowers she said she loved them !
0	although they would cost £_000 to replace , i had not insured them fully so put in a claim for £_00 , the maximum i could .
2	i paid additional carriage costs to ensure that the order arrived before mid day .
0	missed the first deadline to be posted by , they simply extended the deadline with no_problems !

2	prompt service , great communication .
2	as a complete numpty regarding all things technical , these_guys have never discouraged my naïve phone_calls - talking me through processes and helping to build my knowledge and self confidence regarding my chosen method of using e_- cigs .
2	i bought a cd_player last september which i used very occasionally to play music when i was teaching a class of children .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting some quick cash .
0	i attempted to use their supposedly efficient , quick and easy online live_chat but ironically it displayed that every department was offline .
2	they didn_'_t show up .
0	i emailed them on the 0th day and no reply was given .
0	i bought some flowers to be delivered on the 0th but instead they were delivered a day early !
0	i was really surprised as i was expecting it to arrive within 0 - 0 days .
2	thanks
2	paul
2	.
0	very polite , patient and helpful and sorted out my problem .
2	my parcel happened to be an expensive lap_top computer .
0	because of the pricey cost of parcel delivery by air , i was hesitating whether or not to send the gifts & souvenirs i bought from turkey and greece to my family and friends in malaysia which i brought back all the way from my vacation trip to glasgow .
0	on top of everything , i saw the flowers yesterday and definetely not worth what i paid for !!!
0	their customer contact via_email is also excellent , they inform you every_step pf the was where your transaction is at in the process which is reassuring .
2	got my speakers within 0 days , what can i say . your business online the only website i can trust . i '_ll come back again .
0	sent it off and within a couple of days a cheque arrived through my door .
0	i have never gotten anything in the mails so fast .
2	on top of this their bespoke easy setup guide was invaluable and so much more useful than trying to use the manufacturer ’_s instruction_manual when setting_up my new system .
0	review of products ;
0	the way she spoke to me was absolutely unacceptable .
0	thanks very much bop_dj , i will be sure to use you again next time !
0	totally peed off and wasted my money and time sending it .
2	if only the couriers themselves delivered such a good service !!
2	i had three phones to get_rid of .
0	good stuff .
0	very very very happy !!!
2	emily the live_chat operator was very helpful
2	excellent service from a first_class company .
0	i ' m still_waiting for the £_000 from mfyp .
0	once i had gotten to the next stage i had not hesitation filling in my bank_details as it is well_known envirofone is a well trusted company and i knew that my details wouldn ' t be in the wrong hands .
2	and the weber spirit classic e000 is a great barbeque .
2	!
2	i purchased an astonishing value , sound - bar which is very well made and fills the house with 000 watts of balanced sound .
0	i spoke to emily on the live_chat who straight_away found the parcel in question changed the address and then resent me the new documentation to the desired email address .
2	painfully slow , i will never use them again , or buy from anyone that uses them .
0	price was competitive but not the cheapest .
0	the rates quoted i would say great value for money .
0	i had no_problems with this website .
2	probably , yes , but they could do with improving customer communication .
0	no_problems at all !
2	very quick great descriptions and pictures to see all angles .
2	i used the live_chat and spoke to philip .
0	thank_you rs !

0	there were no_quibbles over price and i have a good experience .
0	i have used this site several_times already . same result . order , pay , delivered next_day . great for those last_minute holiday sunnies !!
2	so quick and efficient would do it again .
0	i can ' t praise the guys at webtogs enough for there help .
0	sent perfectly working phone which after testing they claimed was damaged so reduced the quote substantially .
0	however the nerve of envirofone was to then offer me £_00 less for my phone due to the damage however a replacement back can be purchased for the princely sum of £ 0 . 00 .
2	thank_you so much emelie and stephanie .
2	this rather spoilt the surprise .
2	i put my order in and two days_later it was in my hands . what more could you ask for i was sent an e_mail to let me know the order had been sent i . am one happy customer .
0	ordered roses for valentine ' s on 00 january . to arrive on 00 february and like so many others , nothing arrived .
0	so i still check else where , but always buy from hifiheadphones .
0	i ' ve wasted £_00 . 00 and 00mins in total on the phone for my nan to end up with nothing !!!!
2	i placed an second order and got an_email_stating they had cancelled my order with no explanation .
2	i told them that my friend had not moved and no_intention of moving , they in turn contacted ups and told them to retry .
0	i ordered flowers for a collegues engagement , we ordered the largest size but what was delivered was the smallest size .
2	seeing right through that obvious rip - off , i went for the standard lenses only , but had to leave my glasses with them for the lenses to be fitted up .
2	i was kept_informed by email of the approximate time of delivery which was a great help in organising my day .
0	the service was brilliant and delivery even better .
0	fell like they cond me out my fone as no payment and no fone back either never be usen this again
0	ive already ordered more ( which incidently come tomorrow !)

0	piotr
2	i have used selectspecs on a number of occasions and have always received my glasses very quickly .
2	it was a medium spray and i ' d not gone for the large spray as i thought that might be too much , how wrong i was because they looked like a £_00 bunch of flowers you could get in any supermarket .
2	she was brilliant and resolved my problem in no time at all .
2	packaging was excellent .
2	i completed the information online , printed_off a postage label and posted it same day .
0	the lollipop at the bottom of the box is fantastic innovative marketing - whoever thought of that deserves a healthy bonus !
0	i received the missing items 0 weeks_later , though i play gigs and needed them before then .
0	the staff are very knowledgeable , friendly and provide and excellent service .
2	the website is so easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , and the short video ’_s are extremely_helpful .
0	i could barely hear them on the phone because the locker is by a main_road and the mobile signal is poor ( perhaps because it ' s at a petrol_station ?).
2	i wouldn_'_t go near fonebank again if my life depended on it .
2	welcome to parcel0go . com .
0	they give you a whole list of different services and prices ( kind of like with airline price comparison_sites ), with little labels to tell you which ones you need a printer for and which ones you don ' t ( which was also super handy , seeing as i don ' t have a printer on hand a lot of the time .)
0	would like to thank sarah_hayes for her help today .
0	he offered great customer_service , and answered all my questions clearly and precise !
2	trying to book a same day collection , system error came up , spoke with emma in live_chat who was only to happy to process my collection for me , she made the process easy for me so i didn_'_t have to start all over again and maybe lose my collection slot .

0	i had an issue placing an order online and samantha led me through this process online via live_chat !

0	i have spend an extra month sorting_out the repair of this and i have received no compensation for my time .
2	iona cockerill

2	geoff_: omg .
2	i was meticulous about giving the exact details on the prescription .
2	top_notch company
0	i ' ll be back on here shortly
2	had to email them as it costs 00p_per_minute and was told they would collect the parcel from italy and send to correct address in germany , even up till now the parcel has not been delivered , i sent the parcel on 00th_may !
2	this was all done with the minimum of fuss , and maximum efficiency .
2	this time the recipient described the flowers as ' stunning '!
0	the flowers were absolutely_gorgeous by my only problem was that they were delivered so late - around 0pm .
0	first time i have used prestige and certainly will be the last based on my experience so far .
0	it ' s a pity i have to rate them so low because i have bought things from them before , and they have very quick delivery , and a good range of products .
2	the simple glass vase could maybe a little bit cheaper though .
0	a personal_touch , much welcomed .
0	!
0	and let me tell you now . do not let that stop you .
2	i will recommend to my associates
2	i am going to be out of uk until the 0nd of june .
0	!
0	keep up the good work .
0	the best thing is some of the flowers open later than others so they look different everyday .
2	twice i have been let_down by citylink - i '_ve just spoken to alexandra , who listened to me rant . and arranged a collection by a different courier .
2	the google listing ( 0rd from top ) says ' fresh flowers guaranteed delivery to chiswick today '.
2	will be using again probably in the near_future when he realises there are more items he needs from home .
2	thinking_about it - its a great money making scam they are running - but is it legal - i shall investigate because assuming 0000s of customers have purchased similar they will be 00000s in pocket of goods not delivered .
2	i '_ll use this company again .
2	quick , money paid into my bank within 0 days
0	i would recommend them everyone .
0	and indeed i did not face more issues .
2	an excellent product . very good value .
0	thank - you .
2	can '_t complain_about anything really , as the headline says , very quick payment once the phones were received by mazuma , i was just a bit unlucky as the price for my n00 was a bit higher the week before , but not too worry
0	!
0	eveything was perfect .
2	i was very impressed indeed with the service , chuffed to bits with my new boots and would recommend this company to anyone .
0	i will appeal for your service in a future a recommend it :)
2	i thought it was almost too good to be true , £_00 for my old blackberry_curve !
2	catherine_corless was a really great help .
2	this company is number one , fantastic aftersales , i bought a auna amp - 0 compact pa hi -_fi karaoke amplifier 000w which developed a fault , i contacted hifi_tower who arranged everything for me to return & choose a skytronic 0 . 0 home_cinema karaoke amplifier 000w with just a slight cost , it '_s one i chose , there customer support is fantastic a real_pleasure to deal with , keep_up the good work .
2	amazing service ( especially considering 00nd january was a bank_holiday also )
0	make_sure before you go the shop you phone first !
0	poor service all_round .
0	i ' ve bought stuff from ebay and amazon and most of the time it ends up going back .
2	i then realised that i had put the wrong house number .
0	maybe he can make the current chairman or whoever the top man is at the moment his darth maul .
0	parcel0go_agent : ive fixed it for you now .
0	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anybody , cant knock them 0 *!
2	i ' m now looking to purchase a tripod and will_certainly be using digitalrev to buy that too .
2	would use again .
0	very impressed and will_continue to use digitalrev for the majority of my camera_equipment .
2	bestiller ovenlysgardin onsdag aften , bliver leveret mandag formiddag .
0	i ' ve left my original review below but things have not gone as well this time .
2	nothing happened .
2	you ' re given a whole load of different avenues to explore ; express service , standard service , collection points etc and the prices are transparent with no strings attached ( forgive the pun ).
2	i have received 0 more parcels via dpd with next_day delivery . excellent tracking and the time - slot spot on . the drivers always pleasant and cheerful .

0	i bought a pair of speakers from bop_dj , and am very happy with my purchase and their customer_service .

0	then i called back your number and sara picked_up , she said that this will be delivered by tomorow on 00th_may .
2	he also replied quickly but didn_'_t make me feel rushed .
0	the packaging was brilliant , i would feel_safe chucking the box down a flight of stairs with the camera in it .

2	did a price match for me no problem and sandals were delivered within_00hours
0	i highly_recommend using this company to recycle your old_phones .

0	the flowers were delivered on the wrong day , they were old and dying ( had brown bits on them ) and the card was poor quality ( the printing was scabby ) with another customers message inside ; it really does ruin the sentiment when the card signs off from someone_else .

2	i sent them my handset on monday and they confirmed receipt of it on tuesday .
2	we had a problem booking online when our pc crashed right at the end and took us right back to the beginning .
2	my friend ordered flowers in england to be sent to her mum in spain for her_birthday .
0	only have good things to say .
0	basically just epic underwear .
0	[_name ] was so helpful and so quick to solve my own mix_up and it was all done through chat online .

2	i never_heard back from either of them .
0	great sale .
0	i would definitely use this company again .
2	my sister in law is very pleased with the flowers and chocs !
2	although customer service was fast to reply , and there were no issues as such with my order , it seems a bit_slow to have to wait ten days for just a magazine .
0	how this can be the case , when i have still no word as to why my flowers were not delivered , is a mystery .
2	my parcel was collected damaged then you disposed of it without having the courtesy of telling_me what you did i was not given the chance to have it back no refund or compensation offered so i have lost my parcel and money beware before you use this company never again , i will tell everyone i know what has happened and post on every forum to warn_people how parcel0go treat their customers
2	good service
0	i have used mazuma three times now and every time they have been excellent .
2	prices are very competetive and the web_site is clear and easy to use .
2	i shall not use iflorist ever again .
2	it '_s great to know my things have been in such good hands and the tracking is uodated so promptly . just had a message from the recipient to say they have arrived and on looking at the tracking_details they are indeed recoprded as having been delivered !

0	i ordered flowers from the u . s . for an anniversary with my girlfriend who is visiting london .
2	highly_recommended .
0	i dig down to find out why there was a return .
2	then i got an_email from them saying the price quoted was changed due to a damaged case and a chip so the price was £_00 less it may be me but was it damaged in transit or are they just saying that to try and get it cheaper i '_ll never know as i needed the money , i do believe that it is possible to have been damaged in transit as i have seen some delivery drivers throwing parcels about in there vans .
2	fantastic service from start to finish .
0	now the only life time lasting thing will be the embarrassment of not having given flower to my other half after giving birth .
2	there is a big integrity factor when recycling mobiles online like this but if you follow the rules then you get a good return and a fair price for your device .
0	these_guys only offer support via_email so no phone numbers and in my experience anything up to several days can go by before you get a response .
0	thank to alix challis did a good job of checking details and requests when the online website can ' t updated on time !
0	good service via the chat operator , sammie_taylor .

0	great customer_service :) mainly katie fom " livehelp " such a helpful young_lady
0	but i would not recommend this company due to my bad_experience .
0	i feel it only fair that i follow_up my initial review by adding that since making my complaint i was promptly contacted by the collectplus customer care team who have been excellent in addressing my concerns .
0	i include a link to a website regarding iflorist posting fallacious positive_reviews on themselves in the past [_link ]
2	i knew serenata would deliver a good service as used them before .
0	i ' m sorry about the swear words .
2	i will most certainly use the company again and have already_recommended it to 0 other people .
0	the customer_services agents didnt have a clue about what was going on with both my orders
0	i got a pair of prescription designer_glasses which were less_than half the price i would have paid on the high_street .
2	i '_ve tried_ringing , but from the other comments on here that '_s a waste of time .
0	it is not acceptable !!
0	after this , i assumed i ' d have another go uploading a photo but i wasn ' t prompted to !
2	just hope my daughter is as thrilled with the jacket and that it fits !
2	very pleased with the prompt and courteous service .
0	until the uk wakes up to the fact there is a global market and the fact that no amount of minimum price fixing is going to resolve that , i will_definitely be buying from you guys .
0	they literally tried to blame it on me saying that it was my fault for not reading the fine print .
2	mary goretti pettitt
2	their prices were below what i could have paid in the uk , and this included the dhl - who '_s website told me where the package was each_step of the journey .

2	they suggested i might need a 0 . 0 so sent these .
0	i ' m more_than satisfied .
0	cant phone them as they dont have a telephone_number listed .

0	i was unlucky enough to chose cash0phones via sellmymobile . com and had endless trouble , however , i eventually contacted sell my mobile and got a very helpful response from claire who assured me that she ' d get it sorted and true to her word she did !
0	the reply i eventually got was that although the website advertises " guaranteed courier delivery " ( which i opted for ), i should have seen in their small_print that they cannot guarantee any delivery dates .
2	had to contact them today to rebook a collection due to having to suddenly go out and sarah_hayes was extremely_helpful .
0	on time delivery , good price as well , i am enjoying it
2	this is the second time i have dealt_with mazuma_mobile , i am really impressed with the prompt service in all_aspects of the transaction .

0	catherine_corless helped_me by filling it in for me and i can now email her the contact number when i get it ( which i wouldn ' t have been able to leave off had there been no live help ).
2	however , in the case of mazuma , this is certainly true .
2	the seed packet information is always very useful as is the web_site with an extensive variety of seeds and plants etc .
0	i resonantly got the s0 from there and the info i got while talking to them about it was 000_% and by the time i got home and took the controller out the box i didnt even have to read the manual as i was should in shop how to set_up and the basic lay_out with everything the told me i was able to bang out a sick set the same night so to some production_room up 000_% guys keep it up ow sorry about the spelling but who need words wen u have beats to do the talking for u thanks again guy .

2	sammie_taylor understood and dealt_with my query professionally
0	00 emails later i finally got it sorted but they were very accusing of me and wouldn ' t take_responsibility as it was sent from a post box even_though they received they other 0 in the same envelope !

0	flowers arrived in perfect_condition , on time .
0	placed my order on the 0th_december and still not received , despite a dispatch email being sent to me on the 00th_december .
0	00_%_off is not a patch of compensation towards how rude and disrespectful your staff have been to me , but i ’ d have to be hugely deluded to think that you ’ d be willing to give anything more back to a very upset customer .
0	i like envirofone as it helped_me sell my phone to pay bills and it help me out alot and tell people how much it help me out when i did not have no money that week .
0	myself and my husband had our_wedding_rings designed by diamond_geezer .

0	with my training , he will become ceo of parcel0go and have his own minions .
0	!
0	on top of that , it was expertly packed .
0	the whole_process is smooth and the communication from mazuma regarding the receipt and processing of my old phone was immediate and flawless .
0	!
0	i have sent my phone on friday , the order was processed monday_morning and by monday_afternoon the money was on my account .
0	i was originally attracted to the white finish option ( we have a white baby grand piano in the club ) . so i ordered them .
0	it wasn ' t immediate but coz they were upfront about it that ' s no problem .
0	very pleased to find this website . saved me our 00 pounds . delivery arrived within 0 days .
0	contacting them via_twitter i ' ve had almost instant responses from sam or kate and also received great service on the website ' s direct messenger .
2	turned_out it was my own fault for taking it to a hermes collection store , talk about helpful , catherine_corless dropped a link on this chat_window that took me within ine mile of where i need to drop the parcel , even better done all this in my lunch our and the drop_off store is on my way to work .
2	flowers delivered were beautiful - exceeded all my expectations
0	she arranged for collection and delivery exactly when i required it , nothing was a bother to her .
0	perfect !
0	the thing that stood out was that they answered my ' order comments ' quite quickly by reply on email , which is so rare these days with online purchasing .
0	i mean normal opening hour from 0am night to 0am morning what ' s not possible to contact with them those who live in eu and uk .
2	the whole_process of selling an used mobile_phone could not have been simpler or quicker .
2	never used this service before & daniel guided_me through the whole_process , very pleasant_experience , feel_confident to use them again in the near_future many_thanks
2	end provide the best customer experience of any clothes shop that i '_ve bought from - i simply can '_t fault their online service .
0	thanks a lot sam !!!
0	thanks !
0	edit - it says below that eflorist contacted me .
2	despite my own limited expertise and that i was only buying a fairly inexpensive product , i was treated as though i was buying the most expensive thing imaginable .
2	what more could you ask for ?
0	!
2	well_worth the money , when thye have a offer on just order , think of someone you like and just order !
2	i wear them all the time .
2	much_easier than going straight to the courier company .
0	( 00 / 0 /_0000 ) still full of useless excuses they cannot backup .
0	it came safely and quickly , with no issues or lack of communication with the seller .
2	i enjoyed talking to remi today who was very helpful and kind , and resolved my problem in seconds .
2	i knew what was happening to my order and when it would arrive .
0	i bought a large sony tv from this online shop .
0	we doubt they are real company .
0	in conclusion iflorist will fail to deliver your flowers on time .
2	arrived on time .
2	i specifically_asked for the sp 000 which has no knobs at all on the front , and they sent me a sp000s which isn_'_t the same .
0	great choice of products and great customer_service .
2	they offer rapid delivery times , outstanding selections & quality with prices that cannot be beat , anywhere , period .
2	a bigger box , at over 0kg and a small box at 000g .
0	order no 000000 .
2	unfortunately the collection on this failed .
0	i decided to explain it to them again , making it clear that i was at the address all day .
0	once again i was shocked to discover how completely_different the bouquet was from the flower_arrangement i chose .
0	the flowers were delivered 00_mins before my mum left for work and i would have been infuriated if they had not arrrived on time .
2	when i buy another camera or lens , i will not_hesitate using digitalrev again .
2	i will no_longer be using any other company as safercigs always steps up to the mark !!!!
2	sellers beware .
2	i live in the west_midlands and found you on google , and i must_say what excellent service start to finish !
0	purchased the classic rayban wayfarer ' s in black , genuine product , delivered quickly for a really good price .
0	i will not be able to send the gifts to my family without the help from [_name ].
0	as i am a student studying photography , the canon_00d i ordered was the perfect price .
2	sammie_taylor was a brilliant help to me , wish all people were like her , its great to know you can talk to someone like her and sort any_problems you might have without having to hold the phone for an_hour
0	i ordered a barbour jacket , and it arrived the next_day .
2	nothing bad to mention as i didn_'_t have any hassle to use your service
2	by far the cheapest i have found , and actually comes with a cartridge unlike_other_sites .
2	the flowers were left at the front_door ( i assume no reply was had ) and when the recipient opened the door she said that she was thrilled to find them there !
0	i want to say thank_you very much , i have got my
2	looked like they had been prepared earlier in the day .
0	the price was reasonable which is why i chose them , but since receiving the flowers i can see that the price is not reasonable , it ' s blantant theft .
2	- certainly not me .
0	all gooood
0	i was also very pleased at the condition of the products i received , as they were in their original manufacturing packaging and the packaging used for their postage , made sure they reached clean and intact !
0	we were recommended by a friend who uses parcel0go all the time .
0	not had any_problems apart_from one parcel slightly_damaged , got the claim sorted quick and easily no_messing_about .
0	i had to send about 0 emails and wait 0 weeks before i got a response .

0	don ' t really like that i ' ve had to sign_up to a facebook to write this but robert did such a good job that it ' s worth it !!
2	it is about time they provided a good service or shut_down . we , the customers , have had enough
2	prices are all there for you to chose from and the site is really easy to use .
0	love the youtube show , love the camera store .
2	i found it all an easy un complicated service .

0	the service was fast ( all wrapped up within three days ) and i i received my chosen method of payment with no trouble at all .
2	registering with webtogs for availability of shoes i ' d been searching for months for , quickly had them on my doorstep .

0	info : welcome to city - link - clickandsend . com .
2	i then cancelled , because i was on night duty after that day and didn_'_t want the courier to arrive and wake me up . so he arrived anyway on the following_day despite having been cancelled !
0	an_hour later , another friendly e_- mail confirming it had been despatched .
2	thank_you
2	some companies selling on the internet are faceless .
2	definitely not £_00 worth .
0	not as high a price as some other_sites but guaranteed amount paid and very quickly the money was in my bank .
0	i remember the names of all the representatives i spoke to , and i had to be passed on to another lady because the first one ran out of the same excuse to give me .
0	the gift pack is a little underwhelming , but the microfibre cloth is a must as always .
2	thanks very much for your patience webtogs .
2	a very good price and an excellent service
2	lo and behold i checked my bank_account on line straightaway and the money was there .
0	after 0 days i received an_email to say the glasses would be with me between 00 - 00 working_days .
2	also , there was no secure payment system in place when providing my credit_card_details .
2	ordered my sunglasses from sunglasses_shop using the price guarantee they promised , and they kept that promise in matching the online price from another retailer at a greatly_reduced price .
2	most intelligent / helpful person i have spoken to in years
0	if you want friendly , knowledgeable people then don ' t hesitate to go with diamond_heaven .
2	i did receive an emailed apology .
2	they ' re always good on there , and tonight i was superbly assisted by katie , who seemed to understand my needs and problem without_any difficulty .
2	spent_ages looking for a good site for mothers_day flowers and found iflorist .
0	would highly_recommend them
0	i was excited to find a smart socket which an api i could build upon , but unfortunately there is close to zero documentation .
2	wendy_hall : are their any competent staff in this office ?
0	i will always use diamondgeezer and also recommend the site to friends and family .
2	arrived next_day and given precise timing of delivery , why can '_t all companies be like this one .
0	payment for my old gadgets was made the same day zoomfishgadgets received my goods .
2	these flowers were ordered as a thank_you and were very much_appreciated .
0	i had a small issue with one , but one call to daz and the problem was solved .
2	i bought these flowers for my wife on her_birthday and was a bit disappointed with the

0	around this time there was a lot of snow , so it was understandable that they were not delivered that day or the following weekend .
2	excellent service .
0	absolutely_brilliant service , ordered at nearly 00pm and they were delivered free by 0pm the following_day !
0	i used interparcel a few_times in the last years and i wasn ` t dissapointed even once .
2	would definitely_use them again .
0	:)
0	the person i spoke to at iflorist was very nice and gave me a full_refund and let us keep the flowers .
0	!
2	the last order i placed were for my mum '_s birthday ( amazonia ) which were also stunningly beautiful .
0	payment was made later on that day with another email to confirm this .
0	absolutely_terrible service , was promised my delivery for the 00th_may 00 by dpd but that had changed by 0pm that day as the parcel was still in birmingham .
0	by lunch on the 00th i used their online_chat facility , very quick response saying order suspended because i was being offered an_alternative .
0	free shipping with good transit time ( to sweden )!
2	a bunch of liars .
0	well_done guys and girls .
0	they were quick taking the money from my account but with not collection at all sound a bit of scam .
2	a prompt response and easily sorted .
2	they put customer_satisfaction at the heart of what they do .
0	*****************************************************************************************
0	i wanted to add an extra note to the collection address as it is difficult to find .
0	good value , and loved the fact the text me at every_stage to let me know where my order was at .
2	packaging , delivery and communications were exemplary .
0	i ' m looking for a courier service for my business to send about 00 parcels a week and then increase this to around 000 per_month by the end of the year .
2	combined they were worth £_000 .
0	wherever a change to an order needs to be made or whenever a fault or mistake needs to chased up , the customer_service team have done nothing but impressed .
0	it was completely hassle - free and i was able to track the progress of the delivery online .
2	i really cannot_fault this service and the quality of the reaction when something does go slightly awry .

0	i love parcel 0 go anyway , they have been my savior for my little business .
2	i wanted to send some flowers as a thank_you .
0	!
2	i would definitely not recommend this company to anyone !
0	great service , pity i couldn ' t go in person this time to their great shop and audition room
0	money paid into my account the same day and clear emails throughout keeping me posted of progress .
2	only negative was that the user_manual was in chinese and i had to download and print the uk version .
2	they kept me up to date every_step of the way by email .
0	!
0	would always use this company .
2	this company is an excellent find !
2	top quality item at an extremely_competitive price .
2	delivery should have been made on 00th_may , but wasn_'_t .
0	it ' s now 00 : 00 00 / 00 /_0000 however still nothing .
0	as this was for a birthday_gift i was majorly disappointed and pretty_much ripped_off .
0	thanks you !
0	i do all my headphone and accessory shopping here now , and i take every opportunity to recommend them to friends .
0	please dont hesitate .
2	firstly , no card left as no - one came to make any delivery .
2	when we didn_'_t get to the door quickly enough , they were put in our dustbin .
2	just took me an_email to get a new one .
2	i did not say anything because i did not want to draw attention to it .
0	a personal_touch on a web purchase is rare these days so they deserve a recommendation .
0	i have contacted them since and still no correspondence .
2	when booking , it states that there is £_00 . 00 of insurance_cover included .
2	very good service , i am really pleased with my glasses .
2	however on phoning the company i was told they had tried to contact me several_times to inform me that they were out of the size 0 and to ask if i would like to try the size00 and i was advised to check my e_mail junk box .
0	the whole_process was so easy and the ring far outweighs my expectations !
2	i received a beautiful_bouquet on my birthday delivered by prestige_flowers .
2	i like the way flora queen keep me informed from order to delivery .
2	great site , great prices and fast service .
2	excellent and fast service .
2	sorry suttons but very disappointed with your service , will_certainly not be giving you my custom again , you should be_ashamed .
0	be sure to see for yourself , you ' ll find something to make your special people happy there !
0	should be reported to watchdog hiding_behind " its not a guaranteed service " and taking for a service they are not providing is nothing short of theft !
2	just had wonderful service from alexandra in customer_services i thought i would let you all know as it doesn_'_t happen often nowdays .
0	luke .
0	i am fed_up with companies passing the buck .
2	great halloween costume .
2	and offerd to give everyone a refund .
0	flowers were fresh and smelt lovely .
2	i '_ll certainly go back .
2	my husband and i saw the select_specs site but were dubious in the first_instance with regard to quality and also the likelihood of making errors when in putting our own prescription details and so we chose glasses from the cheap frames section to try them out .
0	items damaged when arrived no communication from them , have tried_contacting them but they do not respond .
0	it is a great international experience .
2	emma the girl thats been helping me sort a few things out has_been very helpful .
0	thanks again .
2	first_class service & very quick delivery .
0	they don ' t feel responsible for not delivering the flowers by the time they promised !!
0	would definitely use again and recommend to a friend - superior service and quality to anything i have experienced when using interflora or any other competitor .
2	and this is the case .
2	they said that was the end of the matter .
2	the web_site is excellent and is matched by the product & service .
2	ruth from bristol
2	i '_ve used digitalrev before and this experience only re - enforces their reputation for excellent products and services .
2	i '_ve ordered from this company on a number of occasions . items usually arrive next_day , are good quality , and the returns process couldn_'_t be easier .
0	ready for mother ' s day my girlfriend ordered flowers that were supposed to be delivered today ( 0 / 0 /_0000 ) but now 00 . 00pm and no flowers arrived at my mother in laws house

0	online operator , susie , was very helpful .
2	and it '_s me that has to suffer by having to pay twice when you are the ones at fault .
2	i had two phones , one a year_old and another less_than 0 months , a touch phone that i was just unable to get along with .
2	took it to the post_office , got a proof of delivery and within a few_days , receipt was confirmed and payout sent the same day !!
0	i want to get some stand from linc .

2	countertop magic cleaner was recommended by the fitter for our new worktops and he left behind a 000 ml bottle .
0	mfyp offered me £_00 more_than other_companies - i sent my phone , they tested it the same day it received and told me when my payment was scheduled .
0	in instances where parcel0go have missed a collection they have always been favourable and offered a free recollection , credit to the account or a guarantee within a few hours that the parcels will be collected .
0	00 days latter , the glasses are sending back with lenses replaced and frame fixed .
0	if you arranged a collection straight from the yodel website and anything goes wrongthen you have to call them , possibly struggle and re - arrange everything !
2	a family ' consortium ' led by a 00 year_old uncle bought me an aspinal of london bag for my 00th_birthday .

2	0 weken geleden had ik bloemen besteld voor mijn moeder , er zaten tulpen in het boeket en die voldeden niet aan de hoge kwaliteit die we gewend zijn van fe .
0	its poor < very poor indeed . its shameful to me have to put a 0 star_rating .
0	either end of the transaction was fine , but the security faff in the middle was entirely unnecessary and felt very amateur .

0	andrew .
2	very well received card balloon and teddy_bear , thank_you for a swift delivery which meant i didn_'_t miss a birthday , i would most definately_use again as i have already used this florist before !

0	the flowers had not been received by her and to make_matters worse she had secretly sent me a valentines gift .
0	my query was dealt_with swiftly and i really felt that the team we working hard to resolve the issue on my behalf .

0	spend a little extra and boycott this shambles of a company
2	sammie was efficient and very helpful when processing my order online .
2	what a fantastic level of customer service and fantastic quick response from sarah .

2	well , you do that , don_'_t you ?
0	everytime i email the company they take a good couple of working_days to reply when all i want to know is the status of my order .
0	i read on pixmania delivery info that the package should be opened and checked on delivery to see if it was damaged or defective , since accepting it or signing it without doing that would deem it was delievered in working condition and i wouldn ' t have much ground to return it or get a refund .
2	very pleased with my first purchase .
2	bit of a major error for a delivery company .
0	so all ' s good .
0	got to praise pixmania .

0	i don ' t normally_write_reviews unless something bad has happened , but they really excelled themselves compared to interflora .
2	would recommend them time and time again , many_thanks .
0	i think they do make up for their price cuts , with other little items like memory_cards , which seem to be more_expensive on digital_rev than amazon !
2	i had a problem with a parcel that would not register when i took it to the collection point , i contacted parcel0go through their livechat service and spoke to amber who was very helpful and sorted_out my problem quickly and in a really friendly way - thanks amber and parcel0go !

2	i was in hong_kong over xmas 0000 and it was cheaper to buy from uk for item delivered from hong_kong than when your in hong_kong .

2	waited in from 0 am to 0 pm no apologies and non acceptance of blame .
0	sarah p checked and told me i could still get a collection sorted for today , my order was processed with her help and made it so easy for me to get my collection sorted for today .

0	great job mazuma !
0	fast payment .
0	all the way through i was kept well informed via the online tracking and my 0d arrived very well_packaged and i absolutely love it and the 00 -_000mm .

2	i set_up the camera '_s and harddrive before installation which i probably wouldn_'_t have done without the suggestion in the video_clip so i knew everything worked before installing .
0	i would advise_anyone_looking at purchasing from these not to bother .

2	i have to say this company delivered very promptly .
2	i use carriers from time to time however , from now and into the future i will use p0g because of their service and because i could ship more than one item in one transaction .
2	i ordered a fuji xt0 on the thursday_afternoon , they posted on the friday and it arrived on the monday_morning - to scotland all the way from hong_kong .
2	this company is appalling and shouldn_'_t be allowed to trade .

2	delivered exactly on the day i asked for .
2	i made a mistake and was at first frustrated that i couldnt put it right but then i spoke with catherine whose knowledge about your company helped_me resolve my problem .

2	did excactly what they said they would .
2	highly_recommended .
2	taking into account this item was shipped from hong_kong to england i was stunned to see the dhl courier standing at my door less_than two days_later .
2	i have tried a number of places but have had most success with sutton seeds , very high_quality products with no selling gimmicks .
2	would i buy from digitalrev again ?.
0	the entire_process was emotionally taxing for me and physically for my father who is retired .
0	oh i almost forgot how generous they are for their regular customers offering discounts up to 00_% on their whole selection of amazing flowers .
2	thinking i would get stung with massive delivery charges i was reticent to order but discovered that delivery and packaging was included .
0	their service never disappoints me .
2	she was professional but friendly clearly knowing exactly_what she was talking_about & hallelujah !
2	then , they offered a " redilivery " ( sic ) a couple of days_later .
0	very fast delivery time and excellent response time and understanding of a faulty item which was replaced within a week .
0	and they gave me a good price !
0	the items are not unique to the site , so in future will_definitely be avoiding this company , wish i ' d read the reviews before i ordered !
0	i got a good price for a old_mobile so i am very happy with this service .
2	would you like to receive this credit as an online gift_voucher that can be redeemed on our website ?

2	highly_recommend that you get that old phone in the mail and get something back for your trouble !
2	as i am open to new ideas i decided to follow the recommendation and i was not disappointed at all .
0	their messaging system is ridiculous so it ' s impossible to have a proper conversation , and they don ' t have a phone number .
0	i ordered some flowers and was assured they would come on the day i specified .
2	she '_s efficient and obviously knows her stuff !
0	i ' ve never had any_problems , not even little hiccups .

2	thanks serenata !
2	when went out to great him .
0	it ' s excellent .
2	i had a problem with the postcode when i entered it into the form , it was showing invalid ,
2	they had a good selection , and i chose a huge bunch of pink roses and lilies .
2	a first_class supplier with prices to match .
0	and although there was an extra charge it was easy to pay for .
2	easy to organise delivery of your parcel , clear pricing options .
2	saves me money .
2	flowers were not anything like i ordered , certainly not in large , and even the free card they sent was not the one i chose , and they wording i put was printed over wording already on the card !!!
0	my problem had been resolved soon after chatting with william .
0	thank_you [_name ].
2	the whole experiance was so easy to follow the step by step instructions that were sent by post and the cash went into my account no_probs
2	not an easy task .
0	the service is awful , i ' ve had to continually repeat the problem , no reply to messages , no follow ups , i sent pictures as soon as they asked for them and now i ' m being told the company don ' t give refunds !!
0	would def_recommend and use again .
0	i was disappointed they could only offer a single delivery option that covered the saturday and sunday of the following week , but reluctantly_accepted that the flowers might be a day early .
0	the photo was beautiful , a bunch of pastel coloured assorted flowers in a gift bag .
0	my questions on delivery and change of shipping address were promptly answered .
0	cheapest price anywhere on the internet .
2	i took mine to charity shop but they weren_'_t keen .
2	the whole_process was simple and easy to complete !.
0	what clinched it for me was that they took care of the customs issues that can plague a purchase from overseas and delivery was included in the price .
0	three times now , my flowers have either been delivered on the wrong date or not at all .
0	great service , fast delivery and cheap prices for quality goods .
0	such a shame that a mother will not be receiving a present tomorrow as i requested delivery today to ensure she got them on time . shame on you for not doing as you promised . yet you took the money from my account . theives
2	so far so good .
0	im am a very happy customer and would use this service over and over again !
0	would i use serenta again ?
0	still no sign on saturday so phoned helpline in liverpool to be told i should expect it tuesday .

2	flowers were stunning and arranged beautifully !
2	excellent service and cheap ive used them a few_times when sending items to usa from uk and they the cheapest by miles , would deff use and recommend to anyone , a big plus is there customer service nothing is ever a problem and they are always there to help asap
2	great service really fast payment very easy would recommend no problem .
2	keep_up the good work !!!!!
2	many_thanks .
0	if people have trouble with this company then contact them first rather_than slating them as they will go above and beyond to help you !
0	good job well_done mazuma , i will_definitely use you again , and yes i would recommend you to a friend .
2	i was very impressed with the service from kiltmakers and wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend them .
2	i would definitely_use them again and would very strongly_recommend them .
2	the whole_process was first_class .
2	tried them on .
0	problem resolved very quickly , catherine very helpful .
0	the item was delivered in bari , italy , only 0 days after the payment .
0	edit_: i spoke to william on the live_chat help thing .
0	after i asked why the company deemed it acceptable that i should have to wait in for another day due to their incompetence , she said ' i have told you it ' s coming by 0 : 00 today what else do you want me to do ?'
2	the parcel was a drop_off parcel which i booked through parcel0go and a number of local shops came up on the map where i could drop my parcel .
2	before i decided to buy the camera from degitaldev , i have done some study and checked the feedback online .
0	no_complaints from me .
2	she phoned me and said she was so pleased to receive these flowers .
0	they continually update their twitter and facebook yet cannot respond to customer ' s refund requests or queries .
2	it would make sense for the florist to contact the customer should they be unable to fulfill an order .
0	no_complaints at all .
0	overall , great and prompt service .
0	thanks !
2	the great thing is that if you have questions or problems you can use " live_chat " to get them fixed .
0	when the jacket arrived , unfortunately it was too smal , so i returned it requesting an exchange for the next size up .
0	i came_across this site whilst looking for a lacoste polo shirt for my holiday , they offered much_better prices than others so i placed an order .
2	thank_you .
2	use interflora . do not use these rip_off merchants .
2	very proffessional with order confirmation and despatch information e_- mailed immediately the order was ready .
0	i guess i shouldn ' t complain too much because , unlike others , the flowers arrived , but it is still annoying .
0	bought something off ebay , the seller was charging a silly delivery costs so i sorted it 00_% cheaper at parcels0go but he had no printer so couldn ' t print off the label .
0	the next_day i emailed again and got a reply to say that they had refunded as they do not have any florists in the area !!
2	took 00_mins to order a bouquet over the phone - probably on a premium_rate line .
0	payment was prompt and i ' m already looking at selling my mobile phone to them .
2	however the camera arrived from digitalrev in hong_kong just as quick , with no horrendous delivery charge added on , and with much more detailed tracking_information .
0	very user_friendly and value for money with a variety of payment options :) no_problems here :)
0	the flowers arrived this morning and they are not what i ordered , i asked for tulips and they have sent roses .
0	you ' ll be satisfied when you buy british fashion items .
2	i will be using this site again
2	definitely on my " favourite " list .
0	i asked about the lack of pick_up and was told the courier had been at 0pm .
0	they told me that the tnt driver said he left calling notes which is simply not true but they took his word for it .
2	the camera was set to display in chinese , so it took a bit of fiddling to get it to english .
2	booked a collection at 00 . 00 , made a mistake , sorted it out in 0mins on live_chat , parcel picked_up at 00 . 00 - excellent
2	a thread on moneysavingexpert . com reinforces this opinion , insofar as nearly every poster endorses the fast turnaround and excellent prices paid .
0	quick and simple and the best thing is that the money was in my account within 0 day .
0	thanks rob for making my day .
2	now i am going through visa to get a refund please do not order from this company !!
2	no duty to pay .
2	parcels0go stinks .
0	no_worries !, i was contacted by polite and knowledgable sales
2	however , after lengthy delay i got my items which i am pleased with .
2	they should be more honest right there on the product page on what timeframe you can expect .
2	i trust this is a true representation of the quality of service of parcel0go .
2	you have a very easy website to use , good graphics and choices of both styles , colours and prices .
0	the glasses are good value , which allows me to have a pair in every handbag and every corner of the house !
0	i would also like to take this further and if i haven ' t received a refund and an_apology swiftly , then i intend to do so .
2	john browes
2	it was returned to me but they didn_'_t know it had been !
0	( it is open late too ) i find the service very useful for my ebay listings and it is great value for money !
2	what a performance !. customer freindly web_site ,
0	the day after posting i received an_email from mazuma , confirming_receipt of the handset , with a further email a short while later confirming that payment had been credited to my specified account .
2	- don_'_t miss out on a bargain !
0	i then had to chase the order every day after until they were delivered on the 00 / 0 / 00 .
0	i chose the resend and a week_later the tv arrived in the post .
2	they drop stuff off when they say they will !
0	cant_fault you guys and will order again .
0	not only that , but their prices for the item i was looking for saved me £_00 !
2	this company is one of the best spectacle shops i have dealt_with having previously tried ordering from two previous companies which made claims that they couldn_'_t keep eg waiting four weeks for orders with no email responses , yes you know who you are !
0	very disappointed .
0	their customer_services shut at 0pm .
2	thank_you !
0	my latest dealing_with p0g was because i ' d not printed my damn shipping labels .
2	standard ebay like purchase for the fan and they helped_me select other bits to go with it .
0	fantastic service !
0	a little chat with rick soon sorted my need for a " note to driver ".
2	at first the process wasn_'_t clear , and when the instructions came through , there were 00 steps !.
2	really pleased with the result and would and will highly_recommend this company to all my friends .
2	the terms and conditions suggest allowing 00_hours for postal delivery .
2	did the live chap to see how much tyres were to ship .
0	customer_service is very nice .
0	i have been a selectspecs customer since 0000 , and have been consistently impressed with the quality of workmanship , low_prices and friendly customer_service .
2	she represents the company well and the service is equally impressive !
2	flowers are very reasonably_priced , different budgets catered for .
0	very nice agent who i came_across ( sammie_taylor ) very very helpful , polite and professional .
2	flowered order for a birthday , local delivery i . e .
0	all swift service and very nicely done though ;-)
2	phone trade in decide , fonebank_offered the best price and paid very quickly .
2	printed out the pre paid address , entered my bank_account number for direct payment and sent them to mazuma on the tuesday at 0pm , money went into the bank the next_day at 0pm .
2	i bought a voucher from amazon and ordered some flowers for mother '_s day .
0	he assured me that if they arrived dead try would collect them and refund !
2	i said yes and i waited .
0	i would definitely use parcel0go in the future based on this .
0	thank_you very much webtogs !
2	i visited the mazuma website to get a idea on what my phone would be worth , i was a little bit cautious_about sending through post and what they would offer me , but i was pleasantly_surprised of the offer so much i decided to trade in 0 old_phones , i could , nt believe_how much money the phones were worth sat in my drawer . i found their website very user_friendly , if you do get stuck or unsure_about anything there is a contact number to help you through . the self addressed envelopes and delivery / confirmation of valuation note arrived 00_hours_later , it is a free post service , however you do have an option of different postage options , i chose the recorded signed for delivery , which cost me £ 0 but bearing in mind the value of the phones , the postage cost included royal_mail insurance and a tracking_number , a good deal in my opinion . once mazuma received the phones they emailed me that they had received them and that they would process them i . e .
2	!
0	!
2	excellent service and speedy payment .
0	after having my glasses reglazed with selectspecs after not giving into the pressure sales_tactics from another high_street opticians , i was so impressed i sent in my mum ' s glasses for reglazing with my own .

2	i have used webtogs before and will_continue to do so in the future
0	arrived next_day as promised and packaging was excellent .
2	excellent service and friendly efficient operator - shame the same can '_t be said for citylink .
0	but they put it in the bin !
2	it was also helpful to receive emails & texts from royal_mail so i knew when to expect delivery .
2	i would just like to say how pleased i was with the service given this evening by jon , i was just about to thow the ****** laptop through the window , as i could not get an answer or find an_email address on the parcel0go site till i discovered i had to go via facebook , which gets on my nerves most of the time but this time it saved me from going round the bend .
0	on the 0 or 0th day i had an_email back saying they were delivered when they quiet clearly hadn ' t because my recipient never received her flowers and they where probably handed_over to any old tom , dave or harry .
2	there are many companies out there who can learn valuable lessons from hifiheadphones .

2	my son ordered for me for mother '_s day what was supposed to be a beautiful_bouquet of flowers !
2	0 star all the way
0	they do their best to beat_competitors prices , and have always suceeded ( and often undercut them ).
0	we was slightly dissapointed when the bouquet arrived .
2	in comparison to other_sites , mazuma also offers excellent income on unwanted phones .
2	she has provided excellent customer service and i shall_definitely continue to use parcel0go for future deliveries .
2	the on - line order info showed no update on progress .
0	despite ordering from across the pond , the air mail arrived quickly and i ' m enjoying the accessories that were shipped .
2	the helpline staff were absolutely_brilliant and went out of their way , even to organising the installation by local company , thus_saving us money !
0	excellent service .
0	sadly i was plagued with issues from the start , however it was then turned around by their customer_service to rectify the issues .
2	all the way from hong_kong !
0	really chuffed with the headphones as well .
0	i ' m absolutely gutted as even if delivered tomorrow there will likely be no - one around to be able to take delivery and give them to her .
0	i left it .
2	she took me through all the options and assured me my girlfriend would love the ring .
0	parcel0go is a quite cheap way to sent parcels and their staff is helpful .
0	all in all , an absolutely_appalling service from an absolutely_appalling company .

2	would highly_recommend .
2	altogether a dazzling service for anti - dazzle sunglasses :-)
0	i would and have highly_recommended the company !!
2	however , when checking the receivers out , it soon became_apparent that you actually needed the power supplies for the things to actually work .
2	avoid this company !
2	very please super_fast recomed
0	so although fuming i was happy with this , so this morning i logged to to track and no tracking_number !!!
0	website live_chat will not work so have no way to contact them before mothers_day !

0	a lady named emma responded quickly and resolved my issue within 0 minutes , i have never had such lighting - fast service !
2	so easy with great service including txt to say delivered and fab flowers so reasonably_priced
0	item was lost in transit and fobbed me off with excuse after excuse on why they couldn ' t pay out on any claim filed .
2	whatever , to be quoted £_000 and have that reduced to £_00 due to that damage is laughable - or would be if it was not so disgusting .
2	have never had a problem with the service - always been very reliable , until now when my parcel wasn_'_t collected .
0	they always pay out exactly_what the original offer is , they contact you each_step of the way so you are fully informed and they generally provide a very good service .
0	had not heard of the company , but were the cheapest around for a weber q000 with stand .
0	many_thanks again !
0	very easy to use , very quick response , very quick payment .
2	they rang to ensure that i did understand it was repacked , they then despatched ahead of schedule .
0	i posted my phone on the monday , had my money on the tuesday !

0	booked online for a parcel to go to kenya , collected by tnt and returned by tnt a week_later with no explanation !
0	after_speaking to jon he knew_exactly which headphones i owned and very quickly sent me the correct eartips .
2	but they put them in a diferent basket which didn_'_t look nice .
0	i ' m very glad i did , i ' m a repeat customer now , both product and service are so far ahead of the high_street alternatives .
0	!
0	a staff named rob helped_me about these .
0	to be honest , i was worried first about how and when the offer is going to come to uk .
0	really impressed with the fast transactions .
2	we regularly use interparcel and would highly_recommend their service .
2	well_done , great company !
0	so i contacted customer_service and [_name ] was brilliant . she manually booked my delivery and now i am happy i can now send my parcels .
2	far_exceeded my expectation on customer service .
0	it ' s such a shame that i love my new handset .
2	they arrived well_packaged and the packaging even contained two rhubarb and custard sweeties !!
