M	0 hours passed and guess_what . no call !
F	after further_discussion he said they would refund a mileage amount and when i asked about the time and disruption he said the store was authorised to give further compensation which could be negotiated and the store would have details of the complaint .
F	the flowers were lovely but were delivered and left_outside the property .
F	what more could i ask .
M	i will_certainly be ordering from here again and would have no_problems recommending this site to others .
F	i would expect at_least a 00 - 00 hour grace period for changes without charge .
M	and that was strange ?
F	item wrapped in bubble_wrap and well_packaged .
F	update_: customer service rang and offered me an ten_percent discount on next order for my troubles so am changing one star_rating to three
M	if you need one , go for it .
F	my grand_daughter '_s old_iphone stopped_working .
M	i could rate less but it has_been a little while since i used hmv and i don_'_t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
F	they also said it was the florists fault and that theyy were just kind of the mediator - ???
F	0 times they were way way out of time for their delivery slot .
M	chemist_direct should offer more free or low postage offers .
M	why ?
F	guess i will stick with lbs and merlin !
F	i can only_assume that jpj have reduced the chances of a good prize so the more games offered and the more members joining the less likely you are to win .
M	fitter did return to replace the sensor foc , but it would have been so much_better if he ' d been properly prepared with spares .
F	i love my fitflops , got them at a really great price next time i '_m looking for some new shoes , i '_ll check out shoetique .
M	should e_mail you or text you when delivery has_been made so that you no the goods have arrived like most on line shoping do
F	no emails while it was pending but received 0 within 0 hours after i made a phone_call , not happy at all with the service i received .
M	only issue was due to my post_code being iv00 i was going to be charged £_00 . 00 delivery , but choose my parents post_code ab00 which was 00 miles_away saving myself £_00 .
M	however , the last few_times i have been , my opinion has completely changed .
M	i was sure that eurostar would not let_me board the train without a reserved seat .
M	will_definitely use priory again for my next lot .
M	that would be fair_enough if it was just meant to be an additional service on board .
M	not much more can be said - it sells shelves and it does it well .
F	also thought postage bit dear .
M	well pleased .
M	thank_you for the great service and reply so quickly to me via_email .
M	lowest_price , easy to order on website ( no_hidden_charges ) .
F	0 i shouldn_'_t have been sent a dispatch email for the item , only then to be followed_by not the politist of staff to have a conversation with and then an extra wait for the actual product .
M	as per a recent comment by another user .
F	have been waiting in all day on my day off for a bed i was told the driver had to change the route owing to an accident and that it would be delivered by 00 . 00 this is tuesday 00 / 00 /_0000 by 00 . 00 not arrived so went back to the tracking it said that it was carded which_meant we had recieved a card no all lies we have been in and nothing the next minute it was showing gone back to depot no phone_call to me no text nothing not only that tonight i am sleeping on the floor thanks for that ????
M	would recommend , excellent service .
M	too bad !
F	so the moral of this very long_story is that i will not be using resorthoppa again anytime_soon .
M	while they are soon introducing more categories to review the hostels on , you can only choose between 0 smiley_faces on each , which correspond to increments of 00 %.
M	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
F	i had to then try and find the harlow fedex before they closed to try and get the items i ordered , luckily i managed to obtain the items , but once i opened the items to check their condition one of the frames were bent at the bottom .
M	excellent delivery and support .
M	have used before , and will use again .
F	if the website was advertising the correct product , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it in the first place .
M	i live in hampshire and they are in telford .
F	emailed back asking for the ' correct tap ' to be delivered the next_day .
F	the product was as_described , but until i got to check out i was not aware of the shipping_costs , which i thought were expensive .
M	website works well , telephone staff are well - informed and helpful .
F	i decided to return them on the back of the 00 day no - quibble policy .
M	finally after 0 telephone_calls and 0 unanswered_emails and nearly 0 days waiting my points arrive at by midday .
M	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
F	i phoned the company on 00 / 0 /_0000 to get an update only to be told that the item was out of stock and had been when i ordered it .
F	i would definitely recommend bedworld and would buy from them again .
F	first of all my printer would not accept them as they were not genuine , then when i got them to work the black_ink is pale silver / grey
F	i have sent an e_- mail complaining but i am still_awaiting a reply !!
F	there is always help at the end of the telephone to deal with any_queries .
F	i had to change the date through the airline , which charged me a whopping fee , although it would have been free if i had booked with them first .
F	will use this retailer again , had previously only bought wormer from them as i didn_'_t expect a good price for the food .
M	will i shop_here again ?
M	they sell good posters .
F	well , the product ( now we have the correct one ) looks good but ;
M	it then appeared to be working but nearly 0 years after buying it , the watch stopped completely .
M	but if the site says they '_ve got the tyres and takes your money , it '_s not very good when they later say , " whoops !
F	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
F	i had planned cocktails for a party the night of friday 00th when my cocktail_mixers were due to arrive unfortunately they didn_'_t arrive until saturday_morning , nothing to surprise my guests with just the usual .
F	the cheapest site !
M	i wouldn_'_t hesitate in recommending this company to anyone ( in fact i already have ), a pleasure to do_business with , many_thanks again .
F	bottom line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
M	however , when kwik - fit called me it was not to confirm my chosen timeslot , but to say the tyres would not be available until another day later , because they had to be ordered .
M	if you remain at a price level differential that now exists with e . g .
M	on the day of delivery another txt gave_me the name of the driver and an exact 0 hour_slot for the time of delivery .
M	mazuma_mobile quickly paid me for my used mobile on the spot and i couldnt be_happier
M	great comms , helpful service when i needed to exchange my purchase for the next size up .
F	microphone is surprisingly good and in working order but the packaging was damaged with large puncture holes around it .
F	i '_m really grateful , and impressed with how simple and quick the mazuma system_works - giving me a good conscience about my unwanted_phones being put to good use , and even some money for them too .
M	this company has blown my mind with its prices .
M	miss xxx was the reply .
M	i am now on hold to customer_services for the 0nd time for over 00_minutes .
M	perfect fit and top quality .
F	i told him if it had been delivered on time then there would have been someone at home !!
F	getting told it has_been dispatched a dream , getting the delivery to madeira portugal !!!
M	found exactly_what i wanted within 0 minutes of logging on , ordered , paid for them and was informed they were being despatched all within 0 hour of making the request .
F	would use this company again .
F	easy order form to fill in , fantastic fast delivery service , and was amazed with the prices of the acuvue_moist , will definitely be ordering more .
F	very disappointed & definitely didn_'_t get my money '_s worth .
M	can you tell me
M	well on the inner sole was printed a size 0 , and every where else is was sized as a ten .
M	it arrived 0_weeks_later as flat_pack .
F	placed my order and the goods arrived promptly and in perfect_condition .
M	i would recommend amigo_loans to anyone .
F	quick and reliable service !
M	quick and easy , efficient service

F	generally procook products are excellent and great value for money so this will not stop me from purchasing from them again !
M	thanks again !
M	its an_absolute_disgrace for this reason i will never use that courier or your company again unless you use a different courier .
M	a the customer contacted us later to say they had not received it .
F	i will never use this company again , stay away !!!!!!!
F	another light i ordered was clearly_shown as available but later refunded as out of stock .
F	nowhere does it say that the time you pick is not guaranteed to be honoured .
F	the product is meant to last 00 weeks , my cat is already messing right next to the product .
M	just about to run it through my banks fraud_department because overclockers will not re - imburse my account .
M	very good efficient company and very good at dealing_with customer service issues .
F	not at all happy and not the way to treat customers !
M	dear_mr duddy
M	something bigger is going on and i am exasperated that i have no understanding of it .
M	am really impressed and would highly_recommend the company to anyone .
F	found it on uk_tool_centre for a comparably reasonable_price and it said they had stock .
F	the slowest delivery ever !
F	embarrassing !
F	!
M	quick dispatch .
F	the email_updates were useful so i knew when the phone had arrived and when my payment was on its way .
F	not impressed !
M	so not too bad .

M	will buy again from these_guys .
M	wanted a big american convertible for the weekend at a competitive rate .
M	as always the service and delivery are excellent and prices second to none
F	!
F	we went into marks_electrical last saturday to look at ovens , found one we liked and after checking it would fit in our kitchen , went back and ordered it .
M	first i tried their 0000 number ( fabulous a company with a free phone number ).
F	they take zero responsibility for the service they provide .
M	i sent them back at my own_expense , they then refused to refund postage stating that the cushions are 00cm square or 00x00cm and that this measurement refers to a diagonal from corner to corner !!!
F	very disappointing .
F	from her feed_back the flowers were lovely .
M	i had printed out the map from my on line booking and gave them it so that they might be able to get the airport management to put up better signs and update the website .
M	avoid
M	bought the marathon pack for a friend who will also now use the service as well
M	enjoy .
F	as there was small gaps in the box either end , the food dropped out .
F	selling some great products at great prices and first_class delivery .
F	delivered within time given .
F	i felt i had to keep this substandand product as the item is very heavy and to send it back would of cost at_least £_00 without packaging costs so would have been out of pocket for a lot of money . so i am forced to keep a useless product but i will never order from these people again and would encouage all of you to stear clear of rajapack if you dont want a useless product that you cant use !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	i recommend to do_business with envirofone , the will not disappoint you
M	speedy postage .
F	the free extras are a super bonus , but i love that they will not only match , but beat a competitor '_s price .
F	i am on totally the wrong contract for me and cannot down - grade for another 0_months and i was not told that i would start being charged for weekend and evening browsing after the first 0_months !
F	would buy from them again .

M	chris beecher and his_team did a sound job in going above and beyond delivering the car in a short amount of time .

F	( but they are dry clean only )
F	kept_informed by text / email at every_stage .
F	nice p0p program .
F	fortunately the neighbour turned_up with the parcel 00_hours_later .
M	i have used this site for over a year now and recouped more than £_000 cashback in that time .
F	it will only go part way to compensating 0 expensive telephone_calls from the uk and still no delivery of the famous bottle of wine 00 days late for the birthday !!!!

F	the bean_bag is great so hope you can deliver the other 0 i ordered soon , if not please can you provide a refund .

M	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
F	our direct doors door is sitting , unused , in our garage .

F	will definitely use again .
F	i was not happy at all .
F	fab show fab price !
M	i spoke to one of the staff to place my order .
M	instead of an e_mail saying sorry . how about you compensate me for the 0 hours ive wasted chasing this missing parcel and sack the driver who cant even remember where the parcel went ?
M	it was everything i wanted so what more can i say ?
F	very disappointed .
M	utterly_disgusted with this service .
F	when dealing_with ss people over the telephone , my experience has_been good ; although the specific ingredient information i wanted at the time was not clearly given to me .

M	you charged extra for a mother '_s day delivery , and then delivered the chocolates the day before .
M	i trusted serenata to deliver a decent bunch of flowers for my grandma '_s birthday - serenata have failed terribly and have certainly lost my trust and future custom !
F	we were very disappointed with flowers we ordered recently for a funeral .
M	hi , i am very disappointed by yur service .
F	we found the website easy to use and the choice of party_decorations vast .
M	if like me you are self - employed and googled " annuity " when nearing retirement , then you would have found a bewildering choice of companies promising the earth .
M	the worst thing about this is there is no way to communicate with them if your query falls outside a very narrow category , the help screen claims to help with any problem , but that is blatantly not true ,
F	i was able to track the progress of my order in the lab until it was ready for delivery .
M	i don_'_t think so , i have flown many low_cost airlines as i travel an awful_lot for work but ryan_air have been the worst but here '_s the thing they are not just the worst but the worst by a long long way !

M	00 year_old boiler now working like new !
F	recently bought a couple of outfits .
F	wallpaper_direct is the best place to look on line because their selection of wallpapers are amazing .
F	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
F	the courier had put in a distant garage but no note posted through letter_box informing of this .
F	i ordered 0 shampoos and 0 conditioners and got 0 shampoos and only 0 conditioner .
F	delivery was as promised with no delays or hassles .

M	the quality of service virgin gives leaves an awful_lot to be desired , to date i have attempted to set_up a direct_debit with them five times to no_avail , the ' cannot care - less atitude ' is awful for such a big company . shame on you branson

F	the website is very easy to use and you can order as much or as little as you want and you don_'_t have to worry_about ordering a certain_amount to qualify for free delivery .
F	i had a fight to get compensation because i had not kept the receipts for the foodstuffs for the freezer , well i don_'_t know anyone who keeps all their receipts for weeks on end .
M	unfortunately indifferent to all the others providers .
M	the website failed to accept my discount_code but took my money before i could tell that i was paying the full price - it never confirmed what i was paying .
M	?
M	great prices & service from the magicians at merlin , they are my " go to " online_retailer !
F	0 ) can '_t easily update or amend booking online .
M	after a few weeks i had to contact the company to find out where my items where and was told it would be another few weeks .
F	will definitely use again .
M	claim they are busy on other customers so can not deal with the customer they are conversing with !
M	i had to pay to have it straightened out and then had to work on it to reduce the effect of a dent in the rim .

M	always been happy in the past but won_'_t use again !
F	this was my second order from muscle_food .
F	waited for so long and now the full order isn_'_t turning_up .
M	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
M	they can take us to court now if they wish and they will have to explain this utter lack of competency , continuous ignorance and complete_lack of attention , care and responsibility as a uk energy_supplier to the judge .
M	if it were possible to give negative stars i would give them a hundred - do not use them they are total c_** p !
F	recently i had to wait several weeks for a product to come into stock and be delivered ready for a holiday , only for it to arrive with days to spare and be completely the wrong_colour .
F	very pleased with the result .
F	fast and efficient .
M	but they are not so generous with part exchange if at a later date you want to upgrade to a more_expensive watch .
M	prices better_than most , had just what i wanted and at the right price .
M	sorry your choice of delivery let it big time down !
F	be warned .
F	update this is written after the concert , and i have upgraded my rating accordingly .
F	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
F	i was really impressed with the service from e_- outdoor .
F	my mother is from portland and i have loved knobs since i was a child .
M	i purchased an engraved lighter at great expense as a gift to an usher for my wedding last_year .
M	i had a pre_oiled and undermount sink_cut out .
M	seems an ok company , who communicate very well , but on all occasions the delivery date quoted was nowhere_near - 0 / 0 days out .
F	in the end i rang up their customer_care who were not very helpful and who told me my watch wasn_'_t in stock and would be sent to me ' tomorrow '.
F	the p_&_p was almost £ 0 making my order much more_expensive than necessary .
M	do not ever use this company .
M	they are the cheapest i '_ve found for zopiclone but you don_'_t know what you are buying .
F	the finish on the upstands is quite rough and from what i can see no amount of sanding will alter this .
M	my new ( secondhand ) pc arrived the day after ordering ( even_tho ' i was a cheapskate and went for the free delivery option 0 - 0 working_days ).
F	the delivery was on time though and they kept me updated at all times .
M	nature shops pricing is excellent .
M	promised connection in 00 - 00 working_days .
F	the mens clothes seem to be more fashionable than the womens .
F	now they don_'_t really offer any discount .
M	good value price .
F	you have not queried or questioned that any part of my review is anything but factual and i do no think that your basis for a removal request can be seen as fair .
M	excellent shop who really look after their customers , somewhere i '_ll always recommend and will_continue to use .
F	i am therefore pursuing the problem directly with tp .
M	something in the paperwork to say whats required before opening the box , or a cheap spanner in the bag .
F	it would be so much_better with monthly_payments .
M	keen_pricing - best on - line price found .
M	second time of using tyreshopper and just as simple to use site as first time round . good selection of tyres from budget through to prestige .
F	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .

M	i do not think i have had a worse experience over the airwaves in my life .
M	always fast delivery fully_informed as to when the delivery is coming so no_problems there , the site is very informative as to the the products very pleased
F	product as expected .
M	i probably wouldn_'_t use them again !
M	a " reply " from the advertiser of the goods i wanted stated words to the effect that i was contacted and to confirm this , they also stated they were sending me a copy of the email that they claimed to have sent ; not a great surprise to note that nothing was received in either case .
F	they ended_up being too small and i returned them using the address and instructions on the website at the time and sending an_email to let them know .
M	parking was free .
M	i wanted to put a new battery in my best watc for holiday but it didn_'_t arrive in time .
M	i know cycling clothes are tough to fit_properly and tend to be tight , but this was way off - something went wrong , and it '_s now going to have to be used by my daughter , who is in 0th grade .
M	don_'_t just take my word for it , read the other bad_reviews on here and also do a search on the company and see bad_reviews on the reptile forums about them . they all say the same . you can '_t get hold of them if things go_wrong !!
F	this is why i have no_hesitation in rating little_sunflowers 0_stars .
F	this is our second fridge which we will use for beer and wine .
M	couldn_'_t track the delivery either using postcode and reference num .

M	if only all businesses made this effort .
M	i would highly_recommend !
M	the day before delivery i received an email with a list of delivery conditions and the threat of a £_00 charge if any of the conditions were not met .
M	this has_been received today 00th - all good .
M	ordered item one day was delivered the next , with plenty of contact updates and even time given for delivery slot , which is excellent when your out at work .
F	i would recommend anyone to book this service its worth_every_penny .
F	sorry it is not very good comment but this is true .
F	cleaning was ok during our stay but not really to our standards .
M	also , when there was a one - day delay in the delivery , they apologized to me by giving me 0 free ribeye_steaks .
F	i ordered a dress in the beggining of april ( to norway ) so that i would be sure to have it for my birthday the 00 .
M	i chose oriental breeze - deluxe .
M	perfect_timing and quality of product
F	drive to the park & ride and the rest is all sorted .
F	the key i ordered came the next_day , to the isle of man .
M	however , in the past , the product merely showed up at my doorstop , seeming hours ( but really the next_day ) after the order was placed - no one had to call me to find out when someone would want to be home .
F	any_problems are dealt_with swiftly & efficiently causing little or no inconvenience .
M	alamo atlantic drive lovely people but car booked for 00 . 00am not available until 0 . 00pm and we were one of about six customers in the same position .
F	he thought he could do a moonlight flit and shaft all his customers , but i did some sleuth work on the net and found that the company was still active with him as a director and they had cash in the bank but high debts .
M	the drawstring pull pulls from the " wrong side " of the blind and this makes it somewhat difficult to use !
F	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can '_t return it which i think is silly as well .
F	gordon , arranged our plans for a once in a lifetime_trip to australia .
F	i called up and was promised that it would shipped that day , or the following_day at the absolute latest .
F	i have used viovet a couple times_now always get my goods in a couple of days and they let you know where your order is and so cheap as well will never use anyone_else
M	xln left me without broadband for over a whole month !
M	this is backed_up by a knowligible and courteous team , with weekly_offers to tempt you further into the world of high grade watches .
M	the book is really nice but i wasn_'_t impressed with the quality of the photos in the photobook .
M	called customer_services and they said there was no record of the deal being offered .
M	every time i sat down it pinched my bottom .
M	any company that " hides " their registered address or office address clearly has something to hide .
F	so many airparks around the airport that it wasn_'_t very well sign posted as to which one we were actually booked into :(
F	he agreed .
F	lovely looking flower_arrangements etc , value for money and next_day delivery 00 / 00 / 00 wednesday .
F	what excellent service .
F	it is a great way to reach the multitudes and it gives the hotels etc a chance to improve and respond to the reviewer .
F	when your_own domain registrar which you have used for a decade starts squatting on their own clients domains it really is the pits .
M	excellent service overall , especially being_able to tell me what bouquets are available for immediate_dispatch .
M	i would add that the frames were square .
F	i should have listened to the other reviews that would have steered_me away from the company .
F	talk about doing everything right , right balance of email and text to let_me know where my order was , confirmation of what i had ordered , when it woud be delivered , options to change , the works !

F	i was told i had been emailed this information but i didn_'_t receive any emails .
M	great service from usrentacar great price clear details . but when we arrived at the dollar counter we had a very very long wait very poor customer servie ( we were moved to thrifty ) and very very poor car choice !
M	but making calls over wifi / 0g was not a smooth ride .
F	they say are " currently dealing_with high call volumes and will be with me soon " if not they say they will ring you back if you leave your number but they do not .
F	according to ' customer_services ' it '_s drivers discretion where they leave deliveries , regardless of where you have asked !

M	i decided to cancel .
M	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
F	item was fine but not what i was looking for so i took it back to the store - on their website it says its an easy way to return items .
M	be prepared for them being offline so much of the time - multiple visits to collect seem to be a speciality .
M	and what a catastrophic disaster .

F	the staff dealing_with the order were great as was the quality of the banner .

M	my advice the the management remember that pride always comes before a fall .
M	steamed the laminate off my white kitchen_doors , please dont tell me i should not have used it on my kitchen_cupboards as it states clearly that you can .
F	the company hd not been very clever in the way they '_d handled it but so far we have had no_problems .
M	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
F	no problem at all . would recommend to anyone .
M	the carrier informed me that the parcel was damaged and asked me to open it to check if the trim was ok .
F	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
M	the girls there were so grumpy i could not wait to get out of there .
F	however after arriving more than 0 hours after ordering i had to wait for over an_hour for the pharmacy to download my prescription , as there was some sort of error with the computer .
F	from the moment we approached the desk to the point of drop_off we had the best service .
M	can '_t say it was the fact but a bit of a convenience for them so have learnt lesson and will keep an eye on this in future if i use again but apart_from that the deliver was fine and iteam arrived the good thing is u do get an email to confirm the exact date of delivery were most just get an email_saying despatch but no exact date
F	shocking from such a well knowen buisness !
M	all of the little niggles would be forgivable if they were significantly_cheaper_than official nespresso_pods , but they aren_'_t .
F	i ordered boots which were over_£_000 but did not receive a discount .

F	they also have some great deals if you buy products in bulk .
M	chased on monday to be told ' it '_s on the engineer '_s bench , i '_ll see what '_s happening and ring you back '.
M	was not easy to contact dpd directly due to their automated_systems , so called sol for help .
M	first , i was asked to provide a copy of my credit_card statement , in case mine was a stolen card , which delayed the process of my order and is just strange .
M	i was assured that they would be delivered before 0pm and they did not arrive .
M	they claim the refund was made immediately but ten days_later there is no refund showing on my account .
M	i really hate hdnl and make it a point to complain to the company i order from ( e . g .

M	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega_constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
F	no reply .
M	0 days_later i revived my goods , i would pay a little extra and use another company so that i could get a tracking_number .
M	there lack of business understanding means they cannot get their heads around what can sometimes happen in business .
M	estimated delivery time seemed huge ( 00 weeks ) which then overran slightly .
F	furniture is as good as it looks in the showroom and the service at the store was really good .
M	sadly many will be_fooled .
F	!

F	not only was the price better_than other online_retailers but i also got 00_%_off and the order arrived incredibly quickly .
M	i have replied to the e_- mail posted below which just shows the level of sheer_incompetence of this company as i would like to know how my item was out for delivery when the courier was actually hundreds of miles_away in scotland and my parcel was is in his shed - no answer required yodel , i have drawn my own_conclusions !
M	i recently created 0 calendars on the jessops site and to my delight they arrived very quickly .

M	tesco lakeside is filthy and i often shop late at night to see and smell 0 or 0 members of staff smoking in the doorway at 0am
M	they are both very small for there age .
F	this was an inconvenience because he came to my work and i had to arrive hours earlier for my shift because that was the only times slot available to me .

M	my advice , do not buy from this company .

M	best quality !
F	why do they keep lying ???
F	i was very pleased with tennisnuts service and my grand_children were over the moon - just what they wanted .
M	has about 0_weeks to use the coupon and ended_up going in to work at 00pm to finish the 000 page album off .

M	so my parents take their car in for an mot ( pensioners ) and they get a phone_call saying it needed rear axle bushes …. i then rang to confirm this as its very strange for a car with 00k on the clock . they quoted £_000 to replace . took it to a merc specialist for second opinion . 0 technicians stood around the car laughing at the halfords assessment . they confirmed there was nothing wrong with the bushes and to prove this they would put it through an mot in their garage . i gave halfords the written report and a chance to rectify / explain …. more backtracking and maintained that they needed_replacing . i then got the mot_test done at mercedes specialist and it passed with flying_colours . i have been advised to complain to vosa . the manager had his chance to put things right . halfords even tried to tell me that the car couldn_'_t have an mot at any other test station as it had now gone down as a failure .
F	i was lucky that the 00 . 00 mother '_s day bouquet had been reduced to 00 . 00 and opted for delivery on the friday .

F	ingen reaktion .
M	to my knowledge this is not legal in eu .
M	thanks amazon . com .
M	i ordered an item from this seller , but was concerned that the original delivery date had slipped by several days .
M	after mentioning it to the staff they vavuumed some of it out but after having left the rental car station i still found food and trash in the door - and seatpockets .
F	i am writing about tesco westwood store , scarborough . i used to shop there regularly , spending about 000 - 000_pounds weekly . accessing the store on foot is a nightmare , you have to walk round the entire outside of the store , the main doors are round the back . i returned a blind i had bought to customer_services , the woman was so horrible , and you would have thought that she was refunding me from her own pocket . there was some fittings missing , but she talked down to me , and i was offended . another time i was in store choosing easter_eggs for 00 people , so was spending a bit of time in that aisle . an assistant was re - stocking with a large trolley in the centre of the aisle . she was looking very stressed , and was obviously displeased with me looking at the display with my trolley . she was only doing her job , but it was her face , as though i was in the way . i went elsewhere . the next incident was awful . i was in the store with 0 children , and an assistant was stocking the biscuit aisle . there was a packet of broken biscuits on a shelf , and my little_girl picked_up a broken piece and ate it . well , the assistant went to town on me , saying she could call the police , it was theft , and was so wrong . i was so upset , i wsa actually buying mobile_phones and the weekly_shop , and i put everything back and left the store crying , and shouting at my little_girl . i have never , ever , been in there again , or shopped at tesco in any other way . also , at that store , if you need to call a taxi , you have to wait outside on the ramp in all_weathers . they are taking over our town too , it will be the final nail in the coffin for scarborough , i can tell you .
F	no_problems at all with the order .
M	you are not committed to accept , read the review and make you decision on price and reviews
M	top quality product
M	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don_’_t feel they deserve any sale from me .
M	i left the car with them and received a call an_hour later to say that the wrong tyres had been delivered , h rating rather_than the v rating i ordered .
M	please_accept our apologies if this is the case .
F	when contacted , they said they '_ll get back to me in 0 business days .
F	the product itself ( cot ) was complete , no damage and looks great !
M	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
F	i have sent 00 emails and still nothing .
F	i do favour online courses due to the flexible learning option they provide .
F	i waited in all day only to find out it was ' lost in transit ' - they did however agree to deliver on the saturday at no extra_cost .
F	i am very happy items and the service i recived will recommend to all my friends and family . the prices are very good will be buying more item soon
F	ordered some bedroom_furniture through bedroom world on 00th_march items still not arrived 00 / 00 / 00 !!
F	a hair_dryer would have been welcome , and less noise from neighbouring flats over the way across the car - park .
F	this time , however , i found it hard to search for items , received no confirmation of my order once i '_d placed it , and after 0_weeks have still not received anything .
F	on cheap_smells !
M	looking at each book in isolation is not too bad but the differences are very evident when under comparison .
F	service first_rate always prompt delivery ,
M	although they are perfectly useable the tee heights are not as stated : i . e .
F	on return the car was waiting for us , we got in and headed straight home in know time fabulous .
F	!
M	the amount of packaging requiring to be removed was excessive and it took me over three hours to have my furniture ready to be put in place .
M	what a scam !
M	item was required i ' d say quite urgently , so i '_m now going to be out of pocket until at_least the end of the month .
M	my home is awkward to find so i called up to give details .
F	advised despatched on 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	i have never come_across this before .
M	didn_'_t come instantly , had to wait 00_hours for it to come through compared to it '_s competitors where they were alot quicker .
F	all calls to an 0000 number , not cheap when you have to keep calling !
F	i tried three_times to use my credit_card to pay with and each time the screen crashed .
F	my other issue is that the book was a gift , but it arrived emblazoned with the fact that it was a photo_album which kind of gave the game away .
F	however they sort of make up for it with a lot of contact with emails and texts_letting_me when delivery was due .
M	delivered in 0 days .
M	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
M	no tv arrived .
M	no explanation ( such as out of stock maybe ) was provided and no part refund was offered .
M	i ordered a sink and tap for a new kitchen .
F	off my own back i have attempted to contact the derby depot this alone is a joke .
M	its a shame my trust is on hold at the moment .
F	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
F	there have been numerous_calls / emails back and forth_between myself and my husband and hammonds customer service , and whilst they have discounted our order by a small_amount , and paid for the bed to be disassembled and reassembled , i think the way they have handled the whole situation has_been absolutely_disgraceful !
F	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
M	!
F	i will definitely recommend to anyone who hasn_'_t used animed before .
F	!
F	excellent .
F	otherwise very good service and very happy with the machine .
M	i have used it on a solid_oak floor and it is frankly dissapointing .
F	i did have a code to buy a second book for 0 / 0 price but the code did not work .
F	it did wash off but not really good quality control in my opinion .
M	i '_ll be switching to oil club next time - you know how much you '_ll be paying - no gambling on the slim odds of a decent discount .
M	i ordered a shirt for a specific event , within lansen '_s published delivery schedules .
M	excellent quality leather , very well present .
F	do not buy this product .
F	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
M	well_done tyreshopper yet again
M	the agent iman on the phone said he would call me back in 00_minutes .
F	turns_out that it wasn_'_t the last address where the replacement would be done , it was the other address and i wasn_'_t there .
M	trimmer doesn_'_t hurt and is a decent price .
M	the beach is a pleasant 0 min_walk through the town .
M	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
M	from the moment you contact them they keep in touch with genuine concern that you are pleased with both the product and their service
F	deliveries made outside of a 0 hour time_slot 0 out of 0 times .
M	these tyres were offered as tyre of the week .
M	totally_unacceptable .
M	do your self a favour and go_elsewhere as my experience of this company is that they are in competent and blatantly lie !
F	my surgery was fine but i am not squeamish .
F	i was really pleased with the budgie toys i ordered .
M	but at_least they did resolve the problem promptly .
M	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
F	i also don_'_t like the new computers .
M	willbrook @ ntlworld . com
M	quick free delivery , good service from animed , i will shop with them again no problem .
F	quite simply , it doesn_'_t .
F	argos i would suggest you get new handy men and delivery drivers and i sit and wait for yet another wardrobe !!
F	however after 0_weeks i still had no sunglasses delivered to me .
F	the mattress failed to turn_up .
F	mrs lorraine hryziuk
M	this charge - backs scam has_become particularly popular on high ticket items such as laptops and so on , and in the space of one week 0 separate sellers that are on my face book list fell for the same scam .
M	great value for money and every now and then they surprise you with something free .
M	( 000_yards_away from my sister '_s address . )
F	i understand that they had no_obligation to advise me if i waited 00_hours i could have taken_advantage of the sale , but it would have been good customer_relations .
M	i left it 00_hours plus and tried to login again - same thing happened .
F	i then emailed a week_later after_hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
M	easy to book , best price i could_find .
F	i would highly_recommend it .

M	the ipsl staff i dealt_with were friendly and helpful .
F	based on our dealings so far - very much recommended .

F	the correct item was then sent to me but my item to follow still had not arrived .
M	do without it .
F	!

M	delivery was prompt but i was a little disappointed with the quality of the roses .
M	please imporve on the above points .
M	ebay - im just waiting for the day when we have a competitor for selling , i do use amazon for most purchases but im not particularly happy with you - and you are very expensive - the feedback protocols are anti sellers too .
F	having read some of the other reviews on the site i noticed that often wellies appear to come up large .
M	on talking to the driver it is clear my directions weren_'_t passed and the delivery was only made because the driver used his initiative .
M	top service .
F	pizza all over passage side , who as been using my car !!!!!
M	over the years they have replaced the entry system and each time they don_'_t consider it important to keep the garage owners informed .

F	you put hot_water in the base of the plates and the food stays warm .
M	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
M	cons_:
M	gb_posters are great in themselves but there delivery company leaves a lot to be desired they are extremely slow in this instance i tracked the package and it changed hands at different_locations five different times .
M	they takes yer money then advise on their site that they '_ve emailed about ' availability '.
M	very good service , turned_up when said they would , driver was very helpfull .
F	i went on to my account today to find they '_d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
F	it took us 0_months to get our phone line reconnected due to the way in which talktalk had cut us off - as if we hadn_'_t paid , which we had - we were up to date with payments .
F	free post and received amazon_voucher within 0_days .
M	some items out of stock but i was kept up to date with the remainder of the order by email .
M	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
F	we were thinking if updating our bathroom and thought we would go into our local_store to check it out .
F	good price but disappointed at short expiry_date .

F	i ordered the door for my belling_cooker and it seems like the right door but now it won_'_t shut properly do not think this is down to the product but cannot be sure .
F	i have been very impressed by the communication they provided at each_stage of my purchase ; by the speed of their delivery -- i had an eye_test on wednesday and received my glasses 0_days_later ; by the quality of the product and the price .
F	thank_you .
M	they take your money .
F	very fast reply to a query .
F	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
M	well recommended !!
M	i also found that whoever dealt_with me was rather condescending - correcting me and treating me as if i knew absolutely nothing about cars .
F	!
F	love this juicer , it '_s easy to clean and extracts all the juice out of the fruit and vegetables .
M	i '_m staying put !
M	when an important parcel wasn_'_t collected by ups i felt_like interparcel were of the opinion it wasnt their issue .
F	loved this chemists so much choice and very affordable items . will be back again for sure !!
F	as they live in what is sometimes classified a ' remote_area ' i even emailed eflorist to check they would be able to deliver .
M	the price i was offered was not the one i received by some_margin ; my phone was in good condition yet the offer was not what i expected and the time window to accept the price was tight - especially as i was going abroad - so overall not a great experience
M	after throwing my receipt away and finding i was hearing a loud noise from the rear of my car i was worried i had just bought 0 new tyres that may be faulty and had no receipt . when i phoned tyre_shopper that worry was put to rest the customer service adviser helped_me in every way possible . i was told to take my car to the depot that fit the tyres and they would take a look at the car they finally found the problem to which was not a tyre fault but a wheel_bearing . even_though i was now stuck with the expense of the bearing i fellt these_guys have been a great help and would recommened tyre_shopper to anyone_needing good cheap tyres with an even better after service .
M	p . s .
F	recently have not replied to emails and now emails are bouncing back ?
M	whilst the system works . there is no collection service and it is very slow compared to other_sites .
F	very unprofesssional company run by a person_who will quite happily make arrangements and subsequently hang up the phone and fail to attend appointments without reason .
F	i would order from them again - but insist on the 0st phone_call rather_than the 0th .
F	ok but no fire_extinguisher has turned_up
M	easy to order , delivery sent next_day with tracking order to the minute .
M	wanted a knights costume for a new years party im attending , saw just what i was looking for on the mega_fancy_dress website , ordering was very slick and simple and delivery was extremly quick , very pleased with the costume will_definatly be ordering again from mega_fancy_dress as and when the occasion_arises :) .
F	!
M	talkative woman , the type to overtalk you .
M	my partner could have purchased it making a different transaction .
M	easy to give good service when all going well .
F	was charged over double what the tickets actually cost ,
M	the amp was nicely_boxed up and protected , my son spent no time setting it up and played for 0 hours non stop .
F	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
M	martin is far to busy for that .
F	very prompt delivery following ordering after_reading good reviews online .
M	i am_delighted with the service provided by golf_support .
F	visitor .
F	the laps were replaced but this meant having to remove and replace pieces which i was not expecting to do .
M	you will lose a fortune in very a short time .
M	my initial_impressions were not great as the staff at pick_up were grumpy , unfriendly , the car was very dirty on the outside despite only have 0 miles on the clock , the inside still had the plastic covers on covered in mud , the aerial hadn_'_t been screwed in yet and the attendant on pick_up was reluctant to let_me check for damage , which made me nervous .
F	good price , though .
M	' could be '?
M	i was sent the standard package when i had ordered the deluxe and had been sent a different vase from the one i had ordered - all resulting in a waste of roughly_£_00 .
F	unfortunately , they hadn_'_t been strung properly and the left sided string quickly shot up through the slats as i pulled the control strings to test the rising mechanism .
F	very disappointed and will not be using serenata_flowers .
M	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
F	!
M	i saw the tv_advert , had an old moby to sell , mazuma did just as they said they would and now i have money for something that would have ended_up being thrown in the bin .
F	i rang craig_shepherd this morning following a reminder email from him as our fixed electricity contract was up for renewal .
F	for the sake of £ 0 i could have ordered on my amazon_prime and got next_day delivery wish i '_d stuck to my usual and not bothered with this company .
F	she ordered an ottoman base and mattress .
M	just as my review says becareful
F	i will be taking this to the citizens_advice at the first available opportunity .
M	given that the photos uploaded to the layout system were raw images taken on a high end dslr , colour balanced in adobe lightroom and exported as best quality jpg files the fault is not with the images .
M	i will of course be speaking to the card company to ask why they didn_’_t talk to me properly when i spoke to them at the airport , however i suspect they may have a recording of what the avis representative said and his “ excuse ” for taking £_00 . 00 .
M	office arranged for collection and eventually delivered the correct drill .
M	customer service is good too !
F	i think birkenstock make the most comfortable shoes in the world so , even_though the sandles do not fit the description on the rubbersole site i am sure i will still love them .
F	the laser_treatment was fine and you can neither see or feel anything happening .
M	it doesn_'_t make_sense , it also makes the book look totally unfinished .
M	the return of one tap by parcel_force was efficiently arranged by bathempire but a phone_call was necessary two_weeks_later as no money refund had been received .
M	i was delighted .
M	will_definitely be ordering again
M	an email to confirm that you had my phone would have gone a long way .
M	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
F	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
M	explain please why i '_ve placed my order , paid my hard_earned & you '_ve not even sent me an acknowledgment email as a courtessay ?
M	it '_s much less expensive than using the courier companies direct .
M	they say order is dispatched so they can legally take the money from your card , but has it really been dispatched ???
F	amazed by the prompt next_day free delivery , great products and very reasonable .
M	please make_sure your after sales is as good as the order and delivery experience .
M	no_hassle
M	0 - 0pm deliveries - delivery wasnt going to get into london until 0 . 00 - 0pm which was unacceptable , the florist they used didnt get order from e_- florist until 0 in the afternoon .
F	not sure how they did this , but fantastic !
M	i purchases a medium wind cheater for my wife , i selected next_day delivery , rescheduled my work to be able to take the delivery .
F	arrived in good time , good value for money .
M	no_frills , just first_class service
F	whilst the phone_call did confirm my order was ok and the customer service person was very polite , i am annoyed at having to make the call in the first place !
M	i went back with the police officers and a refund was paid to my credit account .
F	i ordered a hoodie , it was slightly faulty .
M	i received the order in reasonable time , but this item king of shaves super skin face scrub 000ml spilled almost_half inside the package over other products .
F	basically their childrens playhouse is rotting because the bearers have got wet and thats beacasue i have allowed it to rain on the shed !!!!!
F	absolutely_shocking way to be treated , don_'_t get me wrong the staff were pleasant enough but didn_'_t seem to have a clue what was going on !!
F	i am delighted with my order and have added wildflower_favours to my favourites .
F	competitive_prices , prompt dispatch & free_postage , excellent !!
M	no it '_s a rip_off price for a five minute job .
F	i posted the phone .
F	you find that argos i selling nowdays almost everything and they curtomer service is better as the have the rating_system about the service you recieved , so they are all smiles ;))
F	the flowers could have quite easily been taken and my son would have never known .
F	in the end i got so fed_up with receiving umpteen calls from their staff asking if i '_d like to renew my contract , that i cancelled my direct_debit in the hope that this would tell them that i was leaving - they cancelled our phone line the next_day and left us with no line , not to even call emergency services - which i thought was illegal .
M	was paid $ 0 rather_than $_00 .
M	about 00_% of the time , i am left infuriated with how the parcels are left at my house .
F	mix_up with payment when ordering did not linkmy papaypal payment .
M	i would like to inform you of my experience with the cambridge f0 branch .
M	the shop was rammed and although the staff were trying hard they were clearly stretched .
M	these_guys are professionals .
M	not happy about that !!!!!
F	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
F	joker '_s masquerade have obviously done their homework .
F	very pleased with my item , a present for my grandson .
F	but really only if you are able to find a seat on the top section .
F	filled out website registration form prior to payment / delivery details and within minutes , received a confirmation_email .
F	she had had 0 from other family_members but nothing from us .
F	on the upside they do tend to answer the phone '_s quickly ( never more than a 00_min wait so far ) but the fact i even need to make these calls in the first place is atrocious .
M	now let_me remind you of something , it was “ peak time ”, peak_season and the airport was packed so why did you charge me 00_euros extra ?
F	they did their best to assist and we received our order within two_days via_royal_mail !
M	one box was damaged ( he said it had been left at the depot ) so had to be delivered but it came within 0 days .
M	i would have thought that the easy way was to click on my account in the top right after logging in with a simple one click option to cancel , but it '_s not like this at all .
F	when i contacted them this time around i was told that they don_'_t like to use the royal_mail as items don_'_t turn_up .
F	quick delivery , good quality and price
M	i would not_hesitate to recommend others to use this company .
F	ordered placed and paid for 00 august , 0_weeks_later still no delivery , several emails later i am told that once a parcel has left them its in the hands of the royal_mail - no offer of refund but will replace , and take no responsibility if goes astray .
M	location is excellent and within walking_distance of shops , restaurants and the beach front .
M	!
F	the process was made easy by their efficient handling of my application and the rapid transfer of documentation which they achieved .
M	so this site was the next best thing .
F	inevitably the website won_'_t recognise my consignment_number so i usually end up calling them and hanging on the phone for 00_mins .
F	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
F	lots of people were or had been in my boat .
M	it would be easier to deal with 000vet if they accepted scanned copies of prescriptions by e_- mail , which some other_suppliers are doing now .
F	it arrived the following_day but unfortunately i was not at home and the delivery man left it with neighbours who are in their 00s who had to bring it over in their car to my house .
M	the real problem is that the car has engine of only 00 hp , which you cannot access until you go to 0000_rpm .
M	i received excellent service
F	yes , it was quickly dealt_with by a call to the operators who opened the barriers for us but having been through the same scenario last_year is it not about time some sort of online booking identification code is given so the ticket can be swiped , recognised as paid and exit achieved seamlessly ?
M	excellent value and cashback offer .
M	on the motorway , your limit is 000_km / h , and it will take a really long time to speed up above 000 .
M	it arrived and was very small indeed .
F	!
M	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
M	the tyres were cheaper then my local_garages and other online companies .
F	have emailed and complained and still no response .
M	the only_disappointment , he wouldn_'_t reduce the [ very good ] price !
F	the delivery service was brilliant but i wasn_'_t impressed with the size of the bouquet that i ordered .
M	obviously any company reserves the right to price as they wish , but this could be seen as a little_bit misleading .
F	very happy and hope to be placing an order soon for tiles when i get entry to my new house .
F	i would recommend to everyone .
M	mike d .
F	and they would refund me , however the lady gave_me an incorrect email address which_meant i had to follow_up with another phone_call and send the email again . i am to get a refund but not a good first experience .
F	we are a pub holding company who run a number of sites across the country for varying lengths of time .
M	they are a one stop_shop for all electronic accessories and a whole lot more , all at excellent value for money .
M	the stuff i order came rely fast . one of the inflatable coolers were broke so we could only use the one which turned_out to be enough as it happens .
F	i will always use this company for any spare_parts i need , as they are so efficient and you don_'_t have to wait very long before you have your order , thankyou .
F	the service in the blackpool store is not as good as preston - st georges as you are kept waiting for longer asthey never seem to have enough people on and the unit feels cramped .
M	i won_'_t be going back to o0 at the end of my contract .
F	.
M	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .
F	delivered on date specified .
F	very helpful and polite on the phone and i would definitely recommend you to anyone .
M	the choice is almost overwhelming at first .
M	returns and exchanges are free and prompt and telephone_conversations are calm and helpful .
F	great delivery service too .
F	i decided that i had some screws i could use and i '_m_sure i can improvise with some double_sided velcro to hold the cover on - anything to get the blinds up .
M	top site !
M	so when you phone the phone rings for six minutes unanswered .
F	sooooon
F	it was the way i like it : i order - it delivered .
M	if not , your set_up is amateurish .
M	found what i wanted and fast efficient service thanks
M	the whole exasperating experience has left me so frustrated , i am struggling to write this review .
M	kudos for the good work and thank_you so much .
F	i will not bore readers with all the details as its pretty_much what previous_reviews have said .
M	i have used the site for a couple of years without_any_problems , and it works even better_than ever now .
M	application process took well over an_hour and was still being_processed when i decided to cancel .
M	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
F	what is the system ?
F	ordered my shed after looking into prices across the board thoughtn this was a good deal
M	i can '_t recommend them enought
F	can '_t wait to give it toy dad for his_birthday he '_ll be made up
M	however , report took over a week to be made available .
M	i give them away as presents but always retain a copy for comparison until the next batch arrives .
M	this whole_experience has_been a waste of time and effort and i have paid postage_costs for no reason .
M	as such i did not_hesitate to make an order , and will_definitely be visiting again in future when our stocks become low .
M	fantastic ordered two_pairs and saved nearly_£_000 . 00 compared to high_street , very pleased will_definitely use you guys again .
F	really good product , excellent value for money and great service
M	after nearly 00 months of supplying meter_readings they still give me an estimated gas bill .
M	received my protein_shake and shaker quickly in the post .
F	as simple as that .
M	i told_him that i want to make an official_complaint about him and his service and that i am not happy , i want to stop the porting .
F	please writer to wagoro @_gmail . com
M	rang plumbnation to chase at 0 :_00pm and waited 00_minutes (!!)
F	imagine my surprise when i found out i was not the only one going through all this .
F	!
M	on our return there was limited work being carried_out on the vessel , but that dragged on way past the appointed handover time , and with no direct communication from anyone about what the problem was .
F	called again - 00_minutes .
M	he also showed me how to remove side_panel from tower unit and instructed me to try things he pointed_out in different slots if pc failed again .
F	we would most certainly recommend dry it out for any of your heating requirements .
F	i always buy my electrical goods from here , as the quality , knowledge and customer service are second to none . the same however cannot be said of the catering . i would always lunch at the store whilst shopping in the city , but no more , a coffee in the bistro maybe but the food and value for money in the big restaurant is a disgrace . the staff are now all unkempt and unshaven boys dressed in black , and looking like assasins instead of the pleasant and appropriately dressed female staff of the past . it is a nightmare in most of the store to find somewhere to pay or someone to ask advice from . the knitting and sewing dept is no_longer the pleasure that it used to be either . come_back the real john_lewis store please !
F	the prices are fab , the delivery is free and super_fast .
F	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller_than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
M	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
M	!
F	!
F	because of the nature of the problem – i . e .
F	awful company , will never come_back and i have spent a fair_amount with serenata over the years .
F	i was told yesterday that it '_s vodafone '_s fault as they share a network .
M	it is faulty and i would imagine this is why it was returned sometime in the past by the first owner .
F	wonderful products , wonderful service , happy customer !
M	since the amazon switch over it has_been dreadful and they have basically destroyed what was once a fantastic service .
F	i was pleased with products i purchased unfortunately it took rather longer_than i was anticipating for them to arrive .
M	there are more enjoyable , longer_lasting products on the market .
M	its now been 00 days and counting .
F	more_importantly , would i recommend - no !
M	i contacted them to arrange a return , they suggested i may have to wait 0 - 0_weeks for it to be repaired !
M	colin .
F	orders flowers to go to spain arrived in time and were gorgeous .
M	do not use .
M	attitude was argumentative and sloppy , and not helpful at all , this is not my fault bonusprint , its yours , if you are charging me £ 0 to deliver a package then why are you not sending it tracked ?
F	and the resort was stunning and clean .
M	hilton was gracious about it .
M	ordered 0 bottles of prosecco and received delivery with in 00_hours .
F	very helpfull , quick service , l would recomend the carrier_bag shop to all my freinds .
F	a big con !
F	a month passed and we forgot to chase the promised final paperwork - even_though it should have been sent through without the necessity to chase .
F	row a - b - c - d - e , have all been taken out .
M	i contacted them and they said there was no problem at all !
F	i was happy to provide this and could have done so easily at the time of order , had i been asked .
M	had a small issue fitting the product but was helped tremendously by their support_team .
F	on one occasion in tampa we had to wait an_hour at the desk to find this out .
F	i was disappointed regarding the aftercare response .
F	i '_d used rentalcars before and i knew that i would get good value .
F	i will certainly recommend mytuxedo to my friends and use you again and again , as the service . next_day prompt delivery and the quality of the product 0_stars !
M	as usual , anything really useful is discontinued , e . g .
M	i will endeavour to find out who the courier is next time and if it is yodel i would rather not place an order for goods .
M	i '_m just about to get married .
M	the order itself was delivered very quickly and was well_packaged .
F	the service from the happy_puzzle_company was swift and everything arrived quickly without a mark on any of the packaging , unlike_some companies .
F	thanks
M	i ordered a micro scooter black as it was the cheapest and it had free delivery but 0 days_later i tried to make contact and there was no number to call so had to email them which took 0 days for a reply to then be told that the item was out of stock and was being sent straight from the manufactures .
F	i ordered a bunch of flowers for same day delivery .
F	very pleased with our products and the speedy delivery !!
F	by_chance a friend had transported a lawnmower from the midlands to cornwall using anyvan and suggested we used it .
M	the person_who gave them a 0_star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
F	i don_'_t think they can be_beaten on price and speed of delivery .
M	white d000000 - 00 .
M	after_contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow .
F	poor poor service .
F	even when we had a problem while driving down the motorway she was very helpful on the phone and put our_minds at rest .
M	car appeared to have clocked some mileage on return .
F	i am delighted with my new door ( solidor ).
F	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
F	ebuyer inspected the item and accepted this was faulty , however , they have chosen to give a refund for the cost of the item only , less postage & packaging charges we paid at purchase and with absolutely no mention of our return carriage which , as anyone knows , we are fully entitled to under distance_selling regulations when receiving a faulty item !
M	can '_t fault it .
F	very easy site to use .
M	this is who to ask & where to buy .
F	(. name_removed ) from the customer service contact centre phoned me to state he had spoken to ( name_removed ) one of the managers at the telford store .
M	this is when things started to go_wrong .
F	great e shop , easy to get around and find what you want .
F	they should not be trading , disgusting
F	i '_m still_waiting for a refund from these jokers .
M	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
F	( what ' a that all about ?).
M	this meant i had no product and no money .
F	i was very impressed with the quality and value for money of my new side table .
M	note that they took less_than an_hour to test the items to find them not suitable .
M	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
F	no leaflet_enclosed so do not know how to take this product , as it states on packaging do not exceed stated usage , how can i do this when i don_'_t know what it is .
F	do parcelforce really think it '_s practical to not even let recipients know that they '_ve tried to deliver something ?
F	you ask to leave and only then do you get the problem sorted .
F	they are fond of posting a response on here that looks like they are going to do something about it but then they dont .
M	always great service , they let you know immediately if they are out of stock , otherwise never any_problems !
F	the paper inserts i bought separately for the diary and journal were beautiful quality paper and a perfect_fit for the amalfi refillable leather diary .
F	they did manage to get the weekend and evening browsing charges removed for me at_least , so that was a help .
M	all this with the promise of a really good price .
M	i wasn_'_t that day so read_reviews which said they don_'_t always get back to you , they did saying it was sent to billing_address .
F	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
M	i have been using the voipoffice hosted pbx for about four months now and found the system pretty useful and just what we needed .
F	just ordered online delivered to the door .
F	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer_care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
M	thank_you ,
M	i was so incensed that i phoned her back and told her to forget the invoice as my partner was no_longer interested in learning with such a chaotic organisation .
M	cheapest price '_s online ! superfast delivery will_definatly be purchasing from them again , can '_t go_wrong rest_assured and buy !!!!
F	so i had to walk all the way down the car_park in the rain to collect a huge , soggy , slightly crushed box from the delivery driver , who was very nice , but it was still not ideal after paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
F	delivery was super_fast .
M	thank_you
F	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont_be keeping my money !!
F	0_stars because then they came through very quick ;_y nut not the service i expected after previous good expereinces .
F	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
M	a all_round good mtg online_retailer .
M	great selection and prices make a tantalising filling with prompt delivery as the icing_on top .
F	ended_up raising a claim through paypal for refund .
F	two_weeks after ordering we found out that our order had been returned to the courier delivery depot and had to re - order with the happy_puzzle_company .
M	i was bowled_over by the speed of mazuma_mobile
M	ordered a £_000 vacuum_cleaner
M	+ clear pricing
M	we are very sorry to hear this however why would we intend to hold your money if we have gone_through all the hassle of pick_up to avoid
F	the replacements were received 0_days_later and were in better condition , although not packaged as nicely as the first ones .
M	delivered quickly too .
M	and great prices too !
M	would recommend to anyone_thinking of buying inks and paper .
M	they are a french company who ships from other european country .
M	never again
M	excellent service
M	also things like character are of little significance to budget travellers whereas location is extremely important .
F	also , the colour of the ponytail was a lot blonder than i '_d expected .
F	i ordered a £_000 leather_jacket and i picked it up from store as i had to get it delivered as my size was not in store .
M	after informing_me of the pros & cons he turned me onto the supplier he has used for a few_years_now supplement_warehouse .
F	on the delivery day i received a call and was told that they dont have it in stock .
F	breakfast was full - english + cont , plenty to be had so long as requested has one gentleman did explain , that once he had taken a serving of the scrambled_egg there would have been none for those waiting ie_: us !
M	very well_equipped , and in a fantastic location .
M	customer service is extra .
M	also the air_conditioning could not be used as when it clicked in it came on with a rumbling sound again waking us both up when it was on .
M	i then got an email on 00th saying theyd been assigned for 00th .
M	when i first used glasses_direct the quality of service was brilliant .
F	excellent speedy service
F	maybe more simelar to ebay charges which averages around 00p for me for an item that i sell for £ 0 .
M	i work away , and wedding_anniversary coming up so thought i would send flowers with small extra gift ( cake ).
M	the interest shown was generally suited to my requirements so i would definitely use again
F	i know this isn_'_t a hardship but disappointing
M	******** update *********
F	last_week i did my first transaction with currency_solutions , i was a little_apprehensive as it was a large_amount of money for me .
M	booking successful .
F	!
F	delivered when stated .
F	i would be happy to order more of the same .
M	i did not see anything on the on - line booking process which said this would be necessary .
M	telephoned support , only to be told someone would ring me back today or tomorrow , as the lines were busy .
M	not until they sort_out the cons iv mentioned as many other_companies including scan do not suffer from these .
M	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
F	!
F	finally ipad was returned after 0_weeks with new screen but not properly attached so ipad doesnt work at all now .
M	then you changed the quote upwards hundreds of pounds ,
M	your product seems no better , though no worse than many others .
M	easy to use and delivery arrived as promised and on time .
F	will_definately be buying from here again !
M	guess where i will buy my memory products in future ?
M	subsequent weather induced flight cancellations were immediately followed_by a further extension on the time limit .
F	the assistant was helpful , but didn_'_t have any samples to show me but said he had kept asking for them .
M	i recommend to everyone , delivered next_day .
M	by this point i had received some half - hearted emails from other_companies asking for greater detail as to what i wanted , but by now i ' d forwarded my company '_s logo over and had received several ' proofs ' of how the finished product would look .
F	wrong !
F	i managed to find my item at a good price on active_beauty and the ordering was simple .
F	very disappointed the item hasn_'_t arrived yet as it is a christmas_present and i am worried i won_'_t have time to exchange if not liked
F	tracey king
M	" never_heard of that offer " was the reply .
M	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
F	i have emailed their help_desk numerous_times without_any reply .
M	to our astonishment , the customer service desk admitted there were frequent complaints , but that '_s how it had to be because " management want to pack as many cars in as possible ".
M	i '_ve bookmarked the outdoor shop and will_definitely be shopping there again .
F	one year later , two lost houses later , £££ in wasted phone_calls and recorded delivery costs the underwriter finally contacted me yesterday to tell me the decision in principle issued by hsbc was wrong ( delivered in a manner suggesting this error is somehow my fault ) all couched in extremely xenophobic terms .
M	sent the album back yesterday .
F	it smelled very ' watered_down ' and is nothing like what the real perfume smells like . :( i will think_twice before i order anything_else from them . they used to be my first choice . shame !
M	to stop others making the same mistake i made regards_graham
F	the whole_experience has_been very upsetting
F	money was paid when they said it would be .
F	?
M	ordered some boxes of protien bars with the 00_% promo cde and love the fact all flavones are available and can '_t wait to try blueberry smoothie !
F	contacted them and a full_refund given straight_away
F	however using google translator i managed .
F	the stiffeners themselves though are lovely - light , beautifully_engraved and a nice little stocking_filler for my husband .
F	mazuma were gave_us an excellent price for my old phone and the cheque came extremelly quickly .
M	otherwise , half the reviews are unhelpful to 0 party or the other and often seem silly when being read by prospective bookers .
F	phoned again , the manager was very apologetic and refunded my 00_% of what i '_d paid .
M	buying the tyres and arranging the fitting , wheel_balancing , tracking , a complete service at a choice of tyre_fitter nearest to your home is just brilliant , at a time and date of your choice , now that is what i call service .
M	box office agent sorted_out the problem and gave_us better seats for that night .
M	they also have good communications so you always know what '_s going on .
M	they sent it to panasonic who said it wasnt a manufacturing_fault .
M	i don_'_t understand_why you don_'_t bubble_wrap it or take additional measures to protect and take_responsibility rather_than fobbing it off and blaming it on couriers or postal companies .
F	love it will order through you guys again !
F	i ordered lights for my christmas_tree in good time according to the website .
F	veronica
M	however , it then seemed to revert to my billing_address ( which is different ) and was delivered to southampton instead of didcot today .
F	finally , later than they said it would be ready , a new drive was returned to us .
M	this being completely contrary to what baryy granderson told me .
F	!
F	they keep their costs to a minimum , which helps our profit_margins .
F	i have emailed them thry said i will get the phones back and be reimbursed . how true that is i dont_know doubtful !
M	excellent value for money .
F	ordered 0 nail_files on 00th_december & never received them .
F	highly_recommended .
M	they dispatched it quickly and they had the best price for the product after doing lots of shopping around they were also one of very few companies offering free_postage on it !
F	i got round it by putting stickers on but it took a while to match the symbols from the instruction_sheet .
M	no a good advert for a packaging company !
F	i noticed that the recipient address had defaulted back to my own address so immediately emailed to request that they change it .
M	never any_problems with the website , payment options or delivery .
M	fast , safe payment
F	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room £_00 cheaper elsewhere . luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
M	you wont find better , nuff_said .
F	got this product from my vet it is half the price on here and arrived very quickly i will not_hesitate in using you again
F	i paid £_00 . 00 for a polo_shirt which is of very average quality .
M	couldn_'_t have been better
F	have lived and worked abroad as well as travelled for forty_years .
M	it has cost me 0 days from work , but they have paid for the carpet + vinyl covering for the en - suite , so at_least they have been fair , but if there guy '_s had the right equipment we all wouldn_'_t have had this drama .
F	registered and pack arrived within a couple of days .
M	after deliberating for over an_hour on whether or not to take the plunge , imagine my relief when the voucher_code turned_up in my account a few minutes after ordering .
M	playing ping_pong with a laptop .
M	you get what you pay for , always check out the shops fully before ordering and their stock_levels .
M	been with them for so long i cant_remember but never had an issue with orange .
F	they told us that they were never informed of the change of date .
M	and a very efficient service with 0st day shipping service .
M	excellent communication , goods collected on time and , bearing in mind it was over a weekend , the goods were delivered in good time .
M	first and last time i '_ll ever go there .
F	!
F	blackpool
F	very quick delivery , very cheap prices .
F	you do not provide any sort of site map .
F	i have ordered from beauty_bay before , but would think hard about ordering through them in the future .
M	flowers didn_'_t arrive_till about 0pm when it was dark and they were left in a wheely bin !
M	i have bought several pairs of oakley_sunglasses from eyewear_outlet over the past couple of years and every time i get great prices and fantastic overall service .
M	this has to be the easiest_way to buy batteries .
M	ordered 0000 microsoft_points at 00pm , and the code was in my email inbox by 00 :_00pm - you can '_t ask for more than that .
F	its a fantastic company and i have already_recommended petfleas to my family & friends .
F	bags , ribbon and tissue_paper are great value
M	i have been very impressed with the quality of service , particularly , price and prompt delivery of affordable_supplements .
M	still having said that , the company and my experience ( forgetting the price for a moment ) of the company is favourable .
F	they dealt_with my problem very quickly .
M	clear and concise pricing .
F	please steer well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
M	never had a problem with o0 or vodafone .
F	fast , reliable , polite service .
F	a bit more care with packages and this company would stand_out way above the rest
F	unfortunately all the rose_buds had drooped and were discolouring within 00_hours .
M	.
M	kind of too late on wednesday though , ruined the moment !
F	it '_s only next week for goodness_sake !
F	in relation to other service providers , zapper are poor .
F	i found this out the hard way after paying them £_000 .
F	i use interparcel regularly
M	i was so impressed with the ease of it all .
F	i had my details at hand when i was contacted by the payment team just to be told that i had been given the wrong information and only the telephone support could be paid over 00 months which was only around £_00 !!
F	soak and sleep to the rescue , a new parcel delivered to me in less_than 00_hours from contacting them to discuss the situation .
M	" our excellent service continues after your purchase too , offering you spares and after care as well as comprehensive warranty ,"
M	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
M	i would use this company again .
F	i was less_than impressed when i found out she didn_'_t know who they were from after paying 0 . 00 for a card .
M	your 0th paragraph is basic trading law , don_'_t big yourself up , you cannot trade without conforming to such rules .
F	we understand that the fault had to be repaired before sailing , but we did feel there was little or nothing done to compensate for the inconvenience_caused .
F	the people that work there are completely_useless and don_'_t seem to know what they are doing ; they are also rude and unprofessional .
M	when collecting the car , the drop_off drive joked that the car worked well for the girls the night before .
F	rubbish company and i will certainly not deal with them again !
M	outdated food , undercooked instore biscuits , filthy shop floors dopey staff and a management_team that must have mickey_mouse degrees in window shopping ??
F	the cushions are nice and thick .
F	very bad website , very rude and very poor customer service .
M	treated_like an_idiot when dates were missed ,
F	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ". but no one ever does .
M	very poor .
F	returned it for super_fast refund of full_amount & both postages .
F	the website allows you to create an account but there is no functionality yet but it is coming apparently so that will be great because it '_s very hard to contact the company by phone ( engaged_tone for hours at some times of day , i guess it just gets busy ).
M	excellent company that i will recommend to family and friends
M	this company is criminal . they prescribe prescriptions which don_'_t need to be given .
M	order was completed and dispatched as details were well communicated via e_- mail .
F	bought 0 pairs of dickies redhawk work trousers for my husband and they are very good quality .
M	took my order and payment .
M	i have now emailed 0 times and tried to call numerous_times ( the phone is always engaged ).
F	loads of information about the various products and such good value .
F	the flight was also late , but i guess for the low_cost , this is to be expected
F	the food was nice , a good portion but some of the flavours we a bit bland so i added spice / herbs to balance the existing flavours .
F	the reason i '_ve given parts_gateway only 0_stars is because i trusted their reviews and i was let_down_badly .
M	the people i think of first to help me , are within the rla .
M	lets_hope the shipping has gotten better then the reviews let on .
F	i ordered treats , so it really didn_'_t matter too much , but if someone needed an item quite urgently , this would be an issue .
M	?
M	this was caused in part as we could not reach the number given and when we did they claimed no knowledge of us .
M	a wasted four day break
F	the beanbag itself is fine but it has a chemically odour which i '_m hoping will fade as its newness wears off .
F	of the two seals i received one fitted great the shower_door but the one for the p - shaped screen was difficult and it creased on fitting so not very happy at all with that one !
M	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
M	have to say again no_problems with usrentacar but dollar was a big disappointment and we will use alamo as we normally did in the past !
F	would use again .
M	i will be recommending your company to my friends and family
M	highly_recommended and will_certainly deal with again .
M	money was taken on the 0th .
F	the flowers were sent by my sister and me in appreciation of the kindness to her of my late mother '_s neighbours .
M	couldn_'_t ask for more .
F	nothing was offered in terms of an_apology or solution and after years of loyal custom i am basically told to sod_off .
F	the whole_experience was so straightforward and the end_result excellent .
F	i have tried diet_chef before and found the meals convenient & acceptable , but now don_'_t seem to be experiencing any weight_loss as it seems i am committed to 0_months i am not looking_forward to the experience
M	the item was delivered on time and in good order , the price was right and i was very pleased .
M	when i put my order into wetsuitoutlet i felt_confident that if it didn_'_t fit ( it does ) i would get my money back .
F	will_definately order again .
F	and i saved £_00 on the rrp of the lighting , which also came with the bulbs .
F	we were offered other apartments for double the price which we can '_t afford .
M	flowers sent on wrong day
M	the price is competitive though .
F	my stepmother said the flowers were beautiful and so many !
F	they should not be taking customers money , making promises that the delivery date would not be changed again only to let you down once more .
M	my gtech_multi was promised by email on a given date , did not arrive , after nearly 0_weeks rang to find no record of it , although i had paid by paypal , had to phone again and start the process again !
F	still not received .
F	told to order online .
M	i included tracking and balancing , at_least £_00 cheaper_than quickfit and £_00 cheaper_than halfords for two tyres , fitting and tracking .
F	excellent service .
M	took a screwdriver_set and adjustable spanner only to find not sufficient , neccessitating a long round_trip to obtain spanner .
F	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
F	they have a spot to let them know anything special so i said as much . turned_out to be pointless .
F	very disappointing inthe service , i will have to go to the vets tomorrow to collect some more which is additional time and money that is not acceptable .
F	i have tried to leave a review on getting personal '_s own website , but they have not published it , probably because it is such a poor review .
M	giood cover but the claim process seems a bit of a hassle , yet to complete it so i can '_t say how well it works in the long run .
F	update 00 / 00 /_0000
F	by night 0 the backache had gone , by night 0 we were sleeping for hours at a time .
F	stay away from groupon and infurn !
F	always beautiful flowers but often failed delivery on the day selected .
F	from booking to fitting it was all a doddle !
M	i got them at a great price and they arrived promptly .
M	?
M	the adidas supernova pro sunglasses were in perfect_condition .
F	trip ok ships facilities so so
M	the goods came in good time and were of excellent quality .
F	goods are late or get lost ; damart doesn_'_t tell you whether items are in stock or not ( or the info is wrong ); they don_'_t send a message to tell you that goods or dispatched or when you can expect them .
M	looks a good quality product and finish .
M	there second answer is its on the receipt . wells that pure gold as i '_ve already purchased it !!
M	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
F	from deciding on a car to actually getting the car took a few_months .
F	when i need additional badges my design is retained and i can reorder quickly .
F	i am very disappointed with them and i will not shop_here again .
F	sent : thursday , december 00 , 0000 0 : 00_pm
F	i had to buy through viagogo at the unbelievable price of €_000 and then there was a booking_fee on top of €_000 !!!!!
F	' reference_number : x000000000
M	as the title_says , great for service items but thoroughly hopeless for anything_else
F	what could be better .
M	it '_s maybe a case of ' you get what you pay for ' and this is cheap grade double walled cardboard .
M	this has turned_out to be a compete nightmare , which is the last thing you need , when trying to book a relaxing_holiday
M	nobody contacted me to tell me about the delay , or the reason for the delay .
F	will let you know when it is delivered !!!
F	i repsonded to one of these e_-_mails with every_single photo of the damage that i had , explaining that there weren_'_t sufficient fields online .
M	advice was free and plentiful .
F	had to chase_up where my order was .
F	if i could have rated it lower_than 0_star i would have done .
F	i '_m_sure everything will taste fine , but i was anticipating a bit more .
F	i recognize this schools as a great place to become a professional bartender .
M	they look crisp , operate smoothly and didn_'_t cost the earth .
F	!
F	apparently rotary is happy for its authorised distributors to use its brand to lure customers with non - existent products .
F	ordered 0 . 00 , arrived next_day at lunchtime .
M	abbey , if you improve your feed_back , stock notifications , couriers & add a next_day option , you would get 0_stars from me .
M	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
F	never had a negative_comment or bad_experience .
F	also added to my order few other things which i never got but i was charged !!
F	i have been recommending pc_specialist to family and friends .
F	i had an_email to say code was attached but on opening it that '_s all i had was the message_saying codes are delivered before 0pm .
M	mazuma make everything simple .
M	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
F	very quick delivery , and competitive price
M	very satisfied with service .
M	i will stay as i am and then migrate to a better coverage company and get the latest phone cheaper there .
M	how can i set a monthly limit of £_00 and end up with a £_000 bill ?
M	i am now the proud_owner of a highly prized registration
F	found the website easy to navigate .
F	i sent another email but did not receive a very quick response .
M	ordered on monday , received next monday .
F	perfect packaging !!
M	unfortunately no provision for delivery specifics . parcel delivery people insisting on a signature , no body to receive parcel what do you do . able to give secure delivery ! 0 phone_calls later we can only hope eurofit have spoken to parcel del !. adice on delivery time would not have helped anyway .
F	i placed the order weeks in_advance of when i needed it delivering .
M	i sent it off in the post with the address and a section saying my reason of return on the box .
F	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .
F	the delivery was excellent good communication and on time . full_marks but it was delivered in a box weighing 00_kg and they placed the desk the wrong way round . as a single person i had to devise a way of getting the desk out of the very small room and out if all it '_s packaging .
F	it was an embarrassment .
F	i would definitely use them again and would recommend them to a friend !
F	the packaging to send my phones off with arrived very quickly , as did my cheque once i had sent my phones .
M	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look into it .
F	not sure what i was expecting really but thought this was great and something i will use again in the future .
M	problem is my wife has money on it and can '_t even top up .
F	he sorted everything in one phone_call .
M	my order was for several products ( was considering repeat_orders , but thinking twice_now ) and one reason i choose complete_care shop over other_sellers was for its fast delivery , hence the reliability that comes from that , which we all need and look for when we shop on - line , especially when its to do with care and the need for products asap !!!
M	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
F	i have had to order some flowers for a friend in birmingham and found a company online called serenata_flowers and decided to give them a go and they were brilliant !
F	sending the phones off with a pre_- paid label which you could track was a bonus and got paid really quickly .
M	brilliant products at very reasonable prices
F	the last four orders i '_ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
M	i refuse to shop online with them now !
M	would i use again , not sure yet .
M	coming down this morning there was another lily head lying limp and one of the other flowers is lying with its head low x .
M	i have used the amazon contact procedure , the suppliers contact procedure and obviously yodel also .
F	i was rather disappointed that i had to pay so much money for so little !
F	however , she cheerily & efficiently dealt_with my booking & assured me that if we discover we have paid twice just to let them know .
M	delighted with service , found everything i wanted and it all arrived next_day .
F	i have been first in line for the past 0 minutes and the time is still going up .
M	oh and you gotta_love getting free t - shirts and shaker_bottles !
M	the window was very poorly built and had to be replaced .
F	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
M	internet shops are not like going to a real store .
F	the supervisor was equally rude in a dismissive tone .
F	delivery has never been a problem and have always arrived on time .
F	they need to make it clearer on this web_site what you are and arent getting .
F	the estimated time for the delivery of my parcel was between 00 - 00am and 00 - 00am , the delivery was made at 00 - 00am on the dot .
F	first time i had purchased glasses online
F	great products and service from bathshop000 .
M	furthermore the free chocolates that were supposed to accompany them , did not .
F	this is about the third time i have used their service and each time they did exactly_what they said they would .
F	i am disappointed to have lost money and would not advise others to use this company .
F	the upside is that there are so many around !
F	to add_insult to injury , the rest of the email ( do these people never actually talk to their customers ?)
M	), as it got held in one of their depots for a few_days missing the saturday delivery i paid extra for .
F	good for my emails but can be abit slow sometimes
F	the process was great and very simple .
M	the winter_wheels in question were used on 00 occasions over the winter doing total of 00 complete rounds of golf by which time the rubber was coming away around the studs .
M	overpriced , poor quality , helpful staff on a good day , products tend to be inferior compared to wickes . b_& q isn_'_t always reliable but homebase is the asda of diy_sheds .
F	when i ordered the product , i fully expected it to take the full two_weeks , having read recent reviews on this site .
F	i felt sorry for the mechanic as his day wasted as was mine .
M	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
F	and don_'_t know of another comprehensive stockist such as jeanography .
M	still on video i placed the order and he confirmed that it would be processed and checked before despatch .
F	flowers were fine , and delivered on time .
M	- no product
F	box 0 finally arrived on saturday .
M	found out later that order had been cancelled despite further request for info to aid tracking the order .
F	funny enough .
F	very shocked to receive such genuine advice for my acne when i called , i have never received a better service in 00 years of trying to treat my adult acne and needing help despite using other professional clinics .
F	we recently gave our 0_months notice to end our contract on our rented flat , and shortly_afterwards greene & co started to book viewings .
F	on 0th_may received a ' do not respond ' email , saying my order was delayed ( i had worked that out by now !!)
M	the only part that '_s gone_smoothly so_far is taking the money from me !
F	i wish i had got signed for at the post_office but didn_'_t think necessary at the time ?
M	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
F	clear website and quick to find the right product straight_away .
F	fast delivery , excellent service and good price .
F	ordered a fridge_freezer and paid in full - website said 0 - 00 working_days for delivery and i '_m now on about 00 working_days !!
F	also when querying the delivery issue to the customer service team they didn_'_t offer much help instead just tried to fob you off .
F	i would usually use an interflora florist but thought i would try this company for a change .
F	to be honest i was really disappointed with them and my mother even commented on them which made me very embarrassed !
M	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
F	everything was hassle_free , and i even got an e_- mail to inform_me that my money was back in the bank .
M	i want to buy youview through them but they ' re too slow and never ready .
F	the only_thing i thought might be useful would have been a small kettle to heat up water for cups of tea , but we microwaved our water in lieu of a kettle .
F	nothing really more to add than that , other than the obvious , standing in the cold waiting for them to turn_up on both the collection and delivery .
M	oh my fuck , imagine my surprise when a bag of human fertilizer the size of a small village arrived on my doorstep filled with a powder , which had a flavour i can only describe as ' delicious win mixed with a side of gains '.
M	up to 0_weeks delivery - no chance still_waiting - should of been delivered before_christmas for my 0 children .
F	it was really embarrassing because it was a gift for a lady_who was retiring .
F	not great service .
F	great service , very fast and was the best overall price in comparison to other_sellers .
F	the toucans are just what i was looking for .
M	there was some problems after it .
M	the suit arrived well_packed .
F	the staff are friendly and the proof will be in the results so we '_ll see , i just hope those paying full price get a little more service and attention !
F	avoid as the build quality is poor and the staff are rude and unhelpful .
F	what was received was the type of flowers you would pay £ 0 for in a petrol_station !
F	would really like to use this site to order again however the delivery charge will stop me doing this .
F	i also wonder what state the items may be in if they ever arrive having been out on the van for 0_days and now at the garage .
F	they have an excellent website but i experienced real difficulties trying to contact the customer_services team to obtain a clear_indication of when the car was going to be delivered .
M	a letter was received dated 0 march telling us that due to delays with suppliers ( what else ?
F	however , somehow the company can go to the post_office to deliver goods to mainland_uk , but not to northern_ireland ?!?
M	delivery was quick , however the bag i received was not the one shown in the picture .
M	delivery was on time and narrowed_down to a 0 hour_timeslot .
F	i was very disappointed that there were no instructions with the ' kit ' for the shower .
F	helpful customer_services , excellent prices and prompt delivery along with free delivery makes me return to this company again as i know i can_rely_on them .
F	very conveniently they have no record of my complaint back in february .
M	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
F	!
F	however , despite someone being in all day the flowers did not arrive at her address .
F	hubby needed new glasses and as we were getting depressed with paying out £_000 for his prescription ( very bad_eyesight ), thought we would give glasses 0 you a try as the glasses hubby liked were a quarter of the price .
M	great shopping_experience
F	they were still nice but not what i '_d wanted !
F	i don_'_t know if we can still return it .
M	i '_m a repeat_customer .
M	at_least one stop of light will be lost in the automatic conversion .
M	then i had a call off the person i ordered the flowers off that the next door_neighbour had been delivered them an had brought them round .
F	hello , just wanted to say thankyou for not booking my connecting_flight to manchester .
M	have sent a second email and now not holding breath .
M	i told_him i didnt want them and to send me what i ordered , but he wanted me to send the others back first which im not happy with !
F	we tried to ring customer service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
M	if the date was on the confirmation , no problem .
M	queried this with halfords who really couldn_'_t be_bothered .
M	" apologies for the hold up in refunding your order .
M	yodel confirmed that the driver had not been in the area .
M	my order arrived well_packaged and pre_- installed with everything which was needed .
F	the delivery was quick and i was kept_informed at every_stage global gps .
M	however , if you also want a hassle and stress_free claims process ( not an unreasonable request in my opinion ), then i would avoid the warranty shop at all costs
F	to be noted a discount for hm armed_forces which is a big positive .
M	0_weeks after first using this , i '_m still_waiting for result !
F	the pole company is a fraction of the price , i got a bargin and so pleased in the process . im a happy_bunny :-)
F	will definitely go back to them in the future , very high_quality goods
M	it is a great way to stay in touch , i just wish they would leave it how it was before !
F	!
F	however , as i was not given the option to select saturday delivery , the products arrived on monday .
M	i am most baffled by the lazy computer speak so have problems trying to understand what is being said .
F	this is now my 0th car from peugeot and stoneacre and again i am highly pleased with the level of service and care from the sales_team .
F	would recommend service to anyone .
F	it wasn_'_t in stock oh_yes it is in stock but not been unpacked yet !
M	booked a next_day pick_up with citi link - item was collected on a thursday ( citi link say it was friday but it was my sister who handed the parcel to the driver ) & item was then delivered on the monday .
F	we entered all the details correctly ( or so we thought ) and upon our return the car was not ready as the system had us down for returning a day later .
M	i '_ll genuinely probably just use ebay next time , and get my products for maybe a couple of £'_s extra yes but with a hassle - free service including no strings_attached next - day delivery .
M	i recently_bought a new camera through jessops website .
M	looked very congealed and i was one of the first into the restaurant .
M	unprofesional will newer use again .
F	plus all i knew i will be home all day so i '_ve paid_extra for the saturday delivery !
M	the next_day i received a call to say the shower - screen was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be available until the middle of may .
M	i was contacted by optical_express by phone many_times telling_me that there is a surgical procedure to cure my vision .
M	i ordered a chain catcher .
F	the upstairs is fine but it is very small downstairs and my granddaughters age 0 and 0 have to bend down on all fours to access this area - not good at all .
F	even i brought an android_tablet from them via wowcher .
M	i emailed boohoo customer_services , got an answer back within a day and told that the item was still in stock , i said i would like it and thought that would be that .
M	they keep u update with e_- mails and postage is really quick i '_ve never waited more than a couple of days for my stuff will be using again .
M	this is another review about the poor service at the pekham store
F	regards sarah
M	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
M	in 0_weeks , with 00 traps in our kitchen , no roaches caught , but several seen in the open or caught by hand ( glove ).
M	nobody got in touch to say that it would be delayed .
M	really good .
F	i could use mine ( which are very difficult to fix in ) or use booster_seats they provided .
M	the price they offered was far lower_than anywhere_else i looked .
F	i was offered a £ 0 voucher_code but this didn_'_t work when i tried to use it .
F	have used this service now may times and have never had a problem .
F	very quick delivery and reasonable_prices will order in future
F	the delivery was quick and so was getting a refund apon returning my items but boo . hoo needs to have bigger_sizes available , i '_m generally a size 00 - 00 but boo . hoo '_s 00 came up like a size 00 and the 00 came up like a 00 so was very dissapointed with this
F	hoping the customer service will be too .
M	i guess it makes the driver feel better .
F	!
F	emailed me exactly_what i needed to order from walls and floors and emailed walls and floors direct to get them to call me back and confirm my order .
M	a great product at a great price .
M	i would recommend tyre_shopper to anyone .
F	i am not surprised to say that the flowers were actually delivered at 00 . 00 in the evening !
M	i buy of many retailers and do most my buying online
M	the bride asked for a bound album " like the one her friend had ".
M	fit ok but plastic on driver side is slippery when wet , not good .
M	did what it said on the tin !
F	so i called the customer service team and spoke to an agent who gave_me unbiased_advice on the products so i was better able to make a decision .

F	i have always been happy with topcashback , but recently i have been thinking_about leaving them , because i signed_up to a one month trial for cashbackplus and surprise , surprise , i forgot to cancel it .
M	our pool was also closed was a few hours as the ph was wrong ( we found this out after a couple of our party were unwell ).
M	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
F	excellent website
M	this is the parcel service to use , 000_% success_rate with collection and delivery .
F	one bunch was nice but the other very poor .
F	the customer service person told me that they were showing as out of stock , but it was an_error they were in stock .
F	the selection is excellent and due to their location , i am able to collect my goods instead of paying delivery charges .
F	the de - wormer on the website page stated that the product was 000_% effective for all worms usually found to effect cats , which is whay i ordered it .
M	good product but not impressed with prices for delivery
F	we live in the highlands , so there '_s no chance of a courier delivery at the weekend , which leaves very little time for the tickets to arrive .
F	there was also a blue mark in the writing and the 0 ends of the sash were just cut_off and not sewn together , which_meant i had to sew them together my self .
M	had to contact by phone for advice , excellent service and product .
M	i hate amazon , i had £ 0000 voucher balance in my account and they closed it , the reason is i bought too much !
M	many_thanks ,
F	received a text when delivered , super service , thanks :)
F	i was kept well - informed_throughout the whole order & delivery process , and the goods arrived on time .
M	only_downside is the price for a week .
M	loaded up looking good , took important stuff off old system onto new only to have a notification about my windows key not being right .
M	overall very good , would definitely use again .
F	i have a kitten , so i couldnt take part in the offer .
F	would highly_recommend to anyone .
M	called the company to cancel order and when i tried to make a complaint to the operator on the phone i heard " oh for f_** k sake " said either by him or in the background .
M	so_far , all my orders with herbies has turned_out good !
M	i then offered to pay for the other item to be sent separately when it came in to stock but for some reason was not allowed to do that so i cancelled the whole order .
M	spent an_hour argueing that the item i wanted to return was not medication , and i wanted a refund .
F	very very disappointing that nobody seems to care about this and i am expected to keep chasing and making phone_calls and getting_nowhere .
F	not helpful for me because i hadn_'_t had roman_blinds before so wasn_'_t aware of this .
M	despatched quickly for next_day delivery
M	definitely one of the best shop around .
M	no explanation .
M	very well_presented shopping_experience .
F	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
M	i sent my phone in full working order no cracks or scratches however when it came to paying me my money they did not offer the full_amount it is the first time i have used this company and is going to be the last i have always used mazuma and never had problems and been paid the full_amount with them .
M	".
M	by clients if also the delivery service is not up to reasonable standard .
F	i complained to serenata and they said that they ' would look into it as a matter of urgency ' and i would hear in 00_hours - not really much use as they were a birthday_present , nor is 00_hours particularly ' urgent '.
F	other than that , great service and i would definitely use again !
M	do not take out a product or service with this company .
M	keep it up !
F	when i arrived it took several minutes for the blood to start circulation as the seats were so close together and uncomfortable to boot , the staff were snooty and unhelpful , next time i visit my friends in toulouse i will drive , i will not be using bmi baby again .
F	one of the minibuses went back to kirkcaldy to collect it .
M	was looking to boost the ram on my imac i0 to the full 00gb .

F	fazit , wir werden keine buchungen mehr bei ebookers tätigen , sondern bei einem anderen anbieter , der die richtlinien nicht so straff hat und innerhalb 00 stunden eine umbuchung vorgenommen werden kann .
F	once they had my money they didnt seem to care .
M	i haven_'_t .
M	rude staff
M	small left breast logo were delivered .
M	great company very good fast service would use again the tracking worked so well how many other_companys do that and let you change delivery day very good thanks
F	thank_you .
M	anyway , back to the madness ,. 00 days_later and 0 phone_calls too , i am still looking at this box , waiting for it to be collected .
F	online service = good , ability to collect part from depot = very , very poor .
M	a few which did not conform exactly to the size specified were printed on slightly_larger paper which is not a bad idea .
F	instead of this i received a new phone number and spent in total 0 - 0 hours chatting with the customer service and until now the new unwanted number is still active and guess_what i am still on pay as you go and completely frustrated .
M	these contact_lenses are fantastic and very comfortable .
M	great product very pleased .
M	in a service sector plagued by unhappy clients who engage with unreliable rental_companies , carhire0000 proved_themselves to be extremely efficient , helpful ( on the phone ) and able to offer excellent prices .
F	it '_s no wonder hermes is rated so badly , and why asos ' profits are dropping .
M	you had the best website , with the best choice of designs and easy to use .
F	i usually get really good service from them , so i wouldn_'_t leave , but the flowers i just ordered died within a couple of days when they normally last much longer .
F	i '_m going to have to get him some more - they ' re quality and worth the price paid .
M	quidco appear to have done their best , and i haven_'_t lost confidence in them , but it has taken a lot of chasing , and too long .
F	never use them

F	also great value for money :)
F	however this was further delayed and i had to keep emailing to check for updates .

M	abbey made no effort to contact me , i had to chase them for everything .
M	very good , lots of choice , reasonably_priced , delivery prompt .
M	not happy so_far .
F	when we tried to leave they wouldn_'_t transfer our account to the new company we chose .
M	many white goods are cheaper on line without the hassle of arranging your own delivery , installation and disposal .
F	online ordering was very easy and i needed to change the date and rung up to do so and staff were helpful .
M	!
M	prompt service .
M	please avoid at all costs .
F	have had no_problems with mazuma after dealing_with them several_times over the years sending them my old_phones .
M	they told me my order had been stopped at customs , and they handled my copmlaint greatly .

M	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .

M	we '_ve purchased an entire bathroom for our new property and whilst it looks great , the plumber has had major problems with the poor quality plumbing fittings provided .
M	their stores are fundamentally bombed out regardless of their blue and white exterior , and although their prices might be marginally lower my favourite other food store ( waitrose ) does not leave a bad_taste in my mouth or stomach unlike tesco .
F	the day i could upgrade i moved my contract to orange so deal with them directly and cut out phones 0 u . i cannot tell you how much relief i felt knowing that i never have to deal with this company again .
M	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
F	i would definetely recommend this company to anybody .
M	most definitely will order from greenman again in the future .
M	surprised ?
M	watching this performance and then being told that the couriers get paid 00p for each delivery which has to cover wages , fuel and car use , i can understand_why so many deliveries go_wrong .
F	good choice of sunglasses wanted aviators and was not disappointed .
M	why not send the answer directly to you ?
M	sometimes i would only receive half of my prescription because of local shortages ( like when hay_fever season_starts ) and have to go back a couple of days_later ( another 0 miles ).
M	overall a good service though .
F	pleased with overall service
M	back on the phone again , they questioned my order till they found the invoice and had to send the rest of the parts out , they came the next_day .
M	they have a stupid policy about delivery to addresses other than your credit_card address , which no other supplier bothered with .
F	unacceptable !
M	i am very careful when it comes to buying tools and equipment etc .
M	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
M	in summary could to better !
M	delivered next business day .
M	reliable delivery and fair pricing too .
F	my advise is to ensure that your prescriptions are showing against your account , is to shop early so that you have time to chase and chase and chase before the pets drug supply runs_out .

F	stayed in all day on the lovely sunny saturday while my family went off to the coast , grrrrrr yes you can guess , the delivery company didn_'_t deliver , so let_down that i had ruined a whole day and with the prospect of having to wait in all day again on the coming monday .

F	it '_s a great place for me personally to shop because being 00g the choice of goodies in my size is way more than the high_street and also having three daughters makes present buying very easy too !
F	the mattress was good but the bed that we bought with it was rubbish , the slats broke and fell out when we wanted a refund they only gave_us £_00 although we paid £_000 .

M	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to .
M	cant save to file as it wont let_me select that option either !.
M	the worst part of the outfit by far was the wig , flat packed to within an inch of its life it came out of the wrapping and basically " puffed " out like an afro , after 00_mins frantic styling and pinning with the wife it resembled something like an elvis hairstyle but was very disappointing and i must_admit kinda spoiled the outfit .
F	not royal_mail and not guaranteed by 0pm .
F	0 ) lowest_price guarantee is not valid .
M	ok service but quoted higher price than advertised on website .
M	i then receieved a call to say it would be sunday morning to collect from store and what documents would i like saved .

F	i placed my order on a sunday lunchtime and received an_email the day after from the couriers regarding tracking my delivery , this made me think that i would be getting the delivery that day maybe as the delivery showed that it was with them .
M	will never use these_people again .
F	i ordered a pair of cycling_shorts for my husband after midday & they were with me first thing the following_morning .

M	i '_ve called customer service three_times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
F	the item arrived well packeted !

M	direct_sight took 0_weeks to repair my specs and i never did receive my new pair .
M	their price for the same key was only £ 0 . 00 - including_vat & delivery , so i thought i give them a shot .
F	our broadband and land - line have not been activated now 0_days past activation date !
F	we also went to a brilliant gourmet pizza restaurant round the corner that i can recommend called babalou .
F	also the zips are temperamental .
F	luckily my paypal_account is backed_up with my mastercard , which means they have refunded my £_000 and will retrieve it from them via their protection procedures .
M	i ordered a berghaus ilam jacket online .
M	it was a large cheque to be presented to a charity , and the end_result is deeply embarrassing .
M	the car was driven round to the front , i paid and started my journey home .

F	who_knows ?
F	outrageous !

F	it '_s flooded with adverts and ways of connecting with big companies - the types of company i don_'_t want to have my personal information .

F	i did have to remind him to put the free item on the order - twice !
M	despite describing the problem , made to jump_through_hoops and now have to send back and they examine before i get replacement .

M	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
F	there needs to be better quality control of items being dispatched by post and now i have to go to the unfortunate task of posting this back - at an additional_cost of recorded delivery ( as per instructions ) and requesting a refund .
M	don_'_t get caught by this company - read all the other reviews - nearly all say similar things , either item not delivered , or no refund received .

F	it is a step forward for on - line buying .
F	great service , and even better if you ask to speak to ricky .

M	chris from abbey rang me to discuss_options after i had sent an email about their current offers on their website .

M	me i asked ?
F	when we got back and we opened the box at first we were shocked by the small_amount and mainly made up cheap flowers .
F	it is an_absolute_joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
M	use this company
M	good communication .
M	i then phoned to confirm the details and order .
F	the boot arrived 0_days from placing my order ( i chose 0 day tracking mail ) but obviously the first day you place your order is not counted .

M	michael
M	i place the order and i received the delivery within a week .

F	i have tried_calling again , but the phone is not being answered .
M	they are rude , arogant and extremely unhelpful .
F	i have then received payment 0_days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .

F	wtf ?

F	i have had fabulous times at hotels that have had very bad_reviews .

M	we were disappointed that they were not local companies so all lacked that personal care that we expected i would like to add that we did not select any of the companies
F	what a joke !
M	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
F	order arrived in different batches which was fine_except most of the first delivery was left on the van and had to come separately after a phone_call to bbs .
M	a liar ?
F	but i was so disappointed to find that neither pair fitted .
M	what more can i say .
F	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
F	nothing was too much_trouble .
F	the customer service returns was very helpful and hassle_free and the refund was very quick .
F	the company is now refusing to respond .
F	i used to love this . then i started_playing wow .
M	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
M	thank_you .
F	the biggest con is the computer as the labels are all in chinese .
M	running out of stock with what i have , my diet messed_up etc . surely a supplement supplier should understand what this means to a sports fanatic and personal_trainer no ?
M	we were told - yes , that is definite .
M	i have always said that any idiot can run a business when its going well .
M	i would however like to suggest that the site contains an option where the buyer could be contacted by text or email to inform when the flowers have arrived to the recipient .
M	thankyou guys :)
M	the service and prices are excellent , delivery turned_out ok but only just .
F	very dissapointing and stressful experience .

M	it is not my responsibility as a customer to care about the internal politics of iceland or their figures and it shouldn_'_t be used as an excuse to deny me my money back .
M	i found go - electrical through and online search , and was delighted at their web - price .
F	it was really easy to order from the website .
F	couldn_'_t change online again and so this went on a couple of times .

M	absolutely no_fuss or trouble at all .

M	two items went wrong in 0 months , reason , ill packaged kit , amp not suitable for the speakers .

M	as usual , the clerk handling the prior conditions assessment was not technically expert , just filling in a form , and it was hard to work out the logic of the form – if a condition had been corrected by treatment it was sometimes regarded as a continuing risk and sometimes not – so it wasn_'_t easy to make_sure that you were making a full disclosure , and i wasn_'_t sure at the end of it whether i was actually being charged more than once for the same condition .
F	am trying to do so again now as i write this .
F	however when i did order the car then sales appeared to be more helpful .

F	they delivered on time and the product was delivered in good condition .
F	will definitely use simply_games again .
M	they claim the account is a business account , even_though it is abundantly clear this was a personal purchase , and will not back down .
F	overall was good but made me go for full - empty fuel_policy which i dont like .
M	instead i had to make alternative_arrangements for the following_day and my partner went to have my tyre fitted as i had to borrow her car to honour an out of town appointment
M	when i enquired as to why , i was told it was locked to icloud .
M	but i wonder_if this is just a matter of time .
M	the whole_process including receiving money into my account took less_than a week .
M	i have used photoworld for several_years and have been very pleased with the results .
M	all good recommend

M	dependable quick service and a great range of tools
M	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i '_ve ever had .
F	i was told before i placed an order that i would be called before anything was dispatched to arrange a convenient delivery time - this did not happy and instead delivery was attempted on a weekday when no - one was home to take delivery .
F	! x
M	during the process of trying to get payment ( from next month ) back onto the credit_card which was unbelievably painful the credit_card ran a security check and almost cancelled the card !
M	i have contacted you twice_now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn_'_t good !
M	the quality is exceptional and you would be hard_pressed to tell it wasn_'_t brand_new .

F	the price was way cheaper for double the amount and the communication_regarding the delivery was excellent .
M	the flowers received to the flowers ordered where two completely separate things !
F	bought a bed from one of the companies they '_ve got on their website , comfy_living .
M	pathetic .
M	very good service and friendly people , they say they are there to help and they really are , nothing is to much_trouble for them .
M	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
F	the flowers got to the recipient but were delivered to and left at the wrong_address .
F	ordered 0 britax_car seats .
M	but they ignore emails or questions ticketed to them on the order .
F	avoid at all costs , and thanks sachin who took my call at 00 . 00 gmt on 00 / 00 /_0000 your a great flagship as a team_leader .
M	they did offer a replacement straight_away , but i did not want to pay the return postage on top of the original cost of the set of sticks .
F	i phoned customer service number and just got a recorded_message_saying people can charge whatever price the want when selling tickets .
M	i upgraded to the grandissimo size , 0 extra roses for £_00 , but the whole bunch arrived unbloomed and still all closed , not very pleasing on the eye , and now they have started to bloom , most are dropping heavily .
F	eventually , a week after ordering , it was urgent that i needed to get my goods .
F	unacceptable as these were for a bereavement and earlier warning should have been given so alternative_arrangements could be made .
M	apart_from that cheap nice car very good value .
M	i got a book done by blurb last_year and for around half the price the quality of the photos was much_nicer and more natural looking - although even these were less good than when printed on a photo printer .

M	the price is good , tyres provided as stated with a friendly service .

M	delivery etc was fine
M	seeing as juno were offering the entire cartridge for less_than other_places charged for just the stylus - and only a couple of pounds more than the stylus by itself - it was a no - brainer .
F	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
M	reported to groupon online where i was told to parcel the item and take it to the post_office !
F	however , when i phoned to discuss this this was resolved .
M	i asked for headphones but was told there weren_'_t any .
M	quick delivery was made , shame about the oil slick that was left on the drive , delivery was made when i was out .
M	the communication is first_class letting you know every_step of the way what is happening until the item is delivered to your door .
M	i looked at dolphin_music , among others , as the prices that they had for the kit i needed was excellent .
M	ordered the shorts online , expected them the following week but arrived well in time for a first_outing that weekend , price was not bad either !

F	i know i for one will never use ebookers again and i haven_'_t even taken off yet !!
F	the phone was reconnected .
F	i '_d rather take my chances going blind folded round a car boot sale than use this unhelpful un - customer service .
M	i always spread the good when it happens , but i also share the disappointment when it happens sadly .& thierry customer service is a lot to be desired or am i believe in thinking what customer service ????
M	p . s .
M	definately coming_back and using them again !

F	sorry .
F	i '_ve sent 0 emails over the past few_days and have threatened to notify trading_standards , watchdog and anyone_else i can think of .
M	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer service person has cut me off .
M	noooooo it hasn_'_t come .
M	up till now we would use db '_s site to work out the best route and train times , then book tickets from several different sites .
M	late christmas_present - didn_'_t expect it until new year but it arrived 00_hours_later with several emails to explain the order status .
F	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .

M	dispatch was prompt and the product arrived well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
M	desperate to have this nightmare come to an end , i toyed with the idea of going to collect it .
F	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
M	my item was exactly_what i needed at a decent price , the only one downfall was the delivery time , i ordered on the 0th which was a bank_holiday , but they said i would get it the 0th or 0th ,
F	having advised them i was contacting_trading_standards and a number of consumer watchdogs ( which i did ), i got an_email_apologising that the item hadn_'_t been dispatched when they '_d said adding that it had now been sent .
M	?
M	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry_form .
F	i then received an_email to say they '_ve been delivered - hurrah !!
F	many_thanks klm .

F	despite this , my order still took over one week to arrive .
M	the return was very easy , collected and paid for by sportsbikeshop , and the larger version arrived very shortly_after .
F	folllowing a puncture the car was changed rather_than a new tyre fitted .
F	so i waited and waited and waited .

F	i have rung this number left numerous messages and only twice been rung back .

M	service first order excellent second order all_sorts of problems .
M	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
F	hello i am disappointed you have not told me if the flowers have been delivered with your same day service .
F	it would have been nice if the flowers had been delivered a little earlier_than 0 . 00pm birthday almost over by then .
F	bear in mind that this comes at a premium and the large delivery costs make this an expensive option and therefore a last_resort only .
F	i said 00 times that i am not interested , but still trying tom push !
F	they are not serious and are out to rip people off .
F	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them to anyone .
F	lilian
F	well , maybe there is a reason_why my order wasn_'_t being delivered on the date that i wanted but then i was really disappointed .
M	never got my full payment that i was offered diddled me out of £_00 when i sent a 0 month old_iphone_0s .
M	have to say fast and efficient service with top_marks for customer service .

F	despite all of the above : great food , lovely staff , and although i don_'_t think a free drink was sufficient recompense , we needed it !
M	so , i '_ve had not one but two issues this morning with dpd .
F	even on our visit to the solicitor peter bartlett ( a charming man ) we felt comfortable .
F	i have always had a good comment to say about mazuma but i have had a little problem recently . i did sell my phone and i got a price for it and i got a good price considering the phone was in a non - working order . i requested to have this money put in my account but still , i have not had this money put into my account !
M	very pleased with the speed of delivery and the goods received were just as expected .

F	i had called one of the nos about 0_days before , and he had told me to call him about 00_mins before i get to the airport and they will pick_up the car .

F	bought a tv , delivery was quick , cheap and well_packaged but the tv wasn_'_t working :-(

M	my order was dealt_with effectively & efficiently .
F	i received a text_message_saying my flowers had been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property .
F	he did not understand enough so we left there really disappointed as there was no discussion from anyone about because of the delay we will give you the next level car instead as customer service .
M	all i wanted to know was do i leave a deposit with the budget desk at the airport and if so how much ?
M	this turned_out to be extremely problematic , not least because any opportunity for feedback ( the only thing you can do to warn_others of a mover '_s poor service ) was taken out of my hands .
M	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
F	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
M	the only slightly negative_aspect of the computer is that the case of my desktop_computer , although adequate , is not as robust as others i have had in the past .
M	great service .
F	it is also appreciated receiving emails to say order received , & order despatched .
F	i suppose with optimax being the cheapest i wouldn_'_t expect them to lay_out the red_carpet .
F	i received the packages promptly .
F	what a great and easy way to make a personal gift .
M	all of a sudden my cooker was in stock and delivered the following_monday ( yesterday )

F	excellent next_day delivery and i was kept_informed by text as to what time i could expect it .
F	best price .
M	this episode has caused all_sorts of problems and still we do notknow why was saying how good ao was but now will not be recommending to anyone very dissatisfied .

M	oh - i forgot to mention that each time i tried to make a booking the price kept creeping_up , so i ended_up paying around £_00 more for the week .
M	the saving_grace was the staff_member when i dropped_off the vehicle .
M	on receiving it the guitar was perfect and i '_m very happy with it .

F	was very pleased with the service provided by mazuma_mobile .
F	the cards i ordered arrived very quickly which is great , they are on good quality card and colours on the photos are good .
F	avoid at all costs !
M	they provided the refund of £_000 which never showed up in my bank_account for next 00 days .
M	they know us and stuff turns_up ok . pixmania are conservative in their delivery promises and usually beat their date .
F	the other 0 orders worth £_00 have never arrived .
F	you have to keep an eye on the site for updates to your claim , e_- mail reminders were inconsistent and timed ( in my mind ) to gloat and wind me up .
M	great prices and location for fittings but lot of unneccessary waiting around for the tyres to be fitted
M	it cost me £ 0 . 00 plus_vat to send a 0kg parcel to a friend in northampton .
F	i have already_recommended to a coelic friend .
M	absolutely_hopeless .
F	the only real disappointment was the way they were packed up for delivery .
M	waited over two_weeks for order , always misformed about order , paied for saturday service however guy worked there forgot to add label .
M	other than that mum delighted with flowers which were up to usual high_quality .
F	no communication at all , not even an_email to tell me when to expect delivery or when item had been dispatched .
F	i '_ve_used lenstore for a while now and have always found the ser ice to be excellent .
F	it was meant to be a christmas gift .
F	basically if i hadn_'_t called my nan to go check out side , they would have been gone by morning .
F	the place was busy , but tyre was replaced , only_complaint was that they didnt put the spare back into to the boot neatly , but service was fine .
F	they are a joy to shop with .
M	brilliant company to deal with
F	overall very nice chocolates but due to size , once shared within the family , not enough left for the person_who recieved them to enjoy .
M	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it '_s too late to make alternative_arrangements .
F	i ordered some flowers to be sent to my mum for her_birthday earlier this week - i was happy with my purchase and looked forward to hearing how nice they were on her_birthday .
F	a week_later i ring again , just a while ago .
F	i will never shop there again .
F	this is what quidco service is about .
M	for example , you simply cannot climb up a steep_hill on the 0st gear if tachometer goes lower that 0000_rpm -- forget about the 0nd , burn the clutch !
F	exceptional , and i will certainly use again in the future and recommend .
F	anyone want to buy two buzzers ?
F	we have horrible_experience with the customer service .
F	i went_onto this website over others and ordering and registering my dog '_s prescription was easier and better_than other_websites .
F	great website , speedy service , good communication about delivery .
M	never received the order and paid for next_day delivery .
M	what arrived , although not as good as a prime worktop , was considerably better_than_expected .
F	miss leading would not use again .
F	today i have received a mobile phone answer phone message to say that the van that was delivering my items broke_down on friday another excuse !
M	ordered on one day , dispatched the next_day and received the following_day !
M	luckily so_far no one has picked them up before i have got to them .
M	!
F	.
F	no reply but parcel arrived following_day .
M	it was clearly_laid_out with video reviews of the rucksacks which made my buying decision much_easier .
F	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
M	the delivery was next_day before 0am .
M	always a pleasure to deal with .
M	it was so quick and easy to use the online service .
M	!
F	after just 0 years and it being on a slod base with a waterproof membrane on the floor bearers the floor is rotten and the rot speading up the shed .
F	0stclass service from_start to finish
M	i do not mind the delay . as long as i am told that there will be one .
F	keys arrived within 0_days of ordering .
F	i accept that .
M	the arm support for tennis_elbow sufferers , is well made and a real help .
M	the replaced item was received within 0 days of return .
F	i called customer_services to be told it had been delivered to the store a week_ago - day after i ordered !!!
F	beware , it '_s easy to get good reviews when things go right ( and they are quick to send ).
F	i have always used booking . com without problems and this was my first experience with hotel_direct .
M	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
M	i have spoke to other shops on the high_street at 00 bute street & also 0 station rd radyr cardiff a returns address they use and not one person has heard of so special .
M	returns associated with invoice #_00000000 rma_number :_00000000 accepted
F	got what i wanted at the best price with free delivery within 00_hours !
F	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
M	quick delivery
M	the company does what it says it does .
M	great prices , too .
M	i ordered 0 pairs and received 0 additional boxes .
M	the lenses were neither tightly nor robustly fit into the frame .
F	i ordered the omni sports_massage roller which has_been a really useful product as a sports_massage_therapist to add that bit of extra pressure when your feeling tired .
F	i was very pleased with the speed of my order process and delivery .
M	with good cutomer service they could have turned the situation to their advantage , resolved the issues quickly and they would still have me as a customer .
F	i managed to get meet and greet on looking0parking cheaper_than the 0 mile_away long_term shuttle_bus parking .
F	i had checked the tracking so , i emailed again 0 - 0 - 00 to say please can you investigate missing parcel as it hasn_'_t left sorting_office , when checking website the delivery of the 0rd beanbag had been changed to 00 - 00 - 00 , this date had passed and was different to that originally stated on the order tracking website and different to that stated on answerphone_message .
F	the ordered items looked a very good quality and really interesting and different ( saved for later so cannot_comment fully ) but the packaging was inadequate causing squashing and tearing of packed boxes .
F	!
M	it '_s costing us £_000 but worth it to have a working dishwasher repaired at a convenient time for us .
M	and best of all , my wife is absolutely_thrilled .
M	site was easy to navigate .
F	very pleased .
M	a fast and efficient service , quality products and fantastic value .
F	adding on delivery time meant that i would not receive the goods until march .
F	nothing seemed a problem when we kept changing our_minds , extra days wanting to be spent in certain cities , upgrades for accommodation , even change of dates for when we could go were all handled so well !
M	i was now furious .
M	highly_recommend them and would definitely use again in the future .
F	at the eleventh_hour i needed a costume very urgently .
F	would deffinetly recommend .
F	revision 00 / 00 /_0000
F	would use again though .
F	highly_recommended !
M	overall , i could not be_happier with the service and the product .
M	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
F	he arrived just after one .
M	however with time i am finding it to become more and more intrusive .
M	very organised bunch .
M	tank_sealer arrived and was as_described , por strip was out of stock firstly so i delayed ordering , when i next went to order it was out of stock again , i emailed twice but as yet have not heard , i was offered free delivery but if there is no item to deliver they cannot fulfil , unimpressed .
F	have you used westwoods_footwear on line site .?
M	i have two printers but as i write quite a few letters weekly i write them on my computer so i can save them and i then print them , i use my old printer as i do not need the colour_cartridge for this , as a pensioner budget is obviously a issue and i have had a couple of cartridges although they are the compatible type dont last more than a few documents . this is especially if i use the colour ones , the cartridges are t000 & t000 and are budget priced , obviously this is pointless if they only last for a few documents .
F	everyone who was an o0 customer is now jumping on our bandwagon , now that they want an iphone .
F	i emailed them with a question and they got back to me straight_away !
F	i booked tickets back in september_0000 for pink in dublin on 00th_april_0000 .
M	by the time the codes arrived ( many days_later ) most of the sizes of the item we had bought the vouchers for had gone !
M	?
F	good site and good products but bad customer service !
M	very annoyed and frustrated
M	fast response very good service worn to school for red nose day everyone loved the costume many_thanks lizzie
M	they are like all the other payday_loans . say yove been accepted but when you apply its no . ive only got 0 default payment as well which may i add im paying off
F	we ' re different_colours and quite a lot of greenery which was a bit_disappointing .
F	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
F	couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	the level of customer service was actually good , despite the problem initially , and i ' d not_hesitate to use them again , as the value for money was good too .
F	and delivery was much_faster_than they said so i was really pleased
M	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
M	one long orbit of the car_park later , i eventually found my way out .
F	mattress arrived on the day i specified , in good condition and as_described .
M	excellent web_site - good information and choice
F	sent for two haligen heaters th ey came both were broken sent them back got a new set one was broken one good sent broken one back waiting to see what wi ll happen know we are oap and really need them soon
F	when i got home at 0 . 00pm , there was a ups card through my door telling_me the courier tried to collect at 00 . 00 !
F	they responded to each email_saying they had not received my prescription through the post until thursday ( 0st_class mail ???)
F	hassle_free purchase .
F	using the website and finding out how much my phone was worth went well , and the bag to send my phone back in was posted to me quickly .
F	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .
F	ordered some flowers and a gift from serenata_flowers , delivered hassle_free next_day .
M	i phoned straight_away and was promised an e_mail that night with the recipes and how my chicken would either be sent or compensated .
M	i ordered these ray_ban glasses from fashion_eyewear , easy to use website service and cheaper_than stores on the high_street .
F	not made clear that i was buying a smaller_size , which makes the price very expensive for the oraldene .
M	this is when comms slowed_down and it would take_upto 0 days for a reply , as the pc was out of stock i opted for a refund which took 00 days after chasing up .
M	nobodies fault
M	i have paid two years in advance , and have never managed to get a refund !
F	will definitely use indigo_herbs again !
M	i made my purchase on line and found the web_site simple to navigate .
M	to everyone
M	usual great service , would recommend to anyone
F	the bottle of sherry survived without damage .
M	i was very annoyed i booked my trip for half past 0 in the early hours of the morning my mistake and upon_arrival to check in at 0 - 00 afternoon time i was very distressed to learn i ' d make the silly_mistake and though surely i ' d just pay a small adjustment fee like we always used to with sea_france , but i was made to pay full price that cost morethan my whole return ticket , no effort was made to help or accommodate me even as a regular_user from this i would be reluctant to use again even_tho they are alot_cheaper i do not feel as a customer i was helped or looked after .
M	ok we thought , we '_ll get a refund .
M	would recommend to anyone
F	to get the package .
F	just to receive multiple emails which simy said ' we have responded to your ticket ' and to go to an enclosed link .
M	a fantastic company
F	post_office said not usual delivery man .
M	guess_what no collection after being confirmed with a team_leader and a 0 hour phone_call on a premium number .
F	if enough of us write to watch dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it '_s affiliate companies .
M	have a huge_range of products really swift delivery brilliant
F	items were shown as " in stock " when order placed .
F	one short phone_call was all it took to sort_out the situation in my favour and the product i had originally ordered arrived the following_day .
M	a couple of changes and i placed the order .
F	arrived extremely quick with no_problems
M	even after 00 days and numerous journeys across the island it is difficult to use 0 / 0 a tank as the cars are so effiicient !
M	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless_router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
M	the parts order was quickly processed and delivered next_day , website is easy to use and prices competitiive
F	i was very impressed with the website !
F	i was shocked when i took a parcel to the post_office and was told how much it would cost so i decided to try out hermes , i was very pleasantly_surprised to find it was half the price and i could track it '_s progress on line .
F	also no way to contact customer_services to has extra envelopes sent out which is not great if you have any_issues .
M	i understand_why it is there but when it is applied to a harmless product like isogel , it is very irritating .
F	eventually i emailed them to which i got a reply and they assured me thay the flowers would be delivered before 0 :_00pm sadly no delivery was made :-(.
F	reasonably_priced too .
M	i saved over £_000 . 00 by buying second - hand , and the wheel is in very good condition .
F	they have every kind of paper imaginable and they are fairly_priced .
F	partmasters website is really easy to use and explained how to make_sure you have the correct_part before ordering .
F	they really are terrible .
F	i have been using animed frequently for more than a year and i never have any cause for complaint .
M	well , if i could reduce the rating to ' zero_stars ' i would !
M	not the chepest
F	delivery info prompt
F	they keep_fobbing_me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
F	a good idea .
M	i contacted amazon and asked for a complete refund and told them that i will no_longer buy from them while they continue to use yodel as a courier !
M	quick delivery , good price and quality .
M	kept up to date with order at all times and order arrived quickly .
F	only been trying for a week , and the food been lovely really tasty but the portions
F	yes i would shop_here again .
M	good suitable packaging .
M	now before i have ordered saws , blades , knives and probably other " dangerous " items so when was this nonsense introduced .
F	nice oner manor_pharmacy , will use you again
M	ordered some swim trunks .
F	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
F	i would also like to suggest another warning that indicates using a photo on the cover of the book alters the clarity of the photo and also the colours in the photo , as i am very disappointed by the cover of ours .
F	i sent my phone to sell took them nearly 0_weeks for them to get in touch with
F	i will not recommend you to anyone - in fact quite the opposite would advise people to stay well clear .
F	delivery of pc & old drive on wednesday 0th was assured .
M	an_absolute_pleasure to use this service , the goods got picked_up and delivered no problem atall on time like agreed
F	i cannot_believe a company as big as this would swindle a customer
M	but delivery excellent ( arrived even before the money cleared from my account !
M	' availability ' email btw means no stock - and i believe they knew it when the order was taken on the website .
M	although the website indicated that my chosen tyres would be available the next_day , i chose the day after .
M	!
F	it also feels_like a more ecologically responsible way to get_rid of a mobile than throwing it in the bin .
M	i did and i saved .
M	day before delivery carpet fitter ( monday ) rebooked fitting for thursday no one turned_up . yet again !!!
F	0_star x
M	!
F	i am so glad i found woodyatt_curtains they make it so easy to order and the service is fantastic .
M	i had a great experience on the website and found it really easy to use .
M	well recommended !
M	you can '_t do_business like this .
M	placed an order with toolstation earlier . screws , brush cleaner and white_spirit .
M	the smokerelief flavours however are pleasant .
F	i will be buying from made to measure_blinds again and will be recommending to friends .
F	so having taken a day off work no one came .
F	a detailed quote could come later once i outlined exact_requirements e . g .
F	i will definitely be ordering other sizes to complete a full set of the casserole_dishes and now that i have been introduced to pro - cook , i want to recommend them to you as my friend did for me .
M	), i really see no reason to be paying for high_street_opticians ' crazy prices .
M	thought i paid full cost when i pre_- booked , paid £_000 for 0 days when i pre booked but then got hit for an unexpected additional_charge of 00_euros for winter_tyres when i collected car at the airport !
F	my wife as pregnant at the time , so we wanted somewhere close to amenities and her portuguese school in ipanema .
F	this is ridiculous and the lack of customer service is appalling .
F	wanted a refund on xmas_present as didn_'_t fit .
F	excellent idea .
M	now , i am left less_than a month later with damaged belongings and an outright refusal from the mover to pay for the repair .
M	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
F	i have purchased a few items from this site , usually takes nearly a week to receive the items , also when you receive an item that they sent in error they ask you to pay postage to return it and will not send you the correct item until they get the wrong item back .
M	nice seller will buy again
M	i would have no_hesitation .
F	i can '_t fault it .
F	!
F	in general service is prompt , and they provide good value for money .
M	ordered a variety of products from this company - very impressed with the quality of the products & excellent prices , not only will i return to buy these again but i will order other things from them as they have a wide_range of healthy_foods on there website
F	will definitely use them again .
F	if you can wait a month for your order , don_'_t care about customer service and can_afford it , then it '_s worth it .
M	disappointed i couldnt use my recent homebase vouchers that had been sent to me in the post .
M	as a consequence not worth the money .
M	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
M	i ordered a bed for my 00 year_old father in law who was in hospital ( we had to get_rid of his previous bed for reason i will not go into ) i chose this company simply for the next_day delivery as we were not sure how quickly he would be discharged from hospital .
M	i would not have ordered if they had been accurately_described .
F	. a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
F	good value for money
F	i had ordered this and it came within 0 week .
M	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
F	they came in a secure box and had a free return_label to use so i could return them along with a handy little brochure of the services available .
M	the line of communication with the emails keeps you upto_date with what stage of the process you are which is great .
F	!
F	the prices are really good and the service is second to none .
M	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
F	i wouldnt touch this company again .
M	service fine , but instruction what to do with key not found by me !
F	helpful , friendly staff and quick delivery .
M	the only problem is that you cannot try before you buy .
M	having paid one month in advance and being on a one month deal i don_'_t owe them anything .
M	craig .
M	will never use these or any axa company again .
F	i did find them expensive as i am a student and its hard to keep adding to my kit at such a cost .
F	i ordered my rug after_speaking to a nice sales lady from the rug_house , i was not sure what the quality of the rug would be like as the price was cheap in comparrison to other_sites .
F	ordered from another co yesterday recd at nine this am with numerous updates .
M	i have used these_guys a few_times now .
F	i like myshu as have a good choice of boots & it '_s good to support local_shops - but you need to pay for your_own returns & they don_'_t supply returns postage_labels , so it makes it a bit faffy & expensive to return goods .
F	i have to wait for technician to come but they can only give me a 0 hour time_slot .
F	although i had not asked for a time of arrival i did expect the flowers to arrive before their 0pm arrival i had asked for deluxe and paid the extra but when they arrived they seemd average size .
F	blev enig med kundeservice om , at den sidste radiator blev annulleret , og at jeg_ville modtage en bekræftelse på_det .
M	i placed the order several weeks before the date .
M	very good company with good service
M	my garage is now much tidier and i can actually get down the middle now !
F	would certainly reccommend .
F	i did eventually book a holiday .
M	i can '_t comment on ' returns ' because i '_ve never received any more than one order in 0 / 0 .
F	so not only am i out of £_00 . 00 paid for the motor , but they also took over_£_00 . 00 from the refund that they did process .
F	my recipient was thrilled with the speed too and i have used them ever_since .
F	excellent - great products and superfast delivery - highly_recommend
F	:)
F	if i were a company i would never use them .
F	easy to use love getting things from them
F	good job my neighbour took it in for me .
M	brought some lemon kush and afghan seeds , says on the packet that they are 00_% feminized but all i got were males !!
F	however , they do not ' glow ' as much as i thought they would , and the remote_control didn_'_t work .
M	all in all an excellent service and will_definitely be using again .
F	i telephoned again and thankfully dealt_with a much more reasonable person_who was polite , apologetic and placed a replacement order for me .
M	hi , i was really pleased to find your site , and you offer a great variety of low - cost trophies which were perfect for the informal awards_ceremony for my football_club .
F	although initial inconvenience , the problem was resolved quickly with limited fuss .
F	however , when my daughter told me that if i got an iphone , i can get my emails , i asked orange for my upgrade to be an iphone .
F	i don_'_t know how this company is still in business .
M	will use again
M	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
F	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
M	fast and efficient .
M	not only was paulo , and dolphin , excellent in pointing me in the direction of the kit i needed , but also very responsive when my timescales changed .
M	i ordered 0 items from offtek .
F	product is super too and half the price from vet for 0 times as many tablets .
F	my husband ordered an item from this company , via_amazon .
M	i have bought an identical item at £_00 . 00 at different times about a fortnight apart & charged £ 0 . 00 carriage firstly & £ 0 . 00 on the second occasion .
F	one of the cabinets , well it just does not look like wood !
F	dear_sir / madam
M	!
F	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh . not impressed .
F	update_:
F	i would recommend travel_nation
M	it '_s naff .
F	0 . 00pm the following_day and told that they could not deliver , they couldn_'_t find a local_florist who had the type of flowers i had ordered !
M	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?.
F	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
F	but glad i did in the end .
M	i went for the free delivery option , so i was not expecting it all that quickly , however it arrived in good time and very well_packaged .
F	in the past my experience with this company has_been positive .
M	quite good but some metchants do not confirm cashback and is still pending even after cashback date has long passed
M	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening_speed .
M	it is easy to use and payment using credit and / or debit_card is safe .
F	i '_ve_used ebay for several_years .
M	this is the second time i '_ve_used ffx and it certainly wont be the last , would recommend without_fail .
M	when i checked back on the upgrades page the offer had been removed and was showing as £_00 per_month but still with a free hanset .
F	my husband spent the next 0_days trying to actually speak to anyone from that company .
M	000000000 ) in may this year , i called there sales_team to confirm when the product would be delivered as i had read a lot of bad comments re meeting their commitments .
M	i scan the web for some specific timberland shoes and came_across rubbersole and saw what i wanted and bought them .
F	their stores are good but the internet ordering is rubbish , dont expect any follow_up customer service because once they have your money they couldn_'_t give a hoot .
M	" we understand that is not your fault however please_note that this was a system error and the emails used were free of charge instead of paying for them .
F	so he had to go in and sort this out in person .
F	great service , cheap prices , very fast delivery with great communication via emails to let_me know the processing .
M	oh i never recived any confirmation_email as others have written in their reviews .
F	have not delivered my item after 00 days .
F	cannot_rate them high enough
M	thanks in advance
M	nonetheless i went_ahead with the booking and the ticket got us in ok . on the negative side , if you buy a ticket at the gallery itself , it '_s then valid for future entry over the coming year ; this is not the case with tickets bought online .
F	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0_months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
M	i was initially very pleased with the option that very provides for an interest free for 0month period - take 0 - however since my purchase it has sadly been downhill and for this reason i will not purchase from yourselves again !
F	( i had opted to receive payment by argos_voucher for which i got a little added_bonus !).
M	use a uk_based company with a phone number if you don_'_t want to get_stung or deal with a ticketing_system that is understaffed and incompetent .
M	you get a photo of your order sent to you just before they dispatch it as well .
F	the whole_thing took about five days - including the exchange .
M	couple all this with their rubbish traffic management ( 00_% speed reduction on uploads !!)
M	more of the same please .
M	we found the picks we needed , ordered them . and had them in our hands the next_day .
F	he asked was if i available all day when he returned to the store he would get it dealt_with and would return with the said items .
M	i have ordered regularly from serenata and the service is usually good however on this occasion despite me putting instructions on the order that if no one home to be delivered to a neighbour .
M	ordered some perfume just over two_weeks_ago and am still_waiting .
M	i then used a different phone and the call was answered .
F	now , that was really confusing .
F	quick and fast delivery too , they were here in no time
F	viovet notified 0 times on friday needed food before weekend .
M	emails contradictory . original camera defective and eventually returned .
F	very good experience i '_ve had .
M	almost gave up but persevered .
M	first_class service from a first_class company
F	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
M	i would rather spend my hard working money on a company that values it '_s customers all the way through , not to get an order and then not give a toss .
M	another big_mistake !!
F	the pricing was very competitive and the delivery was within a couple of days .
M	suitcase full of pressys , £_00 .
F	he was aggressive in a passive way refusing to answer any of my questions and not even looking at me .
M	contacted bedeck and was given an returns code to send the items to ireland .
F	one particular object i could not order on line as the information number was not accepted .
M	ordered a number of things from made . com for my new home .
F	i didn_'_t want to pay too much - they were £_000 cheaper_than elsewhere .
F	i now recommend simplysupplements to all my friends !
M	i had to call the office as my internet was playing up .
M	once ordered though , it arrived quickly and the finished product is excellent .
M	the best amount is on insurance ( e . g .
M	so , overall i '_ve been reasonably satisfied with my initial batch '_s flavour , but i '_ll need to live with them a while longer before_deciding to buy again .
M	poor service , poor delivery , poor customer service , poor quality , poor aftersales care !
M	broken_promises galore !
M	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking_down and having tried to contact us .
M	always trying new companys gives you a worry but i can say my experience with pf_jones has_been good . there own product looked good fitted easily , there insructions were clear to follow .
F	i use the colour a lot as i make cards for all occasions and print pictures , verses etc off the internet , usually on photo card , so it is important that the ink is really good .
F	in spain the hotel sorra daurada gave_us a room with no disabled facilities but they changed us to a room with a shower only when i compl
M	besides the ( unavoidable ) time it takes , it really was hassle_free and allowed_me to try on quite a few pairs before_deciding .
F	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
M	still_waiting for refund and now they have just dispatched the same order again .
M	my only issue was that i paid £_00 too much for the makita_impact_driver .
M	when i went to school we were educated in the international system of units ( abbreviated si from french : système international d ' unités ) which is the modern form of the metric system which measures in mm and not cm .
F	have spent three hours on phone now and still not getting a refund .
M	kind_regards autoeyeuk team
F	i was looking for a product that boots wasn_'_t stocking anymore - found it here and received it next_day .
M	if there was another auction company on the web , i would use it , ebay is too expensive to sell stuff on , they get money from every way , even when a seller uses their other company paypal
M	waste of time and effort .
F	!
F	i tried to speak with cpw customer support so they could explain this report to me .
F	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
F	the delivery man rang my doorbell and then gave a knock on the door .
F	i ordered m fireproof / waterproof box on the basis of next_day delivery and paid the fee accordingly .
M	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
M	highly_recommended and british made to boot .
M	the delivery company delivered them to a completely_different address , not even on the road where i live .
F	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
M	the website said it was in stock and would be despatched within 00_hours .
F	i ordered a hall_carpet_runner with underlay received both within three_days , and i am very pleased with the carpet , as you could choose the length you required and it was a reasonable_price love the colour too .
F	received an_email monday_morning saying my order had been dispatched ( how when they had cancelled it ?!)
F	cant find a number to call them .
F	i had purposely worked from home on the day i was suppose to get it to ensure i did get it .
M	not surprisingly the 0 - 00 day bank_account never_materialised either .
M	they basically look like they have been printed on a home printer .
M	?
F	unfortunately it rained very heavily & all the contents of the box fell out as the cardboard was absolutely soaked !
M	however i like the sound of this company from their early beginings and hope they don_'_t ever forget what made them today .
F	its light_weight and hassle_free as it is cordless .
F	was not sure i was doing the right thing , prices seemed to good to be true , hey_ho in for a penny .
F	i wouldn_'_t advise against using , just don_'_t rely_on their customer service .
M	please save your hard_earned_money by not going to kwik_fit !
F	excellent easy website and delivery of product was perfect and on time
M	flight availability changed mid booking .
M	problems with my previous_supplier .
M	highly_recommended .
M	regards
M	i checked numerous of tyre_fitter and none came close to the price of black_circles .
M	parcel_force lied and said they had tried to deliver but someone is always home and they did not .
M	good thank_you !
M	always use these_guys . just fantastic
F	having to warn my friend they were coming , spoilt it a bit .
F	booked with blue_chip holidays for our last_minute summer_holiday break .
F	good choice of suites but be prepared to pay more than what '_s on the price_tag .
F	order received promptly and was left in secure_place as requested when placed order .
M	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
M	only today i mentioned that herz payed me 000_% of the caution on my account .
F	!
F	good evening ,
M	that skrill could check .
F	excellent customer service , great quality products and fast delivery ( even to new_zealand ).
M	i ’ ve bought a few things from prends ciclismo now and never had a problem .
M	very personal and courteous on the phone when i was enquiring_about my footjoy myjoys , i was able to order and receive my shoes in very quick time .
M	( first use )
F	after_placing order then a day lateran e_mail telling_me it '_s been dispatched and is with royal_mail , it took another 0_days to arrive !
F	i then had to email them to check they '_d received it , which they had .
F	hahah .
M	despite ' in stock ', on the website , there was a delay of a week in despatch but this was not too upsetting .
M	notified of a wednesday delivery the previous night .
F	ordered various minitures for party bags for my 00th_birthday and they are great .
F	i '_m pleased that there is an_independent shop catering for a fairly specialist market so close to me and will probably use it again - just need a little_bit more info on the website
F	i called a local_garage about this and they advised that this was over - priced and it would not have needed the oil change based against the mileage the car done .
M	then i experienced nothing but a nightmare .
M	i hold out little hope of receiving my money back from these_people , they are too evasive and slippery .
F	consequently this meant that i had to rearrange delivery for the next_day and wait in again .
M	animals being sent to slaughter are treated better .
M	very frustrated and i '_m seriously thinking_about taking_legal_action .
M	nice packaging but not so sure about dpd delivery service
F	the 0 delivery men were cheerful & friendly . perhaps they could have offered to remove shoes before coming into the house but this is a minor ' tweak '!
M	i wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone .
F	i have no idea .
F	i excepted this , as white will be easier to wash i suppose , but not what i was expecting from the picture online !
F	it '_s impossible to redeem wowcher despite_emailing wowcher for help .
M	it '_s out of stock and they were pretty unhelpful about suggesting alternatives , blaming restocking policies from the italian supplier .
F	we have always had good service from nitrotek until we sent our rc car on 0 .
M	after christmas my opinions were expressed , we were advised the cover would be delivered asap , the next story was it went to the wrong_address , verbal apologies mean nothing in business , as far as i '_m concerned .
F	the delivery service ups were not given the correct details to be able to deliver the parcel successfully , so - as a result , our goods took over a week to arrive - disappointing .
F	but we both felt it very "' hard_sell " on the insurance .
F	everybody should pursue this route .
M	apparently there '_s a secret upgrade to the app that allows this railcard .
F	prompt delivery of a faulty product which was replaced within days .
F	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about £ 0 with an estimated delivery date about a week_later .
M	however , this time , because of a ' change to their computer system ' the guy at the nottingham office typed in all our details and said ' computer says no '!
F	will be back !
F	!
M	very pleased with the service and price of my new bosch shreader , will use them again
M	this as affected my decoration that will have to be done again . kitchen window left hand top hinge faulty ( gap of 0 . 0mm towards the top ).
F	we were really pleased with the service and advice given and the kitchen looks_fab . aside from some of the doors / panels were damaged and it has taken over 0_months of new panels being ordered and sent back before we have got a full undamaged kitchen .
M	also if you look at the dates on trust_pilot the reviews they are all in groups by date so there '_s been quite a lot recently but then none for the previous year then loads so my only conclusion from that is that they wrote some of them at_least themselves obviously only the good ones .
F	ordered on the monday so assumed i would receive my goods by friday / saturday but my order wasn_'_t actually processed until the thursday .
F	cab be poor compared to other nerworks
F	sorry if i sound like i am moaning .
M	i reported this via their online foms , where it is possible to attach an image to show any damage .
F	i was pleased to order my offroad lite sandals before they were available locally but the toe strap nubuck leather had some small dirty marks on both shoes .
M	the first i knew that the item was being imported from_hong_kong by me was when the couriers demanded i pay over £_00 to obtain delivery .
M	- delivered quickly ( in a couple of days ) and appear and feel to be excellent quality .
M	having contacted them , they offered a further discount and apologised for the state in which it was sent out .
F	it also states " try going outside the store to check - in " - make up your mind please !
F	returned as per their instructions - april_0000 and no word from them since .
M	prices are great - definitely 0_stars .
F	i discovered , when the plumber was fitting it that the mesh grid was the wrong shape , and i again received helpful treatment from amanda , who gave_me the astrocast telephone_number but she also told me that if i didn_'_t get anywhere with them to come_back to her .
M	i then tried to call the customer_services number supplied on the base of the paperwork , only to find out they no_longer accept calls .
F	really impressed tickets came quickly & by registered_post
M	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
F	not all of us are good on the internet .
F	got to say i am usually rubbish at leaving reviews for products but i thought i would this time .
F	i '_m delighted with how easy it is to put up and the amount of washing it holds .
F	a very comfortable stay , friendly and helpful staff , fantastic room , good price , what more could you want !
F	thank_you perfect flowers made hr day
M	the jacket was with me within 0 days and is all i hoped it would be .
F	ordered my product late_afternoon and it arrived following_day .
M	when the car reaches the gate and the courier gets out to key in an exit code she_sees the packages jammed in the door and pulls one out without opening the door , you can see the package rip open , she looks at the contents and slings the damaged item over onto the passenger_seat , she then opens the back door and about ten items fall out onto the soaking road .
M	ordered online , received the pack within a couple of days .
F	it seems that then i have to call you with some code number he has given me to request my money back !
F	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
M	quidco works really well and gives me money back on purchases i would have made anyway .
F	i was supposed to get part of it by end of november but was told it had been delayed and would be january .
F	including the same photos i went_ahead with the books but was not happy with the first printing .
M	i ordered two t - shirts in june , and after one month i wrote and asked when they would arrive .
M	this has come and gone , and when i spoke to the agent on the phone , they said they were having trouble processing refunds , and couldn_'_t say when it would be , although it was now ' expedited ' which is meaningless .
M	initial high_standard somewhat wilted with latest experience .
F	i was really grateful that my order came on the same day as i wanted it to be delivered .
M	now after a week the flowers are still on display in our lounge , apart_from the roses that died off within four days .
M	easy to use and delivered on time !
F	a sign says to ring a bell and someone will come .
F	the only problem came when i received the email_notifying dispatch ; the link to track my parcel didn_'_t work and the order number wasn_'_t recognized so i had no idea when it was going to show up .
M	ordered £_000 worth of stuff , just to have it left_outside my house by the cowboys from ' yodel '.
F	asked neighbours to know avail ????
F	the postage_charges were extremely reasonable .
M	companies with that kind of money_grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
M	i got home from work on the 00th_april to find a card on the door_mat stating that an attempt at delivery had been made .
F	it was well_packaged and is now hanging on the wall .
F	last_year was exactly the same i should have learnt from last time but i ordered some items i was told i would receive 0 working_days_later , its been 00 working_days and i still_haven_'_t received an_email_confirming a dispatch of my order , i contacted elc who couldn_'_t tell me why they hadn_'_t been dispatched even_tho they are in their warehouse , couldn_'_t tell me when they will be dispatched , and that i will have to wait a further 0 working_days when they are eventually dispatched , so frustrating .
F	i find the site quite fair , the higher bets are the better pay out . the site has a free daily game . starspins is one of the better site for fairness ,.
F	a saving is not a saving unless you receive goods , so buy from reputable_companies - not this one !
F	many_thanks once again !
F	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
M	no alternative delivery times were offered - just a voucher for my next shop , which seemed a bit of a joke given all i wanted was my shopping to arrive on time and without_any fuss .
M	turned_up to get tyre fitted but was left waiting in the reception as the lone assistant answered phone_call after phone_call giving priority to incoming_calls rather_than dealing_with a customer physically on the premises .
F	the porch has a door without a lock which hides it away from passers_by .
M	it was then an offer was made to sell at a shop - soiled price .
M	a quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff , which probably explains the lack of flavour .
F	i '_ve recommended the wrist_bands to friends so i suspect kiddymania will get further orders from us !
F	next_day delivery , had to return an item because of none fit , and received excellent customer service .
F	would use again , its just a shame about this particular order .
M	did some_research and found these_guys to be the cheapest , i also read a load of reviews and they all said good things .
M	challengeing and rewarding for the children to build and get an insight_into how clocks work .
F	impressive in my standards .
M	we have looked into your issue on a priority basis and currently there has_been some delays with the refunds .
M	felt_confident i had the right bits at a good price .
F	a company like yours who_knows what good customer service is , deserves to do well .
F	world_stores need to employ more people like her .
F	the item duly_arrived & our old fridge_/_freezer was uplifted .
M	i live in liverpool and to fix a puncture it costs between £_00_-£_00 .
F	i tried them in my daughter '_s older nespresso_machine , but they didn_'_t work in that either .
F	see above .
F	communication_throughout the process brilliant .
M	the web_site is easy to use and gives an accurate picture of what you can expect .
M	very happy !
M	excellent value and service .
M	the package arrived three minutes after the first time !
F	first order delivered on time and correct_address
M	i just punched in the dimensions and weights on the website and printed out the labels .
M	their bacon and ham are the best we have tasted in recent years .
M	stock range is enormous , think of a battery and they have it .
M	ordering via their web_site is very easy and safe and delivery has always been extrememly fast , really reliable company .
F	needless to say this is what i have done .
M	there was no interior padding so the contents bounced_around and eventually split the box .
F	the value doors chap made a mistake and we didn_'_t pick it up / weren_'_t given a second chance to pick it up as he failed to email the final agreement .
M	seats were booked and paid for online .
M	excellent friendly service called to tell me exact time of arrival would recommend
F	very quick turn_around and sercice
M	i still_haven_'_t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
M	there appears to be a very low entry_level , with no insurance required for example . the owners need to be aware of this as a race to the bottom will drive out many of the competent operators and will lead to poor service and disputes with clients .
M	flower where old and at the bottom of parcel also all different_sizes valentines_day bear said baby_girl on it , me and my partner are not expecting a little_girl !!!!
M	this anchor pump i bought was to replace an old anchor pump which didn_'_t owe me anything .
F	but most of all , the jackets are the softest leather i have ever felt . and so comfortable and stylish .
F	i had to actually phone them and asked where my order was , only to be told the product was now discontinued .
M	more details of the response from jason to follow .
M	the web_site is very simple to navigate .
F	my parcel was delivered to me at 00 : 00 .
M	a text to give even a 0_hr time_slot would be preferable to the way i have been treated today .
M	my sister liked the winter flowers which were delivered on the correct date but , because the florist omitted my greeting_card , she did not know who had sent them .
M	i would avoid this company if i were you !!
M	!
F	i didn_'_t have any_problems with the costume i purchased per_se , but the sizes were a bit off .
M	the glasses are great .
M	even with a very careful approach we were left with air - bubbles . they don_'_t look too bad ( and better_than the newspaper we had before ), so would recommend , but get a professional if you can .
M	now forgive me for sounding very slightly cross .
F	this happened twice in two different orders .
M	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
M	now , about the course i was enrolled - project_management professional ( pmp ).
F	i cannot_fault the service or the quality of the product .
F	very happy .
M	however the email stated a further update with delivery details would be recieved within 00_hours and this never happened , so had to make quite a few call to get this information .
F	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i '_ll need to go back online an re - order .
M	told i had accepted a vehicle upgrade , taken out extra iunsurance , vat had to be paid what seemed three_times over and final_insult was being charged £_00 for 0 digital bar missing from fuel_gauge which was exactly how i got the car after turning one corner leaving the airport .
M	they sent me a usb_memory_stick to do this .
F	i have been very impressed with their service and i am going to buy my lenses in the future from them .
M	much_cheaper to have your own goods in transit insurance .
F	acdctv were great .
F	j ' ai loué une voiture chez rental_car en aout 0000 pour pouvoir conduire en vacances a nice du 00 . 00 . 00 au 00 . 00 . 00 " aéroport de nide terminal 0 " chez advantage ".
F	they have too many competitors to worry_about using them again .
F	i will certainly buy online from dickies again
F	still have not received them 0weeks later yet told we ' re delivered .
F	i requested that i should be reimbursed with the difference , given that i could have returned the item and bought the cheaper one .
F	thank_you for the delivery of flowers to mr & mrs webster on saturday but to be honest i was a little disappointed with them .
F	and excellent prices , nearly_half the price that i would have paid at the vets , even taking into account the cost of the presciption .
M	excellent delivery , well_packaged .
F	different issues :
F	first time ordering flowers online and i was really nervous that
F	they are disputing everything so we just have to wait and see .
M	i ordered a calendar , some prints , and a small photobook , all at the same time because i thought i could reduce the postage_costs that way ( my mistake - although actually jessops ' mistake ).
F	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
M	the glasses were delivered very quickly however there are two slight_scratches on the frame .
M	tickets booked 0 months in advance - confirmed at time and 0_weeks prior to event .
F	i doubt very much whether they would have said the same had they spent their hard_earned_cash on a sub_standard product .
M	buying online , no problem , i order a couple of sizes then return the items that don_’_t fit , fantastic !
F	husband arrived home and fully unpacked base .
M	he took the pc for checking while i waited .
F	my items arrived quite quickly even_though i had opted for second class_post , and my items were safely_packed in a little box inside a jiffy_bag , there were no mistakes made with my order so i didn_'_t have the hassle of returning items and sorting the order out .
F	they emailed back within 00_hours and confirmed it was 0mm so we ordered the panel .
M	will_definitely use again , thanks !
F	definitely will use this company again
M	be very carefull about ordering furniture from laura_ashley .
F	it , i '_m on my 0rd week and my distance is not good really it '_s like
M	found item to be cheaper_than elsewhere on internet , quality branded goods , quick prompt delivery , what more could you ask
M	once you have my money you obviously don_'_t seem to be as arsed ( when i say you i mean the liverpool office ).
M	although the link has since been corrected , no refund has_been receive although i '_ve been querying this for months .
M	really impressed .
M	the money is refund quick enough so you can buy elsewhere if needed .
F	they quoted me £_00 and offered me £_00 !
M	paid for pre 0pm delivery but then i check my tracking_number to be told by yodel they could not deliver at 0 . 00pm to my gf place of work .
F	speedy delivery and on this occasion i had to return an item , it was simple and processed quickly .
F	the watch was bought 0_weeks ahead for an anniversary and discovered to be faulty 0_days before the anniversary when i tried to set and start it before wrapping .
M	many_thanks !
M	we continue to sell berlin confidently to hundreds of customers and have fantastic positive_feedback accounts from such events throughout the past years .
M	fast , efficient service
F	i can '_t praise this product highly_enough !
F	i am deeply unhappy and wish i '_d never purchased a sofa there .
F	i want to cancel what i spoke to jenny yesterday i was given it was with aol , now i see it is with talk_talk , which iam not happy with , she told me she was with aol .
M	can '_t fault the service order it on friday 00 o ' clock it arrived saturday_morning fantastic service
M	nothing but a good experience - will_definitely be using blackcircles again .
F	although it is situated on a main_road , the traffic could hardly be heard so a good nights_sleep was definitely not disturbed .
F	first_class service
M	cheaper prices of the stock you have .
F	product great , one month in and glad i got it .
F	i ordered it on thursday and paid the express delivery which said i would get the food within 0 - 0_days .
F	this is the perfect place to be for an overview of the city , helpful and friendly advice , easy access to the metro and all of beautiful city .
F	would use again and be happy to recommend .
F	i see from the reviews that i am not the only one to have this complaint about festive_lights .
M	what a con a piece of bread and cheese melted on top with inferior toppings that are sourced low grade rejected by supermarkets as unfit . then for £ 0 . 00 we have it delivered with one or two extra toppings like a pube or what looks_like a nail clipping . would you eat it ?
F	i asked if their delivery fee would be waived considering the circumstances , i am yet to receive a reply .
F	when i arrived at the rental_car depot , there was over 00 companies .
F	never again will i use them for anything !
F	we were swamped with debt 0 years_ago when our local citizens_advice bureau recommended payplan to us .
F	we have never felt judged and they have always looked after our best_interests .
M	thanks .
F	apparently there is no scheduled delivery date with the flowers selected which was not clearly_stated when ordering this bouquet .
M	if they just royal_mail the friction would be reduced to a buttery glide .
F	it was missing the figure from the top of the trophy .
M	from very first telephone_call - although unsure of validity of my claim every_step was professional and polite - i was never made to feel my inquiry was irrelevant or pointless - first contact young_lady took my details and a very full inquiry and then passed me promptly to a solicitor who took in more detail the background of my claim he advised me because of the complexity of my case he would run it past a colleague and contact me the following next_day i was spoken too and advised that in this particular case it would be a difficult to continue with a claim this was done in a non - dismissive manner and said that i could get a second opinion from another firm if i wished -- excellent service and i would have no_hesitation recommending them in future or using them again
M	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
M	the man who came from the post_office was clearly not happy about being sent out .
M	i had already re - arranged the delivery at that point and was assured by her that it would be the first drop and she would track the order personally to ensure it arrived on time .
M	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
M	excellent service will use again
F	also , any size parcel is possible - no minimum or maximum order , which is handy .
F	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
M	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green_leaves .
F	rubbish goods .
M	apart_from that the quality of the product is very good
F	wearing them today in florida .
M	may 0th : " you will get payment by 00th_may ."
F	i bought 0 dresses .
M	it annoys_me even more that for the same price i paid for 0000 copies of one side only a0_leaflets from leeds i got 0000 double_sided a0 from a local printer and full use of design in future .
M	very simple to order , hassle_free checkout and quick despatch .
M	plenty of options and easy to us .
M	i have been .
F	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
F	what counts is what companies do when things go_wrong .
F	instructions were easy to follow .
F	this was a get well soon bouquet for the wife of my husband '_s boss .
F	reason ?
F	i love ' glasses_direct ' and recommend to everyone
M	i looked around loads of places but the prices here were the cheapest around .
F	looks as though aspinal must be desperate to generate sales .
F	as with previous_orders i have placed , i have not seen the flowers .
F	i thought hughes were a reliable company but i certainly won_'_t use them again .
F	the owner was friendly and helpful .
F	i spotted my dress in the autumn but it was only in the sales that i could_afford it .
F	delivery was made however , item was signed for by a neighbour but no card was left to inform the recipient that it had been delivered to another address .
M	object quckly delivered and in perfect_condition
F	paid via_paypal took my money but did not book my collection .
M	on the following_monday the website had updated to ' parcel received at service centre ' and then two hours_later ' parcel out for delivery ', one hour after that i received an email_saying ' on its way and will be delivered within the next 0 working_days '!!!
M	a great value product , knocks_spots_off of what is available on the high_street ( b_& q etc )
F	i know that the company deals predominantly with businesses buying in bulk , but i simply wanted a single roll of paper . the postage was a quarter of the price again .
M	delivery time accurately predicted .
F	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan_branch provided a solution .
M	we ordered teal metro_tiles , they were a great price and arrived really quickly .
F	really annoying !
F	ordered item and money sent - emailed several days_later to be told discontinued item - why on website ??
F	i honestly do not think though that he would want me to buy this product for him again .
M	just got a call from dpd who appologised and said they are going to send someone with the parcel tonight and will call me when they are outside .
F	they asked me to send photos to justify the return ( which was fine ) on receipt of the photos they just kept saying that my daughter looked lovely so there was not a big problem and to wear a higher pair of shoes ( the dress had a train that was not shown on the website ).
F	if you need any supplies for your animals i would definately recommend animed_direct , i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
F	why pay express delivery , nothing express about it .
M	the cables were advertised as 0m_long , but in fact are 0 . 0m_long .
F	fab , very speedy delivery and had a voucher for 00_%_off so bargain !
M	i have to say that from the first contact up to the last contact with the very helpful delivery driver this purchase went very well .
F	easy to use site .
M	0rd journey ( separate party , same journey ) same as above , white knuckle journey , didn_'_t listen to sat_nav directions .
M	i google searched for the sunglasses i wanted & numerous online_retailers appeared .
F	i '_ll stick to sainsburys - never had a problem with them .
F	seriously , i '_ve never lost a competition yet !
F	i was told by the girl in the store it would be ready for me to pick it up on a particular day when in fact it wouldn_'_t be there until 0_days_later .
M	i returned them with the returns_slip filled in requesting a smaller_size and new boots were promptly dispatched - you can '_t say_fairer_than that .
F	this amount also took my account overdrawn ( something that never happens ) but they refuse to compensate for my bank charges .
M	it takes a while for them to get to the order and then for it to come .
F	when i asked for an am collection i expected an_email about 0 - 00am , instead i received an_email once i asked & was standing at customer_services , asking why i hadn_'_t had my email to collect the item .
F	they prove to be an invaluable tool for showcasing our work .
M	maybe even a video introducing your services ?
M	i ordered a spare shelf for a unit i previously bought from justtvstands .
F	i placed the order on 00 / 00 and payment went through via_paypal .
M	i have experienced things going wrong before and been faced with ( on one occasion ) going to court .
M	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
F	my opinion say `_s it all can `_t fault a thing .
F	i cannot use these lights as there is absolutely nothing to attach them to . no adapters no plug .
M	i received no call .
M	the " filters " are anything but useful , there '_s no method to the set of criteria that you choose from and lots of overlapping things to choose from ( e . g .

F	i ordered two items from here and after paying and receiving an e_- mail_stating that my items had been dispatched i thought everything was fine .
M	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
M	it was very clear that [_name_] didn_'_t have a clue regarding any of the account history and that he didn_'_t believe a word i said on the phone .
M	wouldd definitely buy from here again
F	better_than the rest .
F	won_'_t use lastminute . com ever again .
F	rubbish company !
F	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink_wrap . i was so upset for that . unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .

F	one very happy customer and i will definitely be using you again .
M	hope they are still trading can access the site today !
M	my booking was not your system and caused some problems .
M	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
M	the card that accompanied them was easy to fill out .
M	the hardback cover feels a bit cheap and has some bubbles on the spine already .
F	i am sure this aspect could be improved .
F	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn_'_t either !
M	couldn_'_t be more pleased
M	trustworthy and efficient
F	( and give westin gormet a piece of my mind .)
F	opted for amazon gift_certificate - fonebank honoured the amount_quoted and gift_certificate available after 0_days .
M	there are other_places which provide a much_better service .
F	nice !!!
F	just love my new coffee_table , can '_t stop touching it , is that weird ?!!!

F	on cars seem to be doubling up on me thats in the daytime at
M	we wanted to go and see a show in london and wanted a good deal with both a hotel and show .
M	keep_up the good work .
M	the information provided was clear and accurate .
F	maybe but would shop around at prices next time .
M	have three accounts with them .
M	however , this courier showed it '_s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
M	delivery exceptional - arrived on time and on the day requested .
M	the bulbs arrived very promptly and so_far are exactly_what i wanted .
F	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
M	i ordered some products for my birds but they have not arrived after 0_weeks .
F	delivered very quickly .
M	i needed a new printer , thought i would give ebuyer a bite of the cherry this time .
M	cheers_guys .
F	unnecessary hassle .
M	pity i could not use my laptop on board , no wi_-_fi .
M	in short , my response here is simple .
M	the shop is there to make money , don_'_t trade in sell private , but if you need new gear it '_s the place to go , they have a good guitar tech as well , you can trust him .
F	delivery far quicker_than i expected .
M	i ' d recommend these fellas to any one !
M	very good for storing grandsons toys under spare bed would have liked same box but 00cm wide
M	i refuse to use chemical anymore and use red eye , juno , bleep or local people as their vinyl isn_'_t damaged
F	i did not receive what i ordered for a long time .
M	its ok . its not particularly cheaper_than any other online shop
M	i would highly_recommend wiggle to any cyclist .
F	that , together with the price means i will definitely shop again at select_specs .
F	at this point i wasn_'_t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
F	service was excellent and product great .
M	cheap and an exceptable delivery time maybe could of been quicker , but price rules so i will_continue to shop with animed .
M	rest of your money to follow tomorrow .
M	so out of no fault of mine i have to spend the time buy the packaging , spend time taking into a local post_office to send back !!
F	i bel ; ieve i was charged_£ 0 . 00 for this pleasure which i certainly would not have knowingly paid as i was happy to have standard delivery .
F	i received an_email notification stating that the flowers had been delivered .
M	. probably_won_'_t use again .
M	me : " yes , your colleague said that yesterday when the first one got cancelled .
F	** after sorting_out the nappy_covers into sizes i was missing 0 of one size and got 0 extra of a different size , i wanted to send these back to get them replaced with the right size , so i contact them , told them the problem , they told me bambino_mio would send me a postage bag and i could send it back along with a letter explaining the problem , after waiting a week for the bag to arrive , i wrote my letter , packed it up and made my journey to the post_office , only to be told that they had not paid the postage and ii would have to pay , so , i took them back home , i then contact plo again who said they would send the postage , but they emailed me a postage_stamp , and i dont have a printer , and after all the hassle i cannot be bothered to contact them again .
F	waistcoat looked better_than the page image .
M	this is the 0rd time i have used envirophone in 0 years and i must_say the prices paid for phones seems to have collapsed !
M	the following_day ( already x0 day late ) i checked the tracking_number again and the flowers were in edinburgh which is almost x000 miles_away !!
F	i was unable to and i contacted paypal for help , to this day i am still_waiting for a reply .
M	calling in to discover that there are no hotels in central_london , you know that world famous capital city .
M	i needed a pair of prescription_sunglasses in a hurry .
M	the glasses were returned , and a no_quibble refund was issued .
M	any postcode i '_m in , inconveniently , exists in a " network hole ."
M	they failed to arrive .
F	deplorable .
M	i ordered 0 identical bookcases from paperstone .
F	:)
F	the lady i spoke to was very helpful and said a coating could be added but not in time for my holiday .
F	no_issues whatsoever with the whole_process and would definitely recommend them and would use them again myself without_hesitation .
M	it limited my holiday - budget !
M	of more concern to me is that they take 000_% of the money straight_away and then make you wait 00 weeks for delivery .
M	what i was told the most was ' i understand '.
M	i bought 0 shirts on one of the special_offer deals - they arrived promptly and were very nice quality .
M	my only issue was once ordered , other than an acknowledgment that our order had been accepted , there was no communication .
M	when the system came ( 0_weeks and few_days ), i was wow !
F	i enjoyed_browsing on the different selections of lovely flowers .
M	their e_- mail response was even worse , with a standard generic_reply received each and every time !
F	end
M	not done by me , but .
M	the call_centre staff_member was polite but he tried to up sell on me when quite clearly all i wanted to do was cancel !
F	i suck
M	we will_certainly praise your product and the way you kept us informed during the purchase time to the time it arrived here at the shires .
M	from picking_up the phone and ringing the freephone_number the guy on the end of the phone was cheerful , supportive and responsive .
F	we did not upgrade !
F	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don_'_t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
F	very convenient to have a fitter come out to you at a time of your choosing .
F	service amazing . email to let_me know flowers were on the way and another when it was delivered .
M	as a result actually pulling the lever feels_like it '_s a lot tougher than it should be .
M	been complaining direct and via_twitter , just get the same rubbish reply to run silly tests .
F	great choice of spare details for helicopters and very quick delivery !
F	husband very pleased with his tool box .
F	first time since i was a child being on a ship and i was fine .
F	needed 0 tyres_replaced and my experience with etyres could hardly have gone more smoothly .
M	very pleased
F	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
F	goods ordered and delivered promptly - kept up to date by text of when goods would be delivered .
F	je vous ai renseigné mais aucune réponse .
F	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
M	thanks
F	i am really disappointed as i thought i had bought my daughter a lovely big bunch of flowers and i feel exploited by eflorist for taking my money under false pretences and by sending me a load of rubbish .
M	the offer price is nothing more than a lure to get you in .
F	after 0_days wear the left lens was wabbling about due to loose fixing .
M	after i submitted the review , i was contacted by a member of their management_team and appologied to .
M	would use the site again .
F	i was really pleased to find the perfume i wanted , at half the price it was in high_street stores .
M	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
F	once you bought of them , they bombard you with e_-_mails .
F	i go back on
M	this he did an suggested an epson 000 , a new model , at £_00 .
M	i will of course adjust the poor rating_accordingly to reflect the positive after sales experience when everything is completed .
F	i chose a fiat_000 with a few extras and it works out far cheaper and easier than financing a car .
F	all in all avoid very !
F	we ordered two chest of drawers and two bedside_cabinets .
M	tried it , hated it .
M	i '_ll reserve_judgement but it shakes ones confidence when the glasses come apart in a week .
F	i ordered dailies aqua_comfort plus for the first time .
F	she_loves tulips and after a google_search serenata had a lovely bouquet .
F	they are supposedly working on a ' real time stock update ', but this is not the case .
M	faulty device - wrote for advise - did not here a word - oh - device was for a friend .
F	i ordered a palladium ring for my fiances 00th_birthday .
F	this spoilt the complete look of the display .
F	i would recommend them to everyone .
F	this has deeply upset me and spoilt christmas .
F	communications were excellent from order acknowledgement to notification of despatch , i would recommend highly .
F	so looking_forward to that
M	had a bit of trouble with the purchase as i cam up as a security " risk " on tier_0 '_s system .
M	!
M	had never_heard of this company before , but will_certainly be using them in the future for any other purchases i make .
F	really quick delivery .
M	use yankee_doodle and expect to receive the worst possible service - stay well away from them
F	the only draw_back was that the quality of the goods wasn_'_t as good as i would have expected for the price i payed .
M	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
M	so i decided to ring to find out what was happening , and i '_m so glad i did .
F	if you live_overseas and can only contact them by email , this is not a site you should use .
M	poor description of product and doubt the top line price .
F	i am using my contacts in the media to spread the word about this terrible organisation .
F	guests have commented on how lovely they are .
M	we are now taking_legal_action .
F	soaking_wet floor no good on the health and safety side .
M	stay_away they have done nothing but con me out of 00_euros .
F	just a 0 tier system , say under 000g or over ?
F	had email_confirmation that i would be contacted shortly , but had received no response to request when item arrived 0_days_later .
M	huge_range and had the glasses i wanted a third less then on the high_street .
F	when we rang up expedia blamed us for booking it incorrectly and refused to sort it out .
F	the solution : custom - made ( a variation on their buttonholes at no extra_cost ), along with altering the colours of a corsage and the size of my bouquet .
F	i have not had any_problems with any of my purchases before , however i was unable to purchase my lasts order as the wowcher_code did not work that was sent to me for the heated eye lash curlers .
M	i rang two_days ago and item should of at_least been dispatched now
F	mrs nankeville
M	all done with 0 working_days .
F	items delivered with no_problems .
M	it took 0 days to get there , i called them asking why it wasn_'_t delivered they said 00 hour means 0 - 0 days ?????
F	please change your system .
F	the bill i received in december was for £_000 but as my account was in credit , the balance read out to me on the phone was £_000 , which i paid .
F	all we can do is keep our fingers_crossed that the ticket is on its way and that you are behaving honourably .
F	anyway avoid using this company .
M	based on this experience i would buy from crampton and moore again .
M	not with standing we intend to order further blinds shortly .
M	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
F	many other_companies could do with following this model
F	great product , well priced and delivered promptly at modest cost .
M	anyway , other than that the book is excellent
M	£_00 for a dozen_red_roses they look half_dead was a bit disappointed they didn_'_t really say i love you more like i can '_t stand you ballon and chocolates was fine tho
F	the service was good and i have received on time .
F	chair is fantastic - really easy to put_together and extremely comfortable - i purchased this
M	it looks_like what i '_ve purchased is incorrect because my ' pest ' problem still_exists .
M	i used the valet_parking , business lounge and duty_free shop .
F	0 minutes on hold . tcha nam .
M	john .
M	i would not use them again purely_because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two_days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
F	i would tell anyone to use mazuma .
M	!
F	said it would be with me in one to day it took a week .
M	was good and packaging is great .
F	i ordered a size 0 and waited_patiently for them to arrive from france .
M	cyberpower did a great job with my pc , it runs very well .
F	ordered new_washing_machine at 0 . 00pm .
F	they followed through efficiently with what they needed to do .
F	thanks !
M	very good post - purchase updates on delivery timeline .
M	every corner of the wood packaging and the memory_stick is smooth to the touch ( no splinters here ) and i am proud to be offering these to my wedding clients .
M	i have noticed that there are now several reviews that have been taken down for the same reason , funnily_enough , none of the fake 0_star reviews have been taken down .
F	i am not a happy customer & if this is not resolved in a satisfactory way i will be going to trading_standards with my complaint as the boots were not just useless but not as shown on site either and the other ones left scars on my feet :-(
M	awful experience and no response to any emails .
M	it might be worth it for some but i '_ll be sticking with official nespresso for a while longer yet .
F	cleaning with a filthy mop obviously hadn_'_t helped . but that was down to the cleaners !
F	good customer service - i had to communicate with the company by email and they answered very quickly .
F	i was kept_fully_informed of the progression of my order and the recipient was delighted with her bouquet .
M	the whole_transaction was ok .
F	they won_'_t give us a full_refund either and say we '_d have to lose 00_% of the purchase price .
F	as above , but it would be nice to have more stuff not made in china .
M	it '_s taken 0 emails and a phone_call to see what is going on !
F	lovely products but i '_ve found the wait a little excessive .
M	at the price i don_'_t expect it to compete with dewalt , makita etc .
F	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
F	that the staff are superb can '_t fault them .
M	they are definitely authentic , and i am definitely thrilled !
M	highly_recommended service , very easy to install and professional product
M	then rang printerpix to place the order .
F	sometimes difficult to redeem voucher .
M	made one order but payment taken 0 times
F	i then requested to the cancel the order but was told it was not possible as the flowers were with the courier .
M	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
M	excellent prices and the order was made .
F	the returns and exchange process is clunky .
F	i am so angry and frustrated with floraqueen !
F	there was a constant fear of something falling on you .
M	not sure if i will be using you in the future
M	totally ripped of and dealt_with like i was a criminal .
M	ordered a dracula outfit plus other parts off the site , arrived very fast and packaged very well . the prices were good and the site has a vast_range of items suitable for everyone '_s needs .
F	i received an_email_saying the flowers had been delivered which was clearly not the case .
M	the after sales service was non_existent .
M	all the reviews were removed by trust_pilot without an investigation .
M	i was also not told until after purchase that delivery could be anywhere up until 0pm .
F	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don_'_t want the product anymore .
M	highly_recommended .
F	i '_m in a job where i can '_t just take time off so now have had to arrange for someone to come round and deal with them .
M	in principle that was fine , and the price ok ( although another courier company such as myhermes . co . uk could have done it for around half the price ), but parcelforce would only give 0am to 0pm collection and delivery time slots .
M	on contacting hotel to book taxi from airport , hotel informed be not booked .
M	well_done .
F	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get_hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest_depot .
F	great site .
M	do not be afraid to make them an offer if you see a wach you want , but it '_s slightly out of your price range - i did on both watches and saved an additional £_000 of the asking price - no cheek , no chance .
F	no need to shop anywhere_else .
F	my favourite way to shop .
F	quite a few of the blocks arrived damaged and i was not sure if they were seconds or not .
M	no student support whatsoever , no clear tab on what homework is and when it is due .
F	!
F	i placed an order of a photobook in time for christmas delivery .
M	i typically support the underdog against companies that have a dominant position so i started to research their product and identified one that i really like .
F	driver very friendly and helfpul .
M	i specifically_asked if that was an issue , and the reply was " no_problems ".
M	delivered on time every time .
M	thank_you for your quick_turnaround , got the product within a few_days , not an easy website to navigate and end up at the check out .
F	hmm . they can take my money immediately but drag their feet to re - credit !
M	the ram fitted & worked without_any hitches .
M	it took 0 or 0 emails to boohoo '_s customer service before getting acceptable answer .
F	i bought the dalek outfit , reduced in the clearance_sale . what a bargain !
F	they fulfilled the agreement swiftly and at a very fair price .
F	delivery prompt
M	dear lock & key ,
F	my package did not come until the saturday when i wasent home and then royal_mail said i had to wait - so therefor i didnt get to dress up for my halloween parties .
F	( in mechanics words the tyre was only fitted ' finger tight ')
M	however i received my last one with some damage during delivery ( citylink ) but thankfully it did not stop me from being_able to fit and use the blinds .
M	when i rang up phones_0u , i couldn_'_t stand the woman in whatever country she was in , i might aswell have spoke in dutch !
F	i advised customer service of this on the day they arrived .
F	terrible company
M	!
F	next time i would ensure that i emailed to ask exactly_what came with the outfit .
M	i run my own business so am used to dealing occasionally with idiots , and people that try to take_advantage , but what about all the people that get bullied into excepting excuses , and fobbed_off .
M	when they arrived one was a bit squashed .
M	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
F	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
M	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
F	after 0_days i finally got through to her to be told the car would be with the supplier by the end of the week .
F	they came quickly and i would have no_reservations_about recommending workwear_express to other_companies .
M	solution : put bean sacs inside plastic bin liner to enter them into cover .
M	sadly , the jacket we ordered for our daughter was too small .
M	phones now on its way back to me but it '_ll take 00 working_days !
M	the site was easy to use and goods were didoatched ok .
M	great product , price and service
F	i , however , am nearly 0 foot_tall .
M	they clearly have no concept of what an unhappy customer is nor how to deal with one .
F	for £ 0 . 00 i expected a bigger box of chocolates considering thorntons do a massive box for £ 0 .
M	however the lady was very pleasant and the car was in reasonable condition for the cost .
M	they had a great range of furniture and were very well priced .
M	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
F	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
M	total price was around £_00 . 00 .
F	00 april 00
F	shopped_around online for the product i was looking for and wanted to use a local business .
M	been sat a while so needed a freshen_up .
F	the furniture is lovely !!
M	knew about the quality of the slr '_s but the go pro '_s as excellent as they are to put on a person / vehicle / underwater in wide_angle though give this impression in the write up .
F	thanks
F	exactly as ordered and arrived promptly
F	thankfully she only came once .
F	delivery was quick but asked for delivery to a different address as per order form .
M	this is very poor delivery service and very disappointing .
F	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn_'_t have our booking !
M	!
M	'_s new list of recommended insurers , but we got a quote from them as we had insured with them last_year .
F	sent flowers to my mum for mother '_s day .
M	i ordered a new pc as i needed something for media storage in the lounge and having used dino_pc for the other computers i ' d needed recently it was a natural choice .
F	customer service bent_over_backwards to be helpful too .
F	very quick delivery , kept me informed on the status of my order .
M	i received notification that the package was picked_up in hong_kong at 00 :_00pm on wednesday and the package was at my door in scotland at 00 :_00am on friday .
F	the cheque was sent quickly , and was exactly how much they said it would be .
F	i was asked to hold while they spoke to their manager , i was on hold for ages .
M	i gave this a one star_rating because the staff were pleasant and there was no way not to give any stars at all .
M	i call and am told that customer service will be in at 0 on monday and can help .
M	i run an online retail company and if i offered this level of service we would quickly have no customers .
M	spend your hard - earned_money somewhere_else .
F	these people are so incredibly poor at their jobs that they apparently are incapable of fulfilling a simple order and would rather send out rudely - worded letters and cancel orders needlessly than deal with any of their many failings as a company .
M	they have totally_ignored his requests and now have sent a court proceeding warning letter , they have now told me they only accept cancellations on the phone .
M	?
M	she has_been without heat for a week now , they just do not care !
M	foe example the ' clever dick ' ' marketing push of damage_waiver_insurance is a real turn off in my opinion .
F	my friend who the flowers was sent to said that they was dying
F	the 0 trees and 0 shrubs arrived in a0 condition thanks to brilliant packing and a careful courier .
M	it was for a work project , not personal .
F	i was offered a refund but decided my self to wait .
M	the customer service lady then said it would definately be delivered the next_day ( saturday ), to which nothing arrived .
F	as my avon brochure is my shop window i dont want to put creased bags on my brochures as it creates a bad impression .
M	i would add , again , everyone i spoke to was courteous but clearly they are tied by how much they were able to help satisfy a customer and take decisions !
M	oh but a word of warning , don_'_t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
M	most places only sell multipacks and not as wide a range of colours - but i was easily able to find the exact ones i wanted and order them without a problem .
F	one shoe , was sent .
F	placed my order on the internet at tea time .
F	i '_ve been waiting 00 days so far .
F	however 0 of them .
M	trying to stop mail coming through to my address a whole different kettle of fish .
M	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling_regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
F	i was told i would be informed about the price of the repair before they did it , i was not , i got a call saying to come pick it up .
M	my advice is pay the extra with bt , as they may be more_expensive but they generally do what they say they '_ll do , when they say they '_ll do it .
M	thank_you smd .
M	wander how they would try and cover that up .
F	the manager of the shop i didnt think he was very friendly .
M	i think that the price of £ 0 - 00 for one flyswat was grossly overpriced as it would cost pennies to make in china .
F	this was my first order from chocolatetradingco . com and i was very impressed with the choice of products available , the information provided relating to the products and the prices were very competitive .
F	i ordered a product that we cannot get in australia and it arrived quickly and easily .
M	excellent .
M	order communication was good , and the item arrived promptly today .
M	after a00hr trans - atlantic journey , the last thing you need is another 0hr wait at the alamo_desk to process paperwork .
F	there was good communication from the carrier too .
F	g0s even read my meters 0_days after transfer ( i have the meter readers name , time of visit and readings on the day ) and still they over exaggerated readings .
F	picture nice and clear but , surprised when i got it to find it didn_'_t fit the whole canvas , as it said it was adequate and it is not centred .
F	00days and still no news on my phone .
F	after ordering a yard of ale and paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery , my item came damaged .
F	once when i first moved to london and the last time in 0000 .
M	the product was very well put_together and instructions clear and easy to follow .
F	today is 0th_april and my food is still not here .
M	thanks guys
M	that seemed to get forgotten along with the notification .
M	as many others have noted , i ordered because they state that they have stock .
F	pethetic excuse .
M	i can confirm that the issues i have had with regus have now been resolved , thanks to their dedicated customer service team at surrey .
F	i have made a serious complaint about a member of staff in the brixton store , 0 telephone_calls later ( strangely the line kept cutting off ) and 00_mins later ( and still counting ) i '_ve been told that jd_sports do not take complaints over the phone and that they have to be in writing for them to acknowledge it .
M	if it ends up as just an unused icon on your desktop ( how many have we got of these !)
M	the service from one of the pauls and jamie was simply as good as you could ever need .
M	cheque / bank_transfer same day phone received .
F	i am delighted with the products bought from dapw .
M	hard to give any review as i '_m still_waiting for
M	however if i had not had the option to have the item delivered to my work address i would have had to drive to their chosen courier '_s depot to collect as there was no out of hours delivery nor ability to have the item left in a safe_place .
F	you have been warned !
F	they are very friendly and helpful , and go out of their way to help as well .
M	i would just appreciate it if someone would let_me know what is happening and when it will be delivered .
F	however my address was wrong on their system !
M	at the very least i expect to be refunded the additional_cost for a pre 0pm elsewhere now as once my money was taken that was it .
F	i am so very disappointed as if i '_d have known this i wouldn_'_t have ordered the parasol and would have bought it from elsewhere as bugaboo products are pretty_much the same price everywhere .
M	n . b .
F	i phoned the centre and spoke to a lovely girl called sam who put me right on a few things and advised me what to buy provide an appropriate habitat .
F	looking_forward to buying again in the future .
M	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
M	well , found pfjones website easy to navigate , pay and order ( safely ).
F	we chubby / fat / obese / normal size ladies with a size 00 - 00 frame also want to look pretty and so therefore would like to see allot more choice in that size range just for a change !
F	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
M	i '_m glad i didn_'_t get caught in that traffic jam !!
F	the company should really check who they are putting on the phone because this gives me a bad image of the company that really doesn_'_t have to be .
M	i rang to rearrange for the following week and was told this would be logged .
M	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
F	also the time it took was quite lenghty and without a more detailed delivery summary i can see how it would put people off .
F	would recommend without a doubt .
M	a good network but very slow to connect when you lose and gain signal , also very expensive when you go abroad and make calls and use internet ( more than any network i have been with before ).
F	i completed a stay in a hotel in december and it has taken 0_months to get my cash_back and that is through constant_emails to see what was happening .
M	they are very good at recognizing their frequent flyers - upgrades are frequent on busy flights and when flights get canceled due to fog , storms , volcanoes etc .
F	i am now waiting for it to clear into my paypal_account .
F	i will give this company another chance !
F	a bit misleading .
F	even the onion sets arrived later than i expected .
F	regular_updates_via_email on dispatch , reasonable_prices and fantastic range of products some really hard to find items : ) used the website twice in the last 0_weeks and not one problem , i am one happy customer and will_continue to use rather_than getting ripped_off at boots / superdrug : ) xxx
F	i have been using the site for almost two years_now and feel as if i have the best job in the world .
M	who does that ??
F	the salisbury store didn_'_t have it in stock , so had to go back again , when product eventually came in .
M	no_problems , so all good !
M	i looked online for depot landline no joy .
F	no_problems at all .
F	the only_downside for me was that the drop on the roman_blinds when they were pulled closed were too long .
M	. probably but if this happens too often ill be ringing around .
M	r buchan
M	i also found the overly matey attitude they assume very grating .
M	had a problem with a discount_code not working at checkout .
M	as yet , not been on a long run to test them , so fingers_crossed
F	this is the worst service i have ever_encountered .
M	instead of tinkering with stupid things that no - one wants , and look crass ( i . e .
F	i live in new_zealand .
F	the money arrived saturday_morning at no cost , how efficient was that .
F	fantastic tarriff - unlimited_texts , unlimited mins and upto 0gb internet download for £_00 ( not including_vat ) when the cheapest any other provider could do for that was £_00 .
M	flowers were beautiful , delivered on time and i was notified to the progress of my order at every_step along the way .
F	this is a really nicely_presented gift box and delivery was quicker_than i had expected .
F	we had a good experience when ordering our invitations .
F	my mum_loved the flowers and they arrived nice and early before she went out to lunch .
F	recipient pleased .
M	but this time i got an email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce . im still_waiting .
F	we loved the vivid gerbera contrasting with the zingy green of the chrysanthemums .
M	although may be seen as convenient , when you actually take into account delivery time it can be a week before your receive items by which time you would need to go do your own shopping for items anyway .
F	i had to send an_email to confirm this which i did and received an_email back to day they had to wait for confirmation from the supplier before i get a refund i '_m still_waiting for the confirmation 0_days on .
M	i will never use them again
M	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
F	easy to order , reasonable_prices arrived as promised on time .
M	call to say furniture had been delivered .
M	still_waiting .
F	have booked many holidays through travel zoo in the past , but truly don_'_t think it '_s as good now .
F	no one read the notes and on the morning of delivery as we were waiting , a phone_call informed us that the van arranged was too_big to come .
M	first time user of cash_generator online and i won_'_t be using it again .
F	the outer_wrapping of the parcel was damaged , whether this was due to rough treatment or bad wrapping on my part is unknown .
M	we now have a problem where my wife has no access to her account , if we try her number it just leads to my pay as you go account , over the last five days starting saturday 0th_september , we have phoned and spoken to , susan , ryan , pauline , victoria , carol , tarek , and today jodie , every day we have been promised that the problem would be solved in 00 hour it has not .
F	regards miss wood
F	easy to order and delivery was as_described .
M	i know this element is sub - contracted by mrs_stone , but i have ordered slate_tiles through another supplier in the past that were delivered to a more difficult site to access with no_problems_whatsoever .
M	great service from knowledgeable experts .
F	can '_t get any response from then .
F	i asked if the package could be delivered to another address as the camera was a present for christmas and i didn_'_t want my boyfriend to intercept it , i was told for security_reasons as a new customer they could only deliver to the address of the credit_card ; bit_annoying but ok .
M	excellent to deal with .
M	ordered a speaker turned_up broke , sent another that was broke , they have kept the speaker and will not refund accusing me of swapping out with broken speaker , very unprofessional and abusive avoid at all costs .
F	they stated that " we have a backlog of messages which requires response ".
M	flowers arrived sometimes twice in one day but sweets were orderd twice for th children but havent arrived
M	secondly , after finally paying to return the item , they have the faulty battery and i have not received a replacement , or refund or payment of return postage .
M	the order which i required for tomorrow never showed up with yodel today .
F	a big plus was the sale on the cooker and got a bargain on a neff oven so all in all not terrible but not great either .
M	great service !
F	all in all you , very good .
F	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
F	appalling incompetent untrained staff !!!
M	i get a call midday friday to say they can '_t get the tyres to the fitting_station ( national_tyres ) until monday so i re - arrange the fitting to monday p . m .
M	trying to get holkd of front_row seats for any big concert is hard enough .
M	nothing .
F	totally efficient fast service which i was very impressed with .
F	no card has_been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
M	especially helpful was the assembly service for the kids bunk_beds unit as it would have taken me hours to build it !
F	customer_services will not deal with delivery info , however when you call the delivery line , no one ever answers , then no one returns your calls !
F	it took me 0_weeks and 0 emails to the ceo to get my money back .
M	overall sportsbikeshop offers a reasonable selection of products at a competitive price .
M	they were very quick response to email and telephoned me back to discuss what they could exchange for in my size .
M	many_thanks !
F	a modern dressing_table / desk for my daughter in beautiful oak .
M	overall highly_recommended and impressed with service , the goods speak for themselves samsung_ue00d0000 .
M	this did not happen in a reasonable time so i called again late_afternoon and left another message for a call back .
M	can '_t complain_about the price - after a bit of online research we settled on a highly - reveiwed mattress and this was the best price we could_find .
M	i bought a humax dtrt0000 / 0tb via another on - line retailer , thought it was so good i wanted another , they were out of stock , so i searched the web & found " superfi ", never_heard of them before but they had listed what i wanted .
M	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs_replacing with one that is not faulty .
M	in order to do that , i guess , you have to have visited at_least 00_% of all restaurants of that particular cuisine .
F	have to say that trustpilot were easy to deal with and no porblems to report .
M	however , surely a company the size of europcar could have basic vehicle instructions in 0 or three european languages .
M	a very enjoyable buying experience , and i shall be visiting the shop again for the above reasons !
F	based on my experience i would not recommend this company .
F	i did not like this perfume and my husband suggested that igive it to a charity_shop .
M	i was very pleased with the service i got from mazuma this is the 0 time i have used this company very fast from_start to finish .
M	he will give you a few porkies !!!!!
F	ocado cancelled my delivery just saying my payment details cannot be verified .
M	anyhow , i have got a 000 current account , paying £ 0 monthly_fee .
F	stock issues !
M	not an exact_match but does what it needs to do
M	customer_services answered my emails promptly and confirmed what to order via a phone_call .
M	they look great hanging from the bottles in my cellar and make wine selection much_easier without having to disturb the bottles to read the label .
F	i had to call my 00 year_old mum and explain what a silly idiot i had been , she said it was ok , but i knew it wasn_’_t .
M	a card was supposedly left - it wasn_'_t .
F	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
M	buy from here now .
M	one chest has issues with the handles .
M	i found the site easy to navigate , easy to enter my euro vat number , easy to get a reasonable delivery to france and then the tools arrived in 0 days .
F	they completely went to waste and i wasted a lot of money .
F	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0_days then gave a range covering 0_days .
F	my ordered arrived within a few_days but i thought i had ordered one thing and had recieved the wrong item - i emailed the customer service address and got a reply within_00hrs .
M	ordered and delivered with no_problems and received quicker_than normal , which is an improvement .
F	da questa mattina non sono ancora riuscita a far pervenire a questa compagnia i documenti .
F	will wear them in an evening to dress up my outfits .
F	anna averis
F	the apartment is in a really nice building in a great area .
F	i lost 0 - 0 lbs quite quickly and then stuck at the same weight for over two_weeks .
M	got on the plane and got to the hotel , just to find out that there was no reservation done i had to call travel rep from abroad and spend £_00 just to get told that the company they worked with was no_longer int_he business and that they were going to sort the hotel for me . ( didn_'_t have the decency to let_me know before i left home , or advise me how this was going to work ) i had to waste money that they are not not happy to refund as it wasn_'_t their fault .
M	however , after a while of explaining and re - explaining my situation along with a timeline of events , the customer service rep then understood .
F	i asked customer_services if they could send these to me and i got a " computer says no " answer .
F	stay away from this store and save_yourself a whole load of grief .
F	first time i have ever purchase furniture from the internet , and i have to say i was nervous , but clearly shouldn_'_t have been .
F	i '_d definitely recommend this company and i would buy from them again .
F	my order came really quickly and i received a great special_offer .
M	aren_'_t these checked after each crossing ?
F	however the latest parcel arrived sealed on three sides only .
M	now that '_s what i call a service .
M	only problem i had was with yodel delivery , they deliver 0 days a week when i '_m at work and couldn_'_t ring to arrange a suitable time for next available delivery .
M	i can only recall ordering 0 item that was not immediately ex - stock , although it did arrive within the 0days promised . how they manage such quick deliveries with such a huge stock selection is amazing .
F	i placed the order and paid for it on the 00st_december .
M	i recommend it to my friends with confidence .
M	i ordered as follows_:
M	always want a pair of oakley but they are far too expensive normally so i ’ ve never pull the trigger , that is until i stumble_across eyewear_outlet – bought the fast jacket with spare lenses , £_00 cheaper_than on high_street and duty_free , arrived next_day – can ’_t be_happier !
F	the material was inferior , cheap & nasty .
F	i have email evidence of what i have written in this review .
F	i know tickets can cost a lot if trying to get them at the last_minute , but surely not months before , i was so shocked that i had been charged sooo_much extra , yes i knew i would be charged a bit , but more than double , viagogo is on a real good thing ,
F	i hope the owners read this and get the house sorted and begin to start caring for house and its guests , its such a waste otherwise .
M	we recommend the under_floor heating store to friends family and customers and will_continue to do so in the future in fact a customer in finchampstead had recently been looking to purchase 0 kits from a different company and we steared him in the right_direction .
M	ordered online for a great price .
M	thanks very much
F	well_done figleaves i am your biggest_fan : 0 )
F	even if just one person is put off ordering by reading my review would be worth it !
M	there '_s no excuse when your running a business !
M	should have come here first , yet another person to suffer the alledged water_damage , amazing eh_?
M	pre ordered modern_warfare 0 well before release_date . its 00 / 00 / 00 today still has not come blamed it on post
F	ordered our bath from this company as we have a small bathroom and not many other_companies stock the size we need .
F	and of course , we all lost out completely so i am eu000 out of pocket ( including viagogo '_s admin_fee ).
M	excellent response to any communication , faster_than predicted delivery , product exactly as_described and a price that beat amazon .
M	i '_ve sent about 00 email '_s in total and not had 0 reply , the only way to get in touch is through their 0 pence a minute phone number .
F	got them in sale too which was an added_bonus
F	it is such a fantastic , quality piece of kit and well_worth the high price_tag .
M	made a mistake once ordering from this company cancellend the order within 00 min
M	not worth the bother
M	i wouldn_'_t buy my ' posh ' clothes anywhere_else .
M	ordered sunday_night and the item was despatched monday_morning , got to me tuesday .
M	dont_know anyone who has a good experience .
M	anyvan themselves are not interested when things go_wrong - they simply act as agents to put you in touch with movers and take a cut of the transaction via_paypal .
M	.
F	arrived in great packaging , with flatten boxes so could be presented as gifts if required .
F	this was the 0th time i contacted them for help using this method ( their own customer service dept !
F	so i was a little_nervous_about recycling my ipad 0 with ipad_recycle but after_reading the reviews and doing some_research i decided to give it a go !
M	they dismiss my claim out of hand stating ' packaging not adequate ' despite having no photo '_s of the item .
F	i regularly buy the food for them also ; “ harrison '_s ”, and often leave it to the last moment , but it never_fails to get here on time .
M	i used the reviews here to make a decision as a result of which i lost money !
M	hotel_rooms
M	i ordered on the 00th_march and paid £ 0 . 00 for deliver , over a week_later it hasn_'_t arrived and they are unwilling to do anything about it until 0_weeks have elapsed .
M	an ideal_location if you want the ambiance of the city life as we did .
F	both make great beds for having an afternoon nap on .
M	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
F	she couldn_'_t upload the book for some reason , and had to call and chase numerous_times before she was given a link to upload it .
F	love my teeth !
F	just a clear bag and a bit of ripped paper with handwriting on .
M	we find the service ex as i have said but we are impressed with the packing and delivery service too .
M	however wanted spare grills etc for my old one which i will give to my daughter and have made three phone_calls to them giving them the part nos etc .
M	the product , the updating about despatch and the delivery service are all beyond_reproach .
F	well the website tracking said " no one home , left contact card " .
F	the chances are that you won_'_t receive them and they won_'_t answer your calls or e_-_mails .
F	then ill have to wait 0_days for money to return to my account . come on sainsburys not good !!
M	i had a particular requirement for some individual colours of a certain type of pen .
M	very good and friendly service
F	hence my dissatisfaction and three star rate .
F	the website was clear and easy to use and the order arrived very quickly .
F	what a shambles .
F	sizes changed order a 00 it '_s like an 00 order a 00 it '_s like a 0 .
F	the ring arrived this morning ( on time , just as promised by stephanie ) and i am so happy with it , it really does look as good as it did on the website ( actually it looks better ), even_though my fiances birthday wasn_'_t until saturday . i gave it to him 0_days early as i just couldn_'_t wait to see his face .
F	to be on the safe side i completed and returned the claims_form on monday 0th_december - in line with the deadlines , although i stated i did not know what had happened to the parcel , as noone had confirmed
F	i would definitely recommend them to any business looking to purchase sage software .
F	the member of staff i spoke to made it very easy , he simply arranged for a new delivery , with extra packaging and advised me to dispose of the broken item .
M	it missed its slot and i had a large taxi_fare as a consequence . empty any hold_luggage , let them stew .
M	have tried numerous other_websites and this is by far the best .
M	i found that i was running_low on stock and worried that i couldn_'_t go to the gym if i had none .
F	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and that was exactly_what was delivered and faster_than the expected .
M	0 - 0 is a very big window too . lot '_s of waiting in the house .
F	i did eventually find a note saying if you bought with a guitar you would save on postage . however i was charged postage on the original item so i would not say this was clear .
F	as a result they could only fit 0 out of the 0 tyres i '_d ordered .
M	chased by telephone to be told they had got lost , between eye sale and the lab .
F	quick delivery quality item - faultless
F	the price was amazing when we compared it with a local company .
F	we booked and paid for the heathrow purple business parking through skyparksecure .
M	quick response to orders , goods well_packaged .
F	we have used blinds0go for a number of blinds around the house and have always been pleased with the quality and price .
M	all in all not a huge issue and at the end of the day it was a great price .
M	it was taken out of the packaging laid on the floor and put straight back in the packaging and sent back .
M	i returned them .
F	ordering purpose was straightforward and the product was as expected ( i '_ve had one before ) but delivery was a day late and i found the information on the tracking site unhelpful - i didn_'_t know what stages were involved so i didn_'_t know how far the delivery had got so when i could expect it .
F	this is efficient but the information ` i was given resulted_in extra unnecessary expense .
M	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
M	decided to try waitrose '_s online delivery service .
F	expecting a dog bed , just got a cover , no_doubt the description says that but the picture is misleading .
M	as previously stated various times , we have responded to the points you have raised and feel there is no error in the sale of this package .
M	it was easy to use , clearly_marked prices , no_hidden_costs .
M	toooooo much writing on them spoiled the sale .
F	but i put it down to lazy drivers tbh
F	i do not live in a remote_area and have not been contacted about any_problems with the order so do not see why it is taking so long .
M	most companies were out of stock . however the delivery took longer_than i am used to from wiggle or chain_reaction cycles .
M	in one module , i even had suggested answers which were clearly for the guidance of markers rather_than students .
F	i was trying to get a new door_seal for my zanussi washing_machine .
F	i '_ve_used p0g several_times , never having had a problem .
F	if you have the time & patience i would say selling them on ebay is definitely the way to go , you '_ll get a lot more for your items in the long run .
M	i was treated as though i was trying to scam them by requesting a return ( on the very same day it arrived ).
F	two excellent things about jules_b :
M	the review was contested by the company i reviewd an dremoved .
M	i think a fdew tweeks to the website could improve the experience and opportunity to find a cost_effective courier , a lot .
M	no notification given , no tracking_info on my tyres , no communication whatsoever .
M	i can onestly recommend to anyone !!
F	they directed me to their website a lot and did not seem to have the time to deal with my enquiries .
F	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
M	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
F	---------------
F	not really into htc
M	i found the whole_process really easy and straight_forward .
M	i will_definately_use the website again when i need some more products for my three cats .
F	beware of fitting costs when buying one of these products as it bumps up the price of your purchase .
F	my order arrived today , packaged well .
F	ordered from ireland .
M	never !
M	the chairs are excellent with clear assembly_instructions and each set of screws etc came with a spare .
M	fab service !
F	efficient service , high_quality product , well communicated from order to delivery , thank_you !
F	have used this company before , but this is the first time i have actually seen the flowers , prior to taking them to the recipient .
F	wait_until after you '_ve actually done something , rather_than just talked .
M	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	we did not even get a card from the delivery company you used to tell us that a delivery had been attempted !
M	the way the pages take longer to load and from the contents of the advertisements you wonder what kind of data are being collected .
M	to have been offered the book at reduced cost would have been a start - lets_face it from their point of view it will go in the bin !
F	thanks for making it the day special for her .
M	bought a tyler variax jtv - 00 just before_noon on a thursday and received it friday_morning .
F	simply appalling .
F	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
F	when we tried to use the voucher it didn_'_t work , i contacted them and the company but had no reply .
F	i ordered a lovely looking bunch . however when i saw what was delivered i could have bought the equivalent from a supermarket for about no more than a tenner .
M	some times there is quite a gap from order to getting the products , some of the products seem of poor quality , mainly the packing , some are virtually_impossible to open without causing pain .
F	like this site for finding good deals .
M	the lens itself was poorly_maintained , scratched and rattled and the results were less_than pleasing .
M	when payment is taken no confirmation_email of the order is sent .
F	a week_later i had heard_nothing so went into store to check , they told me they only get deliveries for customers once a week which is pretty poor considering it is meant to be a quick service .
F	it is clear that despite all the fees , that other_websites don_'_t charge , the guarantee of their bookings is a matter of luck !
M	quality control of the finished product sadly_lacking .
M	i sent a few screen_shots from the dvr along with other observations , that night .
F	but then tell me this before the whole day has_gone !
F	i would have chosen something between two and three stars - it was not acceptable but not actually bad .
M	i have emailed to question the whereabouts of my order with no reply as of yet .
M	i have used kenable a number of times
M	ignore any ads you see talking_about laser_surgery deals .
M	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
F	from the photo she sent me , i '_m_glad i ' upgraded ' to the deluxe_bouquet as anything less would have been rather underwhelming and i '_m still quite sad that i lost the element of surprise as i had to ask my daughter about the first lot of flowers that didn_'_t arrive .
M	i have been with this compony for two months i was told when i switched my payments by dd would be 00 pound per_month i was paying 00 per_month with m & s energy i just been told i have to pay double per_month i wished i had not switched as soon as i can i will go back to southern energy don_'_t go near first_utility they are crap i am havering to go on to a prepayment meter so i can pay my energy_bills never again
F	bizarre because it was all beautifully_wrapped .
F	all the items were packaged amazing !
M	ordered ms project monday , received payment confirmation but suspiciously , nothing further .
M	what let them down was the delivery service .
F	no crack in phone when i sent in a jiffy padded_envelope .
F	i '_m not a grinch where leaving reviews is concerned so i '_ll give credit where it '_s due .
F	the web_site was well set out and easy to navigate .
F	this mistake ended_up costing me £ 000in addition wages and was surprised that they would only refund delivery charge when i complained .
M	beware too when buying online .
F	inside it was all complete and intact and exactly_what i had hoped .
M	there is no incentive to return though as there is so much competition i believe that unless there is a change in either their pricing policy or offer an incentive scheme to repeat sellers then they will just be another company use once and disregard there after .
F	i '_m a uk 00 / 00 , when i tried it on it was really big and more like a 00 / 00 .
M	i took the car back - no_problems did it again .
F	the mazuma website was very clear in its instructions right from the word go when they advised how to locate the unique reference_number of my old phone in the screen display .
M	p - paypal , it is helpful that printerland accept_paypal
M	absolutely_brilliant service .
M	he had no notes whatsoever of the situation and was completely_clueless to anything that had been happening at all .
M	was online basically instantly , so simple to set_up .
F	update
F	found it impossible to find out what time they would be delivered - they didnt arrive until around 0 . 00 in the afternoon .
F	i ordered the cream version but received the black one .
M	how wrong was i ?
F	derby depot apparently put the items out for delivery on 0th_april and apparently put a card through the door .
M	having them cancel my tickets with less_than 0 months before holiday , and prices have gone up on all other_sites now is discusting .
F	when we rang to find out why we were told that it was delivered but no - one was in which is an outright lie - we were in all day practically sitting by the window waiting as it was that important to us !
F	the colours are great , the quality is very good and i will probably buy more of them .
F	i will certainly be purchasing my wedding_invitations from here as well .
F	!
M	the fire is for our elderly_mother as her old one broke 0 days before !
F	i had my furniture in 0_days with regular_updates / emails in between !
M	great overall service .
F	to my dismay the picture and text i had chosen for the cover was actually wrapped around front and back . this was not clear when i was choosing .
F	now 0_days_later ( 0 working_days ) i am still_waiting for my order .
M	i have some quite intricate patterns that on the product are barely a hairs thickness , absolutely amazing .
F	will be using golf_garb again .
F	not easy !
M	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
M	i would recommend this company to my friends ,
F	i can '_t_believe jd_sports treat their customers like this .
F	after messing up my order 0 times , i decided to ask for a refund , they now do not respond to any correspondence .
F	have sent loads of old_phones iv found or no_longer needed each time excelent service quick payment never let_me down have told others to use and will keep using myself
F	ordered some flowers online to be delivered next_day for a family birthday and they did not receive them till 0_days_later !!!!
M	good service backed_up with a one to one telephone contact .
F	i asked for a manager who was a lot more pleasant and said he understood and he would raise the issue again and explain that i need an answer in less_than 00 working_days as it is urgent , he also offered to credit me £_00 as a gesture .
M	would highly_recommend mazuma to anyone who has a phone to sell & will myself be using them again in the future .
M	my friend_suggested that i try the memory_foam mattress and after finding these competitively_priced at the memory_foam warehouse , i decided to try one .
M	delivery good disappointed with flowers looked cheap which they were not .
F	i was sent a text to say the delivery of flowers had been ' left ' in a secure_location ' even_though i had asked for them to be delivered personally .
M	it did not happen .
M	this section of their website does not work for me , despite me having changed my password about 00 times .
M	i ordered a flat_pack log store and it arrived on time with all components complete .
F	i was embarrassed when i went to visited my mother on the sunday due to the very poor quality of the blooms and the small size of the arrangement - i was expecting her to be wowed !
M	hardly secure delivery .
F	was very please and also when it was delivered the deliver guy brought it in to the house for me as it was to big and heavy for me to move or lift very satisfied and please with all_round thanks :)
M	i received the order promptl .
F	stud missing off the bottom with tape stuck across it so the fault was known before it was sent .
F	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !
F	the flowers were beauiful .
F	the service and delivery second to none .
M	i have had only first_class service , had a problem with my internet , open world responsibility utility_warehouse soon had it sorted can only speak as i find ,
M	fantastic company , great service and goods always arrive on time with a super tracking service .
F	however the member off staff arrived after the given times slot which was between half 0 and 0 .
M	suspect it would have been first thing in the morning if i lived in a city / town .
M	i was not happy .
M	back to tesco for me - the quality may be lacking but at_least you get to eat !
M	items as requested .
F	some people may be put off by the initial timescale 0 to 00 days , on this occasion i received my 0 pairs of glasses ( 0 being sunglasses ) within 0_days .
M	it was a blessing in disguise though , as i managed to get a better deal from another company for the very same day .
M	however the deal was excellent and with some help from the supplying dealer all turned_out well if 0_weeks late ,
F	i am now out of pocket and have no machine !
M	the delivery service is quick and in the number of times i have visited the site and ordered it has always been faultless .
M	worst experience ever_since i have recently decided to change suppliers .
M	received a confirmation_email on the 00 august advising me the my service will be up and running within 00 days , 0 september received my september bill for zero , tried to log_onto my account on the 0 september to get an update , could not log on so rang talk_talk and spent 00_minutes trying to explain i could not log on to my account , only to told i had a credit on my account of £_000 . 00 and my account had been deactivated ?
F	they have such a large range to choose from and the orders are sent out so quickly .
F	the price range was appropriate for a small gift and the delivery came when expected .
F	didnt_recieve items on day i was expecting was just sat in depot for few_days ( weather not an excuse ) also did not get any information about products arriving late or when i will be recieving the rest of what i had ordered ??
F	so i understand that not only are things hectic around that period but also the iflorist may have been closed for part of that time .
F	i would highly_recommend them .
F	otherwise there was an issue with one of the products i received but they refunded the faulty product without problems .
F	do not order from them .
F	once found we parked the car in local asda which only charged 0 pound for 0hrs .
M	i didn_'_t notice if there was an option to have discrete_packaging so if so i should have used that but it wasn_'_t obvious .
F	i would not_hesitate to recommend this company , i could not fault their service .
F	i got a text ( and an_email ) on tuesday ( less_than 00_hours_later ) to say our oven was now in stock so i rang and arranged for delivery on friday .
M	so , i eventually bought a 0 camera system ( bespoke , not a bundle ).
F	this flight was very well priced , but i felt like i was a farm animal cooped up in such a tiny seat with no room what so ever .
F	yeah , really handy .
F	good value for quality pet products and waa really impressed with how quickly my order was processed and delivered - great
M	no problem , delivered in two_days .
M	i would use them again for the quality but not for their service .
M	the site is ready to use , you have a choice of , 0 trip , annual europe or worldwide .
M	i didn_'_t try the ' restaurants ' as the prices were eye - watering .
F	we were impressed with the service and price of the medication .
M	i didn_'_t have any_problems with receiving my products either .
F	i found an old phone the other day and wanted to get_rid of it , but hare the idea of mindless waste and i knew that batteries have some sort of toxic chemical in them which is bad for landfills .
M	if you are thinking of ordering from very - don_'_t , their service is appalling !!!
F	we bought a complete bathroom_suite with taps , shower , radiator and shower_screen etc .
M	mvh
M	this really infuriated me as whoever printed this out should have known .
M	slow delivery slow delivery
M	the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful and gave a an exact description of the item .
M	pharmacy_0u offers the service that you would expect to receive from an online pharmacy .
F	delivery was speedy .
F	annoying that i had to stop booking to email customer for a tel no but otherwise fairly simple .
M	the truth is if i had of had the time recently i would have taken my claim further and may still do so .
M	diamondgeezer are different in that there is also the personal service at the end of the telephone line , no queue and wait for hours , and you can actually speak with the owner of the company and get his advice .
F	i was very disappointed that i would have to drive that car .
F	check - in slow , staff unhelpful we got trapped between some lorries and staff did nothing to help .
M	!
F	my tree arrived in good condition from the courier and didn_'_t look like it has_been bashed about in transport .
M	unfortunately some companies insist on using paypal which is linked to my credit_card anyway .
M	i have already_recommended this company to friends and i will use them again next time without_any hesitation .
F	i managed it but it would have been so much_better if they had done it for me
M	despite my constant questioning as to why it was not being published i never had any meaningful reply from ekomi .
M	i do reside in algeciras , in the very southern side of spain - dhl_express .
F	posted it the next_day .
F	the customer service was mediocre .
M	quidco is worth using for most of the offers / cashback available .
F	would use again , good price and fast delivery ,
F	i wanted two of an item and they said the second will follow in ten days due to stock_levels .
F	i was horrified , as i had actually bought them back within 0 hours of purchasing them , and the ' dirt ' he was referring too was the glue on the bottoms of the soles which were peeling slightly .
M	she didn_'_t return .
M	drivers cant be given instructions .
F	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer service number .
F	thanks o0 .
M	they wouldn_'_t even take refreshment after carting the furniture up four flights of steps as they where already thinking of there next delivery .

F	ordered a blind in an unusual size for my bathroom .
M	batteries required : 0
F	!
M	sent me the wrong_size and then didnt have the right one in stock .
F	0th_january_0000 : further update on my review :
F	i immediately phoned the customer service number - the girl i spoke to has such a strong_accent communication was difficult .
M	in that time , the company has_grown and has got greedy , increasing their charges and acquiring paypal to further increase profitability .
M	0 .
M	after losing a significant_amount of weight , nearly 0 stone i decided to celebrate by buying a superdry t - shirt as many of my friends wear them and i wanted to join the gang so to speak .
F	they didnt arrive .
F	most unstressful .
M	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
M	they looked awful in the photo_album i had purchased .
F	all in all not a very good start to the holiday , in a foreign_country with potentially no booking .
F	made out this was perfectly normal & would be a small cost to replace .
M	he gave my t - s '_s number for me to contact them .
M	several booked flights were cancelled due to bad_weather .
M	i bought the double football boot display_case for a rare victorian portable typewriter .
F	a small item was missing from the delivery and , not only was the telephone answered quickly , the gentleman i spoke to was extremely apologetic .
M	.
M	they are the perfect company to trust .
M	whilst ive installed 0gb my machine only sees 0gb , but this is also covered on the site when the order was made , if not i would have been worried id blown some chips etc .
M	how rude ?
M	luckily she seems to be getting the hang of potty training but we have found this product useless .
F	this was a little extra special valentine gift and ' little ' isn_'_t stressed enough !
M	the guitar ( after some_tlc ) is great but was very disappointed with how i received it .
M	. and still had no scooter .
F	the parrot seeds are excellent quality , though the package is paper based , this means the seeds could then get damp while been transported and this would mean problems .
F	expensive for returns .
F	would definitely use this company again !
F	the canvas came within 0_days of ordering , it was packaged well and the print quality is excellent .
M	the item arrived on time through a courier to my workplace and their after sales could not be_faulted when i had an issue with the set_up .
M	took files in , disc not accepted - bad
F	tooled_- up . com offered us plenty of choice and had the exact one we were looking for .
M	example offered a ' wowcher ' for garden games alleged rrp ( in fairyland maybe ) £_00 wowcher price £_00 ordered lawn snakes and ladders for the kids for summer .
M	ps
F	still no further response .
F	the correct ones have now arrived over a week_later .
M	secondly i feel that a 0day 00 hour manned breakdown telephone service is a reasonable expectation .
F	i dislike the way they don_'_t seem to care how animals have been treated before ending up on the shelves .
M	i only wish i could upload the picture i chosen compared to the one recieved
F	the item arrived very quickly .
M	a number of firms say they have stock but are telling little white lies , however complete_aquatics came to the rescue , on placing my order for my tank it arrived in south_yorkshire 00_hours_later ( well_done chris ) michael_o
F	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt on 00 / 00 /_0000
M	i don_'_t appreciate this as it '_s a waste of time an effort .
M	i ordered a knife sheath for £_00 of these thieving b ****** s and never received my sheath and they was not contactable so i never got my money back either .
M	i took the £_000 disconnection charge as quite_frankly , the service is not that good .
F	update_:
F	the outfit itself is also of very good quality and worth the money - my daughter is over the moon with it . and she will look great when she has it on on wednesday !!!
F	placing the order was easy !
M	car eventually ok wanted me to have a miicra i said i had booked 0 doors offered focus sized vehicle at extra_charge .
M	very poor communication between interparcel and ups .
M	best regards to everyone_involved .
M	i would much rather travel easyjet than ryanair anyday , but unfortunately their ' cheap as chips ' competitor seems to have the edge on providing the flying public with more destinations to the sun !
F	i am not sure how this could have been better advertised on your site but it would have been helpful .
F	!
M	ok its a transporter kombi and therefor a commercial vehicle but its also a sportline and we pay a premium for a sportline , as such i would have expected a better finish to the rear roof lining with a couple of half decent lights , side loading door capings would have been a nice_touch and maybe carrying the sportline finish through to the rear loading area and only speakers in the front doors !!
F	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
F	the fact that they ended_up costing c £_00 each was a bit_pricey .
F	delivery , cheapsmells is a must shop for you :-)
F	to date no call .
F	will certainly use this company again whenever we need new white goods .
F	please_avoid this company !
M	in either case , plenty of available tickets .
F	everytime i required a call back i was not called back until i chased it upwards of 0 times .
M	tyres were fitted at a local_garage at a time very convenient to me , and there was no hard_sell by them of any other services , much to my relief !
F	the optician said i had a very slight prescription and didn_'_t need glasses , but proceeded to try to sell me reading_glasses .
F	i ordered two dog gates and dpd was the company set to deliver .
F	wonderful customer service .
F	my parents arrived home to find flowers dumped on doorstep full_view of the road so not only did the flower sit in direct sunlight for a few hours it was fairly obvious to passers_by my parents were out .
M	expedia is a joke !
F	thank_you partyrama !
M	the company lived_up to its word and beyond their guarantee .
M	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
M	i contacted mr_memory to seek advise on upgrading my ram from 0gb to 0gb .
F	my sister mrs linda llewellyn , was very pleased with the flowers you delivered in cambridge road bexhill , on friday .
M	couldn_'_t deliver parcel that day .
F	she had received them ( lovely flowers ) but all she knew was that they were from the usa !!!!
M	if anyone has done this before will know how time_consuming but rewarding it can be .
M	happiness restored .
M	each_step seemed to take for ever .
F	as always service and price unbeatable .
M	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
F	everything was great from consultation to operation , but my only_concern was the lack of after care comunication , i had to call for checkups , my husband had to take time of work to travel from fife to dundee for my 00 minute appointments when there is an optical_express within 0 miles from my home and a bus journey i could have taken on my own .
F	i just cannot_fault them for their service .
F	on february 00nd i received confirmation of our booking from klm .
F	the whole_experience was ruined by a rude and obnoxious guide who even claimed to having owned the company !
F	i will not_hesitate to recommend your company to my friends and family , however , as i am not prone to make purchases over the internet in view of the size problems incurred will probably ' shop locally ' in the future .
M	ordered them , for a great price , with free delivery , and they were delivered within days !
F	would have no_qualms about dealing_with you again and no_problems recommending you .
M	!
M	i said no that was the only card i had .
M	registered my sale and then popped my phone ( wrapped in kitchen_roll in a small box ) into the freepost_bag that dropped through my door .
F	i wish i could review the product but i am still_awaiting delivery after 00 days .
M	restoring my diminishing faith with online purchases by providing excellent customer service .
F	the morning that my delivery was due i had a phone_call to say that it wouldn_'_t be delivered due to a ' corrupt file ' being sent to the delivery people !
F	very prompt delivery - easy returns ( the first trousers were too small !)
M	i didn_'_t have to pay anything extra at delivery time .
M	mixed review really but other than these points i '_m happy .
F	0_weeks on and i '_m now allowed to weight bear .
F	just what we were looking for
M	no response to email , ended_up having to phone to arrange the return .
F	i requested a new delivery address due to my time_constraints .
F	there are also indentations in the glazing on the reverse side of the plate .
F	their customer service staff have no clue .
F	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
M	( am i an adult or a child ?).
F	was horrified to find that two payments had been taken for my recent order to hungry_house , now yes e_- mail of apology sent to me explaining it would be back in my account in 0 working_days but i am on income support & on a very limited_budget so to treat_myself to a take away is a rarity and of real importance to me as in quality of food and service as i don_'_t have money to waste !!!
F	my niece said they were lovely & also liked the baby balloon .
M	!
F	i had to ask my husband to deal with the matter from offshore mozambique .
F	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
F	customer service dreadful - just automated_response .
F	the day went with ease and was enjoyable .
M	peter russell - blackburn ,. lancashire
M	there are some unscrupulous and irresponsible people out there who one would avoid dealing_with if one saw or knew them .
M	we heard_nothing for weeks and had to call them back .
F	having been a long time customer over 00 years and through all the changes having had 0 phones at once all linked to one account for my children , very quick to take the money but as soon as you have to contact them . long_waits on phone to get through months of waiting for issue to be resolved . no phone back on the 0 times promised !
F	going to order a lot more from misguided :-)
M	!
M	?
F	since then i have ordered 0 more times , for the money the shoes are great value , would recommend to anyone .
F	this is an unacceptable amount to take as a deposit for a two day rental !
M	a very nice place everything you would expect in a b_& b just the website did ' nt make it clear to me , that there was a price for room only and it was extra for breakfast , also it should be made clear that the final payment is cash only
F	one is tescos wine which never ever automatically shows up , drives me mad .
M	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
M	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
M	i subsequently purchased these items independently and they were promptly received .
F	tickets are always delivered on time and the process is hassle_free .
M	everything fine with product .
F	quick to take your money , slow to resolve a problem . or in this case not resolving anything at all .
M	i don_'_t think i ' d buy again from selections .
F	you couldn_'_t wish for a better experience .
F	!
F	would we use oliver sports again ?
F	it is very frustrating to have claims disputed , apparently at random .
M	could do better but otherwise fine
F	then the next_day i got an_email requesting a scanned_copy of the front of my credit_card and a scanned utility_bill , i wasn_'_t happy about providing this information and as they had already taken the money couldn_'_t see why i had to provide it , they wouldn_'_t send me the goods so i cancelled the order .
M	!
F	i will_definately recommend and use this service again
M	i rang them after 0 days and they answered with an excuse that the last of the stock was sold minutes before i had ordered , so they didn_'_t have time to update stock_levels .
M	to make it worse the item is still advertised as being available on the website .
M	good products at a good price fails on delivery - although its free 00 days is too long to wait for items to be delivered
F	i really like using topcashback but have been very disppointed lately when having spent over_£_000 on late rooms and £_000 on the trainline that my account has not been credited for these transactions .
F	they sent several gushing emails tracking the progress of my order which quite_frankly adds insult to injury .
M	the delevery service was first_rate .
M	many_thanks .
M	i ordered two battries one of which is completely dead , should i send it back it doesnt_seem worth while
M	our online order for 00 bottles of wine was due to be delivered 00th_december_0000 .
F	i requested that the hamper be delivered on 00 december .
F	i bought some flowers for my mums_birthday .
M	there is no tracking_system available to use which makes this even worse .
M	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
F	sucks that i spent the money on so called female seeds .
M	not happy with that , otherwise everything is good .
F	they were really good , i trusted them to deliver , had a really good choice of product and they sent an amazing sample_pack .
M	what a coincidence .
F	i ordered a bed for next_day delivery , but it didn_'_t arrive .
F	nice guy .
M	your fragrance company is simply second to none .
F	i would have no_doubt using this site again
M	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
F	great service and product .
F	so you end up paying extra fees in order to split the delivery and get the available items in 0 - 0_days and wait up 00 days for the remaining ones !
F	i kept thinking_about it as a significant birthday is coming and i thought - isn_'_t it time ?
M	they have had 0_weeks since they cancelled the order because they couldnt get it in stock and over a month since they first promised to deliver it .
M	if you read the economics paper ' a market for lemons ' you will see that this is occurring right across the internet , but massively so on ebay .
F	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
F	i was unable to park on my drive without moving the 00kg_sack again hurting my back .
M	i had also change the car_registration .
M	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid_questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .

M	be available till end of month but have been

F	not sure if they came or not but still no internet for 0_weeks .
M	would shop_here again .
M	ordered a nice phone for the wifes_birthday in plenty of time ( i thought ), advertised as being five in stock !
F	now both rooms are finished i have two a0 pages of things which are wrong ranging_from a top not being square on the chest of drawers to a shelf which was supposed to pull out being fixed as static .
M	i highly_recommend using anyvan . com to anyone looking to move anything , anywhere .
M	buyers pay none .
M	then what made it realy funny was i got a email at around 00pm at night saying your delivery will be here today between 00 . 00am - 00 . 00pm .
F	i looked every where for a phone - recycling company that accepted my phone but only envirofone was good enough !
M	it was nice that we could have breakfast opposite and there are near many restaurants located .
M	the wall_clock ordered arrived in good time , however i discovered that it was faulty in the fact that no batteries would start the clock .
F	the confirmation_email never arrived , although if i log in i can see my booking .
M	if the adverts don_'_t work they won_'_t advertise .
M	british_gas have the worst customer service in a company i have very come_across .
M	i subsequently took another picture and we went with this one .
F	:-) x
M	free polish and some zen advice on furniture arrangement might have crept my review to 0 / 0_stars , but is good service not just the standard ?
M	having previously gone for kingston as a reliable and reasonably - priced supplier of the parts i needed , i went straight back to them when i needed more of the same !
F	( which woke me up ).
M	very easy to use website for ordering , i did it so i would say idiot_proof .
M	e_- mails_informing_me of order & delivery status
F	we had the car for two_days and did very little mileage .
M	sure you can buy most of the titles they sell elsewhere ( steam / origin / uplay etc ), but they sometimes have good deals on that aren_'_t running on the other_sites , they '_ve nearly always got discount_vouchers , and you can even trade some of your games back in ( i think any that use gmg '_s " capsule " thingy )!
M	highly_recommended *****
M	the show was fantastic with great seats , but the travelodge in southwark was such a let_down !
F	i ordered the item and was kept_informed by email each_stage of my orders journey .
F	i found the service very straight_forward to use .
M	our vet was charging the earth for the prescription .
F	unacceptable when rival_companies do bank transfers within 0_days
F	i talked with freinds about your company and think , they will order something , too
F	after a hiccup with an item i tried to get on line - it suddenly disappeared !
F	the service was excellent and mum was over the moon with the flowers .

M	just a note to say that chess have been in touch again .
M	rubbish company
M	'' hi helen , posted a card through your letterbox and please look in the garage ''.
M	i only used them once online and that was more than enough for me .
M	very dissapointed by poor service .
F	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don_'_t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer service .
F	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it '_s not something i have to do ".
M	patience is needed to go through the free trials but ultimately the process was very easy , a gd optician called me to check details snd my 0 pairs of specs arrived earlier_than_anticipated .
M	i cannot understand_why this company charge so much .
F	so in summary , terrible customer service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
F	on receipt all items were navy !!!!!!
F	when i said i was not paying that and wanted a refund i was told i would still be charged_£_00 !
F	highly_recommended , thank_you so much .
M	brilliant items on sushisushi , with reasonable prices .
F	the software was easy to use and once completed delivery was prompt .
M	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
M	excellent communication , delivery as promised .
F	was then advised of the delay so was not delivered for father '_s day - very sad kids .
F	paid in good faith but no goods received !
M	shower_unit ordered last october ( price was good , could be a reason for that !).

M	booked & paid for a mobile appointment - received a call next_day to say we cant make it .
F	looked at a few pharmacy '_s and wildricks was not only the cheapest but gave a great service

M	when i phoned the 0000 000000 number the message said the opening_hours on a saturday were 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .

M	i tried to find german speakers in the hotel , but had no luck .
M	the service was spot on .
F	i now have to wait for the delivery guys to phone me to arrange some date in august .
M	this is totally_inappropriate as there is a lot of information on there which i don_'_t wish to share .
F	we then had no key to the room and had to be escourted to and from our room until the key was returned by the previous guest .
M	if you do get caught the tobbaconist sells maps
M	ordered twice_now for in store collection .
M	ended_up cancelling the order .
F	i will_continue to use & reccomend .
F	rang the gas_superstore who said they could not help or exchange the machine and i would have to go through siemens .
M	what i will say is that the helpdesk staff in india ( at_least i presume in india ?)
F	booked online and the confirmation_email didn_'_t come through .
M	bought a cannondale helmet far cheaper_than anywhere_else ( and with no p_&_p ).
M	incredible !

M	i bought a fully enclosed shower from them it cost over £ 0000 it had two doors when the plumbers were installing it they found they had sent two left doors i rang them uo and they said we will send you the right door in a couple of days so the plumbers came back a few_days_later to put the right door in and i had to pay them a extra £_000 for the extra visit i contacted b and q and after lots of phone_calls over many days i got £_000 back
F	the gift would not be delivered by friday as promised
M	no_problems ordering or communication but a delivery time of 00 days from order was too slow
M	it may only be £_00 but its a little_harsh to charge me for something , i can no_longer use .
M	i chose to wait .
F	they couldn_'_t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn_'_t helped the problem at all .
M	very quick , very professional service !
F	i ordered a dress on october 00th , it still has not arrived !
M	a week_later another was sent via a different carrier an it arrived th next_day .
F	after_spending hours on the phone and countless pounds added to my phone bill , i finally spoke to a manager who one minute said that i had not revived my order this time due to a system error , then it was a stock error , than a system error oh and yes you '_ve guessed it a stock error again .
M	before we left , all the staff were really friendly , chatting with all of us including our kids .
M	we are now in the second week of april and have not received our items .
F	the wheelchair was delivered on time .
M	but yet , three_days down the line and there was still no solution .
F	very impressed with the overall service provided - couldn_'_t quite believe_how quickly tyres_fitted !
M	i then asked_him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
F	excellent value and speedy delivery , wide_range of fragrances even hard to find in the high_street perfumes will_continue you use them for all of my fragrance needs
F	they will at every turn try and screw you .
M	:) :)
F	i ordered this on the 00th_aug and was not delivered till 0_days_later i know that your terms say 0 - 0 working_days but a lot of your competitors we use are next_day delivery .
M	i do not understand half of their promotional twaddle anyway , so i have no idea if i am missing out on offers and deals which might interest me .
F	later that same day they had checked the phone over and emailed to advise that my payment was on its way , which i received the very next_day .
M	previously used for washer_dryer - excellent also , aswell as microwave ( admit didn_'_t both with fitting on that one . lol )
M	wardrobe 0 ( sherwood oak ) was ok ( if you don_'_t mind screwing in 00 + wood screws ), but wardrobe 0 ( atlanta ) was a complete and protracted self - assembly job ( 00 screws to fix the back panel alone - come on guys !)
F	i printed my posting documents off one evening , sent my phone the next_day , received confirmation of the valuation given the next_day , and the following_day received my cheque !
M	i refused to pay for a mistake that they made and was told by a very rude member of there team that there would be an investigation and i would be contacted within 0 - 00 days !!.
F	no email , no call to notify_me .
F	after that , i contacted with the customer service , just minutes after the purchase , they decline to make any change .
M	great delivery and all that and good communication , but having looked at what we got - in the flesh - for the money we paid (!)
M	i wish they were all like this .
F	i had to phone to organise a return authorisation , which is only valid for 0_days and then cancelled if not received in this time .
F	no response to support ticket ( which is now dead ) or to numerous_emails .
F	they obviously did not arrive and felt annoyed that they should have been delivered so close to the noon deadline .
F	i have been using amazon for years .
F	i needed some information on a previously - supplied prescription and the answer came back immediately .
M	i '_m buying from it a few_times a month now . never had any_problems with products or service . love it so much that i '_m getting all my mates hooked on it too .
F	great communication_regarding despatch / delivery progress wld deffinitely use this service again .
M	guys are polite , knowledgeable and honest .
F	payment was made through paypal .
M	they missed the next_day delivery but did ring to warn me .
F	text to say received order , another to say left depot and finally another once delivered .
F	good quality items , prompt delivery , well_packaged , a very happy customer and more_importantly , a beautiful baby_girl '_s christening was a huge_success !
F	the site tells you how to measure simply and the colour and fabric choices are great .
F	delivered promptly , packaged well , excellent quality product at a good price - who could ask for more ?
M	went like_clockwork and arrived in good condition .
M	never again :-(
M	bought some flowers as a gift and although they were happy with them , i wasn_'_t .
M	rhys lloyd
F	leased a car with all car_leasing .
F	i ordered set of furniture , and when the delivery did not arrive , i called and i was told it had not left the depot .
M	i have now booked myself a little trip away for me and the missus and will enjoy that money .
F	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
F	!, as i said there was nothing unusual about my choice of flowers .
F	my vision fluctuates constantly and although i am told i have 00 / 00 vision , this does not mean the same as perfect vision as i was led to believe pre_- lasik .
M	would use again .
F	i am glad to say i was not disappointed !
M	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has_gone now .
F	whatever your fancy your guaranteed privacy of delivery , you would never guess_what was in the box !!
M	received email confirmation re registration and clicked to activate .
F	bought the hoodie for my husband for xmas , 0 washes on 00 and the stitching is coming apart so not_overly_impressed .
F	it took around 00 days for the order to arrive despite saying on the website it was in stock .
F	frames are horrible and uncomfortable .
F	thank_you simply_supplements , they are very affordable .
M	no_complaints , very good .
M	you made a full_refund which was speedily done so no_problems there but you order form should state if the item is out of stock at the time of purchase .
M	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
M	economy service is too slow can take up to 00 days
M	will use you again
M	the second pair i ordered at 00pm in the afternoon , they came at 0 - 00 am the next_morning .
F	i have 0 young_children and needed the sideboard in place when they came back from nursery so had to remove from the packaging and manoeuvre onto its feet on my own !
M	would return again in the future .
M	they didn_'_t even consider my troubles and now i have been left with a dud machine that cost £_000 !!!
F	see you next year !!
M	it '_s as if someone was jumping up and down on it .
M	we live in a fairly large apartment with carpet , ceramic tiles and " karndean " type flooring and it handles them all with ease .
F	not sure i have recorded every e_mail and telephone contact but here goes .
M	i chose hermes , but they appeared not to deliver anything above 0kg .
M	by , and on march 0th , nothing had appeared ( a present for the wife ).
M	as expected shiply have challenged this review again , surely it would be better to sort problems out rather_than trying to hide them
M	emails have been sent to customer service and i '_m still_waiting for a reply .
M	in the past i '_ve found renfe and sncf sites tricky .
M	highly_recommended .
M	great for all_round experience
F	after 0 emails , and no sign of them wanting or needing my business . i left their site .
F	i '_m not saying there '_s anything wrong with the procedure however if i had been told there was a very real possibility of suffering from side_effects instead of being told they ' re very rare and effect few individuals i doubt whether i '_d have gone ahead with the procedure .
F	i sent an e_mail on that day explaining the issues .
F	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn_'_t been sent out for delivery ?
F	second time for using aol , both experiences have been 0st_class , well_done .
M	just had a call to say no stock and none in country , also no idea when it will be available .
M	ebay has_been destroyed by us all i guess as we buy from the cheapest seller , but for sure it at the moment is the place to buy tatty , damaged , not as_described , slowly posted junk , combined with zero or pathetic customer_support .
M	bought from here before .
M	i can not right a review as iam still_waiting for my order
F	there was no need to pack in such a large box and trying to unpack it was a task in itself , it took 00_minutes to get into packaging and a few broken nails !!
M	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
M	highly_recommended .
M	everything has_been easy to use and given exceptional results every time .
M	waste of 00 quid !
F	since the panda update in 0000 the website has dropped dramatically into oblivion , google webmaster gave a warning about the detection of paid - for links .
F	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
M	the staff at the national centre in orpington were very courteous & professional , an excellant service ( especially the young_man who changed my tyres , everything was done by the book & he was happy to swap my wheels around for me too ).
F	i feel 0_star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r_us , or babies r_us .
F	why did this happen ?
M	other than that , a good price and at_least they kept me informed .
M	0 to 0 working_days quoted for delivery , item still not here 0 days after ordering .
F	customer service excellent from a guy called steve .
F	i ordered flowers which were delivered to the wrong_address so the intended_recipient did not receive them , your customer service team have taken a week to respond which the response is quite_frankly a joke and still no apology i will not be recommending and taking this further !
F	will definitely be using oak_furniture_land again !
M	only to find later they became_available cancelled a 0 bed apartment with low_cost to get the accomidation i wanted with low_cost charged me !!
F	because i never got a confirmation_email the first i knew if the beanbag being the wrong_colour was when it turned_up .
M	thanks you guys !
M	i don_'_t plan to use the top secret hotel again .
F	arrived promptly .
M	purchased item on line
F	all resolved now and i am really happy .
F	!
F	what more could any one want ?
F	0_days after_placing the order and i haven_'_t received my item , but i did receive an invitation to review my buying experience !
M	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
F	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
F	i didn_'_t , as it got mis sorted and went to a different depot !
M	£_00 .
F	send this free card and when it arrived at the other end , it just turned_out to be a blank red screen with happy xmas from aldi on it .
M	for an online business to be a success it needs to be more effective than wiggle , nobody is that bothered they don_'_t / wont answer the phone if at_least they are responsive to electronic communications - but unfortunately they are not .
M	!
M	i ordered a set of pedals on sunday_night and they were delivered free on tuesday_morning . what more can you ask for ?
F	i received the memory_card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
F	love the website , and love ecco_shoes , but what you fail to understand is that people in general do not have ' standard ' feet .
F	the dog bed cover is very nice but overall this was a real pain
M	i found the website through yahoo search_engine .
F	i liked the fact that i didn_'_t have to do any of the finding out it was done for me .
M	nevertheless i spend one hour sorting_out ( transposing 0 characters in one name ) the issue but could not manage that , so i contacted the flight companies directly .
M	!,
M	meats are great quality and have used a few_times but there was a missing item this time which was annoying .
M	simple , easy to navigate site .
M	quick service , great price and great price
F	it '_s fast and very good with their communication .
M	i took my car to a local rc hobby instead at the weekend & he said my buggy was set_up all wrong and would not run like that .
F	second time i actually rang to check delivery and was told approx 0_weeks .
F	you '_d be better off with an ordinary box of chocolates .
M	also it costs a fortune .
M	i needed to contact hifx re my client number , was dealt_with efficiently and politely making the experience pleasurable , as was my previous_experiences .
M	we shopped_around for the best price but wanted a top quality product which would add a wow_factor to our kitchen .
F	so thank_you all especially sarah_jane and peter ( who have told us if we have any_problems to get in touch with them .
M	their p_&_p was about £ 0 first_class post sds site said postage free until you got the order half placed when they added double the other site .
M	refunds against this transaction
M	!
F	excellent service very quick free delivery & very good price
F	on all three blinds , we are having trouble with the pulleys putting the blinds up and down .
F	all this link did was take me back to their website .
F	all booked and confirmed and paid £_000 for flights and extras with hotel to be paid on arrival .
F	the delivery men left it outside my home and i had to carry it all single_handed , one of the boxes was 00kgs .
F	they said phone was in stock when i ordered it and quite clearly it was not in stock which i discovered when i made my first chase_up call as her reason for me not having the phone yet was completely_different i . e .
F	0 pairs of gorgeous frames plus lenses cost no more than a meal for two in my local_pub .
F	will definitely use this site again .
F	i waited a whole 00 days and then wasn_'_t in when delivery made , items left with neighbour which was fine but no contact info for delivery person - was wanting to order more items and also see what he had with him as i understand you can buy on doorstep .
F	next_day , new stand arrived as promised but also with another company '_s delivery .
M	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
M	they have gone out of their way to make_sure they can get me the best stuff , at the best price and at the time i need .
F	very quick and good quality
F	this is not only my experience but that of many other dissatisfied learmont customers that i have spoken to .
M	when i check online in my account , it says " order pending ".
M	i have suffered 0 months of stress with this , i believe that the one star_rating was far higher_than i would have given if possible , i seriously doubt that i will ever have anything to do with i - florist and would_gladly have never had anything to do with them again until i was sent this .
F	key_solutions were our answer to the problem of dwindling savings .
F	first_class from_start to finish , down to placing my order and the help i received because i had made a mistake and was helped through it by your staff , to receiving the finished item which was beyond what i had expected , it was fantastic and i will recommend you to anyone and will be a great idea for a few christmas_presents next year .
M	returned car to the aorpprt on day 0 after tire shop could not repair tire . sidewall puncture . no_hassle exchange and now we are in a nissan versa just like mine but this one has a low tire pressure indicator all lit_up . been there . bought the t - shirt . so we stopped every two_days to add air . uneventful were it not for the frequent pit stops .
M	he said no problem .
F	the pool was relatively new and well_maintained and the garden had 0 sun_loungers and 0 parasols .
M	would be 0_star_review if it had been on time .
M	delivered by dpd with excellent real time tracking_info .
F	especailly , now that the evenings are dark .
F	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
M	!!
F	delivery time agreed with order not met , flowers still not delivered on the following_day .
M	received the product 0 working_days after ordering .
F	), have already_recommended to friends and family .
M	buy with complete_confidence .
F	seems misleading and not very ethical .
F	the product is so good that i buy from simply a supplement it helping my son to concentrate in claa
M	what a rip_off .
F	fantastic order was delivered exactly the time that was stated
M	you have a monopoly on the islands , and you abuse it to the utmost extent !!!!
F	i '_m cancelling my direct_debit and writing to my mp as this is the worst customer service ever .
F	he said that he would contact the warehouse and call me back .
F	this is now looking decidedly unlikely .
M	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .
F	next time we will know and leave more time , the depot is over 0 kilometres away from the airport and if they have people to drop at the airport they do that then pick_up those arriving .
M	0 their app developer doesn_'_t pay attention to detail
F	!
F	emailed and no reply ,,
M	fast , excellent service from the " off ", and will_continue to do_business with ecigzoo .
F	am still battling with this rotten company - do not buy anything from comfy_living - who are a disgrace .
F	fabulous organisation and professionally run
F	service was brilliant , the fella i spoke to was very knowledgeable , delivery was super_fast with tracking_information sent to me .
M	problems are lack of information no calls returned and worse misinformation .
M	finally , she was initially reluctant to call our nanny / housekeeper - she initially asked if i would do it - and then she acquiesed at my ' insistence '.
M	". i could not soeak to a person !
F	i have ordered from the site before ( different town ) and not had this problem .
M	i had a problem with 0 orders not being delivered last_week and as a result as a goodwill_gesture i was to have a bunch of flowers delivered on monday 0nd .
M	i find bodybuilding_warehouse are cheap but the thing i like best is when you order
F	the only_thing i '_d love to see improved is if there was always a direct link to a hotel / b_& b '_s website right from the review page -- it '_d be so easy to click over .
F	stressful journey to nearest petrol_station .
F	the website has a tracking_facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn_'_t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
M	it was a really lengthy process and i whilst i would recommend you to people who could_afford to wait longer , as you pay slightly_higher amounts overall ( not always ), if they want their money quicker and are prepared to forgo a few_quid , i would recommend they use webuydvd who '_s two cheques were with me before you had even finished processing my first order and they were collected only 0 day before yours . so 0_stars from me .
F	got an_email on monday to say they had tried to call me on friday ( turns_out they decided to use a different number no_longer in use - why ?).
F	luckily we checked it the day following delivery but beware , the company '_s terms and conditions say that if you don_'_t notify them of damage within 0_days of delivery they won_'_t replace / sort_out .
F	the flowers were lovely and my relative was so pleased with them !
F	got this for son for christmas .
M	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .
F	i would seriously recommend not using them .
F	has a good range of products which are the same brands at better prices .
M	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
F	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et_de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
M	the email that tells you your order is in the laboratory and be ready in 0 to 0 days is overly optimistic .
F	also the outfit was a little_pricey and i felt if i had more time i could have researched in to cheaper options .
M	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar_sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
M	the sticky pads on the end of the supports are useless and i had to buy suitable replacements .
M	after choosing the best printer for my requirements the delivery was the very next_day !
M	i particularly like the recommended tyre choice where i can only imagine tyreshopper get a great deal by bulk buying and passing on the savings to the customer and quite often prestige marques at good prices .
F	i have suffered from a lower back problem for many_years and was advised by the staff to try the different rated mattresses , which i did .
F	i was kept_informed about the delivery process and given the option to change the delivery date .
M	both card were called 00 money and supposedly are a debit_card .
F	best part is it is convenient - i don_'_t have time to search dozens of sites to find the best company .
M	good value though .
F	i asked the reason for the change , & told it was made by the airport .
F	i reckon i got a great deal more than i paid for .
F	cheque arrived the next_day .
F	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
M	often now lowest_price means general lower standards .
F	also note that when you purchase tickets on this website they do not disclose the face value of the purchased tickets .
M	might be cheaper to stick an ad in the local rag .
F	i recently brought a pair of bryan adams tickets ( 0000000 ) for the concert on monday for my partners_birthday .
F	coffee so far has_proved ok but havent tried all different_kinds yet .
M	skal jeg beskrive dem med ett ord vil det i såfall bli søppelfirma !!!!
M	i got fat burning stackers n the the 000 thermo pills had some split n the powder out of them is every where but all other stuff i got is in good order many_thanks jamie
M	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
F	based on my experience i will definitely be ordering from sportbikeshop again and recommending it to my freinds .
M	the customer service was good and the item was delivered on time and was exactly as_described .
M	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek '_s way of doing things .
F	dreadful doesn_'_t cover it .
M	i contacted dover00 the following_day by phone , which was answered immediately , and explained the problem .
F	i couldn_'_t find what i was looking for in the uk but ambiente had one at a much_better price and i also had a reduction for signing_up .
M	the model i initially ordered was no_longer available and they offered me the newest one at the same ( very good ) price .
M	myprotein offers good , honest advice about their products and they are very good value for money .
M	cons_: item ( cistern lid ) had a manufacturing_fault , need a new lid , awaiting feedback from customer service team .
M	seed spuds ordered 0rd may , 0 complaint emails , ignored by them , and 0 phone_call of 0 , after 0_weeks , yes 0 , second phone_call actually checked up on my order , then tells_me they ran_out , and the order had been cancelled .
F	the people at my old address say they gave not received the item and royal_mail say the parcel has_been delivered so i an left to pay a bill for something i '_ve not received when contacting violet they said it was because my old address had not been delegated off their web_site so they can not take_responsibility funny how they have previously sent orders to my new address not happy will not use violet again
M	trondirect
F	this has_been the best service i have received from a company in a long time .
M	the order arrived 0 days_later and now my new doors and handles are up and looking great .
F	i would place an order with animed again in the future .
M	just remember to keep all fingers clear , ( personal experience , lesson_learned ).
F	it arrived inside a box with lots of protective semi rigid paper packing around it so that it didn_'_t move and was well_protected , result is that it arrived undamaged in good condition and nicely presentable for a christmas gift .
F	i had non_stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot_speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
M	you will not regret using the store and find yourself coming_back again and again !
M	i rang them and got straight through to a lovely geordie chap , who sent me out a new tray next - day .
M	keep_up the good work !
M	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
F	massive problem with this is i will loose money if i re sell the tickets and when i check the tickets i brought ( even_though they told me they had sold out !!)
F	avoid this company at all costs .
F	eyecatching in our front_garden .
F	i was very impressed with the service , my sewing_machine arrived within 00_hours , i was given clear advice as to the time of the delivery .
M	comms were excellent too and delivered in good time .
F	being hard to contact suggests to customers that there is something dishonest going on .
F	trees arrived in good order - great
M	recommended .
M	first_class service !
F	the work was carried_out , and i was charged almost £_000 in total .
M	this was ok as the delivery details on the site state 0nd_class recorded however it would have been nice if they had been sent 0st_class to make up for the time loss but this is only a little_niggle .
M	by the way their staff have been indoctrinated into_believing its ok to do this .
F	i saw on " all my shoes " that rubbersole were offering a 00_%_discount on all orders over_£_000 .
M	put me in touch with a no win no fee solicitor , who came to my home to help me go through things and took all the pressure off me and handled everything for me keeping_me informed
F	quick , efficient service from the time we ordered until delivery .
F	i ordered my vitamins online after checking a lot of other_sites that i usually use .
F	!
M	i would recommend your ramps to anyone with need to gain disabled access .
M	i ordered two identical items which two_weeks_later were still outstanding .
F	i phoned immediately upon realising that it wasn_'_t a meet and greet and was told to email and they would cancel it from their system .
F	some of the leaves were torn and 0 of the roses was not looking healthy ( died after just half a day out of the box ).
M	went to their web_site , and there , bold as brass were the words all of our 0000 stock has_been sold out , so they take your money , and if they happen to run out of what you ordered , they just bank your money , and you my friend , can proverbially whistle .
M	the whole buying experience from beginning to end was unparalled from the informative reviews and detailled product information to the check out process and the order status_updates via_email .
M	as a bonus , the price was the lowest we found .
F	eventually they agreed to refund the total .
M	ordered birthday card 0 days before my sons_birthday still has not arrived 0 days after his_birthday .
M	a frustration whilst on holiday was that i could not check my account balance from my android tab in the hotel as it requires flash_player ( not supported on android ). this was a bit of a pain as i had no idea how much credit i had left on my card !
M	the flowers were very easy to order came on time they were just smaller than_expected but for the cost they were fine and my wife liked them abd they were for our 00th_wedding_anniversary would order again
F	unfortunately i was really disappointed in the quality of the sash i ordered .
F	as soon as we had booked we were given the full itinery with accommodation which we checked on websites and they were all great ( except one , which we knew was going to be " iffy " but we were staying in the middle of nowhere and we stayed in 00 different hotels throughout our trip ).
M	tickettree were very helpful and were always able to answer our questions .
M	you '_ve missed the point of what i am talking_about - i believe they did meet your condition criteria , otherwise i wouldn_'_t have sent them .
M	asked for a copy invoice mailing and she did this immediately .
M	bought the rucksack arrived before the weekend so that i could give a work out on the saturday .
M	well , i '_m collecting a jukebox from essex back to somerset & for that sort of delicate thing i did decide to do it myself , perhaps wrongly .
M	ordering is easy , communication of order progress is top_notch and orders arrive quickly - this is how an online shop should be run !
F	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
F	this was a stay in the middle of a longer one so , it was impossible to cancel altogether .
M	as always delivery good but disappointed with the flowers .
F	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .
M	the control ring design is very poor , it is loose and dosen '_t always do what you wnat it to do .
F	so i have paid the same for less this meaning i have ended_up paying the same for a lesser_amount this is not what your substitute service offer states .
F	very efficient .
F	!
F	gsf fail .
M	a great selection of product and seems to be the best prices online .
F	ordering online was easy and prices were great .
M	on the latest occasion i showed them a car that was in wonderful condition for its age / mileage .
F	ordered 0 cookers on a special price deal .
M	eventually i got an email_saying they were trying to track down order .
F	upon our return , just a quick phone_call , picked_up within 00_minutes ( and that '_s only because of major road works outside the airport !)
M	used rentalcars a few_times now and had occasion to call them on the phone .
F	was very impressed as the usually nightmarish procedure of organising life cover was made quite simple .
F	as my order hadnt been processed there was no problem to cancel the order .
M	is this a joke ??!
M	we had to get flights home the cheapest and quickest way possible .
F	they were all thrown in a plastic_bag , in a ball and knotted together .
M	they promised to call back many_times and never did .
F	these goods were worth well over_£_00 .
M	what gullible people we are . why is it allowed ?
F	it was easy to process and everything was so quick .
M	called the hotel to check_availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
F	service was fab and arrived well before the expected delivery date .
F	can , t_believe_how quick and easy mazuma makes it to sell your phone . they definatley offer the best price , you can track your phone through the post and money_deposited straight_into your account on arrival , i will_definatley use this service again
M	very hard to fault this ' can do ' company !
M	i was told it was in stock and there wouldn_'_t be any problem .
F	the prices can change whilst you ' re in the middle of ordering and it '_s rather annoying if you don_'_t pay attention all the time .
F	i had an_email when i first sold the phone saying my envelope was on its way and to send the phone by a certain_date to ensure my price bla_bla_bla .
M	he cheered up when we agreed the deal but then told us that buying a mazda 0 meant we were having a mid - life crisis - which we did not want to hear .
F	also very good value for money , unlimited_calls for less_than $_00 . 00 per_month or just pay as you go .
F	my partner also too the men '_s vitamins and had no_issues .
F	website was excellent .
M	we are well pleased and we will recommend you to anyone_wanting similar goods .
F	the main_reason is the packing .
M	delivered on time and efficiently , but my laptop ( samsung r000 ) is functioning slowly
M	can '_t fault the price or service .
M	very desappointing customer service .
M	i have still not resolved the overcharging with this company , calling their phone help and u will lose the will to live .
F	never ever again !!!!!
M	excellent helpful and efficient service ,
M	i found it to be in " as good as new " condition with no discernible wear , excellent battery_life and fantastic key board .
F	iphone_unlocked with no_problems .
F	the room was clean but very drab .
M	very easy to use website with very competitive_prices to meet all your t00 needs .
F	i ordered two velux type window blinds and a roller_blind for a normal window .
M	the dashboard display in german indicated that a safety lock system had come on and that i should consult the handbook .
M	i can '_t recommend the company highly_enough .
M	argos refuse to help me , i only want to replace my kitchen_doors .
F	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
F	con men send you through with order then once they '_ve got ya bank details take 000 . 00 pounds off you without telling you first
M	many_thanks mazuma
F	thank_you , you have made it easy .
F	they will take your money and if you have any issue then they will not assist .
M	their customer service even tried to tell me the delivery date was set to a later date , and referred to the original email that showed the earlier date .
F	i couldn_'_t add a photo to the card , so i went back and changed the card to one that doesn_'_t need to be personalised with a photo but there was no way to write in the card and no opportunity to review what the card said before payment .
M	after waiting a few_days and no arrival i logged on to my account to check the order status and for the second time my order has_been cancelled without informing_me .
M	i am now using offtek to upgrade my companies computers .
F	very bad service !!!
M	my order arrived in 0 parts 0 day apart .
F	great value for money and products arrived really speedily but i was a bit disappointed by the packaging .
M	they have not responded to my email message requesting a cancellation of my order and a refund yet .
M	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot . moved to o0 .
F	i have used cewe_books before to showcase my wedding work ( we are a florist )- and have always been overjoyed with the results .
F	i wish i had done it sooner , the amount of money spent on contact_lenses and glasses over the years would have more than paid for the surgery .
M	customer service was unanswered and overall i would not use again nor advise anyone i knew to consider doing so .
F	if you place an order with them , do not expect to receive anything .
F	i would recommend refresh_cartridges and i will definitely use them again .
M	these catalogu companies offer credit to the uncredible and then charge 00 . 0 % interest . why ?
M	all the food has_been tasty and fantastic value for money .
M	very well_packaged , great price , fantastic service .
F	looking for extra christmas items for son , excellent choice & price . will_definately use again
M	anime provided a reasonable service hence three stars .
M	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
F	the only draw_back was i needed to ask friends to do the viewings , as i was unable to . the one thing i did find difficult was not having a named person / persons who i could talk to with out repeating myself .
F	i placed an order on 00st_december and only when i received the confirmation_email was it clear that the order wouldn_'_t be processed until 0th_january despite my card being charged .
F	after i had stopped laughing and told him that we would not be boarding the coach 0 hours before flight time and to expect us not to be at the pick_up point unless they were willing to be more sensible about the transfer , he hung_up on me .
F	when we arrived the information on their computer had us picking the car up at 00 . 00_hours .
F	well_done green and easy .
F	the third and final time they came i was luckily in a led the beleaguered driver to the obvious wood shed to retrieve the trousers - he claimed he had no information about an_alternative collection_point or that the company was meant to txt the delivery day .
F	thanks .
F	really wish i had stayed at home as an_hour and a half in amsterdam seemed pointless if it wasnt for being on the boat for 00_hours and wanting some fresh_air i wouldnt have bothered getting off the boat .
F	really helpful when i need to change something .
F	i eel that they value your custom
F	response from janet in customer_care team advising that she would check with dispatch team and get back to me .
F	mazuma_mobile was great to deal with .
M	i would definitely recommend these to anybody .
F	couriers are , in my experience , put on this earth to make getting a parcel needlessly difficult .
M	i have used the garage in the past and will use the garage again in the future for fitting tyres , mot " s , servicing and general problems .
M	re - delivery should have been on friday 00th but didn_'_t ' happen , waited in all day .
M	apart_from that it was of nice quality .
M	however , this was and is a totally_unsatisfactory way of dealing_with a customer , they were just not interested in meeting my timescale for things even_though the goods they supplied where not fit for purpose !!
M	website should be more clear in usd .
M	images online were accurate .
F	certain clients of theirs don_'_t pay cash , only love to shop vouchers , which can be refused due to terms and conditions .
M	the did everything these promised .
M	i would use again .
M	as soon as they got hold of it , they adjusted it to the right size and immediately sent it with a next_day delivery , which came first thing in the morning .
F	i have used this site for many_years_now and have always had an excellent service .
M	this is not a problem but i didn_'_t recieve my parcel for four days !
M	we had to wait a long time , which was difficult for my wife , as she is disabled .
M	i have also not been sent a email or a text regarding this order
M	.
M	their phone is never answered and it takes days to get even a simple response ( although not a particularly helpful one ).
M	i contacted them and i had to send a couple of photos to prove what i was saying was true .
F	my husband was very satisfied with the jacket i bought him it fitted really lovely , he would like a waste coat to go with it so i told him he would have to wait just a little while , but i will get him one as he dose not ask for much and he spoils me rotten .
F	!
F	mazuma each time quick and fast have recommended to friends and family and will use again
F	so i am out of pocket twice over .
F	disappointingly it turned_out this was an internet only product ( i didn_'_t spot anything which said that ) and the assistant i spoke to was quite offhand about it (" we don_'_t have the room to stock everything ") even_though i '_d made the trip specially .
F	i have bought a lot of flowers from prestige before they are always nice and delivered as promised
F	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0_days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
F	it was supposed to be delivered on the 00th of september as per what the online ordering system was telling_me , but did not arrive until the 00st of september .
M	wonderful tasting chocolate at a reasonable price .
M	sorry but most disappointed
F	they sent it on the estimated delivery date , and the desktop computer is exactly_what i wanted so no real issues with it , regarding quality it '_s perfect and couldn_'_t be better .
F	only_slight_problem was that , following booking on the internet , email_confirmation did not come through .
F	!
M	good website with ample choice .
M	and it '_s not always because they are the cheapest .
F	we would stay here again as it '_s the only villa with wheelchair access which we need .
M	great service and communications .
M	update monday 00th_september 0000hrs
F	very professional service .
M	thanks
M	from_start to cheque in the bank in three_days .
F	i thought she could accept cash , so i then had to use the internet on my phone to transfer money onto the card .
F	checked with my collect_plus store to find out why goods had been refused to find out that no deliveries had been attempted in my name !
F	they snootily pointed_out that the small_print says they can '_t guarantee delivery on the specified day .
F	whole_process was long_winded i was asked to provide information which i had previously given ,
F	!
M	upon_opening the packaging whilst away ( very nice bags for the shorts ) i soon realised that one pair was smaller than the other .
M	get all your printing done here , as well as other goodies .
F	as it was christmas allowed until january and checked tracking again .
M	i liked the item i bought and was happy with the price but i paid 0 . 00 for next_day delivery .
M	as for the pc everything i had asked for was present and working like a dream , good quality parts , and the pc is a beast and destroys anything i throw at it .
M	this was my first experience with ffx - i was advised goods had been despached - this morning i received an email to say the courier had been unable to deliver yesterday - yet i was in all day - they asked me to call a telephone_number and quote a reference from the card they had left - they did not leave a card - the telephone_number is 000_% automated , so i could not even speak to any one about the shipment - if i don_'_t leave the card out for collection , they say they will not re - deliver - totally_unsatisfactory and how do i get my goods ?
M	i was greeted_by an un helpful and unprofessional gentleman_who was not interested in helping_me .
F	very prompt delivery .
M	first offering had an illegal bald tyre on the rear and the second no aerial so no radio reception .
F	if you require emergency advice at any other times please contact your local electricity distributor ”
M	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
F	the only_thing i would say is that normal postage only covers you for £_00 ish if your handset goes missing , and as my handset was worth more than double that i paid for special delivery at £ 0 . 00 , this wasn_'_t made clear to me but i didn_'_t mind_paying it .
F	the ordering process was very simple and delivery first_class .
M	i felt bad constantly pressing no because there was not really any reason to pay extra , so that got a little annoying that it was asked for every time .
M	no - one in their right mind is going to buy 0 prascend tablet at 00pence !
F	i advise everyone out there not to deal with this company or with [_name_removed ].
F	the delivery driver was awful full bettled the door ( middle if afternoon + its main door , was no need ) near enough threw potty box at me .
M	anyway ordered glasses found if logged back into website and account you can track how things are going .
M	so ordered £_00 worth of goods over a month_ago and money took out of my account immediately .
F	i got shoes within_00hrs after purchase on - line - excellent - without even have to pay for postage - it was free with item i bought .
M	when you reviewed my phone and i agreed the price it took a further 0 days for you to send payment , which then took 0 days to clear .
F	!
M	very happy with my mats 000_% good quality and good delivery
M	i will_definitely buy from this department store again and would recommend anyone to give them a try .!!
M	they are clearly genuine but the only thing i expected them to come in was full retail packaging as stated instead of just being in the plastic holding band that all apple leads come in .
F	we are really happy with the work and recovery , but think the customer service made it all seem a little weird .
M	had it fixed elsewhere .
M	read the mixed_reviews so took a punt . big_mistake !
M	i have had no reply from any of these systems .
M	i have made 0 orders to just poles in the last month .
F	once the correct items arrived i was told i that most of the parts did not come with the product and i had to order separately .
M	called one last time to speak to with a manager in customer service - after holding for another 00 + minutes , spoke to someone_who couldn_'_t help as " no manager was available ."
F	great website with great communication but your courier has ensured i will not buy from you again .
M	many_thanks for your quick and safe despatch of both the model 0 / 00th bus and the paints .
M	happy customer
F	most of them were competitively_priced with the uk market as you would expect , one of the items was expensive though (£_00 . 00 for some nail_varnishes ) so my total order was £_00 . 00 for five items .
M	the next_day a friend of mine , could pick_up the car after all , but there where no more cars available . how is this possible , my car should still be there .
F	i couldn_'_t go so my other half took my car through and when he got there he was told that the other 0 tyres that were waiting for me , had been sold yesterday , so they had to wait for a delivery before they could fit them . my car is still there waiting to have them fitted .
M	amigo_loans in my option should review this process .
M	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
M	all in all an excellent service the only thing that could be better is a wider_range of electricians test and installation equipment .
F	alas , that did not happen - ordered on a wednesday ( evening ), delivery scheduled for following_tuesday which is not ideal .
M	we couldn_'_t complain with any of the staff and we had great customer service throughout .
M	never , ever again .
F	delivery collected mon 00 . 00 delivered to my parents in remote_area of france weds 00 . 00 , absolutely excellent service , drivers very friendly .
M	i recently tried to buy shocks for the m - sport variant of an bmw e00 .
F	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
M	i have ordered several_times .
M	i won_'_t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
M	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
M	happily no damage .
F	service very good came within_0days :-)
M	recieved my sg gibson_guitar with no faults or problems and it sounds great .
F	we ' assumed ' that the door would turn_up as requested as we all heard him say black etc , as you would .
F	no chocolates .
M	eventually the rollers were on the door and eventually it worked .
F	new appt made and this time excellent service and all done with satisfaction .
F	needless to say i have asked for a refund which i am told will take 0 week .
F	but to give credit to get me in , they did respond to this post and sent me further emails_confirming exactly where the tickets were , and have since apologised for the delay .
F	they don_'_t answer emails and it '_s takes at_least 00_minutes to get through to someone on the phone .
M	ordered from gap .
F	the 00v tv was dispatched by courier the same day i ordered and arrived next_day ( free delivery ).
F	very easy to do had payment within 0_weeks good communication
M	a lot of the products i can not get in the local_diy_stores such as button polish .
M	excellent service thanks very much .
F	i was sent the wrong sim_card 0 times so couldn_'_t use the phone for 0_weeks !
F	when you ask if their customers do read these before ordering , the response i had was " of course not "!
F	i wont_be buying from cheap_smells again , the size of the bottle is ridiculous , the ck 0 looked like a free sample in a plastic bottle .
M	this is not good enough , previously i have found that i got excellent print quality along with large print numbers using the cartridges supplied by you but with this last batch , order number cs000000 - lv000000 the cartridges appeared to be incorrectly filled .
M	i contacted travel_republic from work but the operator wouldn_'_t speak to me for data_protection reasons as the card was in my husband '_s name .
M	rating is made up of the following :
F	finally , it went through .
M	the total_cost was £_000 under the amazon uk price – a saving of around 00 %.
F	this review would have been five_stars had it turned_up on the right day .
F	even more worried now , i rang customer number and was on hold for 00_mins before i gave up , then completed query form online .
M	their online support system is confusing and sends me emails with no content .
F	there are a number of companies i regularly use via_topcashback and every time i have to chase and chase for the payment , some of them i now choose to get avios points from instead of using topcashback , via the british_airways site which is a shame .
F	them i '_m told i can have a credit_note and will be deducted the cost of collection . well by this point in losing the plot and tell them that '_s unacceptable i want full_refund and collection of mis sold product for free and i want to speak to the manager
F	brilliant service and value for money , saves the cost of a new vacuum , easy to order web_site . will use again when i need anything .
M	i am now in contact with credit_card company , as i feel i have been miss sold a product .
M	they refused and said it is too late - even_though i had booked it for a different day - they changed .
M	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks_up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
F	good and punctual service , the only_thing i would say is the delivery man didn_'_t have the comments i had written so he didn_'_t know that my mum couldn_'_t sign for the package as she has not the use of her hands .
F	j ' ai_commandé plusieurs sortes de viandes dont des volailles .
F	have contacted_watchdog now and am contemplating a solicitors letter to see if they respond .
M	but the best you have to offer is ' it '_s stated in our terms and conditions ', which is a bit sad .
F	great product would reccomend to all cat lovers especially multi cat homes as it makes the cats lives much happier it really does work !!
M	with speed and the staff can '_t be_faulted , yes i will be going back for
M	good service , lots of boilers ready off the shelf .
M	i phone event_tyres when i had a sudden tyre blow out en_route to work .
F	excellent .
M	this is a great and worthwhile facility .
F	will not complain as leaving uk on saturady and need those tyres .
F	i accepted this .
F	the material creases very easily .
F	if you want top service , best price and a guaranteed ( really guaranteed not just an empty boast ) delivery then choose this great company .
M	response to an email sent regarding an order was quick , efficient and courteous .
F	had it been sealed correctly i could have just popped the food back into the bag and it would have only fell into the box , but even then a bag of food shouldn_'_t be packed away opened !
F	the service was first_class .
F	still feeling_confident that travel up were working behind the scenes to fulfil their contract with me and organise my flights i went about packing etc .
F	i ended_up having to chase the order when it didn_'_t arrive 0_days_later thinking that it had been delivered to the wrong_address .
M	it is 0_weeks since i received only part of my order .
F	worse still on phoning partyrama no apology or offer of the £_00 . 00 !!
F	i '_ve_used this company many_times when travelling from gatwick but this was my first experience from heathrow t0 & they did not disappoint !
M	i asked for a re delivery the following_day ( a saturday ) but received an email_saying we ' d have a fresh delivery on the monday .
F	thursday received a call saying not to worry_about having to cancel the contract as the phone had not been delivered & was with royal_mail !
F	however , i find the website extraordinarily slow to navigate , much_easier to telephone and speak to one of the charming staff .
M	website tends to be very busy
M	a 0 day wait for my goods .
M	good prices , and good range .
M	then wait and wait for the bill .
M	i can believe_how reasonable they were .
F	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
M	up went 0 of the 0 cams .
M	the washer i wanted but cheaper_than everyone_else , delivery and removal of the old machine could not have been better , kept_informed at all times of delivery time which was at 00 : 00 on sunday morning , this included confirmation_email at 0am and an_automated phone_call just in case you miss the email .
F	now that is what i call service .
F	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
M	i went online and the best website and price appeared to be through rental_cars .
M	my order arrived more quickly than i imagined it would , the service from the carrier was impressive , and i was pleased with the quality of the goods .
F	i could even afford to buy the largest storage due to the low_prices .
F	item arrived within time specified .
F	the delivery was very fast .
M	dave & val hall
M	nordicagolf deal and dispatch orders efficiently but their choice of delivery service ( dhl ) let them down .
F	0 t - shirts was also missing from the order .
F	i live in rep of ireland - but of course you know that from my being a regular customer and from my address etc .
M	no communication
M	honestly , i wish i ' d just picked_up a bunch from the local co op , they would have been just as nice but a whole lot cheaper .
F	we have done nothing wrong other than the fact we have not succeeded in this venture , but if you wish to try and blacken our name in other ventures where we have different partners that have not been involved in house0market that is up to you and we can not stop you doing this .
M	unfortunately he needs to use a bottle to go to the loo now .
M	ordered three homeplug_network adaptors , came with prompt delivery .
M	will_definitely recommend to others .
F	our clients never had any need to alter our phone info and in truth did not even notice that we had relocated .
F	one was not answering and the other was unobtainable .
F	the order was marked as pending .
F	the sales_person in the shop was not_overly excited to see customers and had more interest in his phone initially until he found out we were genuine customers .
M	if it was one instance , or maybe a couple over a period of time , because we live in a house with only a house name on a lane , then i ' d give them the benefit of the doubt .
F	lovely villa everything in it we needed second time we '_ve been with villa_plus and are definitely going to book again for later in the year would recommend them to anyone
M	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
F	fantastic service .
F	but one thing the price - really expensive and i expected them to be cheaper online than in a shoe shop = yet it was cheaper in a little shoe shop in west kirby where many of the ' we won the war for you ' parade live .
M	despite purchasing the thinnest_lenses online – the site suggests these are the only thin_lenses available – they arrived and were noticeably thicker than my existing same prescription high_street glasses .
M	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
F	i hpi checked the car and came back with clear !
F	now . 00 days after receiving this item and 00 emails later sent to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk and servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk i still do not have a returns merchandise number for my purchase ( en0000000000g ).
M	pleased to find injury specific tape and a good shop online !
F	quick prompt delivery & my mum was delighted with the flowers .
F	the product is as expected , however i paid for next_day delivery , got the text saying it was on the way but it didn_'_t arrive .
M	they changed the flights dates , then we we called to ask why they cut me off , even the manager put me on hold for 00_mins , when i rang back they said he was not working .
F	i found i had to lighten dramatically many of the photos which were far too dark in the book .
F	i am happy with my new glasses
F	beautiful ceiling_light with quick delivery .
F	thank_you .
F	i found it very poor quality cords easy came out of cheap plastic grip , bottom of blind didn_'_t have a slat in the frame . very tinny and flimsy
F	very bad and poor customer service
M	yes cheap deals , but dodgy as hell and things go_wrong , boy do they go_wrong , oh and should you be treated unfairly , expect to be threatened .
M	thank_you for excellent service .
F	the driver checked cabinet and even put the handles on for me .
M	i have always been happy with the products and the service - they are my ' go to ' site for any glassware , bar etc .
F	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
F	when i phoned back to complain they told me it was too late .
M	i called them , and they were very helpful on the phone and said that the best deal was with avis .
M	not delighted with this as no estimated_date for delivery
F	i also found the product quite_pricey for the size and quality .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
F	it is not appropriate to advise how a good recepiant is feeling - particularly if a brerievment .
F	we have used kenable several_times and have always received great service .
F	i put 0_star for the service but there was no rude_conduct really
F	very impressed overall , and would definitely recommend !
F	the only downfalls were the less_than generous_sizing ( not good for the ego !)
F	they did not do so , and so i called them in the following week .
F	felt i knew what i was getting .
M	where do i start ?
F	after looking on internet i went for the eflorist heaven_scent at £_00 . 00 + £ 0 . 00 delivery .
M	i ordered two blinds which were competitively_priced , the blinds arrived within a few_days and are better_than i had anticipated .
M	call 0nd time , told goods are now with the carrier at the depot , delivery now saturday ( doubtful ) or monday .
F	it '_s a real_shame as it '_s a christmas_present and i don_'_t have time to return it .
M	i '_ve been using quidco for over 0 years and i simply cannot stop !
F	we are on second treatment and not one single flea .
F	oh and lastly a cheap super market at the bottom of the hill !
M	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i '_ve spent £_000 to support these_guys jobs .
F	good company to deal with .
F	thank_you
M	nothing more to add .
M	its too late valentines has_been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has_been ruined !
M	if my mother organises for the flowers to be redelivered through the post_office and they are dead and my mother can call and get a replacement .
F	the website is clear enough and i was kept up - to - date as regards delivery progress .
M	so we had another look at the outfits and decided to speak to someone and place the order !!
M	slightly_different from the picture on the website but still in the same concept .
M	they give you a date and then txt a time after and if not convenient you have to cancel and retry .
M	service , marvellous , cards unbeatable , convenience , unavailable !!!
F	i telephoned and spoke to a very helpful young_lady .
M	tried a different e_- mail address and received and auto reply suggesting i call in office hours .
F	let_me make it clear that i require a refund for the item .
M	i have to apologise for the previous review .
F	i was directed to hostelbookers via a comparison site .
F	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i '_ve been using it .
F	a 00_percent rating on safety is fine if you ' re a 0 ' 0 muscular man , but 00 is perfect when you ' re 0 ' 0 can '_t do a push up without hurting my wrist me .
M	everything is fine and the rates are decent enough when i deal by email or phone but since they have started_using the automatic online payment ( ipayfx ) i have not enjoyed the experience .
F	the tyres were due to be delivered and put on at my house , the first delivery was cancelled , then the second day ( agreed by myself ) noone phoned to confirm they were coming , and no tyres showed up .
F	once the 00 days were up i emailed and phoned cos no one answered my email and was told that i had been emailed which strangely came through after i phoned and they said they would let_me no of a delivery date but they never i called again and was assured they would phone the supplier that day and call me back but they never so i called again three_days_later and was told they would call the supplier and call me back .
M	they are a disgrace .
M	but what i received was a used iphone0s , which had been reasealed .
F	i bought and paid for 0 barstools totalling_£_000 . 00 .
M	i just need to find out how long i have to take this option up or not .
M	and the delivery time for taiwan it not 0 - 0 working_days it over 0days !
F	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
M	haven_'_t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
M	john ellis
F	i would definitely recommend this company to anyone_wishing to hire a car and i will be booking another car for later this year with them .
M	reason : no stock available from simply ".
M	super hub is only super in name .
M	how do you rate my reply ?
F	i received a special_offer email showing lots of offers including 00 red_roses for £_00 . 00 '.
F	it was so easy and quick to complete .
M	i used mazuma after_reading some dodgy reviews of other_companies online .
F	the software was ok if you were happy to use their display templates but if i wanted to arrange the photos in any other way it was difficult .
M	faultless .
M	they seem to be holding up pretty well , are easy to clean and because they fit so well , they don_'_t let much dirt get under the carpet around the edges
M	must try_harder !
F	everything went_according to plan .
M	not as sharp as you ' d expect either , considering i went for the photo_paper .
F	kept_informed all the way along with progress
F	i was given 0 different delivery dates , none of which saw the arrival of my guitar .
M	the online billing services is fairly good .
F	i would never use again .
F	excellent choice and the quality of the bouquet was excellent for the price , quick delivery too , mysister has already ordered the bridesmaids bouquets after_seeing the bridal one , well_done gt , many_thanks .
F	have just received formal shirt which i ordered for my husband , it came two_days after ordering online !!
F	in short it '_s crap so save_yourself the hassle and pain .
M	they just ignored all these requests ( you can '_t phone the company unless you want to pay £ 0 . 00 a minute ).
F	this meant my builders could not do what they needed and work was delayed .
F	having found a good range of tiles at very good prices and an easy to use website i chose a delivery date when i knew i would be in , when i returned from the christmas break on 00th_dec i found 0 delivery cards from 00th and 00th_dec , so then had to contact interlink for redelivery on my chosen date again , the box was in a very bad state when it arrived , it may be good sometimes to get things early but if you are asked for a specified date and no one contacts you to say any different ?
M	the expression , " you get what you pay for " is nuts .
F	we emailed 000 .
M	*****
M	is the luggage charge legal , sort of , 0 pages of booking info , halfway down page 0 in the faintest of faint type , 0 words , baggage rules .
F	the experience of disembarking was awful .
M	very happy , got my fender super bullets , the next_day !
M	i will eventually but it '_s a bit poor and a hassle i could do without .
F	complained and got a full_refund .
F	i am not impressed !
M	a clean and tidy villa with no extra frills .
F	i should also add that , given the problems i had had , disconnecting was rather painless - a manager allowed me to disconnect in 00_hours and i was even given a refund for my last month of service .
F	friendly , courteous and professional service .
M	in this case liverpool , where we live in north manchester .
F	i have given my views already flowers were late after being told they had arrived , when queried poor customer service , no human to talk to and then they arrived , thrown on the ground after a ring of the bell , flowers ok , card wet , box soaking .
F	i would urge_people not to use this company .
F	i will not be using this site again because i feel i cannot trust what i thought i ordered will be delivered if i have to read the small_print every time i place an order .
M	product itself is really good quality and looks great .
M	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn_'_t put you off purchasing from us again .
M	the only issue that i had was that i tried to add the code to qualify for an extra kg of protein , but the delivery arrived without the extra quantity .
M	this is with allianz ,
F	bouquet was for a dear_friend '_s 00st_birthday .
M	wat are yous playing at do u actually know that i tried to book a hotel to tenerife and the consultant aske me was tenerife in england omg it took me 00_minutes trying to explain were tenerife is i know ur exploiting them for cheap labour but come on were customers at end off the day not dogs
F	i am making_sure i will use yourselves again .
M	advised by my physiotherapist on monday_morning to start using arch supports to help my newly discovered flat feet , i sent off for a set of spenco rx 0 / 0 length orthotic arch supports on monday_evening .
F	i will not be ordering off the company again as wrong item sent they did not send me the right item out straight_away had to pay for another if i wanted it
M	delivery guaranteed before_noon fine - flowers arrived 00 . 00 .
F	he couldn_'_t get it to give hot_water , so paid him for fitting and had to then get mira engineer in , after replacing 0 bits and fiddling around with the workings , engineer eventually got it working , obviously no charge .
M	and i wait .
F	!
M	the courier came and collected my parcels on time , and equally they were delivered on time and in one piece .
F	also i was not expecting the jigsaw finish to be shinny .
M	some of my phones were worth next to nothing but as it costs nothing to ask is worth the time .
F	what '_s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
M	if something does go_wrong , it '_s sorted for you there and then and you are kept up to date with what is happening , although sometimes you do have to go on to a chat to find out but hardly_surprising considering the number of parcels they send .
F	best price on that we could find on the internet .
F	the items seems to be of a good quality .
M	have used this service before and the service continues to be excellent .
M	0th phone_call to find out what was going on - had to go through the same process again , in pigeon english , to be told that there was no credit on my old orange account , so no transfer to do .
M	make it clear !!!
M	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
F	the shipping amount i paid was £_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
M	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
F	it is not an easy task with the boxes and the fact that the items are so heavy to be able to take it apart for reuse .
M	no response from iflorist as yet .
M	had to chase to find out where my order was !, they were awaiting delivery of the product i had ordered .
F	we were also expecting another parcel from a different supplier , which city_link again failed to deliver , although claim that their driver had delivered it and had it signed for .
F	the local supplier quick travel ( more about that later ) on first_impression appeared to have only one coach to cover the length of the costa_del sol .
M	oh and i too think 0_star is too much but it '_s the minimum .
M	no courier ever arrived and i had to book again , this time with city_link who came the following_morning at 00 : 00 and the parcel was delivered the next_morning before 0am .
M	though it takes 0 days from warehouse , then another 0 days assembly , a day to quality control it i assume .
F	lors_de_ma consultation de_notre_compte au début de_l ' été , je m ' aperçois que_le statut de_la_commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que_la_livraison_est passée à_la semaine du 00 septembre . première mauvaise surprise .
M	it seemed to leak .
F	there are no directions given out from getting from central venice to the port .
F	00 april 00
F	also , i have had to ring up because one of the items marked down as being delivered was not received .
M	always arrives when stated .
M	i would think lots of people just forget a bout the money and the account becomes dormant .
M	i tried myself this morning to ring this place twice this morning , funnily_enough no answer .
F	ordered a standard flower_arrangement with e_florist at lunch_time for the following_day delivery .
F	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
F	it was a very nice shopping_experience and i would not_hesitate to buy from them again .
F	fast delivery .
M	there was a prominent scratch on the bracelet .
F	drove to the takeaway which was closed .
M	my words of advice stay_away
M	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
F	!
F	not too great with the after sales .
M	good enough for me .
F	brenda clarkson
F	i want my money back - but have been offered a £ 0 voucher_code which is unacceptable .
M	one of the windows is a metre high so a third of available light is blocked out which somewhat defeats the purpose of a window .
F	if they offered free food on 0st april - then tell their customers its a joke ( youre all idiots ).?
F	online help was not helpful .
F	i posted a message on their site and was asked to send a photo in .
F	£_00 they would take £ 0 and leave me with £_00 credit .
F	service was quick .
F	they used to be so good and i changed all my rental_properties over to them to only find now , that you can never get through to them !!
M	i ordered a watch from iconic_watches as advertised on their website i paid my deposit and received an email_stating 00 - 00 days for delivery i anxiously waited 00 days then got in touch with iconic_watches to find out what was going on .
M	absolutely_disgusting !!
F	i cant use them again based on this - very disapointed
M	didn_'_t quite understand the fuel situation but got a satisfactory result .
F	the shed is ok but not a quality i was expecting real cheap wood no treatment which i am sure was not mentioned in the advert nails were not hammered in properyl and am sure it will not last the the time it is garenteed for having said that its ok but for a few pound s more could have a got a better quality one from major diy .
F	and it is easy to store .
M	driver was paid upon collection as required .
M	well_packaged too .
M	we won_'_t hesitate to use them again and will recommend to everyone .
M	after waiting in all saturday again i received no tv !!!
M	samsung printed user instructions sufficiently comprehensive and clear .
M	don_’_t use or get involved with they are cowboys of the mobile market
M	well_done guys .
F	in the end i had nothing just the refund and a £_00 . 00 postage fee for nothing which was slightly_disappointing so if anything to improve would be allow refunds in store , find a way to have free postal returns and quicker in processing exchanges .
F	my name is brenda syrett not brenda scott .
F	order went through apparently dispatched , had to ring to check after some time had passed .
F	ordered on the 00 december and tracking shows it having been scanned to send on the 0th_january ????.
M	within the hour , for someone to stay in from 0am - 0pm just to recieve a parcel is to much for someone at home
F	i ordered the photobook from jessops because they were recommended as being the best quality books , so i hope that once i do eventually receive the order it will be worth the wait .
M	both_times the products have arrived well_packed and arrived within a couple of days of payment .
M	are you understaffed ?
F	found a very competitive price and the site was easy to use .
M	just it seems very slow to be able to collect your money and also there seems to be a lot of problems with merchants not giving you your money . staff seem very friendly and helpful . i probably will not bother any more after i get my money this time .
M	surly the clue is in the title ?
F	i couldn_'_t work in my garden during the whole weekend because these people didn_'_t you their job properly .
F	it '_s now 00th_december ( 0_days_later ) and i still have not received my order or received any update or apologies from chemist_direct .
M	these_guys are not accountable like sellers are in ebay .
M	and thank_you again .
F	and now asking me to click to link to my bill - i can '_t .
F	thoroughly_recommend them .
F	i was not suprised that i had to contact the store twice as no discount_code was emailed to me .
M	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
M	i do not know if it is people who feel sorry for yodel employees or yodel staff themselves writing their own reviews or if it '_s trolls , doing what they do for reasons only known to themselves .
F	instead we left only leaving a deposit .
F	still_waiting for final part of my order the most_important part my shoes ????????????????????
M	i spent_nearly_£_00 on a photobook .
F	very easy to order .
M	as you get older and wealthier - you will wish you had banked with someone_else .
F	her reaction was " wow , they ' re stunning !"
M	i ` v got the ray_ban_sunglasses it is really fantastic .
F	they never bothered getting back to us .
M	no_hassle .
F	how can they think a call back within 0_days relating to an item that should have been with me within 0_days is acceptable ??
F	i always end up phoning citylink who then say that titmuss have to confirm the delivery instructions .
F	when they arrived i realised one of the fitted_sheets was for a deep ( rather_than normal depth ) mattress therefore was quite loose on the mattress i had .
M	. 0 tickets for leonard coen as a suprise christmas_present for my sister long time l . c fan i dug deep and explained to my good lady wife that it was both a christmas and birthday_present and hid the reciept face value of tickets £_00 actual cost of tickets £_000 does the phase ," ever feel like you have been ripped_off " mean anything to anyone anymore nothing more than legalised stealing and the fact that they are associated with the nme is also shameful they are not helping the fan they are exploiting them .
M	they were very efficient and we were paid extremely quickly
F	i didn_'_t think you could get service like this .
F	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
F	i am left very disappointed and would never use this company again .
M	so all in all for me a good product but inefficient company processes which is fine when you have a lot of time but not for me
M	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
F	easy to use , i requested a bag and that came within 0_days , i posted on a tuesday and payment was in my bank by thursday of the same week , very quick payments and very happy with the service
F	total_waste of space and don_'_t even deserve one star
F	have come away with lots of ideas just need the time to put into practice in my working life .
M	called with a question , was told that i needed to talk to a specific person_who was busy and they would call me back , they didn_'_t call me back .
F	i wouldn_'_t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
M	it '_s been three_days now for a next_day collection .
M	keep_up the great service - thanks !
F	i will certainly be shopping with superdry again !
F	getting a bit fed_up of that , oh marketing departments .
M	good points are that they delivered it on the chosen day , were friendly enough and called ahead .
F	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
M	called the day before to make_sure they could fit at my chosen date and time .
F	i '_m at my wits_end with greene & co and have unfortunately had to lodge an official_complaint with the property osbudman over this .
M	so don_'_t buy from this don_'_t - buy - jeans . com site .
M	poor service all_round .
M	the boots arrived quickly and were the size i had ordered .
F	thankyou very much xx
F	thank_you beauty_bay !
F	:-(
F	as it can be frosty , that might have been a problem .
F	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
M	finding the exact memory i needed was easy , the price seemed to be perfect and the delivery time was great !
M	i also did not take into account any duty implications because i originally thought they were coming from the uk .
M	save_yourself the trouble go to a proper supplier and get insurer approved .
M	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
M	another week odd of waiting .
M	for the other makes , best to phone and check if its a stock item or one ordered from supplier .
M	on the plus_side - after i cancelled the order i was quickly promised a refund to my card if i agreed to reinstate my order - i agreed .
M	" connection of freestanding washing_machine or dishwasher plus disconnection of old unit from existing space with power and plumbing " and " removal and recycling of your existing appliance at the time of delivery ".
M	eventually despatched on the thursday without further notification ( by which time we were away for the weekend !)
M	to the airline - forget it , despite several phonecalls to get expedia to process my sas eurobonus number properly on my flight_bookings , they still_haven_'_t managed to work it out .
M	the cake was cute to look at but inedible .
F	i recommend this company to all .
M	cheapest around .
M	which happens quite often these days .
M	bought an orange cab using the finance offered .
M	what impressed us was that there are not many sites that have the coverage to make this kind of booking .
M	delivery was quick and email_notifications let_me know what was happening with my order .
M	easy ordering and quick delivery
F	i am really unhappy with the service !
M	i phoned
M	i found the website great to use as i got what i wanted straight_away
F	they offer extra discounts but don_'_t tell you when they expire .
F	also you say tickets valid for 00_hours you don_'_t run over 00_hours .
F	i dealt_with phil and the manager and what nice lads .
F	i read carefully other reviews about this company and they really did sound too good to be true , but they convinced me to place an order on line at approximately 0 . 00_pm on ( tuesday ).
M	items were received at the door within 00_hours .
F	it came on wednesday as expected , perfect_condition and great quality .
F	have just tried to assemble this goalpost .
M	cars should have been supplied with full deposit
M	great and competitively_priced service .
F	our order was delivered to us with in 0_days .
M	great price given for an old bada os samsung wave , however it took 0 - days to acknowledge_receipt of the phone by c0p and another 0 - days for payment by them into my bank_account .
F	hope they do as they say .
M	my dog has cushing '_s disease .
M	at that point the process and the web_site tracking page froze .
F	veronica
F	my engaging party was looming ( 0_days_later !)
M	product exactly as_described + fast delivery .
M	i had no_problems at all , the product that i ordered came on time and at the cheapest overall price .
F	was promised delivery by 0 . 00pm .
F	not a happy & never again to be curry '_s customer .
F	luckily my engergy company sorted it out for me .
M	at_least easyjet make me feel like a human_being rather_than an animal being hearded in a cattle pen !
F	the delivery was very prompt , the only problem i had that was the doilies were very hard to separate and a lot of them got torn so had to be thrown_away .
M	so made another appointment for another day and time . got there . and same thing , no tyres .
M	this company is absolutely abysmal .
F	when i did speak to customer_services i put it to them that their company and its systems were in chaos and that if they could not find the switch request it might be the result of this state of affairs .
M	i '_m not sure how thats even legal : s
F	contract is up in june / july . have not decided if i stay or go .
M	thank_you
M	?
M	no_problems with car but as yet but no aftersales feedback queries from the dealer !
F	i am a customer .
M	ive heard_nothing back from them .
F	had been looking to buy a silver_birch tree locally but could not find the variety we were looking for .
M	total_waste of my time .
M	in all honesty im not convinced i would return at this point , not due to poor service in anyway but more for high prices lack off promotional_offers and high pp charges .
F	i have 0 grievances - 0 is i can never get through on the telephone if i wish to speak to someone personally .
F	. funny how now they think it was there idea now ?
F	no replies to mails .
M	very pleased with product which arrived within a few_days , many_thanks .
F	from_start to finish the service was excellent and very well_organised , and the furniture i ordered was of a very high_quality and well_worth what i paid for them .
F	they '_ve found themselves a couple of long_term customers here !
F	a little stitching was needed on the gloves but other than that it '_s perfect !
F	i have used budget in newcastle and they were much more obliging .
M	despite several emails and photos i have been given no support or partial_refund .
F	even better that you deliver to denmark .
M	too_busy to go through a returns process so just getting on with using it .
F	how is that for good service !
F	once i ordered the part it only took a couple of days before it got delivered .
F	thankyou !
F	my parcel delivery was great , just needed to enter the details online and it worked out all the rest for me .
M	- i have never ever_dealt_with a customer_services_department that lacks any form of intelligence , professionallism , and communication_skills .
M	very happy to recommend to others and will_certainly be back for more .
F	very efficient .
M	will never look at using another website / store for buying games .
F	he very obviously bad tempered and angry .
F	when i asked about it i was ignored .
F	not very competitive in this day and age .
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	the current process of call back is in my opinion placing a unnecessary hurdle in the way which in todays_world of immediate communication is frustrating .
F	on the 00th day though , i had had no update and no computer .
M	what i got was far worse !
M	great service form chris although i had to chase up the delivery date a couple of times .
M	it is so nice to see this company finally getting the caning it deserves on the web - my advice is to read the reviews and then walk_away .
F	there '_s no way i could have got back in time if i '_d have been out anywhere .
F	so i was not impressed .
F	i purchased from another well_known supplier a saturn back to wall_toilet and installed it earlier this year .
M	( i love their irish accents too !)
M	thanks very much .
F	no luck .
F	in these situations its not also cost that counts .
M	thank_you !
F	the price was good so i will deal with this company again , but will allow more time for delivery .
M	use of online buying , ok to start with , but a long delivery item was not notified until i enquired .
M	i should have purchased from another company that could have supplied .
F	would buy from again .
F	its easy , cheaper_than any where else and delivery time is fab better_than [_external_reference_]
F	the store manager came out and noted concerns and agreed it was under foamed .
M	although the product was as_described i paid extra to guarentee delivery on a specific day however it turned_up 0 days late even_though it was on [_link_] tracked service .
M	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
M	it transpires it was the manufacturing company , grange , who let the side down and not internet_gardener who were completely_unaware of the situation .
F	absolutely ridiculous because of course we had questions .
M	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
F	whilst the labelling was all correct , when i opened the parcel the actual contents were from holland &_barrett .
F	i ordered some prot - col products on 00th_june it '_s now september and still no goods and no refund .
M	bought everything i needed from this shop .
F	we checked in staff were pleasant hotel reception was clean .
M	makes you want to got to the stores and buy a laptop knowing you can get it replaced straightaway
F	as soon as i am able to contact them , i will be cancelling my order , and definitely won_'_t be ordering from them again .
M	so i placed an order again and it seemed to work .
F	i like that there was no extra fees for the highlands .
M	after keying all payment details when booking flights got a processing transaction message for two minutes followed_by an error_message .
M	i would prefer to have a slim cut shirt for example .
M	wineware delivered promptly and safely .
F	i ordered it for a party so there wasn_'_t time to complain and send it back .
F	probably will use this website again , as it has some good rare products , but a mistake is a mistake , the website should take full responsibility .
M	the guy didn_'_t even blink , he was hesitant that i needed a new tire , the closest one to mine conveniently cost £_00 . 00 !
F	the mulled_wine and mince_pies which had been promised by the blue_chip website had become a standard bottle of wine and some biscuits , once again no festive touch at all and to be honest disappointing , id rather not be promised anything .
F	unfortunately , they were too tight on the legs and because i couldn_'_t guarantee they '_d stretch i sent them back which cost me £_00 special delivery .
M	best rates and fees in uk
M	the local carrier staff were really helpful & sorted my problem out . still_waiting for that call back tho !!
F	well pleased
F	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
F	wormers arrived promptly 0_days_later but after chasing 0 times the food turned_up 00 days_later !
M	i think that companies like yours should consider a boycott of royal_mail unless they discontinue this practice .
F	i am so glad that he kept the email trail as without_seeing it for myself , i would never have believed that a customer service team would respond in such a way , unless the person in question had just won euromillions and didn_'_t give a toss .
M	i appreciate product ranges change over time , but this one is definitely inferior with only a small accessories pocket and just one shoulder_strap ( although the description says " straps ").
M	had we met this man first we would certainly not have bought either the mazda 0 nor the mazda 0 from you .
F	i have used this company twice .
F	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
M	it was scalloped on one side , but on the other ( not shown in either photo ) is a coarse ripping - tearing surface which predominates in use .
F	any suggestions ?
F	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
M	though the last time i was asked to request 0 friends and get the money the next_day by 0pm , but it kept error out .
F	damp or infected quilt – i gave you all the information i could , so you could check that other items , either stored with or alongside the quilt in the warehouse , were not also infected – an attempt to save you further problems with other clients .
M	i would have no_hesitation in recommending dino to friends who need a new pc .
F	the boat itself was good but think the people going for the trip round amsterdam should have been given the opportunity to cancel
F	when i contacted this firm they explained that prices fluctuate due to stock_levels , and the price was adjusted shortly_after my order .
M	i have received an_apology from the company but could not in all sincerity recommend them to any of my friends .
M	i am so impressed with the service ao provide .
F	bad color quality i guess ?
F	good product and website very easy to use .
F	very simple and very efficient .
F	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
F	i therefore find spartoo discourteous and a disappointment in their attitude to customer service .
M	mmmm . read in to this what you may , i substituted van with yodel .
F	simple website , easy to navigate , a wide product range , excellent prices and 0st_class customer service both on the telephone and in person .
M	i needed to deal with people from sales , warehouse and despatch .
F	nothing wrong , do you want an enginneer in 0_weeks time ?
M	that was four days ago .
M	!
M	all reviews but one are from people who have not claimed .
M	having lost the receipt for a microwave we bought 0 months_ago i called the customer service line to see if it was possible to still get it replaced as the interior paint had peeled_off and was cracked .
M	overall good , but could be better
M	the website is hopeless to say the least and collections don_'_t happen .
M	the staff were always knowledgable on products and helpfull in finding the right products for me .
M	i was able to see the quality and finish these were refurbished to and that helped_me to make my mind up .
F	looking for a present for a friend and the prices were the best i could find , arrived in super quick time too .
F	the pillows were extremely yellowed and lumpy !!
M	its only when they have charged £_00 ( 00 per_minute ) extra they cut_off the phone .
M	but after you have selected , and payed they suddenly dis_- appear from your itinerary .
M	the product is brilliant ( no pun_intended ).
F	from the moment i placed my order ( over the phone ) i knew i '_d made the right choice .
M	they looked amazing online but when they were delivered they were rubbish i wouldnt of given them to my dog !
F	will be using them again
M	checked tracking site the following_day , which showed goods had reached the a depot .
F	the money was taken immediately and then after 0_weeks the fobbing off started .
M	i have mailed 0 times and left a message but i am being completely_ignored .
M	they didn_'_t .
M	the oven_door_handle has fallen_off three_times so_far .
F	the design was really pretty and we added her picture .
M	i have now switched suppliers , so swim shop have got what they desired .
F	i emailed to ask where it was and got no reply then called 00 times throughout the day to ask where it was , every time the line was engaged . then today i get an_email thanking_me for my order !
M	go onto their website , same deal .
F	!
M	ordered some taps paid next working day delivery they arrived 0 days_later then to find a part missing ring they send out the wrong part for what '_s missing & now still_waiting for the correct_part to be sent out they talk a good job on the phone but give garbage service in the end defiantly would not use these again ends up costing more in the long run after numerous phone_calls & putting plumber off i recommend avoid this site like the plague
M	i was kept advised of progress with sourcing my watch and given really friendly and efficient service on the morning i visited the shop to collect it .
F	i will be using buyspares . co . uk again 0_*
M	caveat_emptor as they say .
M	will use your company as long as your prices stay competitive ,
M	did exactly_what it said on the tin - even without using recorded delivery .
F	i will never use them again .
M	me ?
M	winter_wheels for golf trolleys from jlgolf ltd
F	my sister is going through a tough time and i wanted her to have the flowers to cheer_her up . really disappointed .
M	but the costume had a hole in the leg .
F	it is not clearly_stated on there website that they have other options and was told i had to type in to the search to find the groupon deal .
M	using parts from both deliveries assembled a complete ' undamaged ' unit .
M	( i suggest possibly ordering half a size up from normal in this brand )
M	i found the product easily , the site was easy to use , postage was free , the product came in no time .
M	regular mailouts handy but i do find website a bit_tricky to locate items on .
M	this allowed_me to purchase three bottles of perfume for the same price as i was about to pay for one in the high_street .
F	the two missing genie head massagers arrived today , in good condition and packed well so i '_ve decided to upgrade my review .
F	il m a confirme que_le remboursement avait bien ete fait , ce_que_j avais constate moi meme ce matin completement par hasard en consultant notre_compte bancaire en_ligne .
F	twice i have paid_extra for a next_day delivery only to find out the companies used yodel - i hate them they have their own agenda .
M	a very happy repeat_customer .
M	so_far our experience has_been great , worktops arrived as agreed , at the time of this review our kitchen_fitter had yet to fully fit them but from what we have seen they are great quality .
F	i brought the bambino_mio birth to potty pack mixed , they arrived quickly , so i cant_complain_about that , but was disappointed to find a few things after looking at them for a while and washing them .
F	no option in checkout though .
M	also hsbc online_banking is not safe , they do not use safe device , which caused lots of accounts hacked .
F	very disappointed with service .
F	the guys were great who installed the machine .
M	i won_'_t be using skypark_secure again .
F	delivery is by parcel_force , who failed to deliver or leave a note that it had to be collected at the post_office , as i had paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery although it was post fairly fast , i still did not get it delivered as expected
M	it is our first stop for information .
F	e_- mailed them thursday and they haven_'_t even bothered to contact me .
M	you are better off cancelling your original collection and trying again .
F	i won_'_t sadly order from them again as i wouldn_'_t want to ha a delivery or collection from your company .
M	only joking , but i run my business so that i know how everything '_s working .
F	i look_forward to seeing them in court .
F	the store was grim and depressing and the service was impersonal and rushed " no_frills " i guess and you don_'_t get what you don_'_t pay for .
F	the delivery of the tyres were on time , excellent condition and will use the service again .
F	very quick response to order and product received next_day . excellant service and products cheaper_than_anywhere_else !
F	excellent .
F	so i would definitely recommend this company to a friend .
M	it can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
M	customer service rep was very helpful though .
M	although the immendiate reaction by sainsburys was good , ( the assistant manage visited us with replacements within a hour ), things then stalled .
M	took me 0 tries to get it to work . would recommend but requires a little patience !
F	customers services have said they will not do anything to help as i have allowed it to get wet its not their problem .
F	after_spending ages on web looking for item finally ordered from country_attire .
F	i was very impressed by the communication .
M	i paid the extra for the next working day postage and did not receive it the next_day .
F	everything was back within 00 days and those of poor quality were marked .
F	i ordered on monday_morning and my order still has not shipped . never again !
M	i can say 000_%, that they are 000_% genuine but if you are still unsure , pay by cash on delivery as i did .
F	did as promised with a next_day delivery on a saturday .
M	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction . the same day i made the purchase . thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
M	also they hide_behind emails and not on the phone .
M	if i hadn_'_t prepaid for the tyre i would have walked out and gone elsewhere or would have rang the branch on my mobile from their reception to discuss my fitting and been seen quicker
F	therefore we made the sales persons job very easy .
F	i ordered some flowers for my sister that were delivered on the day but left on the doorstep because they weren_'_t in .
M	so i asked for a refund instead which i am still_waiting to receive .
M	mark stillman
M	ordered blinds for our house - ' delivery in 0 working_days '
M	after ordering i found that they are running scam i send them an email very next_day .
F	had to pay £_00 diesel on picking_up the vehicle but as car_hire company will verify it came back with the same amount of diesel as vehicle was too_big for me to confidently drive .
F	very happy with the purchase .
M	well_done np_autoparts !
F	one of the biggest cons going , promises were made on the website which certaintly were not fufilled .
M	we will be using work top express in the future for all our solid_wood top orders .
M	the drop_off point was only a few_hundred yards from my home and the collection_point was only o . 0 miles from my friends home .
M	other printers i have spoken to and given further orders to , tell me the design i have paid for is mine to use foc in the future .
F	prices for some products higher than same products in supermarkets
F	avoid people , take_heed .
M	!
M	a perfect fit and in place within two hours of arrival .
F	you have kept me informed all the way through , from ordering , despatch & delivery .
M	0 boxes because of the weight .
F	i was recommended by my therapist to try this out ( tennis_elbow strap ) could avoid having a steroid injection or being on medication for the rest of my life ?
M	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
M	the online service employee was excellent
F	ordering was easy , waiting was horrendous !!!
M	i pointed these errors out , and they responded with a second diagram which still contained the original errors , and also had a couple of new errors on it .
M	i bought a rug from them last_week .
M	i am very disappointed at the service and only hope the flowers are better_than the service received .
M	but to whom and when ?.
M	the company . horrid
F	you surely are not doing anything for the planet by using such excessive_packaging .
M	so i went to the post_office around 00pm but the staff were pretty_useless , saying they don_'_t take deliveries for my postcode .
F	a ) they would turn_up
M	it is just unacceptable !
M	zero or less would be more appropriate .
M	i would be glad to receive a replacement .
M	all was done over the phone and my fantastic new shiny hayter rear roller mower was delivered the next_day .
F	customer service was terrible , they couldn_'_t even have the decency to reply when i asked who was supposed to have signed for the parcel as i knew there wasn_'_t anyone in the address to sign for it .
M	the parasol pole diameter : 0 . 0cm was not anywhere_near correct .
F	i originally ordered this kitchen in october , despite a survey being booked evidently the order wasn_'_t processed properly and no one turned_up .
M	0st time he must have knocked the door and ran away as it took me around 00_secs to answer it just to see him drive off .
M	0 days before our game and 0_weeks from order , a box arrives
M	i have my doubts that they were despatched in the first place , was on the point of reporting to barclaycard when the arrived .
F	one even claimed the driver had arrived and left a note thought the letter_box , but not of my house .
F	tried that but of course the deal i had signed_up for through uswitch was now unavailable .
F	no_hesitation in recommending and i will be using them again .
M	i have even found the internet can sometimes be very slow on the handset when my friends handsets are working fine on other_networks .
M	great product and excellent service
M	slow delivery
F	here '_s my order :
F	the other is the courier service they use ( citylink ) are awful .
M	they are sturdy but light enough to be carried and are proving very good value .
M	i would happily pay £_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
F	a couple of days after ordering , the courier emailed me saying they '_d rearranged the delivery date which i was not happy about so emailed the seller .
F	have bought from here before and will do many more times .
M	the failure to respond to my emails asking what will happen to replace it is very disappointing .
F	i wouldn_'_t advise ordering if you need your things in a hurry !
F	additional stops were added after booking and therefore the journey took longer .
M	first_class service
M	this did arrive !
M	not too impressed .
M	the whole_process from_start to finish was simple to follow , the customization options were clear and gave_me the ability to have the machine built exactly as i wanted , within my price range .
F	i '_d buy from them much more if they did .
M	couldn_'_t have asked for more .
M	sent to wrong_address !
F	i couldn_'_t change the place of delivery to my work and they required me to be at home from 0 . 00 am to 0 . 00_pm to accept re - delivery , ridiculous in this day and age .
M	perhaps it was a one off so may try again .
M	no problem with inter_city courier , great delivery on time , or tribal_uk , easy to deal with , would never order from hughes electrical '_s ( ipswich ) again ), poor customer service in my view .
F	i was told i couldn_'_t have my extensions fitted as i was so late and would have to rearrange .
M	no answer as usual .
F	00000 000 000
M	as he has to start another job , so i am not sure when he will be able to finish it .
M	great !
F	again this item did not arrive in time for the event ( date specified on order placement )
M	they were completely_clueless .
M	how dare you charge for the full 00 litres when nobody can or would risk driving to empty ?
M	would love to see the pricds of the ready_meals drop so i could sample them next !
F	i reported the damage to the car_park office , but they were less_than helpful , and although i was told someone would be in touch no one has contacted me to date .
M	to charge extra for slightly faster processing is not good business practice .
M	they did this without notifying_me in any way .
M	puts me off placing a full order .
F	having never brought medication on line for my pets before , i was given the animed_direct information by the vets receptionist and then once i had got the prescription from my vet , i found it easy to e_- mail over and then buy the flea_treatment a great deal cheaper .
F	i had to phone customer_services again .
F	received the full_amount_quoted within 00_hours .
M	again very disappointed !!
F	this is now a police matter .
M	the battery was delivered the following_morning well_packaged and fully charged .
F	every day they llive is a blessing .
M	i believe that i should be compensated for this poor experience as ultimately you have chosen to use them .
F	photoes are useful too .
M	this company left me with the impression that " nothing is too much_trouble for them ".
F	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns_up .
F	on time but service nothing special .
F	i would not_hesitate to recommend , fab company to deal with .
M	thanks to allah ( god ) got my money back .
M	i booked 0 new tyres to be fitted to my vauxhall_astra on saturday 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	stay_away !
F	i am delighted with the flowers .
M	they out right refused to accept it as a faulty return , they gave_me a phone number and said i had to return it myself .
M	i would never use them again , ever .
M	waiting for richard to phone when a 0000 coin comes in to swap the coins over .
M	i work away from home all week and needed the parts so that i could do a repair at the weekend .
F	my friend celebrated her 00th_birthday last_week .
M	phoned to confirm the actual version they were offering but they were either unwilling or unable to check for me - had a look on his system and told me he could only see much earlier versions available .
F	great service . pleased with final product . arrived when said
M	phonecall to say they could not supply as advertised
M	just brilliant .
F	my sister - in - law was delighted with her flowers
F	still not received by 00th_dec so cancelled order .
F	service was good easy to order , but the packaging was dreadful .
M	to say i felt ignored would be an_understatement .
F	they turned_up stunning not a single unfresh flower in the bunch was worth getting them upgraded in size .
F	i call again the man on the phone was very nice but yet again that offer isn_'_t available .
M	deal with them at your own_risk .
F	i had no time left for looking around and trying on so i took a choice on a costume based on the pictures and description and sizing_guide .
F	finally after a few calls on my side a guy arrived , no appology for being late .
F	the lady_who received the flowers said they were lovely .
F	i got in touch with the customer service team and they placed an order for the fittings to be sent to me straight_away .
M	yes you might get a set of mats cheaper but i '_ve been there before .
F	stores again .
F	we have used betterbathrooms twice_now , and both_times we have been happy with the products .
M	the price was the best in the western world with over 00_%_discount .
F	i ordered some wellies , they quickly took the money from my account , over a week_later they then mailed to say they didn_'_t have them in stock !
M	buying from d amd m powertools is never a problem , everything runs_smoothly they have a rewards_program , fast delivery i do not buy from anywhere_else
M	searching their site can be painful , but their live_chat tech_support are very good at the search part .
M	not cool !
M	the staff are friendly and helpful .
M	ordered from them for the first time and then i wanted the delivery faster_than 0 - 0days so they happily changed it to a premium delivery for me and was very helpful lady on the phone that assisted_me .
F	quick easy and no_nonsense .
M	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
M	otherwise all good .
M	however the number of fonts and design choices available was quite limited .
M	nowhere did it say i had to phone when booking .
F	quick service and good description of goods
M	the service has_been ok , until i lost my phone .
M	go their its great
F	i ordered 0 men '_s cravats for my wedding , the process was very easy , they were dispatched the same day and i received them the following_day .
F	i thought the website was very straight_forward except for two things - it doesn_'_t specify anywhere that if your car fails an mot there is a free retest .
F	but be prepared for it to play havoc with your musical
F	i have already started making a second one .
F	very bad feedback !
F	in my case just add two orders made with minutes of difference in between them .
F	i have now been told that the camber could be out - unlikely to my mind .
F	better late than never !
F	it seems like a long time since ordering , worried it is lost , had to call uk and still not arrived .
F	customer service was good , they sent me the card and said ' my box wasn_'_t sealed because they do random security_checks ', i am not sure i believe that .
M	the 00x00 canvas ).
M	my replacement glasses took over 0_weeks to produce ( 00th_sept - 0th_nov ).
M	got the money the next_day
M	yesterday for the first time ever , something i bought didn_'_t turn_up .
F	as it was their error they advised that the fitter would work around this , cutting outside etc .
M	am convinced this is a deliberate scam .
F	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
M	update 0rd sept just phoned covent_garden shop sending out today .
M	i think the order was originally placed on august 00st .
F	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel . knowing full well how awful they are !
F	i was kept_informed of delivery times by e_- mail .
F	i was very pleased with the item .
M	perfect .
F	checked his emails - nothing from alpha_rooms .
M	the blind was easy to order from the website , was delivered on time , and fitted_perfectly with no adjustment needed .
F	very impressed , within an_hour of ordering received a message to say ' despatched !'
M	after 0_weeks of chasing i did actually ask for a refund but they ignored that and continued the delivery !
M	i telephoned their customer service and after some wrangling i managed to get them to agree to a full_refund and i would be able keep the flowers when the eventually turned_up .
F	after a very tough year and alot of deaths in the family i knew_exactly_what would lift her spirits unfortunately the concert was sold out months earlier then fortunately ( i hope ) i found ones available on this website . i got printed out e tickets delivered to me very promptly .
F	iflorist to the rescue !
M	i would not_hesitate to order from this company again in the future .
M	ordered on sunday , arrived on wednesday , with email_notifications in between .
F	such a waste of a lot of money .
F	they have the retro_style i love and expect from the brand , and yet , they have some modern , edgy twist that make them current .
M	glasses are a fashion item and specsavers have exploited the market !
F	thoroughly_recommend !
F	it arrived really quickly and my boyfriend was delighted !!
M	eventually i received another email_telling_me the ferry i wanted was not available ( other sailings offered were not to my requirements ).
M	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
F	we must have said ' black door ' about 00 times , and when the chap read our order back to us he definitely said black with chrome fittings , so we were happy .
F	i e_- mailed , they said its out of stock again !!!
F	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three_attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .
M	i enquired_about my order and was told there was a problem with one of the colour on one of the items and it had been re - ordered .
F	was not sure how to pump the product up as pump didn_'_t fit when i e_- mailed the company 0_days_later they still have not got back to me
F	sent an_email and as yet have had nothing back .
M	the website was clear and precise and gave a variety of excellent offers .
M	bad_experiences with yodel on previous deliveries , thought ups would be better but i was wrong ; couldn_'_t contact their local_depot at all , couldn_'_t make changes to delivery on their site as i was supposed to be able to .
M	thanks to you too housetrip ,
M	bigest and better company i have neser seen
F	as a retired professional , i can_assure you that your complaints procedures are sadly_lacking .
F	finally received my wedge_wellies which i am very pleased with .
M	don_'_t even try to get your money back , as even items which you pay extra compensation for will " not be covered ".
F	very disappoining .
M	animed sent the right goods at the right price and on time .
M	mr abel
F	how difficult would it have been happy_puzzle_company to e_- mail at the time of order and communicate with me that the item was out of stock ?
M	andy bacon
F	good enough but when the tracking service from royal_mail said it was delivered and it had not arrived i got in touch with physioroom by telephone .
M	thats_why i took the price in the first place its one big joke , like i say never will
M	they arrive quickly and are good quality .
F	every time i have dealt_with mazumamobile the service has_been faultless and incredibly speedy .
F	i tried to call again , no answer on phones and was transferred to a squeaky fax_machine sound .
M	well_done and thank_you .
M	i love their products and their animal paks price cannot be beat !
M	the software to make it up was pretty easy to use once you got the hang of it .
M	second meeting was as above on time talked_me through all documents explaining in detail , even my cats liked him .
M	i accepted the cistern for a toilet as i wanted to carry out the installation asap .
F	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
M	i ordered a pair of half glasses using a promotion_code to 0 for one .
M	what a sorry_saga of total_incompetence .
M	my ref was 00000000 - return tracking was 0000000000 .
M	obviously i would prefer to get more money than i did .
F	very pleased , will be ordering more .
F	a priori il_y a beaucoup_de mécontents , quelle que soit la nationalité des acheteurs .
F	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
M	in all a very good and well_presented company with a good rep , unlike the other_companies that i have used in the past .
M	we tried hiring a lens from the lensforhire website , but it failed the first time because it would not accept our card_details , which meant we were forced to do it the next_day and miss the pick_up date we needed !
M	on handing back the vehicle , the inspection clerk as well as receptionist at ' first car ' were not interested and did not look at the petrol slip i handed to them , which included : time , date and registration of vehicle i had just filled up , 00_minutes prior to transaction .
F	its a shame as i liked your company and would have been happy to continue using your services - but in light of my recent experience - i will not use your services again .
M	thank_you .
M	i had to register with the website and to do so was forced to give unnecessary information that i did not want to give about myself .
M	the rump_steak we ordered was delivered on time and so_far we have only opened one pack .
F	pleased that they remind_me when i am getting low on lenses .
F	it was easy and the best price i could find .
F	purchased a childrens play shed with a 00 year guarentee against rot .
M	other than that my only complaint is that the glasses are advertised as having a quick - change lense system , which they don_'_t .
M	if you are going to purchase from these loonies then i suggest you do it as a person and not a business as you have 0 days to return without_quibble .
M	very bad .
F	but the most aggravating thing is the prohibitive price of all drinks , especially soft_drinks and water .
M	you have more chance of winning the lottery than having someone available to ' chat ' with you .
F	the sunbeds were marked and mismatched and the only sun brolly was half broken and standing at a tilt under the trees around the perimeter .
M	prices were fantastic and even over the holiday_period delivery was quick and efficient with a text received advising 0 hour delivery window which was spot on .
M	good sell - by dates .
F	i could have done it myself on the ryan_air website
M	annoying !
M	good website .
M	first time i have used them and was really impressed .
F	found exactly_what i was looking for and ordered .
F	please make it a bit friendlier and enable it to cover objective issues .
F	i hope the above comments and suggestions will be of assistance to your service improvement .
F	they didnt turn_up next_day despite me paying in full on my debit_card and being assured they would , then marisota sent me out a replacement pair and didnt charge me for them until they could find the other parcel .
M	been using this website for a few_years_now but since update its become a nightmare if it wasn_'_t for the live help staff i would find another courier .
M	very impressed .
M	if you need your console repaired , give chris a call .
M	i cannot_fault this company .
F	vey poor customer service - no phone number only an online_chat service which is not always available .
M	each vehicle selected was described in full and the final vehicle chosen was recommended to fit the purpose it was required for .
M	it would appear bt are offering me much slower speeds than advertised .
M	initially all was well with a very good free ' home_trial ' service that i would recommend everyone use before buying .
F	goods delivered on the following_tuesday meaning 0_days from order to delivery .
F	!
M	!
F	the staff are really helpful and the customer coffee area is a nice_touch :-).
F	i had the customer copy and she wanted the other one as well .
F	i guess they are what i ordered - no better , no worse .
F	this is too late .
M	the booking was for collect from pietermaritzburg and return at johannesburg a journey of 000ish km .
M	on that request the site said the order was all ready sent , but the the store was closed at the time .
F	no flowers and too late to order more for the same day - totally_unacceptable and very poor customer service .
F	the difference in strength is also noticeable unfortunately .
M	paid for it online and collected it from my local_store just up the road the very next_day , as they said it would .
M	i ordered a mueller ' the one ' ankle_brace for my son and shortly_afterwards received a call explaining that the size i had ordered was out if stock .
M	used twice_now and will_continue to do so if price and standards remain the same .
M	overall an excellent experience .
F	the prices are better_than_anywhere_else i have looked and there is so much to choose from , my partner says too much ( is there such a thing ?)!
F	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
F	courier / delivery guy couldn_'_t find our property even_though we are a business !!!!
F	sorry you will see the exchange_rate after you receive the money !!
M	good value and service but hiring a car in key west with minimal mileage driven makes it appear a rip_off to have to pay for a full_tank of petrol and get no credit for the half tank i returned .
F	0000000
F	i have had 0 good stayed and 0 really bad stay and i was told i should of complained in 00 hour & wimdu could have had help .
F	thank_you purely_diamonds - i will definitely recommend you to all my friends and family .
M	at this point i called the shop again .
M	as the payment was allready done , i had to cancel my paypal payment and make a new order as transferring my money back to my bankaccount would take several days .
F	the girl i spoke with said that the courier wasn_'_t able to attempt to collect again today and that " if they ' re in your area earlier_than the time you have arranged collection , they '_ll try to do it then ."
M	don_'_t waste your time .
F	i knew it wasn_'_t as i had stayed in all day for the delivery .
F	did he think i was calling for a friendly chat ???
F	they also are so easy to order with and give you plenty of opportunities to add the little pieces on such as vases and teddy '_s , the little extras id forget otherwise .
M	!
F	do yourself a favour , don_'_t buy from uksweets .
F	a big_thumbs_up and highly_recommended .
F	so emailed and cancelled and ordered from elsewhere .
F	imagery on site is misleading
F	very disappointed and not even an offer to refund the delivery i did pay for !
M	we would welcome pro_cook '_s comments .
M	take my advice , don_'_t use yodel ( anything ), they are the one '_s who deserve to go out of business not the people who use them !
F	either they peel away ( maybe iron not hot enough ?)
F	brilliant !
F	i will definitly use this site again if i need to .
F	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
F	firstly had to wait 00_mins before being picked_up .
F	the goods were packaged well and in excellent condition .
M	i must_say that the quality is above_average , but i do feel the company could have written that they where delayed .
M	this is my first led purchase and i am impressed by the intensity , though the ' whiteness ' is taking a little getting used to .
M	worst customer service i '_ve ever come_across , avoid like the plague .
F	this was extremely inconvenient as i had to arrange for a refund and then find somewhere_else to do it late in the day when i thought it had been sorted .
M	the folding arms became_loose which meant the glasses fell_off my nose every time i leaned my head forward .
F	the sunglasses were dispatched very quickly after_placing the order and were really competitively_priced .
F	good booking_system , efficient check in and out at reception .
F	it was a risk for me as i hadn_'_t used this particular company in the past , but am really happy with the product itself and the distribution / packaging and would thoroughly_recommend and will be using them again !
M	my credit_card was debited on placing the order , not on despatch as some better companies do .
F	?
M	when i finished with them due to rising prices i was sent a final_bill which i paid , then i was sent a second one .
F	products are good .
M	slightly_disappointed with this , although appearance and quality of the card is very good .
F	ordered vertical_blinds for our_conservatory doors .
M	little point in going too far with this review .
M	top customer service and i will be back very soon .
F	thank_you harrogate_holidays .
M	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
F	as it is i '_ll use the stuff i bought , but i would have preferred to wait before paying out another £_00 or so .
M	however , this time the site seemed to freeze at the payment validation step and i had to call the 0000 number to purchase the desired items .
M	based on this experience i decided to leave comments and a one star_rating on ekomi to publish .
M	under the distance_selling_regulations refunds should be made as soon as possible and no later than 00 days .
M	dear wood0u , you have got my money , but you have not told me anything about delivery .
M	but what makes it a nightmare experience with you is the using of dpd delivery services !
M	later delivery than website promises , wrong product and no refund on a faulty product .
M	this has happened with my last 0 orders .
F	great company !

M	i really liked their web_site where you can see your sign develop with the design , font & lettering colours plus the holes options .
F	the ordering process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
M	well and truly impressed .
F	not only were they larger than i expected , but they were lovely healthy_plants .

M	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them and am about to order another banner from them .
M	the other tee arrived the next_day in perfect_condition .
M	this company harks back to the bad old days of faceless unaccountability of online suppliers and a reliance on having no physical shop front for people to complain to as excuse for providing terrible quality products and service .
M	this was a present for my daughter who didn_'_t want to wait for me to return this and get another and luckily isn_'_t bothered about the camera , so i '_ve decided to keep it , but next time i will be wary of believing the descriptions stated .

M	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
F	the order and delivery system are quite slow compared to on - line stores such as amazon , but that may be down to prescription items .
M	the product was sub - standard for a deluxe_bouquet and instead of wasting my time complaining only to get a " we ' re sorry you were disappointed ", i '_ll vote with my feet and make my experience known to others .
F	so went threw all internet forms and sent the thing
M	don_'_t trust them .
F	thank_you .
M	cut out the middle_man !
M	as i said , very simple and really impressive service .
M	i am debating whether to return the item as quality is dubious .

M	as a first_utility customer for several_years i had looked at the negative_reviews with scepticism as the online switch and monthly reading part of the transaction was actually pretty easy .
F	you must be able to afford to lose a lot of money .
M	the fact is you can get the products from other_sources and i would recommend they be used .
M	card messaged printed not hand_written ( despite_being charged extra for a premium card !

F	the parcel was collected promptly and delivered very quickly .
M	saved_myself 00_% on new price .
F	this book is to record our latest holiday , but it would have been worse if this were a wedding or other special event .

F	lovely pool - just a little cold but that was a challenge .

M	good price , good service
M	what you should know is its part self_assembly , which was not explained to us in the showroom .
F	decided to get new seat from different supplier .
M	please send over a joint statement with the garage that none of you you have received the tyres .
F	a simple text or email was all that was needed - onus shouldn_'_t be on the customer to have to keep checking .
F	my friend has just called to say the flowers have been delivered . and they are dead , leaves all dropped_off and whole_thing squashed .
F	all in all - i probably_wouldn_'_t order from them again , but only because i wasn_'_t filled with confidence .
F	this is the second time i '_ve recycled my phone with
M	also , the method of fastening the 0 ' base ' pieces together , was poor design .

M	it should not be allowed but i blame the relaxed censorship rules for film and television some must get paid by the number of times they can swear .

F	couldn_'_t_resist having a little taste .
M	googling the product i was after called up sds , they had a variety of suitable products but the web descriptions made it easy to see which particular one was most relevant to my needs .
F	courses covered all content required along with additional content , not expected .
M	a cup arrived chipped at the base , it was suggested that i ' live with it ', take off the name_plate & fix it to the back so the chip doesn_'_t show and that i shouldn_'_t seek any compensation as the order was small & they had increased the order by one medal ( on my request ) although i was ready to pay , this was sent out ' gratis ' ( seems i am paying for this now indirectly !)
M	so do ups .
F	any_questions i had were answered_immediately .
F	we all know the life - span of spring flowers and i am so , so disappointed to be so badly_let_down on behalf of mum .
F	we found travelwx had the best rates and the service we received was excellent .
F	when asked to upgrade , i always have had really cheap , crud phones as i dont_know much about them .
F	needless to say i will not be shopping with pet_supermarket again when a simple apology and free_returns_label from customer service would have avoided any problem .
F	i was then very apologetic that they had arrived like that on mother '_s day !
M	the confirmation e_- mail i received upon ordering was both fast and beautifully worded and then i received confirmation when the flowers left the florist and again when the flowers actually got delivered to my mum .
F	paypal is not regulated like a bank .

F	i was delighted to find my brush_set had been delivered so quickly to my house , they were presented well , safely_packaged and attractive to look at .
M	the first customer service rep said she couldn_'_t help and would need to speak to her manager .
M	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
M	first_utility came up on price comparison_websites so i chose to stay with this company .

F	i placed my order and then wanted to make_amendments to this almost_immediately .
F	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt_with shortly .
F	they have a massive_range of products and excellent delivery times .
F	the pricing on the website was great , however there isn_'_t enough information_regarding the need to send in a prescription and i didn_'_t get the email requesting it til the following_day .
F	which could not go to as we were doing a theme and every were else was sold out last_minute .
F	i ordered flowers a strawberry bouquet 0_days ahead of time for 00 . 00 , the flowers were dispatched at 0 . 00 in the morning but didnt turn_up till just after 0pm , and the flowers that turned_up contained more daisy flowers rather_than as the picture displayed -- dont_think i will use serenta again --- sorry
M	for customer service , ease of use etc our experience is that the post_office is best organisation to receive parcels from - the flexibility in picking_up your parcel you get if you are out at work is great with po ,
M	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
F	i now have the hassle of returning them .
M	this has_been a really distressing experience which is still producing a lot of stress .
F	delivery came on correct day , and a reasonable time , well_packaged and kept fresh .
F	the blind , when we got it was just as_described .
F	the turn_around time is amazing so i never miss a beat .
F	they hadn_'_t been dispatched !!!!

F	no_problems with products .
M	in fact i noted that the label stated " leave in porch ".

M	cheap car_hire , great staff and great cars 0_star :-)
F	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .

F	i called again , on - hold again for quite a while , i explained the situation again but the girl seemed uninterested , she said she would get the other packs sent out though .
M	i shall not be using pharmacy0u again .
F	would recommend
M	barnaby fixed it there and then in about half an_hour and wanted to charge me nothing for doing it .
M	to return it , only got 00_% refund .
F	ordered strengths of 0 , 0 , 0 not knowing they were under strength compared to nespresso .
F	although this site has lots of choice of products it isn_'_t an easy site to work out what you want or need .
F	!
M	we have problems every year with rats in the chicken shed .
F	bought a beautiful and expensive pashmina , stunning quality with a great feel , to match a bag bought from a different shop .
F	i don_'_t think i will be areturning customer !
M	the my bookings area does not use profile which seems odd .
M	guess_what . i think this review will be amended to include 0th phone_call !
F	efficient and reliable
F	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
M	this - and previous_occasions - has resulted_in costing us money !
M	a convenient and easy way to pay . but if it faults you can in my experience pay for something 0 times over and then you have to wait up to 00 days for a refund
M	the web_site was very helpful when choosing which homeplugs would best meet our requirements , and once ordered the plugs were delivered very quickly .

M	first of all the flowers we meant to be a 0st wedding_anniversary_gift for my wife to receive , the delivery came before 00 with i paid over ten_pound for this to happen as it would surprise my wife , which it did .!!!
F	however , it would be great to be able to get extra services rather_than a second_pair for free as i did not need two_pairs .
F	pharmacy0u offers best prices , quick and safe delivery and a plethora of products .
M	i had to go to their holding company '_s agm to get the contract cancelled .
F	however , this is a world wide uesed website .
F	while the 0 is great , i still don_'_t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
F	i was them prompted to ask neighbours or friends to accept delivery which was not only rude in presuming to trouble neighbours they also work during the week
M	ordered day 0 , delivered day 0 post free !!
F	interparcel have done nothing proactive to try and get this parcel to me in good time .
M	i ordered 0 bolts about 0 / 0 inches long and 0 washers and they were delivered in a small box not a lot smaller than a shoes box , the box had fragile on it crazy .£ 0 delivery as well for 0 bolts is a lot . there should be a normal post option for small items .
M	so in summary , if i were telling this to a friend , i ' d tell them for goodness_sake , don_'_t use citylink .
M	i have to say i could not be more pleased with the entire experience .
F	i carried on with my february booking with advantage at toulouse via car del_mar .

F	very happy with the service .

F	i did approach customer_services who after a long phone_call said would send replacements , so i placed 0nd order , once again not everything worked .
M	while making the payment the site crashed , there was no_indication that the order went through , so i re - ordered , i then received two products , i only want one , now i have to arrange to send one back .
F	i don_'_t mind not receiving my order when i expect it , delays happen , but i do expect to be kept_informed without me having to do the chasing , especially when gxl admitted they knew about the situation already .
M	so now i can prove that i didn_'_t lie to them and i can prove that they make empty , worthless promises !
M	very enjoyable and we would have no_hesitation in staying again or recommending to others .
M	i bought a brake bleeding aid as i have no friends which i knew would be a tube and bucket but this draper model claimed a ' valve ' so i didn_'_t need to worry .

M	my order was only for one item but website went fine and delivery was within expected timelines .
M	excellent service !
M	the lack of post caps to finish off the shower_unit was a sad omission .
F	long_story_short , chilli_sauce are great for the online payment system and we did feel that we got great value for money with everything that was included in our " package " but for peace of mind ask for someone a little more competent to manage your booking !
F	i placed my first order on june 00 for syndol tablets .
M	down to the post_office but nonetheless it '_s only in the small_print that it says first_class delivery can take 0 days .
M	i wont go into the full details but it was a joke .
M	we bought two eamps which are now in regular use to gain_access to our house and into my daughters car .
F	i emailed on 0nd_december to find out what was happening only to be told it could take up to 0_weeks .
F	i checked online ( even directly on little_tikes ) and the toy was being sold everywhere for no more than £_00 . 00 .
F	my faith is restored but it still lost me three_days , i have emailed walls and floors to complain but they haven_'_t replied yet .
F	the toilet_seat was delivered very promptly and was easy to fit , however it was described as luxury which it isn_'_t .
F	i ordered a bunch of flowers for my best friend who has just come out of hospital .
M	then on 00 / 0 / 00 i got yet another email , now saying it would be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , again with no information about when i would receive it .
F	could not use live_chat on just eat as too early in the evening .
M	it is always a bad policy not to have fully inclusive rates , it is very annoying to be asked to pay extra for ins etc after paying in advance it is not nessessary for you not to have inclusive rates , extra driver charge a bit expensive for the short rental_period ,
M	nobody called so i missed delivery and had to arrange another date ( driver finally called ).
F	it was very handy having a washing_machine ( having 0 young_children ).
M	0_stars would be more accurate .
M	if you pick them make_sure they give you a written confirmation that your hotel has_been booked and proof from the hotel would be ideal too ,
F	i was happy with the product , however i ordered it on friday , expecting with first_class it would be sent monday and recieved tues or at the latest wednesday .
F	the process you used on getting onto the bus with the papers , etc was very lengthy , but nevertheless we finally were on our way to windsor_castle .
F	but when i phoned the company to say i am returning the product the lady on the phone was very nice and polite .
M	all cartridge_shop had to do was add part order to the first invoice .
M	great service next_day delivery .
F	however i did have to send back my lovely boots as one of the poppers came off after only wearing for 0 hours .
M	its a review site isn_'_t it ?
F	i no_longer have to go min the garden to have a cigarette and i cant_wait to try other flavoures .
M	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
M	i called to query why they had not removed the insurance " orange care " ( strange name because in my experience they do anything but ).
F	argos can be a bit hit and miss .
F	shudda given than my work number .
M	but be as i said be more cautious check the description 000_% and check you have understood the description before buying and if possible if there is a cash_generator store nearby check the ps0_console and see if everything works at the store . then you will know alot more then a description on the internet or give them a call .
M	the cheapest decent brand tyres i could_find .
M	as i had sent a cheque i ignored it .
F	funny that , because i could have sworn i worked from home all day just to receive the order .
M	i checked tesco '_s web_site and 00 our 00 reviews for that item said the same thing .
M	my order was received in a few_days
M	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
F	brilliant easy to use , would have no_hesitation in recommending alpha_travel_insurance to my family & friends !
M	one of only a few sites that allows you to book multi city flights .
F	so easy to design , great customer service - especially phone_call to double_check , ( nearly ended_up with wrong fixings )!
M	let_down_badly by canvasprints online , i '_ll be looking for my money back .
F	price was cheapest for size required .
F	i was left on my own !
F	this is a bit of a worry , as i have relied on 0st choice for several_years .
M	after 00 days they told me it was in stock but were waiting for my confirmation to ship .
M	i believe the order was then despatched that same day so no_complaints from me !
F	!
F	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
F	on the website next to the product i wanted it said free delivery on all orders over_£_00 .
M	i ordered 0 latches that i seem not to have arrived !!!!!
F	i was stuck getting a very specific key cut in a very short time frame .
M	" all that glitters is not gold " - i purchased tyres on the basis of the positive_experiences of most customers .
M	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
M	he agreed to reprocess the order free of charge (£_00 so_far - wasted - of course it should be foc !)
M	managed to secure next_day sat delivery and once had contact details were able to communicate_effectively with expected delivery times .
M	morning of the 00th and it has just arrived .
F	sizing info could have product measurements .
F	very poor communication , and do not appreciate that some people order on line and arrange delivery dates because their free time is limited !
M	been a while since i bought from myprotein with getting_married , baby being born and running my business , but got back exercising and got some banana cream spectrum00 as i always struggled with recovery .
F	with a more positive_outcome .
M	told customers that they would not be able to deliver on time due the storm .
F	i stood humiliated by the tills cleaning glue off the bottom , and he later returned and said after all the glue had been removed , i am not exchanging those .
F	i was a bit_worried_about ordering on - line as i wanted a colour_match for my tiles in my kitchen and had been unable to find it in the shops , and although the colour in the photo looked perfect , was thinking that it may look completely_different when it arrived .
F	i was really happy with my purchase , the products are great and i got them quickly .
M	so overall im 000_% happy with everything and would highly_recommend this company for anyone looking for any costume for their parties .
F	so i have had £ 0 in a savings account for the last_year which i could not add too and with not a lot of help or guidance on the website .
F	it was really important to us that we got beautiful thank_you cards for our baby '_s many gifts .
F	bravissimo all the way now !
M	online purchase via 0wisemonkeys went fine , then got a text from the delivery company saying date they will deliver and to reply by text to change it .
M	on the plus_side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
M	the customer service here is incredible .
F	this only got refunded when i took my complaint to ofcom - but talktalk sent them copies of letters they '_d " sent " me - they hadn_'_t ?!
F	won_'_t be using them again .
M	upon_arriving home i spent a lot of time trying to find them for a reasonable price , and after much searching found that one of the first sites i had been on had them for the best price !
F	i '_m_sure it will be much_better when the website functionality is up and running .
F	i would of thought that they would of atleast offered my delivery charge back or maybe a certain_amount of discount of my next purchase but nothing as it was their mistake as on the invoice it says i ordered the pig charm .
M	i also never received my free wireless charging pad as promised on their advert !!
M	use this company at your_peril .
F	two pans and one roasting dish to cook christmas_dinner , we had to contact the owner to ask for more !!!
M	if you are at all concerned or nervous of making a purchase in that you havn '_t seen the article in the flesh , you have a money back guarantee with no strings_attached
F	i was so excited when i found out we could get 00 mbps speeds on our broadband service and signed_up for virgin_media right away .
F	i find the delivery of my orders are quick so i don_'_t need to go shopping around .
F	i did upgrade it to the next price £_00 . 00 , but from the sounds of it , it was so worth it .
M	very happy with my shopping_experience
M	the delivery is also excellent , both_times i have ordered something it has turned_up the next_day .
M	it has said this the whole month i have been waiting for my plasma .
M	i agreed with them that i could have another polishing kit at a reduced price .
M	are you under - staffed ?
M	brilliant service , brilliant shop .
M	i would certainly recommend these gloves to anyone who has the same medical_condition .
F	!
M	we had a great experience at the mousetrap inn .
M	i will never use this company ever again !
M	best lads in any ja '_s , darren , paul , & fraser .
M	fantastic range of products .
F	my boyfriend got back from work at 0 . 00 and tryed to ring but mattressman '_s custumer support close '_s at 0 . 00 but he manged to get_hold of a person on their order service who said they would leave a message for their custumer support when they got in , in the morning .
M	my partner then emailed wowcher who responded with :
M	i would not get involved with this company at all .
M	and here we are days_later with no flowers , no response to my e_- mail and still no sign of the live help coming online .
F	plus_side was that i had a voucher so didn_'_t cost a lot .
M	i thought i ' d have a try of the ciggaweed flavour , it tastes extremely sweet and fruity with a nice amount of vapour , love it !
M	we have previously written to advise you that your account exceeded its mailbox quota and that unless addressed , some of your email_addresses would be suspended after 00 days and deleted after 00 "
F	ordering easy .
F	i have subscribed now for four years and have found thet the each year is repeated with just date changes .
M	the ordering system was easy to use .
F	i will book direct in future , the staff can only deal with what they have got , the rental_car website needs to be sorted !,,
F	choosing the photos took me some time .
F	item was delivered quickly .
M	easy to use service with no_hidden clauses .
F	i have waited ages for this product
F	i have a strong prescription so paid_extra for think lenses .
M	my previous multiple emails , telephone inquiries and even live - chats have been completely_ignored , now i am assured that my goods have been dispatched ( to a " blank " post_code ) so only time will tell if the goods will turn_up .
F	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
M	the upside ao . com are cheaper_than most retailers and deliver on time .
F	city_link have quite lazy drivers tho
M	also for our fourth frame we wanted a darkish grey colour and we received a silver mount , not at all what we had ordered .
F	no_problems encountered , friendly and efficient staff .
M	!
M	the product was ok but the on the second delivery the packing was crushed and split_open with the items in a jumble plus the delivery driver did not ring the door_bell for me to sign the delivery note .
F	perhaps an_apology would have been more appropriate rather_than telling_me i am wrong ? this is a good example of my experience !
F	also there are some people in chat rooms who are allowed to take over rooms and there is alot of bullying betwwen these people and other players .
M	overall not blown_away by the experience , but not that disappointed either .
F	also it used to be the case that only a deposit was taken at this stage - or have i done this through a different web_site ?
F	i was welcome to use it if i like at my own_risk .
F	will never use them again and consequently because of them i am unable to use ebay .
M	they try to take money out of you everywhere .
F	it is not possible to know which company your car_hire is with until you select the car .
M	real live people in the uk !
F	my transaction went through and money was taken from my account .
F	will take my business elsewhere !
M	i could write reams ( this is edited anyway ), but you get the idea by now !
F	despite this , they took the money from my account and made no further effort to contact me , even_though they could have worked out the email address they used did not match the email and account details i provided .
F	i tried them on friday_morning went online and bought the pair i liked the most and they were on my doorstep the next_morning .
M	i had no_problems with both my purchases from echo .
F	i kept getting offers for all over scotland , mainly glasgow .
M	i sent in my design and was quickly replied with a price and a digital mock_up .
M	i had put £_00 pounds of fuel in my tank before dropping it off .
M	i don_'_t mind good service but like rhetoric checking on the service should really only need to be done sparingly and then again when you feel something may go_wrong .
F	i am a pay as you go customer , and never loved 0 anyways , but now i have it more then any other operator
M	i ordered a camera battery via a company on amazon_marketplace .
M	he tried to deliver , we were out .
M	accommodation - not city_centre as advertised - it was central eastern berlin .
F	website very clear and easy to use , never had any_problems .
M	the only bad thing was onebof the costumes was burst at the seam .
F	!
M	i am really happy with the guitar pack !
M	thoughtful and makes_life easiir .
F	used this site specifically because of the discount_code .
F	i have previously paid to other chemist and supermarkets .
M	safety_net and legs - fiddly ( needs 0 people ) and time_consuming !
M	brilliant , fanatastic service .
M	thanks
F	i feel disappointed as i have only sent flowers once before , due to the cost , and am unlikely to do it again if they are not packed and sent with care and thought .
M	highly_recommended .
F	i was always kept_informed at every_step of the process - from ordering to delivery .
M	avoid at all costs !
F	speedy delivery .
F	this would leave pro_cooks customers much happier .
M	the flowers my mother recieved was a disgrace for the money i paid . have used this company before for sending flowers , but will not use again . was proper mugged this time . never again .
M	after emailing gameseek and posting the game back to them first thing on a monday_morning ( i received it on a friday ), i got a reply at about 00am on the monday giving me a return code to write on the package .
F	no reply to emails .
F	i need my phone it '_s vital
F	i have refused to accept the delivery , and now have been told by customer_services that by refusing delivery the next delivery will incur a charge if they check and content not damaged ( even_though courier has told me i am not supposed to take the item out to check it )!!
F	brilliant , i can see clearly without glasses for the first time in 00 years .
M	rang amazon , they said theyd ring dpd and get it delivered first thing monday_morning
M	glad , it all got resolved in the end and i have received my refund .
F	i also sent an_email requesting information ; i never received a reply .
M	to scan copy of bank_statement to proove 0 lots of money taken - never_heard
M	ordered the calibrated brazilian black slate through mrs_stone because they could supply internal tiles and external pavers to match .
M	the customer service agent ( or his manager , who he said he referred to ) was absolutely_useless .
F	they arrived_safely and when i unpacked them the orchids were beautiful .
F	quick , reliable , friendly service .
F	thankyou
F	if you give it a try i hope you have a similar good experience
M	always help available just a call away .
M	this is not satisfactory .
M	in the end we just had to take the hit and order items we didn_'_t want , just so we didn_'_t lose the money .
M	at these prices i can buy new glasses and have spare pair to use when i have mislaid the other .
F	it '_s great for ordering well_known products at great prices .
M	ideal company for quick delivery and cheap prices for screws and fixings , etc .
M	there was an email reply within an_hour , and the package was delivered on the tuesday , on the day and at the time advised .
F	it is good at picking uphair and bits .
F	polybags had exactly_what i needed at the right price .
F	the food when you don_'_t pre book is very very expensive for what you get but it was our first time , we went all out because why not ?
F	every time i called , i was greeted with a negative attitude and zero willingness to help .
F	i also ordered another personalised card from a different website on the same day 0nd and that arrived on 0th and its beautiful , vibrant_colours , just stunning exceeding my expectations .
F	they eventually said they received it after telling_me i had posted it to the wrong_address until i emailed them the copy of the address they had told me to send it to .
F	fitter rang 00_minutes in_advance and arrived as promised .
M	my brother in law was persuaded to do the same thing few_months back at the same place by the way .
M	i ordered their own_brand mass_gainer but instead got the protein .
F	“ please call our prepayment team on 0000 000 0000 .
F	what more can you ask for " first_class service - all the way to my front_door .
M	also came with 0000 print cartridges so plenty of prints vefore spending more money !
M	issue i have is we bought bedding which wasn_'_t needed , so i wanted to exchange them for a double_bed instead of a single .
M	choosing tuffnells for the delivery sevice is not one of you best decisions .
M	the rac man said i would be lucky to source a brake light_switch . he did not know about just_kampers , i filled him in !
M	after recently purchasing my car_mats , i found the transaction very easy and the service very quick .
F	bought for section 000 knowing others could watch the 00 year_olds .
M	the voucher is presented as a scan of the back of the voucher , which makes it appear more legitimate .
F	?
M	i did think maybe i had just been a bit unlucky with the first i ordered so i have relatively recently_purchased another from you as i did find delivery and other items good in the past but sadly the same has happened and i have now had to revert to other_websites to buy the atomisers and fluid chamber .
F	min datter købte iphone covers for i alt kr .
M	great service and good kit
F	i was charged_£ 0 00 for express delivery then i wasn_'_t in when delivered after three working_days at_least it was left in an accessible place i cant tell you what the product is like as i have not got it yet
F	on the plus_side - the delivery was quicker_than stated .
M	the price was also a very good ' offer '.
F	i am sooooo pleased we went to oak funitureland .
M	not 000_% convinced but will reorder and keep an open mind .
F	it '_s been a week now since i '_ve contacted wowcher and the initial company they done the deal with , and i have not received a reply from either of them .
F	?
F	not at all impressed with myyodel .
M	0 days_later i get curt one line e_- mail - due to ' security issues with payment ' order cancelled .
M	amazed when i checked what others had paid , as we paid in one instance £_000 less for exactly the same holiday and no one we spoke to had paid as little as we did , so 00 out of 00 for price .
F	she managed to revive them an_hour later by dosing them with aspirin in a bucket of water .
F	ordering was easy , delivery quick and they kept me up to date with the order until it arrived .
F	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
M	well_done and many_thanks , would definitely use again .
F	he couldn_'_t have done his job any better .
F	!
M	best price going on the eastcoast acoustic_amp and quality cables at good price too .
M	this company is absolutely_useless run by a load of cowboys why people don_'_t use royal_mail more often is beyond me and out of all the alternatives this lot of morons are the worst even worse than yodel would you believe and they are rude with it , if i could give them half a star i would , had i known my amazon order was coming through them i ' d have paid extra for royal_mail , but at_least i know next time , ovoid this company at all costs .
F	there was unfortunately a fault on the couch and the upholsterer was contacted immediately and the problem was rectified within a few_weeks .
M	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
F	the higher the quality , the better the paper , the sharper the images .
F	waited 00_minutes to talk to someone then was told needed to be put through to someone_else .
F	this was an easy transaction and i will definitely recommend your service to all my friends and family
F	i found three of the hangers with problems .
F	no .
M	we were given a delivery window of dates when our oil would be delivered but then no notice closer to our delivery of what actual date it would be .
M	excellent experience , would definitely recommend to a friend .
M	i will be honest in saying that i was a bit_nervous_about using an online estate_agent at first and it may not suit everyone , but for me it did the job and i would not_hesitate using house_network again .
F	the delivery driver turned_up at 0 . 00am on 00 . 00 . 00 and moaned that my children were still asleep in the room so left the furniture at the top of the stairs and left .
F	so i '_ve wasted £_00 on payment to maid0clean and about 0 hours of my time (£_000 ) in dealing_with this shoddy , incompetent , shockingly_bad company with the most dreadful customer service .
M	i cannot_praise enough the quality of service and professionalism i have experienced for the order i have placed .
M	get it sorted please - google gives you a one click and your there .
F	i think we will have to bomb again , which is very expensive .
F	the term ' clasp ' may mean something different to you and me - and it '_s me that is trying to find something for which i am willing to pay money .
F	do i want to wait_until the end of the week ?
F	will use again and again .
M	delivery time was said to be on the thursday of that week which would have been great fix the car weekend , wrong part did not arrive_till monday_afternoon also it was not complete what i had ordered .
F	the first thing i thought a bit off , was when i first ordered on the website .
F	i didn_'_t receive it until monday .
M	we can '_t offer you that .
M	not a pleased customer
F	reliable , with a fantastic choice for all occasions .
M	at this point , one was dispatched and it arrived two_days_later .
M	item as_described and cheaper_than anywhere_else i could_find
F	even_though l '_ve been adding veg and salad to my meals l '_m still very hungry
F	it '_s so sad to see when a company is suffering because their customer service is amazingly horrible .
F	incredible .
F	kind_regards ,
F	it was relatively easy to arrange flowers to be delivered in australia , but i was not very impressed with the flowers sent .
F	not a good way to do_business as they obviously do not want to have sales from scotland or ireland
M	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair_amount of hassle all things_considered .
F	i was advised by a friendly adviser and sure enough my game was with me the following_day in the post .
M	it ’_s now the 00th of april we have received nothing .
F	sadly , this now will make me think_twice about ordering from them again
M	i sent another email quote : " i confirm that i would like to cancel this order please
F	would definitely order from uk_juicers again .
F	who_knows what they treat their customers like , once you are lcked into a contract .
F	( i would have to wait in again ) basically the parcel was collected two_days_later than it should have been .
M	so roofing_superstore efficiency and good communication was let_down by a poor delivery company who seem to over schedule their drivers .
F	i don_'_t think i will be ordering from here again .
M	the receiver was very pleased with the quick service
M	the quality is no better_than tesco and from the packaging they must source from tesco suppliers .
F	the clarinet was a good price and arrived with superior packaging each piece carefully_wrapped .
F	mazurma provide a fastv and efficient service offering what 0
F	well_done would definitely use them again if i was looking for appliances .
F	again phoned back and told same thing but that they always side with customer !
M	i need to source tyres now from somewhere_else - i haven_'_t received the ones ordered from tyreleader so please issue a full_refund and confirm .
M	my opinion is . excellent products , value for money , excellent customer service
F	this is the first time i have used full_circle , as i have always booked through club_med web_site before .
F	what was the reason ?
M	i have been on ebay for 00 years_now with over 0000 feedbacks .
M	my order was for two_pairs of swimming shorts , and i would of expected both_pairs to be of the same size as ordered .
F	great value meat
F	would recommend to anyone to use glasse 0 you
M	delighted to find at geneva_airport that i was offered a 0x0 audi quattro instead of my prebooked vw_golf for a ski_trip in the alps on saturday 00th_jan . everything_went well until i arrived at my destination , where , unfortunately i stalled the engine while parking and was unable to restart it .
F	i was particularly impressed with the hat and it will be just great for our cowboys and indians kids ' camp .
F	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
F	. but guess_what - even after changing the delivery address and sending you an_email_saying that we still have not received the blanket , we have had no response or blanket yet !
F	i completed the online form on the saturday .
M	cheaper_than the non tax paying ' online_retailer ' that i used to use .
F	wide_range of keys .
M	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use bliss again , very impressed .
M	when we did get going the bus was excellent .
M	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
M	all excellent so_far !
M	printing reams on ski insurance when i '_m off to the tropics is just plain silly .
F	i was so excited to receive my canvas as it was of my son at just a few hours old , but was left_feeling a little disappointed .
M	the bird_box was of poor quality and had some damage .
F	three of the nine books i will have to throw_away , which made the order somewhat dearer_than i had hoped .
M	yet again i have experienced appalling service from this company .
F	i was a bit_dubious at how much_cheaper my mascara was than other amazon suppliers then when i went to a department_store i realised that it was the same price so i was no better off really .
M	great product , good and timely service .
F	i was sent an ' order dispatched ' email when in actual fact , this wasn_'_t the case - they were out of stock .
F	ordering was easy .
F	i was directed to a firm with the understanding that they would handle my case .
M	this is usefull for my records , why not this time ?
F	no parcel .
F	one of the items ordered had a small scratch on the front of the appliance .
F	i was not being listened to as a customer .
M	didn_'_t get them at marked delivery day so i phoned tesco direct to ask what happened .
M	again - i apologise for ever considering the clunky , sticky , technological hand grenade of a site that is beatport .
F	so much for so many animals .
M	i called parcel0go , the agency who made the booking and took the payment , they said they couldn_'_t act until three_days had passed .
M	sorry , we said , if you cannot manage your own parts system properly , then we should not be made to suffer because of it .
F	i '_m very impressed and will use again ,
F	i ordered some flowers for mothers_day , to be delivered on the sunday as the website says guaranteed delivery on mothers_day , which is the only_reason i went with this company as my mother works everyday apart_from sunday so i knew she would be home to collect them .
F	buyer_beware .
F	our baby looks super cute and the card is of good quality .
F	i have used your company about 0 times before and you have always been excellent , very polite and always here very quickly but sadly this time that was not the case as i was initially not given the emergency_number and told that there would not be an apt for about 0_days as you wanted someone to be at home from 0 - 0 and as i work i had to wait but when i was given the emergency_number i thought that i would phone them and was told i could have an apt in 0_days instead having been told there were none available a few mins before .
F	would not recommend getting the smallest_size at all !
F	of satisfactory quality and
M	not impressed at all with the service
M	my grandma was extremely disappointed , this is the worst customer service i '_ve ever_experienced .
M	fantastic !
M	well_done broadbandbuyer and all who make it possible .
F	maybe it would have been easier just to go to the next town and buy one from the store .
M	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know whats_going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
M	i got news that some work would be heading my way that meant i would need parts of my order sooner_than_expected .
M	i had to call them to get an engineer to come out and fix the fault .
M	night_freight are need easy to contact to get an update on the delivery time .
F	the mud , hairs and slobber from my yellow labrador is contained within the liner which is very easy to clean .
F	the flowers were delivered to completely the wrong_address and area .
F	but not before i had asked several_times .
M	good idea and easy to use website .
M	useless .
F	we oordered a jaws fancy_dress outfit for my husband he as not worn it yet will send a review after the party x
F	i love them !
F	the delivery driver left them in the back garden on full sun .
F	next phone_call was told it had left their_offices and was on its way .
F	i say if it has 0 pieces that have to be put_together that that is hardly minimal_assembly . it '_s flat_pack !
M	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
M	first puchase went without_any problem and was delivered in a few_days .
M	!
F	this company was very helpful and i took out a contract with them .
M	have found them to be very quick and reliable .
F	it cost me over_£_00 and was not value for money .
M	enough is enough !
M	have been with them 0 years .
M	i had no reply using the website so i tried e_- mailing but after a week had to ring twice as i had had no reply to the email .
F	there was no leaflet whatsoever in the box .
F	i tried to change my hire from a sat pick_up to a fri pick_up , emailed in my changes on the wed and found out 0 hours before i was due to pick_up my hire_car , as i was getting off the plane i might_add , that they couldn_'_t change my hire .
F	great service .
F	fast efficient and best value
M	really can '_t ask for better_than that
M	it saves us all time , troubling traffic and money .
F	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
F	hence in hindsight i think the company just used high pressure_sales tactics ( including pressurising me to join before the april end of tax year increase ) to get the business .
F	excellent packing !
F	i purchased an item of nightwear 0_weeks_ago
F	i ordered a protec riot helmet for my sons_birthday ( 0_weeks prior ) - after 0_days i heard_nothing on dispatch so when i chased i heard it was still coming from a store - nothing on my order said it wasn_'_t in stock .
F	one of my parcels arrived with no bubble_wrap , the boxes of stronghold / frontline were crushed inside , the second order can fully wrapped but after a telephone_conversation with them they said i could have more advantix / stronghold [ which i was told was left on my perscription ],, then viovet telephoned to say ther was a mistake and i couldnt have anymore perscription order , i had a lengthy conversation with them , viovet need to shake themselves up or they might loose customers .
M	ordered flowers quite late friday_afternoon for saturday delivery ,
M	i refused and asked for these to be collected and replaced .
M	there is no one i can talk to and no info at all .
M	we didn_'_t take the option of the installation service .
F	delivery took over a week which , compared to other_websites and especially amazin , is just too long .
M	had i not rang , i would not have known what was going on , or been in limbo .
F	thanks , eflorist for taking my money and in return , delivering nothing .
M	one instance when my supplements where dalayed getting delivered but this was due to interlink_express not affordable_supplements !
F	!
M	have absolutely no_complaints and paid £_00 less for these two than i paid for one at my otherwise excellent , independent high_street_optician .
F	previous post in error , thought it was in relation to airport_parking - travel_insurance was for childs application - on line application is ok if no medical underwriting required .
M	0_star service
M	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital_photos .
M	superb customer service
M	both these rakes appeared to be poorly_constructed in that in each case the head was loose on the handle and there appeared to be no way to tighten it .
M	shipping was prompt and delivery was earlier_than_expected .
F	searched and searched on the internet for a decent well made good looking back pack and spent a long time doing this before stumbling onto this site - immediately saw it was what i had been looking for - easy to use website , varied prices - ordered exactly_what i had had in mind , what my son had asked for - it arrived promptly .
M	my usb_cards look great .
M	i called them at 0000 today , they suggested they would call to fix tonight between 0000 and 0000 .
M	i recently wanted to downgrade my tarrif as i was paying far too much for for the minutes and texts that i actually use .
F	since then i '_ve had almost daily emails re collection an there have been 0 or0 ( i '_ve lost_count ) attempts to collect it from my house .
M	it was brill thanks a lot . atb .
F	complained to lastminute . com who said they were seats with a good view - only with binnoculars and if you are a contortionist !
M	the most_recent offer was £_00 ….… an_absolute insult .
M	the site was okay and the staff were helpful , but when ordering multiple items it isnt ' clear that you need to hit the update button for the numbers to take .
M	had 0 appointments to my flat for a various bs engineers to fix a problem .
F	my phone line was supposed to be fixed on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	!
F	i have purchased several deals in the past .

F	hi there as i said this company is brilliant when you order stuff , i wouldnt shop anywhere_else for my pet_food
F	paid £ 0 . 00 delivery weeks_ago .
M	none had next_day extra payments on them .
M	basically stood outside gatwick for the best part of an_hour waiting for the car to be returned with people wandering_around saying they were going to call the police as they could not get their car back .
F	so was very disappointed and had no choice but to go elsewhere !
M	very fast delivery
F	it was for a ninetieth birthday_gift and i wanted the flowers to arrive on the day as a surprise .
M	i was very impressed with the speed of service - i ordered a euskaltel winter_jacket which arrived in three_days in perfect_condition - and was a perfect fit .
M	and that '_s exactly_what happened .
F	sometimes hit or miss
F	the necessary_forms included makes returns easy too , although i have kept all my purchases !
M	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
F	cheaper_than chips antihistamine tablets and super_fast delivery .
M	very easy to deal with , great communication and quick delivery
F	we ordered one day and recieved our coffee_machine the next .
M	my friends were all completed shocked , as gakk has always been seen as upstanding .
M	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
M	tyre_shopper is an excellent website that i have used twice in the last_week .
F	the kitchen was well stocked with just about every implement and dish you could want .
M	the product arrived within 00_hours , - excellent !
F	we gave up .
M	can believe that if i was going with a run of the mill industry ( tiling , hairdressing etc ) it would have been a breeze to use .
F	really ease to use to log phone , then receive pack and post back .
F	it was very , very hard to fill it out since it did not apply to the kind of trip i had taken .
F	excellent quality products
M	i have used xendpay now for sending regular monthly_payments to thailand to my fiance for the last 0 months .
F	tried the 00hr , 0 day week rentalcars helpline to see if they had any ideas .
F	but it was quick and easy by phone and the technician arrived on time the next_day , was communicative and helpful and got the job_done while i carried on working .
M	!
M	to top it all , the price i paid was quite a saving to the prices i had been quoted from other local_garages .
F	i can '_t fault the service .
M	if so , then i will put this down to lack of communication , and will withdraw my judgment as expressed in my comment heading above .
F	this company charges £_00 . 00 for a domestic service .
F	not a very good experience really !
M	i am , like most teens - on facebook .
F	i asked for a refund and i am still_waiting three_weeks_later .
M	have banked with smile since_0000 .
M	so i placed an order before 0pm on the 00th , the postal option i chose was next_day .
F	great range of products .
F	unfortunately they don_'_t fit or do the job they ' re needed to do and i will have to attempt to send them back and order the right ones which come in packs of 0 when i need 0 .
F	i placed my order online on this occasion which arrived quickly .
F	the delivery was very fast and the man was friendly .
M	the website was easy to use and my order was available before the 00 day expected delivery time .
F	arghhhh
F	sold by iflorist
M	fitting_centre fine and no_complaints .
F	i have bought these sofas previously for other properties and they are great , no negotiating stairs , doorways or damaged walls
F	ordered my fridge_freezer at half past 0 on sunday_night , it was delivered at 0 o_clock monday_morning !
M	i hadn_'_t realised how the ticket i received on entering was printed out with my registration and recognised my car at the exit !
F	best price and an excelent service .
F	the goods were delivered very quickly , much_quicker_than the website said , which was great , as they arrived before the christmas break .
F	another surprise was when we arrived . i couldn_'_t find anybody for few_minutes . and when i finally found the lady ( she was very nice ) she asked me for a keys and we have to leave the car and she was parking it in .
M	would def reccommend !!!
M	sadly .
M	i ordered three products and i was kept waiting because the third product did not arrive .
M	no .
F	i went to las_vegas this year with virgin ( direct ) and we all went economy class there and back but my brother went premium class on the way back only .
M	just an update on the useless company that is waeplus .
F	perhaps because of easter , but the delivery took longer_than_expected and , annoyingly , having placed instructions on the order to leave the parcel in the back porch , it was returned to the post_office sorting_office requiring a 00 mile_round_trip to collect .
M	still , constant contradictions , mobile service outages and rude staff aside , they ' re doing a fine job .
M	after two_days of making my booking i still hadn_'_t received my email confirmation so i called to find that they had entered the wrong email address .
F	i have since stopped taking them and had no further problems .
M	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
M	poor .
M	i have had a nightmare with this company .
M	and again after my letter to customer service they ask me to wait 0 days more and i am not sure that these_guys supposed to do anything .
F	would recommend to anyone !
F	throughout the ordering process we were kept_informed of our order .
F	in fact they have failed to collect every one , thats around 0 , these last few_months .
M	i had to organise my day around an all day delivery slot , albeit that the slot was later shortened but then the driver came early .
F	but all batterirs service without fault .
M	how can i review when my order hasn_'_t arrived , when goods get despatched via parcel_force from london they normally arrive the following_day .
F	response to queries was quick
F	i '_ve also used kgb_deals , no_problems getting customer support or refunds with them .
F	they don_'_t send one out and i reordered as i though the original request hadn_'_t gone_through .
F	we found the ordering and delivery service worked within our expectations , which was good .
F	what she got was a little bunch that looked nothing like the picture .
M	the person i spoke to said yes they do part_ex & reccomended that i send them photos and they would get back to me .
F	obviously can '_t_believe they are that cheap .
M	the coverage is getting worse , my parents and sisters houses now have virtually no signal when they used to get a decent signal .
F	i love figgys .
F	bathroom was delivered exactly when they said , everything was there .
F	it was very unsatisfctory - and i cannot see the point in paying extra when it makes no difference to delivery time .
F	the tracking email cane through . from ups .
M	the delivery service is quick simply out of this world and the quality of the dress is perfect .
F	haven_'_t yet received my order as i only placed it this morning .
M	on top of all that it was delivered the very next_day .
M	i placed an order and was told it would take 00days to be delivered .
M	i cant say enough to bump these_guys up , it was an excellent experience throughout and i now sit cooing over my very shiney beast of a machine
M	instead of having me wait patiently for over a week with no word .
F	the process of ordering online was slow and i must have pressed the ' selenium ' button too many_times .
F	lee anderson fitted my new tyres very quickly and efficiently , very smiley and a lovely person would definitely recommend the company to a friend in the future .
F	on a positive the people were nice who i spoke to .
F	why this mess ???????
M	i have used first 0 magnets three more times for repeat_orders .
F	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
F	i ordered fairy wing from party_domain and it broke from the middle when i was trying it on . i sent an_email to their customer service department and they apologized and asked me to send a picture of broken wings . i tried sending them an_email with the picture on the same email address and each time i got message failure delivery report . i think they blocked my email address to balk any further email correspondence . worst quality product and worst customer service .
F	really good woulg use again
F	!
M	in fact i ' d liken the site to the best off - license you could_find , with knowledgeable_staff and a no_nonsense attitude !
F	it didn_'_t fix the issue and the person in store refused to change the phone until i had a long conversation with a manager over the phone .
M	most people expect a bit of a surcharge when they are part of a captive_audience but when faced with pricing like this , if they are anything like me they become stubborn and refuse to buy virtually anything .
F	i would have liked to speak to a representative regarding our order , as a result we received too many envelopes and although we ordered everything in blue ink , the return address on the envelopes came in black_ink .
F	i will no_longer be using any other place than cash in your gadgets , brilliant , with excellent communication .
F	the guy in question wasnt there , half day or something so i spoke to another who rang the guy and he said he couldnt get the parts !
M	the salesmen really need to tell you more about what the delivery drivers will and wont do and give you the chance to go away and measure up before you buy
F	great brands of gear on offer .
F	tiny shower_head over the toilet_seat isn_'_t very practicable . slept fine couldn_'_t hear a thing , very comfy beds but could do with another pillow .
M	placed an order at 0 . 00pm & arrived next_morning !
M	they have no interest in your order , your needs or how much you spend .
F	efficient service .
M	would be great to get up a load of prices and flight they are available from after a few simple steps so you can make a choice .
M	great service and value for money all_round

M	the bike itself was has_been excellent so_far and has_been a pleasure to ride .

M	i have to say my experience so_far is excellent .
M	ordered my oakleys over the phone and was told 0 to 0 working_days i will have them .
M	the site was very easy to you and delivery and tracking_system was exactly_what i want can '_t fault it .
M	i ordered 00 x 0 item , 0 were dispatched ( notified of 00 ) and payment taken for only 0 in a timely_manner , 0 arrived tow days after order , marvellous .
M	unreliable
F	paid for the 00_hours service to take my things back up to university but it didn_'_t arrive on the day it should have - instead , on the following_day .
F	i ordered on the internet ony so i could view them and received the day after .
M	time from order to arrival very slow apart_from that ok .
F	phoned and held on for 00_minutes - gave up .
F	serenta did upgrade flowers on recognition of failure to deliver but would have prefered the small bunch on the day than a bigger_bunch 0_days late !
M	after_contacting shower_seal they dispatched the order again and it has arrived successfully and on the correct day .
F	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
F	she had checked to see a replacement was in stock and we received it the following_day .
M	the website is better but the app makes finding some details hard to find .
M	i used lenses for hire_ltd for the first time and it was worth it :) got nikon 00 - 00 f . 0 . 0 for a weekend .
M	i had to pull apart bits and re - stitch as it was done so badly .

F	they arrived the next_day & as requested were delivered after 00am .
F	i was looking for a set of decent kitchen_knives that will last .
M	after inquiry to tyreleader they supplied my chosen make with ultra_fast delivery at an amazing cost .
M	!
M	this time i ordered items that were the cheapest i had found on the web , and delivered free ( which was incredibly fast for free - 0 days ).
M	shopping at suppliment warehouse is really is like breathing fresh_air :
M	no e_- mail - no refund .
M	i bought the blind form the excellent website and this was duely delivered reasonably promptly a week or so later .
M	thank_you
F	i emailed you from the states .
M	try to be a bit specific and what penalty do the suppliers suffer ?)
M	i have logged a complaint with tyre_shopper and will be seeking_advice from trading_standards
F	although this came at an extra_cost out of my pocket it was worth it to have the children '_s t - shirts ready .
F	eventually it turned_up but considering how slick some other operators are with their delivery systems this is behind the times in my opinion .
M	sent another chaser for them to ignore .
F	although the order arrived within the delivery timescale i think the delivery options are too long .
F	what '_s the point of independent and honest review if it '_s censored .?
F	i asked why was this ?
M	we had a quick_turnaround on the trampoline order but the courier sent one of the 0 boxes to the wrong depot .

M	!
F	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .

M	my only complaint is that they had been tried on previously and the soles were quite dirty , but did not look as though they had been worn for a round of golf so i kept them .
M	i needed the unit for a rehearsal that weekend so sending it back was not an option so i agreed to test it for a few_days before_deciding what to do .
M	i understand its such a hive of activity ; but so is google - and they don_'_t seem to have a problem ( thinking of all their services mail , search , checkout , translate , maps , picasa , buzz etc_.)
M	since then i '_ve spoken to 0 people who have promised call_backs and it will be solved but i never get them or get an email back when i chase them .
M	my nephews will be thrilled with them .
M	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn_'_t receive anything - and that they don_'_t know about delivery to stores at all .
M	0 excellent .
M	don_'_t use them .
F	after a few more days they hadn_'_t replied so i raised a dispute through paypal .
F	would visit the site again .

F	the ham was opened when i received it and smelling quite badly .
F	i hope you have a very good explaination for not booking me on the flight and causing me a lot of unecssary stress and upset while trying to travel back home .
F	flight delayed out of my control .
F	i always get my cosmetics from beauty_bay because they have such a great selection and it saves me having to visit every department_store on oxford_street to stock up on all my essentials ( i '_m quite addicted to make - up !).
F	nothing but trouble , keep thining ill try again but always some issue !!
F	offered me an_alternative but difference was that this was not a run flat as i requested and need for my vehicle .
M	the shipping is very fast and the products have never been missing or misplaced .
M	they may look cheap , but when you factor in the cost of their awful customer service , you will regret you didnt go_elsewhere .
F	it appears that no - one else had bothered to pick_up the emails in his absence and i eventually got a reply about 00_hours_later .
F	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer_screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
F	holidayautos was based outside of the airport which i didn_'_t know and had to ask another car rep where i could find them and then walk to their office and drive back to airport to pick_up family .
F	i read_reviews on everything i go to do online , as i '_ve been ripped before i was sending a galaxy_note and got a good price , i thought i would get ripped but i didn_'_t money straight_into my bank i was impressed xxx
F	convinient appointments are very hard to come by - there are no evening or weekend timeslots and i often have to wait weeks ( only to then be kept waiting half an_hour in the waiting room !).
F	my puppy cake mix has exploded all over the new toy and dog_food .
M	more_importantly was charged 0 . 00_euros_per_litre when the going rate on the algarve was 0 . 00 .
F	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
M	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
M	i checked my account and it seemed that they had an authorised payment from the bank , they said they didn_'_t , which was a lie .
F	booked tickets for lionel richie for my mams birthday on 00 . 00 . 00 and concert is tomorrow 00 . 00 . 00 and have still not received tickets or any email_confirmation that tickets are arriving which is the protcol that the website specifies is supposed to happen .
F	it was then sent to the local post_office and was informed i couldn_'_t pick it up for 00_hours .
F	believing this to be a fraud attempt ( due to it being the same amount ) my card_issuer did in fact decline this attempt ( and i am very glad they did or this company would now have 0 lots of money from me for the same order that they are saying i won_'_t receive because my card was declined ).
F	the flowers shown on the website that i thought i was ordering looking nothing like the flowers that were received .
M	rest of order remains undelivered as at 00 october
F	it is unlikely i will be using them again .
M	after sales were great when i had a query
M	excellent quality .
F	very good service and cheap , value for money , no_problems with them .
M	the return went fast and sooth pleasant staff .
F	because i couldn `_t get the threads i needed from local stockists i went straight to the dmc website and they were ordered , processed and delivered all within four days as it was over a weekend .
M	excellent company , always quickly delivered and i would recommend anybody to use animeddirect .
F	?
M	wae still refuse to refund my own money .
M	ordered some product then i was told one item was out off stock so i would have to wait over a week for the item to come in they would not send the other items because they said the order was then to small don_'_t see how that is my fault .
F	thank_you very much .
M	jokers !
M	i purchased a acer_laptop with a £_000 cash_back offer , this i duely filled in a posted ( registered ) to them in the timeframe as per there terms and conditions .

F	website very easy to use , quick delivery .
F	yes she says .
M	yes what can one say really great service actually received the package two_days early super service will be using in the near_future as i have been searching for such a great company with thanks
F	ha0 0yh
M	it was fast , respectful , polite and generous response to what was essentially only a forwarding to a new domain query .
M	as yet i '_ve had no need to contact ao after sales but am confident it would be a smooth process .
M	avoid - dont be lured by cheap looking tariffs , will end up costing a fortune in data and over allowance fees , its that bad i just bought myself out of two contacts a year early , and still end up better off going with three .
M	they are very pushy , and only interested in trying to secure a sale / commission .
F	i ordered a couple of things for dressing as a medieval queen for a music_festival . stuff arrived in good time and everything was fine apart_from the fact that i giot a blue dress instead of a green one . no explanation as to why .
F	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can '_t contact via phone ).
F	i have logged a dispute / claim with paypal and i encourage anybody_else who experienced the same as me and many others to do the same ( either their credit_card company or paypal if that '_s how they paid ).
F	hostelbookers had great information on the hotel , as well as photos and reviews .
M	!
M	so_far ordering on line has_been extreamly simple and what is more cheaper_than going to the tyre garage direct saving between £ 0 . 00 to £_00 . 00 make a few minutes work profitable
F	service very good , and very helpful ,
F	i also emailed daily sometimes twice to ensure vetsuk got the message i needed the medication urgently for my sick pet .
M	don_'_t get me wrong i really liked being an e . on customer .
F	they may sound cheap but if they take your money , hold on to it for a few month and never send the goods , it is very expensive !
M	instead they were sent in the makers boxes with no effort made whatsoever to place them on the skis .
M	0 .
F	in this day and age surely they can tell you morning or afternoon .
M	their website to return it just put me in a loop .
M	customer service took longer_than promised to respond and sent technician to review furniture .
M	the laser_engraving that we had requested was really impressive .
M	many_thanks to all the team there for what i call true sevice
M	i am very disappointed with the service .
F	i used to shop at tesco every week and loved the clubcard_points_system but after a bad shopping_experience where the aisles where all blocked off with cages for stacking shelves , getting to the till and there be no bags ( i lived on the third storey ) and them turning the lights off an_hour before closing i wrote a letter complaining_about the low standard i recieved .
M	if only all companies were like this .
M	magic_madhouse has a great selection of cards .
F	i have ordered several books now .
F	i have placed several orders with peak_nutrition and have had fast and efficient delivery each time .
M	as a constructive side perhaps you could price in gb pounds , otherwise no problem
F	my mum and i decided to share the 000_euros cost of a taxi to the airport and got there in 00_mins flat , enjoying an extra few hours in the resort and not stuck on the coach from hell .
M	a little something back is always nice .
F	i '_ve never had any_problems .
M	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
F	five_star operation !
F	impressive service .
M	i returned faulty etymotic earphones in april for replacement under_warranty and 0 months later have not received a replacement .
F	a good selection of goods at a fair price , the shop is good for funky stuff , i wish they stocked more quality seed_beads and findings .
M	now waiting for the parts delivered to be uplifted .
M	so i '_m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
F	i was disappointed to find that some of the flowers sent to my friend for her 00th_birthday were substandard ie dead or decayed .
M	product was as_described and excellent quality ; would have no_hesitation in recommending anyone to use the site .
M	we have flown from stansted on several_occasions and were very impressed with parking through looking0parking .
F	highly_recommended !
F	i wanted my office to be more open plan and contacted aspect about removing some partition walls .
M	note that there '_s ostensibly nothing to stop anyone doing this on anyvan .
F	i work away mon to wed each week and i am now told that they don_'_t have any delivery slots available for thurs / fridays so can '_t tell me when i will get my replacement .
M	customer_services were very unhelpful suggesting that i hadn_'_t read the instructions throughly even_though i highlighted some of the unspecific guidance on assembly ( which they have not noted or intend to change ). will shop around when buying summer_house as i '_m not too confident with quality of instructions and level of customer service .
F	!
M	from a work point of view , very annoying as men were scheduled to install , but at_least they rang .
M	signed_up in june_0000 , service worked for one month then technical_issues started , tech_support very poor .
M	skyone seem to be one of the poorer operators , and i would think_twice before using skyone again .
M	other issues are the html - only emails you send ( such as the one inviting me to fill out this survey ).
F	handy having someone_else sort_out money .
M	bought item on the 0 / 0 /_0000 by paypal still_waiting on delivery ( 00 / 0 /_0000 ). received items from the states quicker .
M	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
M	sadly this is not the case .
F	this is why payment is taken by the hotel directly upon check - in / out .
M	i won_'_t use you again
M	fast efficent service , i was all paid up in less_than a week from registering online .
M	they have good prices .
M	we stayed overnight in a fantastic hotel and dfds took care of it all .
M	they issued me a refund a week_later with a cheque that took another week to clear and to make it up they said we will offer you free_postage when you order again !
F	thanks , this service always works well for me on my annual visit to the uk .
F	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0_days !!!!!!
M	during the order process i had to phone them to enquire_about a few items , they were very friendly and efficient .
M	this company had performed fine when its in stock and it arrives but if you have a problem don_’_t expect it to be sorted soon .
M	the other items were dirty and had been repackaged badly .
M	!
M	if you ' re desperate then try you luck otherwise find someone more professional .
M	worth it if you either do high intensity sport and are regularly at the gym .
F	mine sadly wasn_'_t .
F	at the same time , i got an e_- mail checking i was happy with the transaction , to which i replied re : the e_- mail saying my orfder would not be posted until they had my reg no .
F	the customer service team via_email were great .
F	in fact a spray didn_'_t get delivered - a bunch of wilted chrysanths did and they looked like they '_d cost a couple of pounds and been sitting on a garage_forecourt for a week .
M	in hindsight i would have been better picking flowers up from my local_supermarket on the way home from work .
M	top quality goods plus cash_back
F	really horrid .
M	after ordering some cable tidy '_s for my new desk on the 00th_january , i only now have received them ( 0th_february ).
F	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 order generated
M	postage a bit expensive .
M	colours came out badly , especially yellows which came out almost green / grey .
F	it seems that the people in customer service don_'_t either .
F	my battery died and never have used etyre before .
M	soon after_placing the order and paying i was told it was not in stock and would be ten days .
M	quality service abs good price .
F	lots of choice in store but website was cluttered and difficult to browse which put me off initially .
F	in_spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
F	initially i was unsure_about buying my husbands_favourite_aftershave via this website because it was so much_cheaper_than in the store and i was concerned that it was the genuine product .
F	very bad service
M	that was not plumbingforless ltd fault , perhaps ( though the packing was minimal ).
M	they are not a big deal however i would of expected them to be in pristine_condition
F	i will definitely use e_- florist again , without_any doubt .
F	any accomadation that we wanted changing could have been , but we decided we didnt need to .
F	cushions arrived as said and they are lovely quality - infact hubs was really pleased and even said how nice they were .
F	excellent .
F	monitor your_own websites ( the website host won_'_t advise you when they are down )
M	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
F	as it took 0_days for the order to even be despatched !
M	ordered the blind and 0 days_later it '_s hanging up in my spare_bedroom .
F	for the holland in 0 day tour i was disappointed because although we visited three major cities we only drove through them .
F	absolutely poor customer service !
M	purchased protein as came highly_recommended .
F	my package took around 0 working_days to belgium which is amazing .
M	ordered an ssd on 00th_feb . and despite the website offering a 0 day delivery i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery with no reason .
F	i found everyone really helpful from my initial_enquiry through the process to purchase .
M	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
M	i place the order on january 00 , 0000 and it was shipped on fenruary 0 , 0000 .
F	i have decided i want nothing more whatsoever to do with your company & you can keep my money i am so appalled with your company that it is worth it just to get_rid of you and the stress caused out of my life , so pocket the money & i hope you do well with it & all the best for the future for you and your staff !
F	if you live_alone and work full time then best of luck , frankly .
M	from ordering to delivery to return and re - delivery was equally efficiently carried .
M	the fire_alarm went off at 0 . 00am and no body knew what to do , it was over 00_minutes before everyone came out and because of the chaos we ended_up paying for a taxi to get us to the airport .
M	well as yet i '_m still_waiting on my order !
M	i ordered 0000_flyers and 000 business_cards as a trial run for my company , the quality service and speed of dispatch were far far better then any other company i have dealt_with and i will be ordering a lot more from them , i have also sent through their details for the next fsb news_letter as i consider them that good .
M	this is supposed to be my son '_s christmas_present .
F	i was a little_apprehensive_about attending this session as had been a while since i had attended a practical training_session .
F	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
F	it would apeal to a teenage school_play ground .
M	amazon can deliver within two_days of ordering when paying for the same price delivery .
F	the service was excellent with a really good idea of a ' check ' email to make_sure we were happy with the design .
M	- something i dont recall choosing so i suspect i didnt see a devious ' opt_out ' box on their website !)
F	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .
F	the email was ignored .
F	when i came back inside , however , a lot of the fleas seemed to have congregated around the bombs , and were still_alive .
F	0 mins later i get a call from the fitter to give me an_approximate_time he would be there .
F	so i '_m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
M	following a recent_purchase of a shower_tray , a small item - half a dozen small metal spring clips plus screws were missing from the package .
M	if you can '_t dispatch the correct item for whatever_reason , a quick curteous email to the customer explaining this , perhaps with a small apology would go a long way !
F	many_thanks .
M	we went on to the web_site , designed our house_sign , phoned through the order , three_weeks_later the house_sign was delivered excatly how we throught it would look like , i would recommend alantic signs to any one ,
M	great service , easy to use , fast and efficient . a +++++
F	i was quite cross by now .
F	many_thanks .
M	rang dpd and entered details again , same as before : didn_'_t recognise my details .
M	not to forget the discounted prices !
M	i really didn_'_t get real support as needed in many areas of difficulty that i faced .
M	00_minutes so_far .
F	i just want my front driveway repaired and the blackbox put back into the ground and new tar placed around it , this was dug up in november , when a new cable was installed , black box covering cable is on the pavement and people are tripping_over it as it is on a public pavement at the side of my driveway .
F	after about a week ( and after the review request from trustpilot !)
M	returning a car with no fuel is a horrible experience .
M	i '_ve had several deals from them .
F	i was asked to respond in an_email_saying whether or not these changes were acceptable whereupon my new e_- tickets could be issued .
M	oh , and the ' complaints team '.
F	i would not have kept it even if it did .
F	once the decision was made , the order was quickly expedited and efficiently delivered .
M	good connectivity and decent customer service .
M	of the first 00 reviews of the company concerned 0 have been contested !
M	i have used shower_doctor twice_now , both for components for my power_shower , i find the website is easy to use to find the correct_part for my shower , ( exploded , labelled shower diagram ) which enables me to get the correct_part first time .
F	the box was broken and the tool was sticking out so not a good
M	i was given three dates for delivery and on each date it didn_'_t show up with no warning beforehand that it wasn_'_t coming !
F	excellent services , excellent product and excellent price !
M	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
F	my friend was delighted with her flowers .
F	it was packaged well and delivered exactly when i wanted it .
F	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading_reviews .
M	great service step by step emails so u no where ur order no_problems at all
M	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
F	but extremely disappointed as not many flowers for the cost .
M	no info on account about status of order - e . g .
F	everyone concerned with the procedure were so wonderfully helpful and understood all my worries by explains every_step of the way .
F	didn_'_t pay for next_day !!
F	i have used asda online a few_times and they tend to get it right most of the time but on a few occasions i have had quite alot of stuff missing but when i have called them it has_been sorted_out straight_away
F	!
M	should have updated this a while ago !
F	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
M	don_'_t let your firm down by using substandard logistics , the service is a total package and the deliverers are your agents .
M	so please tell me why the f_** k would i shop with thrm again ?
F	we were very pleased with the whole purchase and service and would recommend table - tennis - table . co . uk .
F	i never received a confirmation_email , despite_emailing directly to ask for one , making it difficult to know if the order was definitely arriving .
F	the spray , however is ace , i really recommend it .
M	the " shipping " is free but the information on the website is very unclear , and for most people the distinction between shipping and handling is irrelevant .
M	everything fine but a wait of over an_hour to be served at rome fiumincino airport ( by hertz ) on a sunday_afternoon was dreadful .
M	i have nothing but praise for tredz , from the website , buying procedure and delivery everything has_been reliable and fast . would recommend them and use them again , well pleased .
M	transferered to another department . waited on hold for 00_mins and hung_up .
M	cracking service .
F	the short_distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird , at first i thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at_least 00_minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly , with back seats first and so on .
F	likewise , claiming that orders are despatched the same day is also over ambitious , mine was processed three business days_later .
M	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did '_t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
M	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add £_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
F	shoetique now are offering fitflop_boots , the only problem is that i cannot decide which ones to buy !
M	i order from solopress mainly_because they have fantastic products at sensible_prices .
M	no tyres yet - waiting for new date .
M	i waisted the best part of the day waiting in as i was given the wrong information about the progress of the parcel .
F	used twice first for filing_cabinet keys for work second time for window keys for home .
F	very incovenient and not what i paid for .
F	mum then had to wait 0_days before they could be redelivered which not only upset me but ruined the surprise for my mum .
M	good - look and feel , choosing prices per leg , good to support independent company
M	although the price may seem cheep the build quality can be maintained , regardless of this i would probably purchase again .
F	i have just taken out the policy , so have not finished all the paperwork .
F	i was so disappointed when i opened the box and saw my lights for the first time .
F	0 .
F	i searched the internet for meet and greet services and this one comes up as one .
M	easy order , great communication and super_fast delivery .
F	quick service
M	item arrived on time and was quite cheap , but customer_services were very poor indeed when something went wrong
M	i telephoned to find out what was happening & it all seemed very confused .
F	poor show serenata
M	i then goggled for reviews on these recyclers and cashmyphone came up as having the most reviews .
F	the web_site is very user_friendly .
F	from the moment i stepped inside the door , i have had nothing but first_class service : from receptionists to surgeons , everyone has_been kind , professional and absolutely know what they are doing .
M	good service
F	later i had an_email to say i could have a refund because they couldn_'_t deliver on the day so would give me an upgrade for delivery the following_day , which i agreed - so i asked for the flowers to be delivered after 0pm on the wednesday .
F	the product arrived a day after the event .!
M	the guy i talked to from replacement_keys showed commendable patience as i tried to figure_out why the keys i had bought apparently didn_'_t work .
M	having placed an order for food and cystease , i realised that 0 days had past and that i had recieved nothing .
F	they kept me waiting for over 0 0 / 0 hrs in the rain with no updates about stock etc .
M	lowest_price on the internet for the item , good follow_up and information on delivery , and received in good order and on time .
M	update - now april - no refund given - have had to fill in a visa form to get refund - now witing for that to be actioned .
M	pros_:
F	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
F	she went off to check on this several_times and ratyher than putting me on hold i could hear her muttering away to herself .
M	difficulty ordering on line i . e passwords / email not being recognized , quite frustrating as new customer !
M	however one of the 0 items i ordered was missing from the delivery and despite various emails i have had no response .
M	the flowers were great and much_admired , however , the enclosed vase was broken into many pieces and was unrepairable ( the box protecting it was quite crushed ) and delivery was rather late in the day ( early evening ) although on the correct day .
M	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
F	fantastc let you know from beginning to end when bein deliverd
F	time_slot for fitting of tyres was between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
M	thank_you oliver ,
F	the arrangement was delivered on time and my sister who saw the flowers thought they were very nice and good value for money .
M	i found this laughable , considering the poor quality of the first one and the fact that the first was only 00hrs old
M	these are the people on the front line so thank_goodness they are solid , it is so often not the case !
F	thank_you optimax , i am going to give it another go , have plucked_up the courage again to make another appointment , and will review after my experience .
M	publicity for oak_furniture_land
M	the old machine .
F	thank_you [ i bet you wished that you had never asked ] and my food has not arrived yet !
F	on the first day we had a very enjoyable trip around the sights of london .
F	:-( not impressed
F	as i moved down in the queue , my wait time started to go up .
F	professional , helpful , friendly , obliging and persistent in diagnosing my problem and doing their best to make me comfortable and working out practical , tailor_made solutions .
M	however , the payment was not made within the stated 00 days , hence only 0_star_rating .
F	this not being the case .
M	order process and delivery was good ; products not brilliant .
M	when checking my tickets confirmation , it stated it was same day return .
M	how fare iz that ?
M	the let_down was dealing_with dpd who were the courier company . hopeless .
M	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
M	i asked to speak to his_supervisor & was told " oh he '_ll only tell you ." thanks but i '_ll have a chat with him anyway if thats ok with you .
M	its now march 00th and i still_haven_'_t seen any refund to my account .
F	at this point i emailed to cancel the order . to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
F	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
M	stuffed full of traders - most of whose prices can be_beaten elsewhere .
F	the aroma is delicious .
M	avoid them like the plague .
M	easier than going to the shop and you can choose what you want !
F	this was annoying , since there was no solution and we had to travel in the cornish countriside !
F	has now filed a defence arguing that as our hard_drive was broken it s worthless " despite the fact thaey had allegedly just fitted £_000 worth of parts !!!
M	was very happy with the service , bought netbook for my son to help with his ' a ' levels .
F	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who_understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
M	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
M	why do i need a report for that .
F	when it arrived it was so vague as to be downright annoying .
F	!
M	i then tried collect_+ plus with better luck , and went with them .
M	nice and easy to book , very good deal for those on a budget and only a few_pounds to secure booking .
M	after much messing_around on the phone (" why not pay to accelerate your delivery .") re - booked for tomorrow .
F	people at work comment on what i '_m wearing .
M	not any more though .
F	i stated that i wanted a call today and that i wasn_’_t prepared to wait a week again for my shopping .
F	quarter of the price the vet would have charged for identical product !!!!!
F	i would definately use this company again and recommend them to others .
M	- it '_s the same standard high - street address as i use for everything else ).
F	so , pretty dreadful , but saved by simple exchange , which actually shouldn_'_t have been required in the first place .
M	i ordered a tv from 000 since they were the cheapest on the net .
F	the price is very competitive .
F	use them theyre great !!!!
F	eventually the tables were collected .
F	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
M	faultless review system resulting in great community communication .
M	for instance ( not disrespect ) i read quite often less experienced reviewers going to a particular restaurant saying that was the best tai , chinese , italian etc .
F	it was accepted by cpw local shop .
F	they were due to be delivered on sat but apparently yodal are completely_incompetent and can '_t find an estate that '_s been there for 0 years and despite always seeing their vans on our estate .
F	great service .
M	the problem was some of them looked a bit worse for wear , this still didnt detract_from the attention of the person_who they were for , but i would suggest that the people who make the arrangements check the flowers arent wilted or browning .
F	only down_side was that on completion date they couldn_'_t guarantee that someone would be in their office for the buyers to collect the keys .
F	shame as have another 0 people to send flowers too
M	it '_ll help me save up for my laser_eye_surgery and finally be rid of glasses altogether !
M	customer_relations team
M	would not_hesitate to use again .
F	it would better fitted on a two year_old !!
M	customer service was excellent however which mitigated somewhat the first impression of avis .
F	it was a real pain .
F	!
F	i love animed : they ' re fast , efficient and very pleasant if you need to speak to them on the phone .
M	ink works well and delivery two_days after order .
M	great views and outside space lovely to be able to walk to kassiopi in the evenings
M	seriously one to avoid at all costs , i guarantee any item they sell you can buy at_least half price and even more .
F	brilliant , thanks .
M	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could_find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	fantastic service and i will be back to shop with you .
M	daylight_robbery .
M	prompt service quality product , would definitely use again .
F	i feel like i have been tricked by them and when i complained they refused to reimburse_me .
F	with the bulbs also provided , we were set_up in no time .
M	the first arrived promptly and as_described .
M	at 00euro it could and should have been so much_better .
M	prosocceruk offers the most appauling service ( if you can call it that ) you will ever receive from an online_retailer !!!!!
F	the delivery was quick and presentation was nice but there was minimal flowers which i paid £_00 for and could of bought for £ 0 elsewhere or paid the same for alot more flowers and foliage .
M	one thing that really is frustrating ( and we know that all rental car companies do this now ) that you get hit with extra_insurance cost at airport !!!
M	would advise that nobody use this company .
F	unable to have stuff delivered to my work address i had to try contact them outside of work to have it delivered at another date .
M	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
F	horrendous_experience !!
M	i was able to talk to an advisor who was articulate , polite and knowledgeable .
M	i was told the product was out of stock , although the web_site did not indicate this and that it would be in today and dispatched for a monday delivery .
F	when i said about the aviva corporate discount , they said they did not have one and refused to honour the price via our aviva site ( the fault came after that ) and to add_insult to injury said if i found another company who could give that price they would match it .
F	it '_s so straightforward to get your voucher and really fast too .
F	ordered sunday_night on the web_site and delivered wednesday .
M	no updated emails - nothing .
F	briiliant service !
F	in my view , they are unreliable and the whole_experience of after care was annoying , time_consuming and frustrating .
F	then this is the website for you .
M	tyres and fitting at very competitive_prices .
M	in hindsight , i really believe that it was only by the grace of god that we got through unscathed .
M	the driver was prompt and courteous and i would have no_hesitation in using this company again .
M	awful customer service and don_'_t try to fix their mistakes .
M	0 days to deliver ( this was stated when ordering ) but come on guys !
F	all good with the exception of communication - there was absolutely no telephone_number available on the website and i sent an_email communication through the website and a direct email with regards to expected delivery date - neither of which got a response .
F	unfortunately the boots were too_big for me so decided to swap them for another pair ( from easy wellies ), this cost me a further £ 0 . 00 .
M	the teak garden_furniture has finally arrived and it is very , very , very good .
F	does yodel really expect anyone to sit in and not make a noise ( in case you miss the knock on the door ) for two_days ??
M	i had e_- mailed several companies to try to find a spare thermal fuse , none responded to my e_- mail except for uk spares , who listed the exact part , the model number it would fit , price , everything .
M	overall this was a company with no clue about customer service staffed by agressive employees who might be described as rude and patronising .
M	worst online outfit i have ever_encountered .
M	the online support was not very helpful so_far .
M	pros_:
F	when discussing the degree of wear during my repeat order , the salesperson immediately ordered replacement seats .
F	i ordered coir external door_mat , around mid day and received the item the following_day .
M	wickes is better_than both the other diy retailers . and there are other_retailers but they are so slow !
F	thank_you and well one .
F	you know you are backed_up by hostelworld so you are not afraid of the hostel beeing a fraud .
M	the time to go from northern_ireland to uk hub is too big a delay , i like the collect_+ concept of dropping in a store , but it is useless due to the delivery time , cannot use it for my everyday parcels i sell online other wise i could send a lot more , i still have to use royal_mail for consistency
M	i had to contact the online sales support who sorted_out my query efficiently without_any fuss .
M	the batteries will need replacing often if you stick with this .
M	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
F	the flowers were meant to be a surprise for my friends birthday so i asked for the flowers to be delivered last tuesday .
F	i am well pleased with the cat suit that i bought and going to wear it to a fetish club on the 00th of this month .
F	also being updated by text on my order and being phoned by delivery men on day of delivery was good customer service practice .
M	i suspect without the help of professional trade bodies and solicitor advice i would still be chasing .
M	did what it said on the tin , no problem
F	i normally wouldn_'_t mind but it was for a gift and i had paid specifically for next_day delivery and in plenty of time .
M	does_exactly_what it says on the tin , as they say .
F	anyone thinkin of ordering from here i would say ' go_ahead - u will not be disappointed ' - thanx again !!!
F	haven_'_t received it yet !
M	have recommended to friends before , would do same again .
M	the problem is that the possibility of " duty " was not mentioned during the purchase .
F	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
M	lousy firm , non_existent customer service , don , t bother with them .
F	now having a very comfortable sleep :-)
M	the screen is too complicated , if it was made simpler perhaps in terminology and function i am sure you would have more adopters .
M	i am never going to use your service again .
M	all went like_clockwork when ordering , followed_by an immediate
M	with the current_climate every_penny is important , especially when it '_s over £_000 . 00 .
M	tyres supplied at an extremely competitive price (£_00 per_tyre cheaper_than my usual fitter ) and i was kept up to date with my order status throughout .
M	gerard
F	hi
M	always pleased with amazon site .
F	paper craft .
M	when i asked the driver about the gaping opening at the top of the box , he said " thats how it was given to me " .
M	it states that :
F	my husband and i have been appalled by the service we have received from usb_flash_drive .
F	this is my eye_sight - rather important to me , but seemingly of little importance to the staff at newcastle '_s optical_express .
M	was promised a call back for a update , nothing .
F	the person whom i spoke just said it showed up as delivered and suggested i contacted royal_mail .
M	they refused to give a full and immediate_refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
M	a card for the 0 year_warranty from digitalrev came with the camera .
M	when delivered it had no elements of blue - green only and they will not provide a full_refund and cover the cost of pickup instead claim we have changed our mind .
F	paid for next_day delivery before 0 . 00 which was £_00 .
M	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
F	bought this toilet_seat after looking in all the usual diy and builders_merchants , this one was not the cheapest but it does compare_favourably with other more_expensive ones . i was very impressed by the quick delivery too .
F	i would like to say that course really worth it , i have learned a lot new stuff and i really enjoyed it .
F	the customer service rep who called me to confirm the rejection was rude and offensive , and lets_face it who_wants to be put out by a company who can '_t be bothered with your order - avoid don_'_t give this company something for nothing go direct !
M	many other_companies could_learn a thing or 0 about customer_services from powerbody .
M	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
F	and they regularly update their ranges meaning you can always find something new to treat_yourself to .
M	i can '_t fault the service that i have received from digital - rev .
M	these were promptly processed and i was pleased with the finished results .
M	very impressed by the texts_telling_me exactly where my order was at every_stage , 0 days from order to receipt .
M	took 0 . 0 days to unlock and was worth the wait , i thought it would of tool longer !
F	however , every_single time i book a courier with tnt i do seem to experience some kind of trouble .
F	the man bought them right into the house which was very helpful .
M	but they '_ve created a sports monopoly - the reason_why football costs so much .
F	price acceptable but tried to call to discuss medical_issues but not yet successful and call costs a fortune
M	we declined this and we offered a mercedes which seemed reasonable .
F	very clear_instructions on how to use the product .
F	big roomy villa with everything you would need for a great holiday .
M	still no lenses arrived by 00th_jan , so tried to contact by phone ( both options ) and no answer after 00_mins .
F	but wasn_'_t expecting it to be that quick .
M	i wanted to go from germany to london via eurostar .
F	i ordered a cabin case and was told it would be delivered on tuesday , got an_email on the monday and its said that it would be delivered that day and i could also track my delivery all day and it '_s was delivered at the time stated .
M	low brow sales .
M	still happy with the final product though .
M	a few_days_later i ordered the product and some more that i needed and the process was easy and fast .
M	it only took a few_days and the money was clear in my account .
F	the delivery came on time , there was a crack on bosch drawer .
M	a class company .
F	the quality of the worksurface is excellent , price brilliant and cannot_fault delivery , guys were really friendly and helpful .
F	order finally arrived on the following wednesday .
F	terrible experience all good on way out to holiday well on the way back wen eventually found car somebody had been using it the petrol had all been used and a bottle of water squashed i between car_seat and door there was quarter tank of petrol wen i left it and on return only 00miles of petrol just enough to get to petrol garage a bit_scary at night with young kids in car so no will not recommend .
M	second transaction of 0 tickets with a face value of £_00 , total £_00 , i was charged £_000 . 00 .

M	the price i paid including delivery for a black and decker powerfile was excellent , by far the cheapest !
F	well - made yes , but not the special present , in terms of looks , that i wanted .
M	i '_ve_used_tyreshopper a few_times now with excellent results , but on my most_recent order when my wife went to get them fitted they hadn_'_t had the tyres delivered . this put my wife '_s day out completely if you book a morning slot you expect them there , she arrived at 00am they still hadn_'_t been delivered at 00am .
F	today , i emailed all the board of directors of sportsdirect .
F	as stated above difficult to find validation point but friendly service

M	the product ( yamaha hs00m speakers ) is excellent !
F	!
F	0st_class service would recommend
F	!!
M	as weeks go by the price of the parking rises well on week which is unfair when using it so often .
M	using dpd for delivery is brilliant as their communication and tracking online system is simply the best .
F	they are worse_than useless - the entire company !
M	i can only truthfully say service is second to none .
M	they were in administration when i took the contract .
F	very pleased with the service .
F	when i pointed_out that there were not 00 items , he said that he knew that and to put in the comments box that only 00 items were delivered .

F	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0_weeks .
M	additionally the air_ram is so light and manoeuvrable with no flex to worry_about .
M	the photo_book took just over a week to deliver and the quality paper is excellent making my pictures really stand out and display to friends and family who have commented on the paper .

F	found a wash_basin and loo for £_00 . great value .

F	will_definately recommend .
M	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
M	todo sin problemas , pagina segura y de confianza .
M	unbelievably , the level was about 0 inches above the marks .
M	setting it up using the cd and booklet provided proved a problem as the cd '_s instruction was asking to use the lan cable to connect to some other device portrayed in the booklet , which i did not have .

F	really easy website and very quick delivery which is free as are any returns should the need_arise .

F	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn_'_t shower in both at once .
M	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
F	i will not be dealing_with these people again !
M	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave_me a full_refund .
F	eleanor and louise are always ready to help and to answer any_questions i have either by email or on the phone .
M	any_problems i had were sorted_out with little fuss .
F	from_start to finish duel were a nightmare .
M	the next_day delivery promise made for my three orders has always been met , with a helpful curier order tracking option .
F	as it happened the delivery man was in the area when he received a phone_call to change the delivery address , and my printer arrived within ten_minutes of talking to customer service !
M	if i ' d known it would have been fine , just needs more communication .
F	would definitely use this company again .
M	once he had finished he just moved on to the next customer without one word of communication .
F	excuses i received , yodel delivered to the wrong warehouse , oh it has not been dispatched as yet .
M	holiday_autos remains a good compelling way to go about car_hire .
M	there were notes not in use left on air cnditioning units , lounge fire ( which was realy needed ) and outside kitchen taps .

M	placed an order for 0 pairs of shoes .
M	none of them were able to provide this , and so i was loathe to part with my money .
M	compared to previous flowers i have purchased from seranata this was a poor show .
M	this one looks old - school and understated - will go perfectly with plain black santini bib_shorts .
F	however rather_than a spray of steel grass to balance the arrangement there was a solitary leaf which looked ridiculous on its own and was swiftly removed before i arranged them in a vase for her .
F	their prices are good and online customer service has always been excellent .
F	!
M	on the whole there is a great range of products and the quality is great .
M	would i purchase from this supplier again ?
M	rang them 00 min before arriving to gatwick and friendly man was ready waiting .
F	i will be intrigued to know if you do actually respond as you say in the email accompanying the review request .
M	which i had taken photo as proof .
M	the roses_died yesterday on 0 .
M	furthermore , i had witness the delivery man dropped the boxing , i '_m not too sure whether this caused the damage or somewhere_else during dispatch .
F	delivery was made a couple of days after_placing the order .
M	and now they have the cheek to demand payments totalling_£_000 .
M	came back at 00 . 00 at night after a meal with friends to find a very soggy box partially wedged under the car .
F	top rate !
F	they have both been very apologetic and i believe sincerely so .
M	i placed an order for a black sleeveless dress for my wife on friday_evening , expecting to get the item within a few_days .
F	on leaving the test centre i was told that i should try driving my car up and down the curb to see if that frees the seized part .
M	this morning , almost two_weeks after_placing the order i called them ( had to get the number of their parent_company from saynoto0000 . com as they don_'_t publish a phone number ) and was told the order was being sent back to them as the courier couldn_'_t find our address ( my work address which gets about 00 deliveries a day ).
F	they have been flexible with me if i needed to keep the lens for one more day and i really appreciated that .
M	the shop did look after me here keeping_me informed through email etc .
F	it was good speaking to someone_who was both pleasant and helpful .
F	i travel to scandinavian countries and the flights are always early
M	send fast , but did not send exact_model
M	please re - organise delivery immediately by contacting your driver and getting him to return forthwith ."

M	the idea of being_able to watch sky_tv on your laptop anywhere sounds_like a great idea right ?
M	email repeated below
M	not working now lasted about three_weeks then died again
M	i wouldn_'_t normally leave a negative response like this - most shops try hard , but for an_automated_response to be sent out like this to a dissatisfied customer smacks of clumsiness !
M	this was no good as they were a birthday surprise .
F	i would definitely use this website again
M	so moral of the story they are good sales people but if anything_goes_wrong its a different_story .
M	they didn_'_t , and after repeated_emails and a further call i '_ve had to resort back to my credit_card company to process a refund .
F	the length was very long - great for tall people but may need to be altered for those under 0 ' 0 " ( medium_size dress ).
F	they then suggested that i take the dress to get repaired ( frayed seams , puckered lining poor workmanship etc ) and the changes made at a dressmaker and they would give a refund of 00 %.
F	simple ordering system followed_by swift delivery .
F	can '_t expect much_better service than that :)
M	or tell me it ’_s on the terms and conditions .
F	i ordered this product on the advise from a nutritionist as i wanted a more protein intake , however after ordering the whey_protein online i discovered it contained milk and soy .
F	i cannot_believe i have not used you before you have delivered a brilliant service and cannot_fault you whatsoever .
M	found a reasonably_priced item on the tayna_batteries website and placed an order in late_afternoon .
F	however with some places that have bad_reviews you can see that the manager of the establishment has clearly created fake trip advisors account in order to give themselves a better rating .
M	i emailed countless_times and even found a number for the parent_company .
M	upon our insistence , after contact archos , they agreed for us to return the machine to them but that was 0 months_ago .
M	i '_m afraid i '_ve never received the advertised cash_back rate .
F	excellent delivery service .
M	i waited whilst they did the work , all ok .

M	promised emails and calls never come_back .
F	!
M	as i have paid £_00 . 00 for delivery i expect this to be method chosen .
M	it took 0 business days for me to get it delivered to sweden .
F	unfortunately the business has ceased_trading , it was a business_venture that didn_’_t work and unfortunately we all lost quite a bit of money which we are trying to recover from .
F	so , it took a week to get to me and my knees are in agony - i had ordered various things to help with my rehab as i '_ve got lots of events i need to prepare for and i '_m very upset with the way they dealt_with this , let_alone the poor communication .
M	order was dealt_with quickly and efficiently .

F	i '_ve ordered 0 bunches of flowers through them and 0 just didn_'_t turn_up !
F	would you like something_else ?"
F	they have been helpful and friendly and tried their hardest to get my orders to us .

F	i would definitely recommend this company and am very impressed with their quick , hassle_free service .
F	the next delivery day was for today - 00th - low and behold a van pulled up and it was them !
M	they arrived very quickly and looked very nice when installed .
F	i '_m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
M	i placed an order several weeks_ago and it is still outstanding .
F	when the tickets arrived i was shocked to find i had paid double what the ticket stated
F	jag valde lyx bukett på websidan , den dyraste men buketten jag fick var så liten jag undrar hur små de billigare buketterna var !!
F	they replied very quickly with advice and clear_instructions to try and rectify the problem .
M	buyer_beware
F	i was very impressed by the efficiency of this company when i placed my order for the sewing_machine over the telephone .
M	the fabric is very good quality , the problem is the mechanism .
F	always use this company if i can and recommend to others .
M	parts as identified , good price with excellent service
F	once product didn_'_t arrive i went_onto my account and under orders is where you see stock information .
M	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one . rediculous .
F	one final warning if you do decide to stay : when leaving your room , hide any newspapers that you are reading , as the housekeeper has a tendency to remove them from the room .
M	ordered and paid for two tyres online , only to have an email_telling_me the tyres i ordered are not available , and the only alternatives were £_00 dearer .
M	i purchased xbox_points for my son on monday jan 00st , these were to be sent immediately by email , by 00 . 00am the next_day having heard_nothing i telephoned gamesbite and was assured by a young_man that my order was being_processed , by 0 . 00pm still no response so back on the phone this time i was told they would be with me within the hour , 0 hour later still no xbox_points and surprise the office was now closed .

F	return did not happen .

M	i highly_recommend this web - site .
F	however , i received an_email on the 00st_january stating that my invitations had been dispatched and would be with me shortly .
M	this was late october and it was nearly dark before we got away , severely restricting our activities that day .
F	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
F	went along to winchester store today to see what all the ad fuss is about " voted britains best supermarket "
M	at this point i reminded them that i thought me radiator was leaking .
F	problem was no depot info on delivery card and no info either on website .
F	excellent service , wonderful product .
M	changed computers and original camera did not work on the new w0 set_up .
F	this bike is very good value for money and provides tough resistance for any level of rider .

M	0 had a snapped stem and many needed most of the petals and leaf '_s pulled off !
M	i then had the nightmare experience of actually trying to speak to someone at amazon , is anyone actually employed on customer service , no human voice can be found ?
F	we had a right struggle finding the correct_part , and had two failed_attempts with cheaper part suppliers and was just about to give up , then we tried partmaster .
F	very easy to book with but making a date change on a booking to the day before the cost was not what was mentioned on the website and was 00 pound to change it .
F	we received a text on the 0th to say delivery would now be the 0th ( i have the original e_mail with stating the 00th ).

M	i found rattan_direct on google , their easy to use website was vey formative .

M	i was assured the refund would be made in 0 / 0 working_days .
M	setting off was delayed , no reason_why .
F	really unhelpful that you can only access your order / customer servies with that confirmation_email in your possession .
F	( in the new style !)
F	back to information , 0 minutes later same member of staff comes round and ignores me further until the lady she is serving says , ' please serve the other lady as i am taking some time ' she did not want to serve me and then said ' next ', i said i am still_waiting for the flower delivery i told you about 00_minutes ago , she replied ' we are only two staff and busy with customers . she brought my flowers , put them down and said nothing , i said do i need to sign or is that it and she replied ' thats it '.
M	i must have made 0 - 0 phone_calls to them .
M	support email on the confirmation_email is a fake .
F	they continued to charge us for the next 0_months also !
M	this is particularly annoying in that yesterday i spent some time on the phone giving precise details of how to find my home and passed on my home number and mobile number .
F	thanks for all your help we were very happy with what we purchased good quality waistcoats !
M	they worked round myself with no issues and left the area clean and tidy once they finished .
M	0 april phone_call from manufacturers / delivery company , that the driver had " run out of hours " and they couldn_'_t deliver my order .
M	however , this was charged in addition the online order price .

M	the senior escalation manager keeps stating that my queries have all been answered , although they haven_'_t , and keeps closing my ticket ( the one complaining_about the other tickets not being answered ).

F	would definitely use the site again .
F	since 00st_july i have been fobbed_off with many excuses , the last one via_email last wednesday apologising (!)

M	item arrived very quickly .
M	they don_'_t use the royal_mail as far as i '_m aware and that '_s why most of the time your items arrive on time .
F	it cost £ 0000 yet was asked to pay £_00 for delivery although oak_furnitureland advertise free delivery .

M	the products are first_class ( and often unique ), prices are reasonable , delivery double quick , the sizing advice always spot on ( don_'_t take a bet with andy !)
F	my initial_enquiries by emails about a pair of swarovision binoculars were responded to swiftly .
M	my advice to anyone : do not use this company .
M	need to know when my parcel arrives for example am / pm to prevent loss of time at work .
M	i would '_ve thought she ' d have gotten this most_important detail nailed_down at the start .
M	simply faultless .
F	bought a raleigh swift folding bike , halfords have the best bargains for bikes and if there are any_problems you can always take it to the shop for service .

F	after_searching the internet for a dualit_toaster , this website was by far the most competitive in terms of price .
F	we were given a £ 0 voucher but this does not cover my costs .

M	they had what i wanted , it came quickly .
F	i have recommended to numerous friends over the years .
F	i would recommend to interparcel to remove this company from their list .
F	on time , friendly , expert_advice and well_worth the money .
M	already building a bit of a cult following amongst my cycling mates !
M	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
M	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
M	on the morning of the delivery i was sent a text_message to say that my package would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 it was delivered at 00 . 00 !
M	and the estimated delivery was 0_weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000 + in stock apparently .
M	communication .
F	i now don_'_t have the box as i didn_'_t need to send it with the phone .
F	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen_elsewhere .
M	had a problem when checking out ( no where to enter promo_codes ; order got split so no free delivery ).
F	!
M	customer service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an email .

M	its got to be the cheapest place ever for power_tools , i will never shop any where else for tools again
F	perfume arrived quickly and was packaged well .

F	excellent customer service , highly_recommended
M	however they assured me that i would receive the 0000 item as_described if that was what they were offering on their site , and if it was not so i could return it for a refund .
M	to my sheer_delight customer service got back to me saying that they would accept this late return , providing it was unused and new ( of course ).
M	for example l was looking for 0 , 000 c0 greeting_card bags . kite are £_00 per 0 , 000 plus_vat plus 00 delivery ' my current supplier is £_00 per 0 , 000 including_vat / delivery .
M	free wifi for just 00_minutes , they know that once you connect you will exceed this limit and they earn another £ 0 - after paying £_00 for one night i expect it free for the duration .
F	thanks
F	0 on 00st_december . email received back , with a different reference_number , saying the same thing , but with an additional note to say they may have to contact other people involved in the oreder / delivery process and to give them 00_hours to get back to me .

M	thanks

F	had to wait for my lens cos the box was too_big !!
F	this was followed the next_day by another email_confirming that the item would be sent , but then by yet another email the day after , telling us that the product had been changed and no_longer came with the freebie .
F	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
M	which effectively means that you almost always end up having to pick_up the item yourself from there depot .
M	product delivered the day after ordering , excellent service , product was great .
F	ordered some shoes for a special_occasion and paid_extra for next_day delivery .
F	the grim_reaper cloak is as_described , grim , black and a good fit for a size 00 " chest .

F	tried to order some kids sippy cups and for an item thats 0 . 00 they wanted me to pay 0 . 00 delivery - hence i did not buy !

F	when i phoned to query this i was told i had signed_up for a monthly delivery ( which is totally_untrue ).
F	we had to contact alpha_rooms who in turn had to contact someone_else and then get back to me .
M	but then thats probably a good thing as i would be tempted into buying more kit .
F	they were very pushy and persistant and most unwelcome , in the end i threatened to cancel my order ( over_£ 0000 worth ) if anyone phoned again .
M	however , prior to ordering , i did contact world_stores by phone , to ask about the amount of self_assembly there would be on these items , and he said " there is an element of self_assembly ".
M	but .
M	would definitely use again .
M	service and communication that matches ' the quality .
M	simply a class act easy use and extremely quick with the cash love it
M	otherwise you will sign up then be quoted £_000 per day , approx 0 days to carry out the work ( notice it has now dramatically gone up ) when you are unable to carry out the implementation yourself .
F	if i want to buy paper in future , i will need to exceed £_000 to get free_postage - proving the business doesn_'_t really cater for small start - ups like me who only want small volume delivery with affordable delivery .
M	good telephone service and product arrive every quickly .
F	i ordered the item on 00th_august by the 00 it still had not arrived and i had to make 0 phone_calls to find out where it was . spoke to a very nice lady_who said the item had been out of stock but i would get delivery the following_day . which i did . would like to have been informed of this before having to send unanswered e_mail and then 0 phone_calls . maybe just unlucky with this item and will use this site again . but a speedier delivery would be nice !
F	an in law wanted specific aftershave for birthday_gift , didnt particularly want to pay full price so searched online for cheap_smells , and hey_presto !
M	what did concern me was that i have an expensive car that i do cherish ., there was no personnel visible .
M	competitive priced products outstanding service fast delivery
M	this costume was awesome !
M	so with no ' apparent ' email or answering of the phone i was about to phone my bank for a chargeback .
M	we have done everything , even silly , thing they asked on mails in order to close this issue .
M	i phoned to cancel and was informed that i would be charged £_00 . 00 .
F	we sent flowers to my mum for her_birthday so did not see them arrive , but according to my dad ( who received the delivery ) the orchids were bruised as they had been sent in a box that did not support them as it was too_big .
M	i had a 0 year contract with this shameful company which i duly completed and then asked them to unlock my iphone as it was perfectly ok and i intended to take out a sim only deal with another_provider .
M	when i called i spoke to tim morrison , who was friendly , polite and pretty efficient .
F	i am happy with my purchase and the kerb ramps work a treat .
F	finally i rang their sales line as there is no number for customer_services .
F	i keep receiving emails from pharmacy0u on matters that are of no interest to me ( losing_weight , stopping_smoking , migraines , to name but three ).
F	at the end of the day its your advertising we book on and its your responsibility to check that what we are seeing is in fact in place and that your clients are looked after .
M	i would not_hesitate to buy again from them .
F	he came a hour early , no_complaints .
F	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
F	no answer to my numerous_emails . tried there online help service . thats a joke . and as for tying to get an answer on the phone . am i sick of hearing ' i '_m sorry ' etc . will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit . lesson_learned . never use this company .
F	i ordered a fleece_jacket from sportpursuit on 00th_november for my husband '_s christmas_present its now 00th_december and its still not come .
M	thanks .
M	the service i have received is non_existant and bordering on illegal in relation to the sales of goods_act .
M	kept in touch all the way through .
M	what i am unable to work out is why the delivery charges are so different .
F	everyone tells_me slow weight_loss is better_than fast but i am finding it hard to keep going without better results .
M	i find zero communications really bad for such a long repair / replacement time .
M	easy to do and money by return of post .
F	( a night '_s reservation deposit is never more than 0 pounds for me .)
M	it was initiated 0 days after returning the item . i was told by paypal there were insufficient funds in the account and they were having to extract money from the funding source which could take 0 - 0 working_days .
M	it is very democratic that everyone has an input but not everyone has the same standards .
F	i ordered flowers for my mother '_s birthday from eflorist , after myself receiving a nice bunch for my birthday from them .
F	omg .
M	if it wasn_'_t annoying it would have been a bit funny .
M	i have complained to abta as chillisauce are unwilling to accept fault .
M	i would return them but the very strict return_policy listed ( which i didn_'_t fully read ahead of time - that is stupidity on my part ) and the very high cost of shipping ( wow i had no idea that shipping a shoe box size item to the uk has_gone up to over $ 00us !!)
M	great for equipment and product range particularly clothing - however with success and the number of customers i think in the last two years there has_been a reduction in the quality of cservice
F	there was no - one available on any of the numbers i found online ( including calling denmark and scotland ), which for a home decor and home delivery service is pretty rubbish .
M	my milano cayos rads turned_up and i '_m pretty impressed .
F	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .
M	!
M	stress , extra_expense , phone_calls , inconvenience , customer service non_existant , rude_unhelpful staff , buyers_beware !
M	well_packaged , and faultless to a tee .
F	the glasses themselves were perfect !
M	firstly i thought it was a uk_based company and it '_s not .
M	i '_m sorry once again for giving the lowest rating so_far , but had the guy on the phone not been as polite as he was , it would have actually been lower !
F	when i rang customer service they weren_'_t very helpful as to when it would be in stock just told to keep looking
F	i would highly_recommend viovet and their excellent choice of courier .
M	a sincere thank_you for the help and suggestions given regarding the eternity_ring for sarah .
F	easy to book . no printer was needed . really cheap i was quoted £_000 .
F	this has meant that i was informed that it had not been delivered and could have caused me to have incorrect feedback .
M	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act_0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
F	the flowers were ordered at 0 . 00 am and we ' re not recieved until 0 . 00_pm .
M	also had message from scrappa ( because i meant to post another mobile_phone worth £_000 ), saying if i want to send another , it is strongly advice to post in for myself using recorded sign for post_office postage as they do not take anymore responsibility for prepaid 00hrs track postage which they send me .
M	rumours they are going broke , well is there any truth in that ?
M	however , order reference_number which was emailed to me so that i could track the delivery was incorrect so i had to guess when it would be delivered .
M	having the control to make amendments to your listing online rather_than having them dictated to you was a plus .
F	went on to there website and there is no phone number to phone and complain !
F	was happy with everything until 0 separate emails arrived from monarch and alpha_rooms .
F	if i hadn_'_t , i don_'_t think he '_d have stopped .
F	the last order i put in arrived two_days_later and their product is good quality .
F	i dealt_with nick jones who had great difficulty contacting me because i was at work , but kept me up to date with everything via_email , and replied promptly to all my emails .
F	they advertise amazing service , it is . but not in a good way .
F	i was very pleased with the sale items on offer but after_placing my order , due to the server being overloaded and therefore not updating its stock i received an_email_apologising saying they could not provide me with two of my products robots but would be sending one product as an_alternative this was fine .
F	now been advised that the beanbag won_'_t be in til march thats 0_months for a beanbag to arrive !!!
M	very happy with the service from dreams .
F	you must_try this site i have been more than satisfied .
F	they were very apologetic and advised the items had been received in their warehouse ( they ignored my comment that they were shown as being in stock when order was placed ) and were in the process of being booked in !
M	had happened still_waiting for item , it will not
M	site quite slow and takes a long time to do shopping
F	i love my new casserole .
F	there were 00 chocolates in the box which were very nice but duplicated so 0 of each .
M	ordered quickly and easily online and it was delivered when they said it would , now in todays society that is a real plus !
M	called them up and they got straight on to dewalt and arranged a replacement - excellent customer service , very impressed .
F	!
M	this did not arrive and i subsequently found out that it was no_longer being manufactured .
F	it was so refreshing to deal with a company who did everything to make_sure i got the correct product at the cheapest price .
M	0 .
M	luckily the seat had a plastic cover over most of it .
M	it looked like it was rushed and they couldn_'_t be_arsed to wrap them properly i would like my money back .
M	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
F	they have promptly dealt_with my enquiry and refund produced in a few_days .
F	however , received an_email afterwards offering a further 0 %_discount if i revisited the site when i had already made my booking which was a bit rough !
F	so now i have to wait for pah to get in contact with them .
M	only by checking the website re status of delivery did i find the order had been stopped due to out of stock and they never even bothered to inform_me .
M	don_'_t !!!!!
M	i asked [_name_] to ask the driver to arrive between 0 and 0 so that i didnt waste a further four hours of my time and he said that this was not possible .
M	i told her that the email confirmation said i could collect it on the friday and displayed the opening times of the post_office in question and said nothing about what time i could collect it .
M	many_thanks .
F	without the beauty of paypal & my quick suspicions i believe i would have been duped too .
M	i needed ink in a hurry for the daughter to finish her homework and it was there in 0 days .
F	i sent for x box with 0 games x box came minus the games very sad after my friend recommened it to me
F	they don_'_t understand your request at all , don_'_t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
F	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
M	i emailed these over and waited to hear back .
M	the fitting was carried_out at the same tyre company that had been used previously .
M	all to hard compared to other couriers .
F	so i can only_assume they just couldn_'_t be bothered to deliver . i '_m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
M	i then get in and the tank is on empty .
M	darstellung oft fehlerhaft .
F	thank_you , brilliant service fast delivery and best price on the internet , i will be returning .
M	anyway after a huge ordeal i got it re - delivered on the monday , no good to me at all ; and never got any kind of refund on the service !
M	i was told to use the web_site .
M	i will_definitely use glasses_direct for all of my purchases in years to come .
F	our suggestions for improving the service would be to keep website current and proactively contact customers if there is a delay .
F	the generator did not arrive .
F	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
M	as a result of this , any_queries sent to us over the weekend or on a uk public_holiday will not be answered until the next business day .
F	but i have to pay postage and packaging to send them to sweden .
M	transferring you to ebay .
F	it was easy to book online , i paid a deposit amount to suit me , got confirmation emails , accommodation vouchers and the rest of the payment was taken on the date agreed , no_fuss .
M	therefore my 0_star_rating is not pointed at their behaviour - rather the quality of the seeds that i received .
F	only " issue " with villa_plus was that we booked well in_advance but when we logged on to their website again a few_months before travel , we noticed that a 0 - bed villa right next door was on the website for approx .
F	website showed stock and order was placed , credit_card charged .
M	0 days_later they called to say that the item (' in stock ') on the website was actually out of stock and would not even reach their warehouse for nearly three_weeks .
M	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i '_ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit_disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt_seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
M	go in at 0 p . m . and get them fitted while i wait , all done by 0 . 00 p . m .
F	the furniture is lovely , solid and well made and you ' re kept up to date with delivery information .
F	i cannot find tyres cheaper after_trawling the net for hours .
F	when my boyfriend made the bed , the eneviatable scratchs were found but i have a bed now .
F	i was really disappointed with this , and my jacket was all creased up :-(
F	i was also impressed by the fact that , should i have had to return it , returns were free .
M	on receiving the glasses , it was obvious the information given to me was incorrect .
M	will never use floraqueen again !!
F	poor aftercare service , not interested now they have taken payment .
F	it '_s not easy to hold a fully laden bike and then do a hill start on a slippery metal ramp .
F	the service was excellent .
M	prices tend to be the lowest or very reasonable and i would recommend them to anyone .
F	( i '_ve tried on so many glasses and they just keep sending them !
M	i really like the text tracking updates from teh courier dpd and eta which was accurate within the stated hour .
F	expertly_packed and swiftly delivered .
M	next_day , still no email so phoned , was told by helpful lady that " her colleague was downloading my order " and i would get email with tracking_info " straight_away ".
F	\ website timed out with no explanation , very unproffessional
M	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
F	my order was delivered with damaged packaging and no contents .
M	es - wilts .
M	recipient got through to a human after 0 attempts on an 0000 number to be told the vanhad broken down so it wasnt just us affected and it might arrive on monday .
M	i had to try a number of times before my on line booking was accepted , although i kept clicking on the buy button , nothing happened and i had to log in again the following_day twice before the booking actually worked
F	0 wasted days off work .
M	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
F	i have having a lot of problems with virgin_media , to call them on the phone takes over 00min and most of the time its call_centers abroad and they are not very good with the british accent when yopu get thru to someone that understands , they take_note and you never frothemagain till you phone them back to remind them , my problem been going on since november last_year .
M	they are a bit more_expensive than i '_ve found elsewhere on the web .
F	i ordered my mum the candy_cane bouquet of pink_roses & lillies with chocolates to be delivered mothers_day .
F	i had a big problem just before christmas , having forgotten to send anything to my closest cousin and his_wife .
M	after that the process worked pretty well up to the point where payment was taken .
M	* in response to workwear_express reply *
M	thank_you for your prompt response to our request , will be using your site again soon .
M	still , the whole_process wasn_'_t too bad and the follow - up work done by the solicitors has_been very good .
F	you double charged for the flowers then they where not delivered to the person on the day and customer service was no help
F	items are always exactly as shown .
M	was pitch black and had to collect car scratches and all in the dark .
M	an awesome customer experience .
F	flght was cheap and on time , hense the 0_stars !
M	it had taken so long for this to happen that i could not be_bothered to return it for a replacement of the correct colour .
M	it was very easy to change ( i '_m just an ordinary householder / handyman ) and it worked like a dream from the word go , plus the added_bonus of a 0 year_guarantee .
F	i contact my dad several_times on mum '_s birthday to see if they had arrived , by 0pm i was a bit_worried that they weren ’_t going to arrive at all so called eflorist and to my horror i had inadvertently order postal delivery flowers not courier as expected .
M	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
M	i am hoping that the local service element will come into play , but have yet to see if it can indeed make up for hte shortcomings of the website management approach .
M	i travelled overseas and returned in late march when i realised that no refund was paid into my credit account .
M	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
M	in the end i was offered £ 0 of a new one .
F	we will be ordering more blinds in the future but will have to consider the service next time
F	really damaged my clients hair , on telling additional_lengths so they did try and rectify the problem but was still really not happy with product of euro hair
M	this was possibly not wae +' s fault but nonetheless remains deeply unimpressive !
F	i have found the people on the end of the phone when i have a query to be a bit stern and unfriendly to say the least , but you can '_t knock the prices and the stuff does always turn_up even if it takes a while .
F	nie wieder werde ih mit dieser firma irgendetwas zu tun haben .
F	i will not use tesco . com under any circumstances as it freezes my computer , yet i have never had a problem with any other site .
M	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
F	it '_s modern and very handy to get about , especially on the buses , and being such a vivid giraffe pattern i will find it in the dark .
M	i told them not to bother !!!
M	_______________________________________________________________
M	then wait for your drinks .
F	i for one am fed_up misleading images & information !
F	now have fully working led_lights , marvellous .
F	i have now found another outlet for my chains .
M	compared with supermarket clobber the chicken in particular is atleast twice the size .
M	this saved a considerable_amount of money backed by a standard uk warranty .
F	the delivery was on time and the guys on the lorry were polite and carried the tv_stand into the living_room for us .
M	very happy indeed .
M	i had an honest review on scs sofas removed for adding " avoid these_crooks " at the end which is neither offensive or obscene trustpilot seems to kow tow to the companies being reviewed !
M	will look at other_suppliers like indigo - herbs . co . uk and holland &_barrett
M	on advice from consumer direct will now send refund request by recorded delivery using all the right words .
M	absolutely superb customer service , along with speedy delivery .
M	after three phone_calls and 0 emails i am still outstanding any kind of respectful customer service or response .
F	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card provider .
F	first off , we had no contract with the manufacturer - if a company supplies goods , they should be responsible when something_goes_wrong .
M	ordered , delivered next_day
F	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
M	prices were great , information up to date - a refreshing start .
F	one would be better off to take the train to the castle and go on their own and have plenty of time to see all that there is to see .
F	i phoned up and spoke to a very helpful lady_who even gave_me a discount as it was my first order .
F	we unpacked the cooker to discover that the cooker was badly_damaged the grill was dis - lodged from the main frame cooker , the back was bent and the cooker glass smashed .
M	both more aged ladies that would have really liked a lovely_bouquet of flowers to lighten the mood and put a smile on their faces - serenata_flowers failed .
F	the store was well staffed although all staff were downstairs so we had to go and find someone when we were ready to purchase .
M	it took 0_weeks from placing order until i received it .
M	i found the web_site easy to navigate .
F	would definitely deal with this company again and i recommend anyone to do so .
M	!
F	the tyre_fitter undertook the replacement of four tyres promptly .
M	checked all my stuff from e0save and it '_s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc_etc .
F	went online , easily found the product i needed and it was delivered the very next_day - to my door !
M	i have received a faulty product , appliances direct are now ignoring my messages to them .
F	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
M	beware of less well_known recycling_firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
F	thank_you marlows for my beautiful sparkles .
M	given i paid £ 0 . 00 not worth the hassle of returning !
F	they keep trying to brush it off like there is nothing they can do .
F	staff were unhappy , unhelpful and made mistakes , refused to open additional registers , leading to long unnecessary lines .
M	0 .
F	i received a phone_call soon after & went through all my details with the person .
M	cheaper_than garages and easier than calling and searching for replacement tyres .
F	i have had to order another one .
F	all i can say is , this company is lucky to have a lady like maxine working in customer service !
F	at the end of my tether with them and clueless as to what they wanted , i went_onto photobucket and created a collage of 0 photos showing the damage .
M	ordered on wed_night , order processed on thu and ready to deliver on friday however was able to email back customer service on thu to postpone to mutually convenient monday , called local delivery depot and was given approximate_time of delivery so saved waiting in all day .
M	i '_m delighted with this amazing good natured and helpful customer service , willing to bend the rules for me .
M	as a follow_up to response to my last rating : there was no apology , and there was no offer of a refund .
M	brilliant service , not !
F	i bought 0 tables that can be used when in bed ( don_'_t laugh . they were for my teenagers !)
F	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
F	the tickets did arrive last friday ( so two working_days before the day of the concert ), which is still way too close for comfort , especially having been told that they were going to be despatched the previous tuesday .
M	thats not interesting !
F	i tried to email them and the email bounced , website gone and domain_name expired .
M	i have done this twice before but over the mists of time forgot just how bad this company are on delivering .
M	staff good to very good .
M	ended_up sending the second shipper to collect from the first ( reported to me that it looked like shipper was trying stealing ) they continued the job a month from when it first started with complete_satisfaction .
F	would have been better to book directly with monarch as i usually do .
M	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has_been left in a secure place ( why couldn_'_t you knock on the door ?)
F	i have ordered albums , separate prints and cards through photoworld .
F	never again will i trust p0g .
M	tive 0 experiência completamente distintas , normalmente a pior é sempre a que marca o_serviço que experienciamos .
F	great communication and very quick payment .
M	great price , great service .
F	i have not opened the products - but although they are advertised as original selling pice £_00 . 00 - sale price £_00 . 00 they look cheap - and are much smaller_than they appear as advertised .
F	i '_m lactose_intolerant and can '_t take anything with lactose as even the tiniest amount upsets my stomach .
F	if it was hung on a wall you certainly wouldn_'_t be able to read it from any distance .
F	the dressing_table looks great and is very solid .
F	each courier i have used has_been very professional and careful with the items they have collected or delivered and very importantly have been very pleasant to deal with with good communication_skills .
M	the money entered my account almost_immediately and will help with the horror that is student life .
F	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
M	my website has_been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
M	the same company can bid on an entire house_move and you ' re left with inexperienced , rude , clumsy chances cramming your belongings into a grubby transit and breaking your belongings .
F	always a fast , cost_effective and efficient service , on line or when you phone .
F	the decs and accessories arrived super - duper quickly and were all of the highest_quality .
M	saddleworth
F	could have got it £_00 . 00 cheaper at jewsons
F	i appreciate that we placed our order over the christmas_period and delivery times would differ but all one needed was to be kept inform .
F	so i pay £_00 and it worked for one evening .
M	i got my money , full_amount .
F	very prompt delivery .
M	this company is an out and out scam .
M	very pleased with the purchase of dell_u0000m and ax000 soundbar .
F	i am not impressed .
M	while their turnaround around times are brilliant i would love if they had a option where you could select postage instead of a courier to ship such items .
F	you cannot get better_than that !
M	the customer service was great , the virtual terminal did the job i was looking for , just found a cheaper service else where .
F	i paid an extra 00 euro for upgrade which in itself was not expensive i was annoyed that you would even consider a fiat_000 for 0 people , a joke !
F	one of those stores that would recommend to my best buddies , promt delivery , fantastic quality in the clothes and what a added_bonus fantastic prices .
M	disgusting service :
F	we waited a hour for collection in auckland after ringing about 0 times - at no time did they say it was a different name of the rental_car that we had booked .
M	when i email the company they drew my attention to a small note in the add that says ' this is a one seater car suitable for 0 small_children ' .
F	on arrival at numerous hotels there was no_indication of who should be getting off as hotel signage not visible at drop_off points .
F	also found it very annoying that there is no phone number for this company .
M	who don_'_t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
M	you cannot get locally .
F	i was happy with the delivery time but the product itself wasn_'_t as good as some other_companies .
M	ordered and received next_day .
M	thoroughly_recommended for quality , customer experience and price
F	fingers_crossed !
M	0_star !
M	if i had known the item was out of stock , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
M	simply the best golf_shoes and ordinary shoe you can buy for comfort , style and colour range .
M	i do not believe a company should sell a £_00 ticket for £_00 , after all what would we all say if tesco or asda sold a tin of beans marked as 00p for over double the price , lets just say we wouldnt buy them .
M	love it
M	once nationwide becomes more honest with the customers and informs them of realistic timescales i think it could be a great company to arrange car lease with .
F	might as well sell from a vending machine .
M	having taken the morning off work i didn_'_t really think that this was an acceptable solution .
M	wasted day monday and now having to wait in for them again on tuesday as they cannot tell me what time they will arrive .
M	but they are more than quick enough to take payments in full long before dealing_with your order .
M	and when the reject they can '_t even recommend a service that can .
F	i ordered them on friday & they were delivered the following_monday - excellent service .
F	their website said the items were in stock when i ordered them - they even sent me an_email_confirming despatch !!
F	if other_companies were as organised as next_day coffee and give the service they do all of the time then the business world would be in a much_better state , than now .
F	definitely to be recommended !
M	let_me start by saying i would love to and would have given this site 0_stars . a few_months back
F	( i had only ordered 0 bags becuase of the sale that they had , order 0 for 00 . 00 avant garde hard dog_food , if i had know it would have been such a problem i would not have ordered in the first place ).
F	i checked with paypal and the payment had been cleared .
F	this is the 0rd time i have used tyre_shopper , but the 0st time i have encountered problems .
M	otherwise , the car was in good nic and there was no problem on that side , i just felt i was vulnerable , and how can you knock a deposit down from r0000 to r0000 , is that because i said i was going to cancel the rental and catch a cab ?
M	!
M	an effortless transaction !
F	i have used mazumamobile before and would definately use again .
F	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn_'_t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
M	cars are in the hotel car_park and are thoroughly checked before and after hiring so advise to buy excess_insurance .
M	beware if you are considering using brightpearl , self implementation is very hard and should not be given as an option , or atleast you should be made aware that erp experience is required !!
M	the memory i purchased was for a very old laptop !
M	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
M	it wouldn_'_t be expensive to set_up .
F	i have bought 0 times from tier0online and have received first_class service and product each time .
M	city_link , the courier service used by yankee_doodle , attempted to deliver my parcel to a incorrect_address two streets_away from me - the yankee_doodle customer_services response to this was " mistakes_happen ." this response left me speechless !
F	when the flowers arrived i was expecting more than what arrived .
F	great service .
M	all i can say is the service was appalling .
F	i also love the fact that the photos are from the travelers themselves , not professional photos .
M	this time i phoned the nominated fitting_centre to confirm the time only to find they had no record !
F	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
M	good choice of kit and extremely competetive_prices coupled_with free deliver made it a no_brainer .
M	only to find no parking slots available .
F	difficult to cook in though !
F	worse still i complained a week_ago and the only response i have received so far is an_email to say if i don_'_t receive a response in 00 working_days that i can phone them .
F	payplan have been heaven sent .
M	i complained on the last day of the month ( monthly game that offers guaranteed spins or cash ) that i wasn_'_t winning on the free games and it had been a while since i won off virgin even after all the deposits made . other members and the chat_host '_s posts were nasty and it was like they was all telling_me to just go !
F	will not recommend you to any forces families who live_abroad .
M	great price .
M	after over an_hour i was told that they didn_’_t have the tyres in stock and it was going to be another 0 hours to get them in .
M	jim
F	the whole litem was extremely disappointing .
F	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn_'_t give her any money back .
F	driver was apologetic and explained why delayed .
F	an excellent service , easy to process , great quality cards with speedy delivery .
M	signed a very pleased husband .
F	i am having issues with the redemption of wowchers the codes don_'_t work and then it '_s a race to do it on time .
F	brilliant , i will be a regular now .
F	i must have made over 00 calls in total .
F	then we had the bill . told accounts that we wouldn_'_t pay until the claim was processed as we had not heard_anything back .
M	none !
M	ordered on sunday , received tuesday .
F	hi !
M	if you saw my previous review , this was directed at a different site .
M	the price including delivery was the best that i could_find anywhere for my savage gear dropshot rod ( which i highly_recommend ).
M	because of this i could have bought the lens from john_lewis for almost exactly the same price with local supplier warranty
M	i then received a rather brash automated email questioning why i had cancelled the first payment request which confirmed by belief that although this interface may work , there is no plan b or c for people who dont meet specific criteria and then it goes spectacuarly wrong .
M	i need these new tyres on now so i can put some motorway miles on the car without_damaging the vcu ( differential ).
M	if you ' re worried_about if this place is legit or not , don_'_t be , they are real and i will be going back in the future for sure .
F	bad treatment
F	buggybaby customer service helped_us choose the mountainbuggy cosmopolitan after listening to me and what i needed .
M	getting ahold of anyone is hard and complicated .
M	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
F	only mistake was mine as i ordered dog_wormers and only one tablet was sent !
M	my pension_expert did what they said they would do .
M	incomplete_address results in delayed delivery
F	my package arrived very quickly in just three_days to belgium and service was excellent .
M	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
M	cheaper_than other mainstream cycling discount sites which is always a bonus !
F	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don_'_t work .
M	we were told this would be fine as long as we reported any damage ( if any ) immediately .
F	browsed internet and amazon , yes amazon had one .
M	never again !
F	will_definately be using your services again .
M	if i have one grumble , and it is a very small one , there was no communication between placing the order and the goods being dispatched on the wednesday .
M	not quite pleased , but satidfied .
F	so the booking_system is not really very reliable , you get what '_s left in the parking lot .
F	i have been waiting 0_days and so far have recieved nothing .
F	i wish i had read all the negative_reviews before i placed my order .
M	got a great deal on cnp_pro - peptide from bodybuilding_warehouse .
F	furniture is fine , but make_sure ou protect all carpets as boxes and delivere feet are filthy .
F	never had any_problems with a booking , and in fact the last two theatre trips through lastminute have resulted_in free upgrades on arrival .
M	the answer came back quickly and it was just what i wanted .
M	a day late with the pick_up of parcel again inconvenient .
F	great service thank_you
F	my solicitors are being instructed today so fingers_crossed this can be resolved .
F	i found this site very useful .
M	how on earth it takes anyone 0 days to deliver a package from england to northern_ireland in 0000 is anybodies guess !!
M	please don_'_t be_fooled_by the positive_reviews listed below i can only_assume they are left by the owners of the company or there are a few lucky people .
F	very pleased with company .
M	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don_'_t know .
M	very helpful lady sorted this out .
F	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
F	if you are thinking of using this printer , think_twice .
F	a definite must have web address for any pet_owners , will definitely be using them in the near_future .
M	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
M	having used jessops for a previous photo_book and being pleased with the result i set about designing one for my wife s birthday .

F	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
M	cancel my direct_debit today .
M	i ordered the polishing kits at the price stated and recieved the order without the polishing kits .

F	and now , 0wks later - a satisfaction survey - what a surprise !
F	don_'_t know why i still bother to look for things in argos - they never have what i want in stock , either in my local_store or for home delivery .
M	absolutely a0 class service .
F	the website was very user_friendly with the order being_processed very quickly .
M	this was a trial purchase with ordinary bike items , but it seems tredz are happy to sell you items they don_'_t have .
M	if you are about to run out of mot , i suggest contacting servicing_stop ltd .
M	never will i buy from this shocking company again .
F	they contacted me before processing order .
M	i ordered a colour_cartridge & black_cartridge at the same paid by pay_pal .
F	really easy to order , kept you informed about delivery . this was my second order with them , the first really pleased . this time abit disappointed . sent as a thank_you for my mum , isaw them two_days after delivery and all the roses and two of the lilies were dead !
F	delivered on the specified day , beautiful colourful bouquet however , disappointed that 0 yellow_roses each had a brown petal on delivery and within 0_days 0 germini - banana had died .

M	what do you intend to do about this .'
F	well impressed and would recommend highly .
M	cheap to book with and there were no_problems .
F	delivery time was certainly nowhere_near meet and i threatened to cancel my order as 0_weeks past my order date i still hadn_'_t received my order .
F	no next_day service and you will be waiting a fortnight at_least for your goods .
M	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
M	great service
M	can '_t think of any way to criticise amazon simply because their service and products have made my life_easier in every way possible .
F	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken_toys .
F	not only is the website of ao easy to use , with a good filter for your choices , but importantly you can guarantee that every product can be delivered and installed .
M	im on 0mb connection however the connection is sooo slow , im hard_wired and i have problems with my iphone , laptop and xbox speed .
M	we have just had an expensive carpet fitted in the hall .
F	hat on the large side so will have to alter it .
M	for once , a company that promises something so good , actually delivered .
F	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn_'_t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
M	).
M	i thought the original booking had bikes on it , but obviously made a mistake ( less_than £ 0 ) and was made to pay £_00 .
F	upon sending an_email complaint the cost of the pies were credited back to my credit_card and i received a response indicating that they were out of the pies and substituted the puddings ; however , the main_reason i placed the order was for the pies and had i known they were out i would have asked them to hold my order until the pies were back in stock .
F	i contacted this company to ask a technical question .
M	as arnie_said " i will be back "

F	mazuma promised a price and kept to there guarantee , it was very fast , i sent mine monday_morning and recieved the payment tuesday i was over the moon , will_definatly recommend mazuma , others say a price and dont promise it mazuma do , and beware if another offer more think or the p_&_p price it works out exactly the same price , mazuma are free_p_&_p .
M	not a frustration with which you want to begin your journey home at the end of a very long day .
M	products offered and guidance / advice very clearly_explained and were approp .

F	overall , very disappointed with the purchase but my grandson was happy enough wearing it on the day .
M	great service , top_class
F	myself & my husband have been shopping at repertoire over the past few_years and everyone we have met is so helpful and it makes our shopping_experience really enjoyable , can '_t wait to shop again very soon .
F	00 / 0 /_0000 well someone called yesterday and still full of rubbish but that '_s ok as i will be getting my meat from you main rivals after have a long chat with then i am very pleased
M	thanks !
M	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
M	!
F	i thought it would save me lot of time .
M	still not received the goods !
M	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
M	i have also recommended musclefood to my friends and family .
F	this had happened to us 0 times .
F	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
F	hello , my name susanay recently ordered it , buy two pencil type brushes and i am very happy with them , i also buy ss000deluxe flat bronzer the use for bronzing powders and highly pigmented blushers and it '_s going great and is super soft , but i also buy bk00badger flat bronzer and fatal , i am very unhappy with this brush because i scratch a lot , it '_s super rough and even_though i wash as usual , is not soft and do not use it because i click on the face of the rough that is my opinion es . esta hope you serve something .
F	i '_m disgusted .
M	to add_insult to injury they didn_'_t tell me this and i wasted another day waiting for the item .
M	there '_s only been one occasion when my order didn_'_t come the next_day and that was down to royal_mail and contactlenses . co . uk supplied me with free lenses to keep me going and then resent my order when the originals didn_'_t turn_up .
M	having had some jasmine tea in china town , london with a group of friends , i thought that i ` d try and relive the experience at home but so_far , sadly it hasn ` t quite lived_up to my expectations .
F	i am buying this tool for my son so hope it is the right thing , but the description was clear and precise .
M	an_alternative tyre was offered but as i ' d ordered the tyre i wanted , i declined so the lady said she ' d give me a refund .
M	i explained why i felt that they should be to cover the consequential loss of expenses and compensate me for the day off i had to take and the 000 mile_round_trip to sort this out .
M	it wasn_'_t informed 00 week wait_until i ' d payed .
F	would recommend service to others , very impressed with service .
M	their website , however , is extremely confusing and i have to order well in advance of my requirements because despatch dates are not confirmed or kept to .
M	email received to advise despatch the next_morning and delivery was within 00_hours .
M	great company to deal with the fire is better_than_expected thanks would recommend you to all my family and friends
M	i feel i have been conned and would never reccomend parcel_hero to anyone .
M	very good quality product , fast delivery .
M	enter registration , confirm car and then select tyres .
M	!
M	in the first instance the service was 000_%, good price and next_day delivery .
M	items were just as advertised .
M	they used to be cheap and good value .
M	charged no problem waiting for stock but
F	titmuss are usally great , i always use them for my dog products and they have always been great .
M	after next days i got the parcel but i paid 00 pound for tax !
M	as we haven_'_t made a claim , we cannot fully comment on the quality of healthy_pets , but the purchase of the policy , the policy itself and the price paid seem fair .
F	just depends on what i need to order as to which one i use .
M	quality of doors fne but the glazed ones had the wrong shaped glazing .
M	like amazon ?
F	( telephoning was not an option as whenever i called i was always 0th in the queue ).
M	however sometimes cost is not the only factor !
F	order placed on 0rd may_0000 and am still_waiting for this .
M	only charged for the half tank and got a refund on the overpayment .
F	0 .
M	however , with a bit if filing and adjustment it is on .
M	i recently ordered an internal compact_flash card_reader for a computer i '_m building .
M	thank_you for the opportunity to clarify our position .
F	i ordered a pair of shoes and a leather i - pad cover from ecco .
F	ebuyer were notified immediately .
M	an email was sent to ensure that i ordered the correct items and replied to immediately .
F	what was most irritating was that the money had been taken as soon as i placed the order , but they had no item to send to me .
M	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
M	these_guys are scam_artists !
F	speedy service !
F	pet - supermarket provided the goods as ordered and within a reasonable time_scale .
F	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn_'_t honour the delivery ?
F	you '_d never be my friend .
F	thanks again
F	for this reason ive given 0_stars .
F	thank_you , thank_you
M	not too happy but i '_ll deal with it .
M	an organisation that can be trusted , and your efficiency can '_t be_faulted .
M	intermouse are the only low lifes on the high_st , no contact from them to fix situation and now in hands of police and trading_standards avoid
M	i am not sure why this takes so long ( unless they have a lot of customer returns to process ) before they will consider a replacement .
F	i did not receive an_email or text to advise me when it had been dispatched or was due to be delivered so consequently i was out when they attempted delivery .
F	a lot of emails incurring roaming charges layer - this matter was sorted thanks to steph .
M	you ’ ve guessed it ………….
F	there are also many discount_codes given by others members on the site which makes it even cheaper !
F	i sent the phone back with 0_days left of the send back bracket .
F	when i finally got through to you i was told it was too late despite it being 0 hours_later when i got the message they had been sent .
F	this company claims amazing customer service . it is amazing but not in a good way .
F	i then asked for a refund and was told it would take a few_days , now 0_weeks on i am still_awaiting refund and have had to open a claim with paypal to try and get money back .
F	other than no one to answer the telephone . not too bad !
F	i arrived home to find both products , too late to use , and one wasn_'_t what i had ordered !
M	no_nonsense and fast delivery without getting involved in the extra_expense .
F	unfortunately i was out when the package was delivered and it had to be signed for , so they planned to deliver the following_day but no time given .
M	easy to order - but poor courier service !
M	really disappointed when asked for extra money for flight when promised no extra fees .
M	scott and the team are great they provide the best service and are very punctual with there orders .
M	unfortunately the distance_between the fixing_holes in the drivers_mat did not match the distance_between the studs in the car .
M	cheap to buy from but to stressful wont recommend or use again .
F	would rather give no stars .
M	pros_:
M	the first 0 boxes i opened had nothing on the reverse side .
F	a fantastic save the date card which looks really classy .
M	i then spoke to [_name_] at parcel0go who advised they dont guarantee collection and were sorry .
M	i would not_hesitate to use 000 blinds again or to recommend to others !
F	many of the hotel descriptions were false .
M	i think scan have set the bar now for online computer accessory retailers .
F	once you have collected the car you seem unable to get the cdw refunded as it is nothing to do with the rental company themselves .
M	!
M	highly delighted with the degree of personal service i received .
M	we arrived at the groundfloor of the airport after ringing you 00_minutes earlier .
M	i was happy to order my tyres from tyre - shopper as their website is well_structured and the price was good , even_though there was no particularly local fitting_centre .
M	got the papers today , did some calculations , and was shocked by how much of a rip_off it was !
F	after trying for months to get an anna dress hooray i got one from here !!
F	recently i needed some omega_0 fish_oil_capsules ( 00 ) quickly for a client and it was actually cheaper for me to buy from a local_store (£ 0 . 00 ) than to order from higher_nature - £_00 . 00
F	still no lamp .
M	on this booking i needed to change the hotel for a better location and called them which is the first time i have called them .
F	i purchased it in sale cheshire at the end of october and by end of december it seemed to no work .
F	i seldom have any_problems with components but when i do aria are very good at replacing them .
F	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
F	very helpful staff and fast delivery
F	i got to my destination 00_hours_later than i should have .
F	the software is easy to use .
M	why don_'_t they employ 00 ex customs people for 0 hours , pay them 00 pounds / hour , and charge everyone 00 pence to cover it ?
F	ok both were fairly heavy but i regard the delivery charge as very expensive !
M	john_anthony provides a first_class fast & efficient online service .
M	the regular sales , price cuts & offers allbeauty do are also very useful & can save you a lot of extra money at times .
F	a resubmission request was submitted , and the reply came back :
F	i thought they would be a usual ladies fit , but they weren_'_t .
M	parcel_force in there wisdom took it back to their depot and i understand sent it back to you . i still_await
F	finally , because we took a coach there , no one told us there was no where for the coach to park , there is a car_park but has limited headroom , so no coaches could enter .
M	very fast and reliable prompt service and speedy delivery . i will be using angling_active again
F	it was a very easy on - line quote but i had a ' nil ' quote which when challenged they admit was incorrect and sent a re - quote .
F	flowers looked lovely ( photo sent from recipient ) but somehow they read the address as 00 not 000 .
M	overall , not a good experience .
F	very trustworthy and brilliant way of paying anyone .
M	!
F	i bought a 00ft_trampoline as a christmas_present for my children .
M	decided to go for another pair of oakley '_s & was recommended eyewear_outlet .
F	!

F	not only the cleaning service was very poor and i had to clean everything again , but worst than that i am left with a big damage : 0 brand_new chrome valve plates in a brand_new_bathroom have been completely scratched .
F	i traded an iphone0c with cex on saturday for a lumia 0000 which was faulty so i took it back on sunday as no other way to contact them , they offered me a replacement phone coming from s different shop , said it would be delivered tues / wed well post has_been and no phone also i dont have any receipts as the blackpool shop kept them i need someone to ring me or im contacting the police as im out of pocket to the tune of £_000 this is just stupid no way of getting intouch other than having to go into_town to the shop , getting the feeling i have been ripped_off big time i have given them until_0pm today to contact me or im going to have the iphone blocked
F	finally , at last two managers called me and gave_me a 000_% guarantee that my order would arrive at 00pm on day 0 ( after expecting it between 0 - 00am ).
M	many_thanks john brown
F	these flowers were ordered for my daughter ( her own daughter was getting_married in australia ).
M	rang the helpline ( no order number as i didn_'_t take it ) and they found the order " oh_dear it doesn_'_t seem to have been processed " even_though i had a e_- mail_confirming the order but , and this is the important bit , no e_- mail saying it had been shipped .
M	great service fast delivery . would highly_recommened

F	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i '_d say .
F	i had to go out and buy some replacements .
M	i ended_up in the airport fast track area and had to get help from airports car_park personnel .
M	this gave_me time to find alternative .
F	we were very pleased with the service .
F	i asked for a manager call back and was told it would take 00_hours . 000 hours_later and i am still_waiting .
M	good website , fast delivery , great kit at good prices .
M	however - before my order arrives i get two promotional messages offering me other stuff - each message a strong reminder of the failure to delver - and then - and then - as if to rub_salt into my wound - a survey to complete .
F	the reaction i '_ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
M	great products , great customer_care , great delivery schedule ,( arrived five_minutes before promissed ).
M	been really happy with the service .
F	i bought my husband sportswear for christmas , ordered one day and it arrived the next .
M	would definately recommend this company .

F	i was happy with the product and the delivery .
M	i will never use again 0 days on live_chat getting nothing but appeasement and lies .
F	we spent a week there , pretending to be venetians .
F	waited nearly a full week for the art_work to be sent despite calling the office daily .
F	karen .
F	the presentation of the delivery was unique and very well_designed .
F	their website is easy to access and has clear displays and details of a wide_range of products .
F	i am still_awaiting the email !!
F	i have brought a few things online from cash_generators and my experience is gettin worse many items i have brought appear in stock online they then proceed to take my money and after over a week of waiting and nothing turns_up i then phone which ever store i have brought from to find out the item i have ordered is out of stock and they will issue me a refund why do they not bother to ring or email me as soon as they realise its out of stock not wait_till i ring to do sumthing about it
M	my aunt was very pleased with her flowers .
M	i preferred showing people around becasue i could answer all their questions straight_away and i can get a feel for whether they are serious or not .
M	ordered an_engagement_ring and needed it within 0_weeks it was delivered in 0 and was even better_than i could of inagined ! fantastic price too the best i could_find and most_importantly she said yes :)
M	when i called to complain i was told it '_s too late we don_'_t refund and your wife probably hit a pot_hole .
M	yet another thing today monday 00th_jan the thumbnails are showing pictures of last weeks episodes .
M	these guy '_s customer service is nothing short of outstanding !
M	very good service but a little disappointed with the short use by dates .
F	i took the blind down and it looked like it hadn_'_t been fitted properly .
M	then only 0 day from uk import to arrival at my house .
F	i hope this review helps to improve matters .
M	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
F	certainly , although i would have no_hesitation using the whisky_exchange again , it will not be until they change their couriers .
M	quick despatch .
M	excellent service and communication , plus the best price on line for this staple_gun .
F	iwould reccommend the bead_shop as they have everything and more you need for beading and their delivery is fast .
F	would recommend to anyone .
M	speedy service
M	free price compares website is really easy to use and will save you some money
F	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
F	excellent service , excellent prices and very good product
F	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
M	also , receptionist in the garage , was not customer friendly ( swearing ).
F	my dogs are now flea clear completely .
M	however , they use dpd to transport their parcels and this lets them down a lot .
M	this is the rudest , most ridiculous service i '_ve ever had .
M	hope when some one reads this optimax might do something about my problem .
M	ordered 0 six foot tubes . came within a couple of days . they seem well made
F	however it is very expensive to return the goods again as it has to be shipped to uk .
F	it meant that the train i took to casa arrived at 0 :_00am .
F	however i have decided to keep them for a light summer shoe .
M	my experiences include : item arriving several days_later than_expected when paying for delivery on a particular day ; the item arriving damaged ; no response from fs to numerous_emails sent regarding a replacement part for the item ; phone_calls being forwarded to voicemail rather_than to an operator ; finally upon speaking to a representative being told they would need to speak with a manager and would get back to me , however subsequently receiving no further contact .
F	having said all that , i '_m too busy to not use this service , especially when i '_m frequently on the last flights in .
F	bought a small variety of items of which i have tried the crisps - not too bad but nothing special and wensleydale cheese which had a bitter aftertaste .
M	you have to take the item back to your local_store , which for me defeats the benefit of on line shopping .
F	bare in mind i tried this various different times throughtout the day on the day of failed delivery and the following_day just_incase theyre system hadnt been updated yet .
M	they have now closed their mediation again .
F	luckily my son didn_'_t mind but the picture should be the same as the product .
M	goods all correct and packaged well .
F	i '_ve ordered a few_times from battery_force and the products have always been dispatched promptly , would not_hesitate recommending this site to anyone !
F	i recently had a parcel to return , containing the wrong item and i wanted to find the cheapest price to return it .
F	we will contact you if there are any_problems , so far so good .
F	will never order online again . i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .:(
F	when i rang up was told 0 of the items were out of stock , the person i spoke to is trying to erolve the situation
F	had used iflorist a number of times so didn_'_t_hesitate in using them again for a boquet for mothering_sunday .
F	i have been waiting since tuesday for 00 parcels to be collected from my business address .
F	the first communication i received about delivery , was an_email_stating that my order " had been despatched " when it had already been delivered several days earlier !
M	can '_t beat that for great value and great service .
F	few sparkly jewels added in strategic places and they look even more fabulous , slight_problem as not enough envelopes but one email and they were with me in 00_hours .
F	on arrival at the purple_parking building . the order reference i was given - did not match the reference on the system .
F	i also had an_email on the morning of the show , mrs browns boys in cardiff , with contact details should i have had any_queries .
M	for example i wanted some m0 threaded bar .
F	very surprised when the box arrived - it '_s very small .
M	the bus did eventually arrive some 00_minutes late .
F	full of promise , very slow on payment .
F	rather_than thanks and a replacement , i was then asked for proof by way of photographs , that i was indeed telling the truth .
M	i experienced your service on one previous occasionand that was an unmitigated disaster from_start to finish .
M	!
F	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn_'_t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
F	i felt completely reassured , however what then followed over the next 0_months is a complete_nightmare !
M	got in the villa really nice but had a problem with cockroaches .
F	i called over and over to find out when they were arriving for me and could get no answer .
M	delivery times seem longer_than i would expect
F	0 .
M	my wife who bought the original flight " hit the roof " and very politely told them that full details would be given to the press if they did not honour the original contract .
M	many_thanks for your extremely qick despatch .
F	apart_from this little_niggle , i have to be fair and say that this is the only order i have placed so far and would use them again - but would prefer my chosen option to be taken into_consideration if there is a problem .
M	i called to inform them and was asked " could i make use of them ?"
M	i renewed with wft because i ran_out of time to shop around .
M	free , fast delivery .
F	really pleased with my items - i purchased an adult parka , adult fleece and child '_s fleece .
M	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
M	the people who received them were total strangers to us , but fortunately were honest , and brought the goods round .
M	0 months for you to pay out seems very slow .
M	great products at highly competitive_prices ( the lowest i could_find ).
M	the quality is fantastic .
M	when i bought a new car i had no_hesitation in going to them again .
F	i was absolutely stunned .
F	its theft in my opinion , they shouldn_'_t be allowed to trade at all .
F	still no contact and still no replacement vase
M	confirmation of order but no dispatch note .
F	he rearraged both packages for the morning after next between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 and booked the morning off . which as we all no very easy to do .
F	i just had to laugh .
F	quick response and prompt payment and communication excellent
M	" hail mary full of grace .
F	precioius little one also had the best price :-) anyway i also got an extra discount for liking them on facebook so was definitely a very happy_bunny .
M	the capsules don_'_t feel as well crafted as the original nespresso ones - they are thickish plastic instead of foil and the foil cap that is pierced by the machine is tougher .
F	having taken a great deal of time and effort , to clarify the defects in detail which could cause a serious injury to my elderly parent , i received an_email_confirming the order would be refunded when the goods were returned .
F	my t - shirt was a good fit and very funny , the best t - shirt i '_ve ever bought i think .
M	april 00nd : " we '_ll sort it out for you ."
F	they made everything every easy and straight_forward in terms of postage and packaging .
M	then you settle_down to use a phone you dont like , so you have problems so you phone there 000 line only to find your talking to an overseas foriener who doesnt understand you or them you , so i couldnt wait for the contract to run out , so you give them a months notice in writing , only to find them contacting me several days after the letter was in there hands ( actually 0_weeks ) and find that the contract wont finish untill 00 days after you speak to there operater . what the hells all that about , what a con .
F	it is so unusual to be kept in the picture with emails , texts and phone_calls , and so very helpful .
M	though the quoted price might be competitive , your fees are undisclosed until the very end of the registration when one has already invested substantial time to book a ticket .
M	personally , if i was told at the start that the items would be ordered in and that it would be about a month before delivery but the price was good then i would probably still buy quite happily as i would have known from the start before ordering but to be assured of one thing and then for it not to happen rather damages my future trust .
M	fantastic place to shop , great choice of products , great prices and free next_day delivery result .!
F	thankyou
M	i placed an order for laminates on 0th_november on their website .
F	it arrived after two_days but the ipod is corrupted and will not restore .
F	they didn_’_t care .
F	i '_d definitely use this service again and highly_recommend to others .
F	they have really helped_me out and their communications are second to none , meeting up with them to pick_up the lens is so easy and the delivery service is great too .
F	i ordered around noon on friday and asked for delivery by saturday_afternoon .
M	we ordered nine days ago .
F	easirent was the carhire company
M	excellent service fast delivery key '_s worked_perfectly
M	after a further two_weeks - the course started next week - still no package had arrived - or no invoice .

M	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
F	ordered thursday arrived friday good value for money wiil use this seller agian
F	best value for money and fantastic hotel .

F	having now received the product , i can tell you that it was worth it .
F	!
M	i made a mistake phoned them up , all sorted .
F	very quick and efficient .
M	i know this is clearly_stated in the delivery information but with some highstreet opticians able to complete orders in under an_hour i expect a faster turnaround .
F	no complaint particularly about paperstone but poor for fedex , in my opinion its a key thing for deliveries to let the buyer know where their items are .
M	the other pair , for my son , were perfect .
M	bought two mattresses and picked a delivery date and then chose to spread the cost on finance .
F	sarah howes
M	on arrival in lanzarote , we were told to wait outside the airport and wait_until our names were called , that took about 00_mins then we were directed to a coach which was a long way away , not good if you have mobility issues , like us .
M	their price was better_than all of their competitors and we received our great quality prints within a few_days .
M	dpd couldn_'_t even be_bothered to inform_me of their error .
M	!
M	sent my prescription recorded delivery on the monday and got my parsel on the saturday .
F	i recently had to return a faulty jacket that i had purchased only 0_months prior and was very disappointed withe level of customer service i received .
F	the trial system could not be easier , quicker or more convenient and indeed the same applies to the actual purchasing process and delivery service .
F	very good website .
M	good product at a good price but i ' d advise against paying for 00 hr first_class delivery as it took 0 days .
F	bought two essentials frying_pans . bargain price !
M	after_searching several websites , found best price at tyreleader .
F	én ud af tre kjoler bestil på nelly har_været helt anderledes i kvalitet , farve og størrelse end det jeg så på_hjemmesiden .
M	however , i have demanded a refund of £ 0 .
M	custom mixed paint colour and clear coat .
M	cue arrival home of wife after long day at work .
F	my delivery arrived in reasonable time but i realised that i needed the bigger glass and seen they were on pre order so i tried to order it wouldn_'_t let_me so i rang and was told that it was only in the uk and as i was in n . ireland they couldn_'_t pre order for me even if i paid_extra postage there was no way round this silly rule so i won_'_t be using again
F	ilumi replaced everything delivered day after
M	very happy with the service and will_definitely use it again .
M	i received a phone_call the day after_placing my order to say that the rod in stock was damaged but i was assured that i would receive my newly ordered rod by the end of the following week at the latest which i was still happy to wait for and i did appreciate the phone_call to let_me know .
F	however unfortunately i had the cardamom_chicken the other night and despite enjoying it whilst eating it after i suffered with some unwanted illness , both me and my boyfriend shared it and found ourselves with crunching stomache aches and symptoms similar to food_poisoning .
M	i traced it back to the fitters .
M	for this reason i was prepared to wait more than the 0 - 00 working_days they state at the time of ordering .
M	the sales_guy alan was very help full and knows_his stuff .
M	my 0 week delivery took over a month . i recieved 0 e_- mails saying my anticipated delivery date had been changed , so i got in touch .
M	( pour moi il est important car je voyage souvent a l ’ étranger et parfois en fonction des loueurs des conditions spécifiques sont en place , restrictions surplus , non couverture par l ’ assurance , limitations .) donner plus de transparence au client .
F	service from mazumamobile was quick , effortless , and first_class .
F	very happy with my order .
F	had a few things done here now and the service is always fast and friendly .
F	the items did finally arrive and were in good condition and as i ordered .
M	the box was clearly damaged before hand so the furniture should of been checked before delivery by your staff .
M	when it come out it had shrunk !
F	!
F	brilliant efficent service .
M	but they must be right i suppose .
M	blinds are generally very good value for money .
M	they should empower their people instead of making them hide - bound by their silly rules , especially pretending to be prevented from helping because of the data_protection act .
M	he didnt_bother his ass knocking the neighbours door but instead left another card .
M	ordered a set of replacement thule_bike carrier keys using just the key code on the carrier .
F	brilliant company , low_prices and free delivery .
F	i don_'_t usually_write online reviews about these sort of things but your lack of communication has made me realise that you seem to respond to complaints on trustpilot . co . uk and not via your customer service email address .
M	had no_problems dealing_with this company , would use them again and recommend them to others .
F	( its been 0_days )
F	love it and defiantly a brand you can_trust !
F	one order arrived after 0_weeks .
M	unfortunately i have nt received my order .
M	kimberlee drew
F	i will use them again because of the excellent service .
M	hears hoping the fitting and mot go as well .
M	i was happy with the delivery service and the ease of use from the website .
F	but when i went to the fitting_centre on the day i had booked in ( monday 00th , am ) i was told that i wasn_'_t on the system and they weren_'_t expecting me .
F	perfect fulfilment of my order from the detailed item discription to regular_updates on order status . i had plenty of notice to choose delivery to suit me .
M	excellent
M	then three of the seven stff went off duty whilst the que gained momentum .
F	i just keep dropping on to amazing bargins .
F	we ' re most chuffed with the sofa .
M	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
M	sounds petty but they were for a present
F	the drivers were courteous and the car was awaiting us on our return which saved us having to wait in the cold !
F	no reason it just will .
M	good choice and price and delivered on time
F	i don_'_t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no_doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
F	flowers were beautiful but such a shame as she thought we had forgotten her on her special birthday . she went out for the evening and they were delivered at 0 . pm at night .
M	my order was placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 for items that were shown as in stock and available for immediate delivery .
M	ok , so the ordering_process was easy and the confirmation e_- mail came through very promptly .
F	this is truly the last time i '_m shopping with this company .
F	when replacement would be dispatched they couldnt tell me so i asked for a refund instead i am still_waiting .
F	!
F	seemed to have an attitude .
M	best price on the internet .
F	only 0 mobile i sent in didn_'_t qualify but that was no_drama with me , as if was totally broken ( missing keypad and other parts of the phone )
F	awful !
F	good service and delivery although i ordered 0 costumes and one had a hole in it and 0 had to have the sleeves sewn on :(
F	the site is very easy to use and there is a wide of variety of designs and sizes of book to choose from .
F	took me ages to order and i had to contact linens_direct as i got so fed_up of it .
F	would recommend trustworthy company
M	delivery as promised
M	prices were more than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
M	one a 00kw pellet ( one property ) and the other a 000kw wood chip system to provide hot_water and central_heating to 0 properties .
F	wonder_how many folk dont notice the colour choice and simply give up like we did 0st time round ?
F	and by the way , sometimes these offers are not really good deals - so it is quite misleading !
M	great light at a very good price with super_fast delivery , what more could you ask for !
M	i put in a small order as i had not used this seed_bank before , but had heard good things about them .
F	i email the company and still have not received a reply .
F	can get some great items but is expensive especially delivery
F	great company to get animal_meds from .
M	the prices offered aren_'_t amazing , but neither did i expect them to be , so no real issues there either .
M	** slightly_lower prices than other energy_suppliers but unprofessional calls and strange and aggressive voicemails left when a bill was paid one day late for example **
M	eventually agreed .
F	sent 0 emails to worldstores on same day but no response except automatic holding e_mails .
M	on the basis of that deal i tried to sell an htc phone .
M	eventually got a second bunch of flowers after disappointment with the first .
F	i found the leki stick easily , and was impressed to see details before ordering . my parcel arrived quickly , well_wrapped upand protected . all in all a fast and reliable company supplying a quality item .
F	ordered a washer on sun afternoon and within 00_hours it was getting plumbed in by my husband !
F	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
M	it '_s sharp_practice .
F	so easy .
F	no waiting , everything went like_clockwork .
M	the follow - up communications were excellent , both by e_- mail & phone .
M	so this means that i will have to go with her ,( the reason i decided on an online payment was so she could go herself )
M	the process in general is ok , however there is nothing memorable about it either .
M	paul
F	i haven_'_t had any_problems with the company other than when trying to renew my insurance , but i just rang up and they got it sorted straight_away would definitely recommend
F	did ' nt purchase pass went outside asked a local police officer and he did ' nt mince his words , he advised they were trying to rip us off !!
F	the difference with mrmemory is that they sent through and email containing a link for a video which showed clearly and simply how to install the new memory .
F	the company realise that when you need something , you need it now , not in two to three_weeks time .
F	in purchasing a travel cash card , i was also less concerned_about losing my own bank card or having additional bank charges on anything i purchased abroad .
F	.
M	0 .
F	it was too much hassle to send them back so will live with it but for the money i was disappointed .
F	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
F	blimmin lovely x

M	martin from hereford
F	lovely runner rug with a great price but i had problems with the courier when they had changed the address to a wrong addresse such as it was addressed to the village primary_school the invoice from the seller was correct .
F	i am now going on holiday so cant open the new screen at present , if it is damaged i presume we will have the same problem again .
F	the website claims show this as being about an inch .
F	think i shall be writing to watchdog and any other similar agencies !!!
M	roger m . lucas
F	never , ever go with three .
F	given that i '_d had the phone for over two years , i would put this down to general wear and tear , but because i '_d already paid £ 0 . 00 to post the thing to them , i wasn_'_t going to refuse their offer to have to pay to post it to someone_else !
F	my order was acknowledged_immediately and the parcel arrived very quickly .
F	0th_april in manchester no_problems in fact i was delighted
F	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
M	awful customer service , i will never use this company again and will be seeking a chargeback to my card on monday via my bank
M	i have used them quite a few_times now , competative_prices ( always been the best for us ).
F	better packaging but not as good ad nespresso for flavour
F	easy to use software , fast service and good quality products .
M	i am being_conned , and the product supplier is being_conned .
M	i was particularly_impressed with the dispatch_notification early on the first working day after the order was placed .
F	the break is this weekend and i have tried all the contact numbers which had me going in circles , referring me to the website and then hanging up on me .
F	the invitations were the easiest and best ordering experience but it went_downhill from there .
F	and in the middle of nowhere .
M	well_done allbatteries i will use again , shame on you parcel_force
M	order placed on the friday_evening and it was with me monday as well so very happy all_round .
M	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
M	urban_industry is a great online shop .

M	many_thanks .
M	love the sunglasses and the price was excellent .
F	the first time i was annoyed because they made me pay 00 pounds for a replacement sim for my contract .
M	so all i can say is , dump yodel because they are letting your company down .
M	received 0 chase emails to accept / reject and replied to each cc - ing as many addresses as possible

M	this is the third time that i have used rentalcars . com , each time in a different country .
F	she didn_'_t .
M	the following_morning on contacting interparcel . com i was told that the tnt driver had reported that our road was closed with no access to the property .
M	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
M	george
M	i will buy from superdry again but will visit a store as my first experience with the online shopping was a bad one .
M	oh , and one of the chairs feels totally different to the sample in the store . delivery men were great , though .
F	brilliant service comfortable mattress what can be said .
F	good quick service but the description of the little girls pirate dress i ordered stated it was a dress and hat .
M	great
M	i am now being subjected to aggressive calls to my home number from a debt_recovery company called nco threatening allsorts of recovery action over the £_00 . 00 which i have now reluctantly paid to avoid further upset to my wife and children .
F	eventually balance of order was received 00st .
F	after me calling about 0 times they said they would refund me . i didn_'_t get a refund but the flowers did eventually arrive .
M	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
M	i bought the one recommended and it was good .
M	!
M	the price was fair and the delivery very swift .
M	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name_] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
F	quick delivery , costume perfect , just as_described .
F	the advice i received on my first visit regarding the fact that the colour of a radiator affects the heat_output was eye - opening !

M	nothing too much_trouble , great prices will use again when needed
M	only time will tell if it lasts_longer_than the grundfos
F	my 0000 hoover vacuum_cleaner still works_perfectly but needed new brushes .
F	tried to call them but after listening to inane music for 00_minutes i gave up !
F	00 april 00
F	fabrication service was very thorough .
M	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .
M	simple enough to work out i suppose , but not for everybody .
M	tried dpd phone number , got answering_machine : typed in consignment_number . nothing !
F	items damaged on arrival .
F	six pounds !
F	fitting it was easy and the notebook works better , or at_least faster_than it did , which is what i needed .
M	also , it came in two_days !!
F	so i emailed and got a nice email back saying sorry about that and if you are happy to keep it we will send an amended purchase note , which they did .
F	recently i have bought loads of perfumes and make up for christmas_presents at a fraction of the cost i would pay on the high_street .
F	deliveries are always very quick and the product choice is great .
F	products are the highest_quality , delivery is fast and never dissapointed .
M	really happy with the phone , arrived the next_day , contract all setup and cheap as chips .
F	everything came , well_packaged and on time .
F	this is going to be my first stop whenever i shop now .
M	this is not clearly_shown on the travelex site and while the blame for this rip_off lies primarily with the credit_card companies a warning about fees , which travelex must be aware of , would have been appreciated .
M	pharmacy_0u beats it '_s competitors hands_down as delivery is next_day and with medication time is of the essence , who_wants to wait 0 / 0 working_days for their medication when it would be much more convienient to pop up the high_street instead .
M	battery delivered for £_00ish , and delivered the day after i ordered it .
F	i sent them back the same day .
F	feel so much happier and more confident .
M	then hang_around for 00_minutes or so until medication ready .
F	however , in practice i had great difficulty actually making the coffee , as it took at_least two attempts to insert the capsules correctly in my nespresso_machine .
M	thanks - colin leonard
M	after the initial_hiccup the tyres were fitted with no further problems .
F	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i '_ve had to sow them back into place !
M	so i went to the local dive shop and bought them .
F	on the plus_side . their 0000 thread bedding and their silk products are to die for !
F	i would definitely use viovet again
F	my mom was left no option but to buy one month '_s supply at an exorbitant price .
F	my house got hit by lightening and had no phone line for over two_weeks , phoning for updates was horrific as you knew you would be patronized by an agent calling you by your first name and not understanding much more they said .
M	not recommended .
M	ordering from the champagne company was mostly as it should be - straight_forward , and with the goods arriving just when they said they would .
F	interparcel have asked for all conceivable personal documentation which again was not explained as why they were required which left me feeling very uncomfortable .
F	ha ving had a set of procook scales for years ( these new ones were for a gift ) i know just how reliable , and pleasing their cookware is .
M	my laptop was delivered promptly and i have been very pleased with it .
F	thank_you
M	so i used saynoto0000 and rang 0000 0000000 .
F	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don_'_t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay .
F	he then called me back to say he had contacted the supplier and my sheds would be another 0_weeks so i cancelled the order .
M	i am very happy to recommend diamond_geezer as well as endorse the impartial_advice and help that they offer throughout the enquiring and buying process .
M	item was subsequently collected after i complained three_days_later than advised .
F	i suppose it is the christmas_rush .
M	how often do your suppliers let you down ?
M	managed to get a delivery ref for citylink , citylink informed me that the package was missing and simply_electronics knew this and should send another phone and claim on insurance .
F	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing_around to sort this on valentines morning .
F	yes it '_s pricey , but i think it '_s worth the extra money , having been through two fairly costly hair_dryers in the past four years .
M	what a cheek .
F	goods ordered were promptly delivered , as_described and with no_problems .
M	if you have days to waste waiting in for collections then this is the company for you .
M	fridge_freezer cost £_000 delivered . local company wanted £_000 for exact_same model .
M	two stars .
F	i can '_t afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn_'_t work .
M	the three that weren_'_t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal_hallway of my building by the front_door .
M	they offered me a better price than many competitors which was great .
F	wait in , wait in !
F	i have previously been extremely pleased with plants from suttons , but not this year .
F	i wish there were more of them .
M	i '_ve had to get credit_card company to suspend the transaction .
M	after a couple of days i hadn_'_t got a dispatch email so emailed them .
F	would highly_recommend to any0
M	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
F	i don_'_t know why they are there in the first place .
F	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story . no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
M	the ordering experience and communication during the process was 0nd to none , but it turns_out that the flowers were left on the doorstep and only notice some hours_later .
M	customer service skills were disgraceful and they dont have a phone number to call !!!
F	not even travel size . miniature .
F	i am_furious !
M	my wife contacted them again yesterday and today and after 00hrs she was told that the bag is still not in stock and it will be 0 - 0 days again ( but who_knows if this is true ).
M	that being the front_door to my flat that you can walk up to from the street with no gates security barriers or anything .
M	thank_you .
M	received 0 envelopes with 0 keys in each but with no paperwork , had to take 0 keys to first cust house to see which were hers
M	jim
M	mothers_day flowers .
M	which i found strange as the evidence so_far was pointing towards a ram / motherboard fault .
F	will certainly order again .
F	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0_days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .
F	i also like the fact that there are detailed product descriptions on all the items on the website , very helpful for beginners like me who don_'_t know which is the best thread for knotwork etc . the bead_shop has_become a source of inspiration for me and i am looking_forward to trying out some of the project ideas detailed on the site .
M	communication :
F	i ordered flowers on sunday for delivery on tuesday .
F	i know from research that the range and prices are also good .
F	i have just used barrington_sport for the first time and had wonderful service .
M	i have contacted parcel_force with the parcel number and they state it still with the sender .
M	tried to change delivery address and this was confirmed on an e_mail package was still delivered to other address when we complained we were told that we could not change delivery address
F	excellent service .
M	throughout this ridiculous ongoing ordeal i have not received a single unprompted call from anybody connected with the company .
M	i purchased 0 tickets for the wales v italy game , but in two different transactions .
M	the money was withdrawn from the account immediately , so i assumed all was well especially since there were 0 in stock according to the website .
M	will_definitely use ace - fx again
M	i ' d defiantly recommend this site .
M	parcel was going to usa .
F	it would appear that the sale sheds are made of of timber that didn_'_t pass quality control first time for the full price - none sale sheds .
M	i recently_purchased some zamberlan vioz walking_boots from openair . co . uk .
M	orders are processed promptly and arrive very quickly .
F	i ordered stuff for christmas_presents & when they didn_'_t arrive within an order i emailed . and then emailed again . and again and again !!
M	i can '_t delete lists .
F	i was told to take it up with maxfactor !
F	where is my gift voucher ?
M	have already_recommended a few friends and family , to use the service .
M	their ' gesture of goodwill ' was on their terms in their time and had no regard for their customers needs , very , very disappointing customer service .
F	do not use .
M	great service speedy despatch of goods .
M	the delivery arrived at 0000 .
F	i would order again , but i would make_sure it was well in_advance .
M	very good , smooth_operation , works very well .
M	used anyvan shipper to collect a motor scooter for me , took a week and a half to collect it from seller then disappeared with my goods for a fortnight !
M	glich !
M	so , be careful on this one .
F	everything runs like_clockwork with extreme precision
F	my biggest grip is with the flex hose orders i ordered and didn_'_t receive which you refunded my money as good will
M	excellent prices and super quick delivery , why look anywhere_else .
M	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing . what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it '_s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service . and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn_'_t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0_weeks !
M	no refund for postage .
F	" get £_00 for recommending a friend ".
F	the lady i spoke to on the monday was friendly and apologetic and explained why i would have to complete the transaction over the phone , which was due to a problem with the website coding .
M	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt_with .
F	product was excellent and very good value , but delivery poor .
M	the replacement drain hose for the dishwasher came with the clamp on to the pump .
M	we loved the customer_services from everyone , the girl we spoke to on the phone and the guy_who delivered and picked_up the lens with our pick_up option and also your costs are brilliant and your location is perfect for us .
M	happy to reccommend to any one
F	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
F	i would , and do highly_recommend the sparkle
F	on a positive_note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
M	shouldn_'_t still be trading .
F	the lenses i ordered arrived very quickly and were as_described but what i received were two lenses and nothing else .
M	ordered sunday , fully_tracked and delivered within an_hour time_slot on monday .
M	now 0 . 00 , no delivery , phoned number on website 0 times , no reply .
M	easy to order - pretty quick delivery but would think a 00 hour delivery could be achieved - would save the plumber from tearing his hair out !
M	however , i have discovered that 0g_network is working fine .
M	these flowers were for a bereavment and was shocking the eay they were delivered .
M	& dispatch is so quick i will without_fail be back .
F	didn_'_t receive order , emailed over 0 times and didn_'_t get a reply had to phone them and was told i had to wait another 0_weeks to see if order turned_up , it didn_'_t .
F	however i had to pay £_00 in taxes which i didn_'_t mind at the time .
F	a very helpful assistant ( josh ) helped_me decide on a style & size , my husband is delighted with his jacket & size is perfect .
F	my husband is a physio and quite_frankly this lot could give physios a bad name .
F	great the blinds fitted properly and i will be ordering some more shortly .
F	i would also like to think by me complaining it may improve their customer service for the next person ?
F	easy to compile
M	and when i called about the problems your staff were very polite and helpful and resolved it quickly .
M	i could not have asked for much more from farnham_cycles .
M	i ordered a gaggia espresso maker from this company which arrived in terrible condition - box was torn , had obviously been opened before and several of the shiny plates / plastic panels were scratched .
F	highly_recomended .
F	this website offers lots of great american products that i am missing .
F	og endnu en mail fra tjekkiet om , at man skulle bruge mit kontonummer etc .
M	they have been taking £_000 a year for their protection_racket service that i don_'_t want .
F	we were sold a sofa and talked into fabric care ( which they gave my friend free !!!!)
M	this is the 0th email in a week plus a postal catalogue plus a personal call - its really ott .
F	delivery was upgraded to next_day as a token gesture which was fine .
M	perhaps a safer and even better option when buying a mobility_scooter is to go to a local retailer rather_than buying something untried online from a company who could lead to the type of problems we encountered .
M	none of the aforementioned was delivered which meant that my mother actually received nothing on her special day !
F	i even went to boots optician to check and confirm there is no n / z mark on that frame design and proposed to them that i can take a photo and show them .
F	emailed them and they don_'_t even reply - very rude .
M	unbelievable incompetence - it is now nearly a month since i placed my order and they have no idea what is even available to deliver !
F	as i was getting free dress , as it was added it to my order , i decided to buy other clothes .
M	was very pleased with the service received and will_definitely use them again and recommend them to others .
F	i cannot say strongly enough that i would never advise anyone to deal with this company , their products or their staff - save_yourself a lot of trouble and shop elsewhere .
F	other than that pleased with the furniture .
F	and the service team always gets your order right -- i '_ve ordered a number of times and never been shipped the wrong product and it '_s never taken more than a couple of days .
M	i had a payg phone with a large_amount of money in credit which i used as a backup to my contract phone with o0 .
M	just as i expected , nothing too fancy but not too bad either .
M	!. if this is what it '_s like trying to become a talktalk customer , i dread to think what the rest if this service is going to look like .
M	pacels0go uses other couriers to carryout the logistics such as tnt / dhl etc and immediately blames these partners when something_goes_wrong .
M	the cardboard ripped and , as i say wide open . all the parts seem to be in the box .
F	i will definitely be shopping here again .
F	the coffee is good and the price also .
F	just read some terrible reviews for this company and i think i was reading about some other courier service .
F	i ordered a plant for my friend for mother '_s day , and incorrectly_entered the postcode .
F	ordered a large roman_blind .
M	we ordered from decuisine over a month_ago .
F	the process if fast , efficient and fault - less .
F	example , one set were too short i . e .
M	i was already perfectly happy with nespresso and their pods , but they simply don_'_t offer enough variety for me .
M	i have a 00 " waist and 00 " chest and am 0 ' 0 '.
M	trevor dodds
F	interestingly the payment was taken immediately from my card --- not good enough i think !
F	my husband was sooooo pleased with the thumb slide business card case , and the free engraving ; his other directors were so jealous they asked me to order for them also , a great compliment to your company .
M	however , i needed to use the pack the next_day , so couldn_'_t return it .
M	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
F	recently tried to book with a competitor ( if you could call them that !)
F	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over_£_000 for leaving the previous contract early and £_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
F	the sparkle helps us to remember the years gone by and sparks memories we had long forgotten
F	this was our 0th time with villa_plus and we were a little dissapointed this time .
F	!
F	i then checked my bank and no nothing had gone in , rang them again and was told that it hadnt been scanned into their warehouse and did i know who collected it ?????
M	i have also experienced really bad customer service from superfi .
F	offered same day service .
M	no help from the company - just a statement that , since i had put it up myself it was beyond their control .
M	at first we were rather dubious , however , we soon realised the professionalism shown by a helpful team , in all the departments to design & advise our flashdrive .
F	got a response after a few prompts stating when they could not deliver and what i had to do and not do and on and on .
F	was pleased with the service .
M	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
F	ordered and received in a couple of days - very simple process and competitive .
M	the flowers i ordered were for a special birthday .
M	don_'_t be taken - in by the massive_discounts that are presented via their website .
F	i have been ordering razor baldes from this supplier for some time .
M	yet as serious as old cognac .
F	the thought of picking glasses out of a line up to buy freaked me out , which is why the home_trial option is so ingenious .
F	however , when i got into placing the photos on the page and scrolling_through the available photos in my folders , the software would crash .
M	the deliveries also went without a hitch .
F	- aucune adresse mail indiquée sur_le site .
F	everything was great , i am fully_satisfied .
F	when i got the package some of the glasses were broken so they sent out replacements the next_day on special delivery .
F	i have forwarded my complaint to an ombudsman and a travel watch organisation , so fingers_crossed they can help .
M	and i still have no product .
F	i was wary of ordering on line .
M	the address was complete and any london courier would know it , failing this why did ' nt they ring me to confirm it ( they ask for your tel_number when ordering ).
F	i recently_purchased the tahiti massage_bed .
M	i asked what was causing the delay and they told me that they couldn_'_t tell me , i then asked if they had been in contact with the supplier and the gentleman '_s response was " no , we don_'_t normally do that with slight delays ".
F	i have bought lots of furniture from oak_furniture_land and i must_say the furniture is lovely .
M	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews , however the service with tyresonthesdrive . com was so good i am compelled to .
F	so it took nearly 0_weeks for me to get the doors - the doors are fine but i wouldn_'_t use the company again due to the length of time it took - it '_s a pity a good company is being let_down by their deliveries .
M	initially things went well , good communication and despatch .
M	i had already had my old sofas taken_away and lounge carpet cleaned , so had to hurriedly obtain sofas from elsewhere .
M	however i will still use the site again .
F	i just entered it on the mazuma website , was immediately given a value for this working order phone and easy to follow_instructions on how to get it , by tracked and insured freepost , to mazuma .
M	quick simple process and booking .
F	bear in mind i hadn_'_t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
M	we '_ve_used allbeauty for buying perfumes & aftershaves for a while now & i ordered two well_known perfumes for christmas_presents from them in recent weeks .
M	i also purchased a gray nicholls fiber glass sheet which i love that was really good value .
M	they never reply to any support chat or support emails .
M	completed 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 : 00 . 000
F	they gave_us a changeover date .
F	we sold 0 phones on envirofine they got 0 bk to us straight_away great but the other 0 we had problems . the 0 found so we couldn_'_t sell which wasn_'_t a problem but the other phone never got mentioned and iv emailed asking about it but never got replied and now its like its getting swept under the rug :/ not good
F	i requested a ford_fiesta or similar which i know will seat 0 adults and luggage comfortably
F	i ordered a replacement oven control and cooker_hood light protector , easy web_page and prompt excellent service , couldn_'_t be_happier
M	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
M	i accept this is the post_office at fault , but glasses_direct then make you wait 00 working_days after the 0 - 00 days you need to wait from the email_confirming_despatch to lodge the loss .
F	i '_m already eyeing the psn +.
F	when the items arrived a week_later they were not fit for purpose .
F	this happened at 0pm on a friday_evening .
F	very have £_00 of my cash and won_'_t return it .
M	it would be nice if you had a service counter as i am only a few miles from your premise .
F	we have not yet received our order because , although the french post_office can find our home , chronopost france cannot .
F	what a waste of their time and mine .
M	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
M	thanks a lot andy !
F	would definitely use hen_heaven again .
F	i have at last had a response to my emails , but still no blanket !
M	lastminute . com
M	i contacted as i was concerned_about the delay in my parcel arriving ( due to the weather ) and i immediately got a response back despite it being the weekend .
M	excellent service and really fast delivery .
F	this was annoying because i did pay extra for the 00 hour service .
M	000_% check before it leaves ( save yourselves in transport costs .)
F	they then came in a did loads of checks and told us that we had changed something in the house that had corrupted the line !!! what !!
M	so , we visited the website which was unresponsive .
M	0pm with a delivery time for 0 hours_later ( between 0000 - 0000 ).
M	i ordered several items , and they were all delivered together , a few_days_later , unlike another national_chain - who on a previous occasion sent one of the items one week , one the next , and the third a month later , then had the cheek to charge carriage three_times !
F	it is not near estepona as the description says , estepona is 0kms away .
M	so i had to ring to confirm what was on the system !
M	in hiring at christmas time we faced hefty prices on car_rentals .
F	thank_you for a very positive_experience .
M	they got me going on waxing and prepping my own skis as well and now i enjoy looking after my own skis and the family '_s skiing is better for it .
F	would use them agajn
F	great communication and fast service .
F	then when i did get a call back at 0pm he said that they will bump my service to next_day delivery and all should be well .
F	needed a fire_blanket for the kitchen and this one seemed to fit the bill - neat , well_packaged , unobtrusive , just right for my small kitchen .
M	which is all excellent .
F	so no anniversary_present .
F	left me short again but i will definitely keep them in mind if i need to borrow again .
F	i was having a clear out and decided to sell some books and dvds .
M	one passenger in the queue phoned airport_parking on his mobile asking for more buses to be put into service and was told this was not possible , which did not help our mood standing in the rain getting wet .
F	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
M	!
F	on friday , 00 june i ordered a bunch of flowers and a bottle of rose wine for my sister - in - law in the hague as a surprise birthday (!)
F	and they have fleeced me of my money .
F	i wanted to take my husband to see two shows .
F	service in ordering the tyres online & booking date were great and although i booked these at 0pm one night , i got a call first thing the next_morning to confirm the date and details , brilliant !
F	i then email iflorist but by 0 o ' clock the following_day i had still not received a reply .
F	on the other hand wowcher offers some good deals .
F	i ordered a moses_basket and it was an easy transaction .
F	regards
F	probably as above !
M	customer service was average at best , taking 0 days to reply to an email requesting a change of order .
F	well_done !
M	so that we would need to pay an extra reorder fee if we could not meet the delivery date told to us in 0_weeks time with only a 0 day delivery date warning .
F	thank_you
F	as i have ordered from you before i had no doubts_about your service and quality of flowers .
F	i can '_t_believe someone can pack a product in a box knowing it is damaged , i ordered a purse and was extremely disappointed in the condition when it arrived , this is down to bad quality control and a don_'_t care attitude , this was an expensive item and looked like it was 00_hrs old .
F	they arrived in perfect_condition & i was delighted - they look fantastic !
M	bull .
F	however , way too expensive .
F	there is always an item out of stock .
M	great to use to customise is a sinch stylish to use and cheap by half the price , quality piece of kit thanks
F	she was given a number in hamburg .
F	if you wish to cancel the order because they are unable to deliver there is cancelation fee .
M	responded to all communication promptly and were more than happy to help with changes to the order .
M	posted my old phone off as soon as i ' d transferred the details to the new one .
F	the time in amsterdam was a little short as the ship was delayed , and we felt like we had to constantly watch the time in case we missed the return coach .
M	0 .
M	what more could you ask for ?
F	never again .
F	i ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my best friends birthday and paid_extra for them to be bigger .
M	the staff i have dealt_with do seem helpful & professional , but they are restricted in what they can do .
M	i just wish that all companies_operated as well .
F	also a long wait to get money refunded .
M	also , the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful !
F	they ' re very easy to use .
F	it is ideal for transporting my elderly friend .
F	they pre_- quoted the best price compared to other recyclers .
F	the instructions were clear but to ensure i got a smooth / clean stick i also watched demo video via youtube .
M	i had smart_meters installed sadly they were not .
F	excellent !
F	excellent quality .
M	the delivery and customer service were excellent and the rug is exactly_what we have been searching for .
M	i got a month web i should be able to stream and download , on the first day i couldnt even watch youtube or dowload , second day i rang up they said they will refresh my account didnt work , they did this the next_day also , now on the fourth day i got a text saying my fair use policy has_been excided after not even streaming or down loading . worst network out there , absoulate bull s ***.
F	i have e_mailed to the home_laundry company & attached a photo of the cracked joint but so far have not had any response
M	don_'_t listen to the hype .
F	but overall brilliant service and lovely villa
F	!
F	a little disappointed regarding delivery .
M	i don_'_t order much from amazon anymore , i find their prices tend to be more_expensive than other_companies and out of the 0 recent orders in which i paid for a timed delivery i have only received 0 on time .
F	great delivery time .
F	however , when i contacted serenata_flowers they replied quickly and asked if i wanted a refund .
F	returns process a bit cumbersome .
F	!
F	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra £_00 to the price .
M	but how they deliver is perfect .
M	brought a grundfos pump 0 years_ago and have been very disappointed so much noise could be heard all over the house and did not last that long .
F	the service we received could not have been better .
F	great - cannot_fault any aspect of service !
M	first time we have used cabrera_medina .
F	no one communicated any of this to us .
F	however , there were a couple of issues that i came_across after the sale that left me a bit disappointed .
F	i was told the error was my fault , even thought i was told it had been cancelled when i phoned and that it was my responsibility to be charged for something i never received or used .
F	james rang me back later to confirm this , which was helpful , but that was all i had to go on .
F	i got a call about 00 . 00 from what i presumed thier delivery service saying that one of two packages were to be delivered today whilst the second would not be delivered untill the next .
M	we had bikes on our roof , and in dover port we were told to go to a cabin to change our booking .
F	i ordered flowers for my mums_00th_birthday on the 0 / 00 / 00 to be delivered on the 00 / 00 / 00 her_birthday , flowers were not delivered on the 00th so missed her_birthday and she leaves the country on the 00th so now a late delivery is pointless very upset as it looks like i forgot my mums_birthday have contacted eflorist by email as i am not in uk but have had no response as yet , not happy at all will not use service again will stick with interflora in future .
M	00hrs_later no reply so i emailed them again .
M	i bought my first mod from ecigzoo when i first started_vaping .
F	i have bought toys for my two caique '_s ’ and they are great quality , i know they are safe for them ; they even put them in categories for the parrot ’_s size so i know they are suited for my parrots .
M	no note nothing which left me bemused .
M	would use this company again
F	i decided not to send the bag back as firstly , normally bags like that are heavy before you put anything in it but this was extremely light and secondly , i really couldn_'_t be bothered to go through the returns_procedure .
M	i had black and yellow fingers for a few_days , which was disappointing .
F	i am a flying blue member which_meant i could access my flight information .
M	it would have been far less frustrating had this been highlighted on the home page so it was easily seen before ordering .
M	i '_m fairly confident i '_ll get my refund , either from simplyelectronics or via visa .
F	always happy !
F	i chose the bundle of joy arrangement but they did not look as nice or have as many flowers as the picture_shown on your site .
F	would highly_recommend .
F	this was a promotional offer via_amazon .
M	well_deserved 0_stars !
F	just such a pleasure
F	:-)
F	found the outfit made very well . the whole_experience was easy and the goods were delivered very quickly .
F	the seats were pretty good , although thought the mark up on the actual ticket price was excessive !
M	i wouldn_'_t bother personally with this hassle , there are better on - line retailers , e_- buyer , pixmania etc .
F	i am so indecisive .
F	yours june scott and husband .
M	go world bound travel .
F	the snorestore has a great selection of earplugs and provides a quick service .
F	i contacted physioroom , and received an_email back advising me it would not be delivered until the next_day . no apology was offered which i found to be quite rude .
M	what is the point of a customer service department with no working computers ?
M	great 00_%_discount , found the jacket i wanted on my phone but when i checked the website it did not show under mens jackets until i searched ' featherlite '.
M	had to go back a again ( yesterday ).
M	only_concern is that the yellow_roses were very pale and after a few_days almost white ?
F	i really would appreciate discreet_packaging ensuring the if the recipient see '_s the package that they won_'_t know anything about what '_s in it !
F	they wanted to charge me an administration charge of 00_% plus return carriage .
F	0 for price but because they sent wrong_colour boxes they get demoted to a 0 !
F	love it !
F	very pleased with my purchases and very quick delivery would definately recommend and use again thanks !
M	i will_continue to make deposit '_s on virgin_games but not like i used too !
F	it was easy to order , informed of its departure and arrived perfectly packaged .
F	had my first eye done on
F	job is always done very well and would have no problem recommending the glenrothes branch to anyone .
F	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
M	pitiful worthless excuses were given in abundance and the goal post of blame being shifted to someone_else '_s pitch .
F	my brother and sister - in - law were delighted .
F	i was contacted by my credit_card company about the " suspicious transaction " ( they obviously know something '_s up with this bunch ).
F	who does eat cold poached eggs ??
F	was really pleased with gjwtitmuss services , quick delivery and well_packaged , would defiantly buy from them again and would recommend .
M	no tickets !
M	the food was great ( large portions ), the room overlooking the garden was perfect ( modern and very clean ).
M	the problem is that tracking is not seamless across borders and delays are experienced whilst we hang on awaiting the possible arrival !
M	!
F	well they arnt !
F	last time i ordered from cheapsmells , they delivered using royal_mail , which_meant i came home , found a little card , and on saturday toddled off to the depot in my home town and collected my parcel , which was great .
F	also the ' goodie bag ' was terrible compared to many airlines .
M	the toilets smelt on both trios .
M	very impressed with selectspecs and will_definately_use again .
F	half the time collected when you say , the other half we have had to chase_up as parcel not collected when you say .
M	good package holidays , more destinations would be nice though .
M	we
M	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )
F	i was expecting to pay a couple hundred_pounds minimum for a 00 might stay , but thanks to hostelbookers , i am spending less_than 0 hundred total , and still staying in a hostel with reviews over 00 %.
M	excellent product , the first order did not arrive although the courier had claimed the driver had been and left a card at the address .
M	such instructions were never given .

M	i am not a believer these days in brand loyalty as it has_been proven time and again that you get taken_advantage of , so it was good to see that boiler_juice can consistently come up with the best price .
F	we were in the villa for one month sheets and towels were changed regularly but duvet_covers were not .
F	this company should be closed_down with immediate_effect , before they cause problems to more innocent victims .
M	explained this in an email , but i wasn_'_t offered anything as an_apology .
F	the corner of the top of the cupboard was chiped as was one of the doors .

F	my house was always thoroughly cleaned and a pleasure to come home to .
F	i '_ve_used other photo sites and it tells you if the quality is good , fair or bad !
M	a *
F	i like the concept and the website is relatively easy to use .
F	no - one called , no message , no missed call - as such , i '_d missed delivery for that day .
F	uniquement des accusés de réception envoyés en automatique .
M	the only good thing .
M	they even reverse out and try again . all this because the signage on the web_page and at the airport are confusing .
F	very easy to book parking but on the day still had to pay full price .
F	i tried to vacuum them off and thought i had succeeded until i presented one to a friend today and still bits of paper were in the nooks and crannies .
M	service was good and efficient at a reasonable price for goods .
F	no_problems with delivery
F	i have queried my order 0 times by email , every time i get a standard reply apologizing to all_sorts of possible complaints but not actually to me .
M	maybe its now different with the change in ownership
F	i had not used winstanleys_pramworld before , but will do again and would not_hesitate to recommend them to friends .
F	very disappointing experience !!
F	plus that the process for writing the gift message was time_consuming as it had ( not obvious ) character number limitations per line .
M	the site obviously uses a bot program to send emails to your inbox from women who are apparently interested in you .
M	you cannot even consider trying to sleep during a 0h flight : you are interrupted all the time with merchandises ( drinks / food , duty_free , lottery tickets , train_tickets .).
M	the packing of my order was appalling .
M	recieved an email from the courier , apc_overnight , on tuesday informing_me that the goods would be delivered on wednesday .
M	hence only bboked room and transfers .
F	although the flowers were very acceptable they weren_'_t what i expected .
F	it '_s a great concept . but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
F	since sending my order number to this company i '_ve been offered a collection on monday , the day it was to be delivered for a surprise birthday_present containing a cake and home made chocolates .
M	xbox_000 transfer kit .
F	), then you may want to consider hammonds .
F	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
F	they keep saying it is new glasses and assured with the quality but they just ignore me with the fact that it is a second class or product with defect / flaw .
F	got what i wanted .
F	i told them to return it then they said it would be returned in over two_weeks !!!
F	luckily my husband was on holiday to be able to return it .
F	the fit is excellent , and the delivery was so prompt .
F	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
M	saves valuable time having to phone multiple garages for tyre prices , the economy option provided by blackcircles . com seem very good quality & at a fraction of the price of the main manufacturers , you get the option to choose a garage local to you for fitting & even specify the day & morning or afternoon appointment , will_definitely use blackcircles . com again .
M	items arrived very quickly and extremely well_packaged , good service , best price .
F	so couldn_'_t keep in box to wrap it up
M	imagine ; it '_s the run up to valentine '_s .
F	i received a voucher for my birthday as i wanted a particular pair of glasses and the sunglasses_shop claim to price match .
M	ordered rug at 0000_hrs on wed and it was laid on my floor less_than 00_hours of ordering .
M	i would not_hesitate in using mazuma again and would definitely recommend them to anyone_else .
M	ordered frontline_flea_treatment which was fine .
M	very irritating !
M	next comes the actual review you leave .
F	the web - site worked efficiently with easy - flow .
F	this is a great site , i have always had good prompt service .
F	i had a bad_experience last time i did , with parcelforce leaving it outside the front_door for anyone to steal !
M	fantastic .
F	updated : just wonder wowcher , you are able to reply this post within 00min , but you have mentioned that 0days mails to be checked ??????
M	while the product wasn_'_t what i wanted , the return process and refund was all dealt_with in good time .
F	i live in northern_ireland and sometimes next_day delivery promise not filled .
F	thanks face the future !
M	overall , though , we think we got good service and would use loco0 again .
F	the flowers were delivered on time .
F	there shouldn_'_t be a need to go into it .
F	summasumarum købes der ikke mere i bolia . com - jeg står og skal købe en ny sofa , men_det bliver helt sikkert ikke hos bolia , den ville jo ikke kunne være i en taxa heller .
F	simple !
M	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
M	no problem but , when my order arrived tuesday_morning i was very pleasantly_surprised .
M	you received it four days ago .
F	the company have not responded and have kept this item .
M	don_'_t expect an immediate_response but will not give up on this without a fight .
F	now trading under tablet gear limited - same director , same address .
F	don_'_t waste your money .
M	information on true position was poor so we were kept there on a succession of broken_promises .
F	i have used partyrama several_times in the past for personalised items and always received them on time with no_problems
F	don_'_t know if wowcher vet their suppliers but delivery on this item was real slow
F	delighted
M	you can go to local_stores and they just won_'_t beat this site .
M	kept in a q for 00_minutes and then was cut_off .
M	bought a couple of excellent bahco tools that will help with my motorbike repairs ; a small socket_set ( sl00 ) and a large 000mm opening adjustable wrench .
F	0 needed_replacing .
M	i have a friend locally who is a mechanic and does all the work on my car so knew that it would pass without_any_issues .
M	bit_disappointing .
M	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
F	delivery was free so i expected it to take longer but was amazed to be notified of delivery the next_day .
M	i would recommend webtogs to anyone they provided a great , reliable , efficient service .
F	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
F	lots of communication to tell me how the order was progressing was very good .
F	pretty sharp_practice think .
M	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised_covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
M	exactly_what i wanted when i wanted it .
F	the negative side for me is that it feels very dry in the eyes .
F	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
M	also wanted parking but didn_'_t have time to pay straight_away so asked if they could reserve a place and pay later no problem whatsoever .
M	!
F	?
M	would definitely use again
F	was recommended by my son and have earned £_000 in about 0_months but have 0 outstanding claims that have not been paid one for a hotel stay in feb and another for recommending a friend if i did not have these outstanding it would have been a 0_star_review .
F	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don_'_t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
F	ordered a grease jacket on friday_lunchtime and i got a text to say it was in the deposit box by saturday lunchtime .
F	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
F	plus they deduct the £ 0 . 00 from your refund even_though i sent proof of postage .
F	found the car_park eventually .
M	i bought my bike from wiggle in september_0000 and since then i have used them regularly ( far too regularly according to my wife ) to buy all_sorts , from clothing , to spares , to nutritional products .
F	----- original message -----
M	again no collection was made .
M	opened the bonnet up to find loose cables where they had gained access to the radiator but neglected to tape them back up .
F	i was sent complete wrong_size to what i ordered then was left with no outfit for my daughter to dress up in for book day .
M	you do realise ther is a recession on you a hole , you might not care if you go_bust , but i cant_afford to piss my customers off .
M	this is a very nice online store where i can find all my aviation " toys " and receive them quickly .
M	purchased new wheel_trims from them and within a few_days they had been delivered .
F	would use again
M	i ' d read a few reviews ahead of doing this that said you have to wait a bit for the cheque , but i thought that '_s ok accounting for time to process the stuff and admin etc .
M	value_incontinence are easy to order from , but you ' re not told when the delivery will be .
M	the worktops are superb , we decided to oil them ourselves , a bit of a labour of love but well_worth the saving available if you are prepared to put in the effort .
F	the tube arrived quickly but i could have brought a dozen on amazon for the price
M	the website said the stock quantity was " plenty ".
F	the medications were so much_cheaper then buying them from my vets ( and that includes the £_00 . 00 i had to pay for each private_prescription ).
M	told to chose some others but did not say which ones could be delivered so just had to try and order another and another and another untill i found one that said i could order
F	very very good service i would highly_recommend viovet
F	good products too - the right price point , given what you get in quality and customer_care .
F	i got cash_back which i just got paid .
M	ordered trainers on a thursday_evening got them on saturday , ordering was easy and not overly mad with details .
F	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
M	0 might be seen as still a little_harsh but the original problem still grates .
F	i have used lenses for hire a number of times_now , and i am always very happy with their service .
M	i tried_ringing the contact number on the paperwork , but no answer from the company .
M	food was in poor condition !
F	excellant product really pleased
F	i will definitely recommend tyre_shopper and national_tyres and autocare to my friends .
F	disappointed
F	they delivered a fridge to me , within a short time it became_clear that it did not work , they wouldn_'_t replace it but sent out an engineer to fix it two_weeks after purchase , the engineer couldn_'_t fix it and then when i asked for a replacement they said the engineer confirmed it to be working !
F	i would recommend pharmacy0u to everyone .
M	competitively_priced goods , free next_day delivery and excellent packaging .
M	booked 00 months in advance , car collection could not be better very slick with very pleasant and efficient staff plus very easy process to drop car back off . but our fiat_000 was marked or dented on nearly every panel plus bits of trim missing here and there , it had over 00000 km on the clock and was looking tired , also no cd or map in car as advertised , it went ok but every other person we saw on the island seemed to have a nice clean and shiny car to drive .
F	didn_'_t arrive till
M	eventually i went through a 0rd_party site and managed to book and pay there .
M	price - 0 *
M	then the cons , like most people had to wait with poor communication , and had heard_nothing until i posted on here .
M	there was no notification of this and i did not get some rather important emails i was waiting for .
F	i would use travelex again .
M	00 . 00 . 00 : i '_m still_waiting for a refund .
M	when i queried this i was told that the reduction was to cover the postage of both units to myself .
M	i might be demanding , but when i see " next_day delivery " when i order something on the friday , i don_'_t think the following wednesday is " next_day ".
M	why would any self respecting company buy all new equipment when reliable , reasonable spec ' clean computing ( for general office use ) is so cheaply available ?
F	when i asked how much longer i was expect to wait for this to be dealt_with ie today a week , a month .
M	ditto .
M	more recently the pills whatever they are and i '_m really not sure turned from being yellow to being blue ( they might have a bit of zopiclone in them but they are basically fake ).
F	the flowers were for my mums_birthday !
F	after my call to the ipswich call_centre where dan , was unable to answer my query , where was my order promised by end of may0000 ?
M	they will go out of their way to avoid any contact and therefore avoid paying a refund ?
F	the standard of the items where great , and they helped_us with providing a trade price .
M	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
F	this was not a cheap bouquet so somewhat disappointed
F	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
F	within 0 working day of my posting i had an_email to say that the payment was being_processed and my cheque arrived the next_day .
M	good product but one of them was not stitched at the bottom of the pajama .
F	more often than not we have to do a 00 miles round_trip to collect goods which we have been urgently expecting .
F	so i waited again .
F	calling customer_services and getting through to the right department and talking to someone_who_knows what they are doing is a complete_nightmare , wouldnt mind so much if the call was a free phone number .
M	i love trains and always look for a train alternative to flying .
F	i could have bought a far_superior bouquet from the local_supermarket .
M	we wanted to return an unused computer as it had been bought in error ( the spec was incorrect ) micro care would not accept the return even_though we bought it on a card .
M	packaging of there books is terrible - had many damaged .
M	summary of cover should tell you exactly_what your particular cover includes and should have clauses such as " if you have selected this at time of purchase ".
F	would not_hesitate to recommend to anyone .
M	if you want a good deal with excellent sales and after sales service then buy in confidence from plumbnation .
M	ebuyer should take notes on speeding things up a bit .
M	but - staff polite and responded to my concerns without_question
M	allay_any fears that you may have that ordering internet meat will make it less fresh - the delivery methods meant the meat was still super chilled when it arrived .
M	i have also e_- mailed them twice but no response i don_'_t think this is a way to run a business .
M	arrived promptly
F	during the day the traffic lights are glowing and any lights
F	i ordered 0 iphones from tmobile , and twice they mess the orders up .
F	he hadn_'_t torn_open the plastic_covering because he noticed one of the arms had a small_crack and had started to rust .
M	i have placed an order and this has_been acknowledged by an email_saying the the table is expected to be available from 00th_may and that i will be contacted shortly_thereafter about delivery / collection .
M	received a voice_mail from complete_care shop management shortly_after my feedback and initial 0_star .
M	no call , no email - no nothing .
F	quick easy to use website .
M	imagine my surprise when the ticket machine showed that i had to pay an extra £_00 instead .
F	so why am i still getting these emails ?
M	i have just kicked him out of my house , after he decided the best approach was to try and con me and fob me off with repairs such as ' colouring in ' the scratches .
M	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
M	she also informs_me that she now has the use of her hands as soon as she wakes up in the morning , rather_than having to wait for an_hour for decent circulation in her palms .
F	shame .
F	i also just get the engaged_tone when trying to ring . what do we do now ?
F	unfair .
F	as a result i didn_'_t get my order until over 0_weeks after i placed it and had to buy my rabbit_food from my local_pet shop while waiting for it .
M	products arrived so so quickly !
M	00 / 00 / 00 update - sent my iphone_0s off to mazuma and they had no problem with it at all .
M	first time buying a secondhand watch but could not have been more impressed with the service .
F	i have been promised the refund 0 times_now but they still have my money .
F	we purchased from the chrome_shelving range for our new home .
M	chair had broken because wood used on seat was of poor quality containing a knot which weakened the whole chair seat .
F	i know where im going to buy my curtain_pole '_s from in the future .
M	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
M	i debate whether i will spend good money with a company you can '_t contact in the future .
F	i chose a mixed bouquet to send to a friend who had been in hospital .
M	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
M	i have been looking for a personalised label printer and came_across patlabels .
F	i was given a delivery date no time and stayed in all day no delivery arrived .
F	recommended .
M	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance '_s ring .
F	the few i could use were filled very quickly .
M	great , fast , efficient , service !
M	i '_m now having to go into our local town and shop for these gifts at various different shops which is a pain as i don_'_t have much spare time .
M	or even black and decker but all seems good .
F	just what i wanted for my wedding photos , will be ordering again from you again very soon
M	driver said they don_'_t take tiles into your home , have to leave them kerbside .
F	first time i have used this company and it is not going well .
F	despite stating that my online account , on their website shows my account balance as £ 0 .
F	my advice would be to open with care , because of the smell and the spores or whatever is on the quilt .
M	hopefully shoetique will get things right this time around .
F	really added a finishing_touch to our baby girls christening preparations .
M	so she didn_'_t get them until she turned_up for work on monday by which times the flowers had wilted and were dead .
F	clear , straightforward and quick .
F	what a refreshing experience - from first contacting paperstone on the phone i have been dealt_with with complete courtesy and professionalism .
F	thank_you for making this an easy way to start the holiday and a relaxing end to just have the car there waiting .
F	after being notified of the wowcher_code i attempted to order the goods via the link given and on each_occassion the code was not recognised .
M	bit_miffed that the member of staff we had asked for assistance buggered off mid way through helping_us as another customer enquired if she could also get assistance !
M	best price , good products , first_class correspondence , super_fast delivery .
F	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
F	you can have the money with in 0days and you dont have 0 pay much back
M	what great service by the advisor that served me .
F	the communication from student_computers was second to none , will definitely be comming back to this site .
F	certaintly giving the name to friends never to use the company !
F	we appealed the decision but still nothing .
M	avoid if you can people , there are other choices that treat you like a valued_customer , not an_idiot
F	apparently this is because the parasol i ordered is out of stock and they will only deliver the order all together .
M	an absolutely_brilliant shop , i ordered my costume at about 0 on a friday and got it before 00 on the saturday without paying for the before 00 delivery , the costume was brilliant quality for the price i paid and came without_any complaints .
F	i did not want an app ans did not download it as i was not intending to use my smart phone in south_africa due to expense of roaming .
M	i will not order from here again and that includes their other site zavvi .
M	phoned ccl again !
M	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
M	i would not_hesitate to advise anyone with any_doubts_about buying from the internet to make their first stop off at watchfinder .
F	the select_specs website was very easy to use and i could get a realistic idea of lens size and shape .
M	the other chest of draws has issues with a wonky foot , cracked woodwork in a draw , damaged top and side surface and a draw that was not machined square .
M	one last thing there was also no one at the budget desk for me to discuss this problem with .
F	other than that all fine .
M	went to national to get my tyres_fitted on the day and time agreed . got there and the tyres had not been delivered !
M	too much effort .
M	i have been using just_kampers for several_years_now , keeping my trusty t0 . 0 on the road .
F	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
F	delivery was then promised for today and once again the order has not arrived .
M	if my company did that we would get so much abuse , and probably end up in hot_water .
M	delivery service has_been second to none , orders usually acknowledged as being shipped on the same day as i place my order .
M	online - £_00 . 00 .
M	however , when assembling the item i found two parts ( plastic spacer caps ) missing .
F	chose your site , verified they would arrive on time , ordered .
F	would highly_recommend this company .
F	i could pay by paypal so no_worries_about giving card_details to an online stranger and the tablets arrived the next_day .
M	i have been using rentalcars for many_years_now , and i can not think of one occasion where i have had a cause to complain .
M	good product / service
F	brilliant service and delivery .
M	the last time we needed to fly was when our car broke_down in france .
M	using the contact message page in their website i asked what the expectations were on the shipping date two_weeks after the initial order .
M	regards
M	they even delivered it the following_day !
M	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
M	as i haven_'_t used them but i am definately happy with my purchase so_far .
M	great delivery service but what made a difference for my wife when buying a gift for our daughter - in - law was your excellent packaging .
F	and to add_insult in injury there staff seem to think they can tell us what we should or shouldn_'_t do and expect us to work for free , why they reap the rewards .
F	i ordered a beautiful organge bunch for my dear_friend in hospital as orange is her favourite colour and i wanted her to see them when she came round from her operation .
F	after over 00 days waiting , this is what we received from expedia :
M	would recomend this merchant
F	on 00th_october i emailed to request an update as my order had not been received and got the following response on 00th_october " due to a supplier error your order is due to be with you on thursday ."
F	product as_described .
F	however on contacting plo they supplied order number and asked us to send photos via_e_- mail which could be forwarded to manufacturer to find out how we proceed phew !!
F	i do not have my driving_licence , and will now have to pay £_00 for a replacement ( and god only knows who has my original licence - very worrying in the current_climate of indentity fraud ).
F	i guess it helps their profits .
M	why does 0 phones get sent and only 0 get there but 0 in each bag and it has to be the iphone not very happy at all , why the 0 phone get there which add up to £_00 but the 0 which was a iphone £_00 get loss !!!!?!!
F	i also had an_email from the customer service guy confirming it .
F	it is a little sneaky when you think e_- bay is upfront about fees before you list and they have a much larger following .
M	was concerned that the phone was lost .
F	dealing_with cookersolutions wasted a lot of my time and effort and my cooker in the meantime is still not working .
F	brilliant customer service - full updates and no concerns to mention .
F	je viens donc de_recevoir le 00 00 . 0000une facture .
F	i chased up the final item six_weeks_later and received a quick and friendly apology and assurance it was still on order and would be delivered soon .
F	when ordering the bag online i studied the photo carefully as i rather liked the idea of a zip_pocket on the outside .
F	so my husband took another half hour out of his work time only for them again to say they '_d phone back .
F	suggestions - give the customer a one to two hour time_slot with adequate notice and if the customer indicates a safe drop_off point then allow that delivery to be made .
M	the quality of the photos is only as good as the original but even then some were a bit darker_than i expected .
F	!
M	so because our polish is virtually nil and the assistants english was quite good , we just had to trust what he as saying was correct .
F	absolutely apalled .
M	i use wiggle from time to time and generally they are reliable and do what they say they will do .
M	i bought the draper 00 piece mechanics bit set ( stock no . 00000 ) for £_00 . 00 , at my local fastparts car shop they wanted £_00 . 00 only difference was it was in a metal case and the one i bought is plastic all the same tools big deal thank_you uk_tool_centre i '_ll be back .
M	the only fault i have with the whole purchase from_start to finish was the attention to detail displayed by the technicians who made the glasses .
M	probably shouldn_'_t have accepted the wheels but thought i could fix .
F	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .
F	this means that the gift box is warped and creased down one side which i '_m_sure my dad won_'_t really care about ( father '_s day gift ) but i '_m quite disappointed .
F	tickets arrived section 000 and further back than promised seating .
F	super servis !!
F	despite arriving at 0 am we were met within a few_minutes of our phone_call .
F	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
F	just waiting for the next offer or info on where i can buy them on the high_street .
F	i will never use this company again
M	£_00 ( including_postage and vat ) for 0gb of ddr0_ram .
M	order no aol0000000 .
M	anyway , as you can probably tell i '_m pretty pleased about the whole_thing and would recommend mr_memory to anyone_thinking of an upgrade .
F	pool was a good size and provided some good entertainment especially for a 0 year_old !
F	i have since not had a reply so am now unsure what is happening with my problem and my replacement .
F	never had a problem , cheap and efficient
M	a great product that does the job , delivered quickly , fitted easily and does not leak !!
F	the delivery company then phoned me to arrange delivery for 0_days_later - after some questionning from me the guy admitted they '_d already had the doors for 0_days but still couldn_'_t deliver for another 0_days - 0_days to deliver 0 doors ?!
M	waited .
M	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
M	thanks and good luck in the future
F	used nissan 0st after 0st mishap through parts_gateway , excellent service , excellent friendly man at the end of the phone for advice .
F	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium_gas_cylinder ran_out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn_'_t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
F	are great .
F	after chasing all day and after_spending no less_than 0 hours on the phone to these people over several calls throughout the day i was advised on different occassions that ;
F	will happily use it again and can only recommend it to my family and friends .
M	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
F	the powder puff box was completely empty !
M	time will tell how they really are .
M	a great price metal_shed that fitted together really well .
F	ok service , would recommend .
M	have recommended them to friends .
M	very prompt delivery with sound packaging and documentation .
F	couldnt_believe_how fast my pedisoothe sticks arrived , it was amazing !
M	very easy transaction fitting_center only 0 miles_away and a convenient time .
F	ich weiß eigentlich immernoch nicht was bei dem ganzen emaail ping_pong mit den komplett inkompetenten servicemitarbeitern raausgekommen ist .
F	this was a helpful website which i will use again if_necessary
F	ordering the flowers was very easy , and the florist contacted me directly to check on delivery details .
M	very good website easy to navigate around to find the perfect eye_wear .
M	flowers not delivered until around 0pm when birthday almost over !
F	by mistake i ordered the items twice and paid twice .
M	i ended_up buying straight_away .
M	i opted to use a german supplier for my givi tanklock tankbag and ' pay more ' because of previous experience with german suppliers on higher end products .
F	i have contacted customer_services but had no response , considering they are a birthday_present i '_m not very happy .
M	il serait intéressant de favoriser les clients récurrents , je loue bcp et personne ne m ' offre une réduction ne serait - ce_que 00_% ou un service supplémentaire .
M	total disappointment
F	hills were really good , phoned and emailed to arrange delivery date even_though our circumstances were complicated .
M	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
M	the replacement mover provided not only refused to assist with putting items in various rooms ( instead just leaving it inside the door for my partner to deal with ), they also broke a door and damaged property , something which was only discovered some time later .
F	the crewebook i ordered was made with the help of a designer and when asked for feedback and editing , i found i couldn_'_t access it properly , i sent an_email and advised what changes i wanted and they were brilliantly done .
M	what irritated was the £ 0 +_p_&_p charge with no options for a cheaper or slower , delivery - for an aerosol that weighs next to nothing although it is relatively bulky .

F	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .

F	this is the first time i have seen the flowers i '_ve sent .
F	easyjet . cheap flights . you get what you pay for . small seats , & fast turn_around . if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you . they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more . having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .

F	lots of vague from prices .
F	i phoned a few_days_later , but the blind was delivered this day .
M	if only everything was this easy and good .
F	cheap_smells is my new favourite online store - my favourite_perfumes at fantastic prices with super quick delivery and great customer service .

F	i was then told by other college class mates that they no_longer use the brushes recommended by the college .
M	selected tnt as they indicated they could pick_up that day .
M	excellent service , highly_recommended .
F	my overall opinion is that the service is badly_let_down by not being_able to speak to a person , emails answered within hours is not an efficient way to operate especially when the answers are sent to a web_page with an emailed link which cannot be opened on ipad etc .
F	we '_ve_used alpharooms now several_times , and have always got the best deal with no_fuss .
F	purchasing shoes from rubbersole was like buying them from a robot .

M	had been looking for this specific hat , and not many places were selling it - light , comfortable , folds & compact .
F	probably not the fault of chemist_direct as it is blister packaged and therefore the fault would not be obvious .
M	0 other snagging problems have been fixed , but the tone of gary left on the phone at the “ eleventh_hour ” was unacceptable ( recorded on answerphone ).
M	finding the right priced tyres and booking my car in to have them fitted was quick and easy .
F	i '_ve also purchased a favourite_perfume of mine at an unbelievable price - i '_ll not buy from the high_street stores again .
F	they look pretty but not what we expected .
F	as i paid for fast delivery - £ 0 . 00 - i ended_up paying far more than had i bought directly from the party shop .
F	i started to build computers as a hobby for friends and family , but in the last_year have set_up my own computer business , repairing and building computers for customers .
M	would definitely use them again .
M	within days of getting it , i would get some spurious streaking and image retention on start - up .
F	as it was out of hours , i had an online_chat to see if i could email a commerical invoice over .
F	easy site to navigate and order but last delivery not as speedy as previous_orders .

F	now i need to ship to uk then ship to malta therefore more_expensive to ship and takes_longer to arrive .

F	on one occasion i put in all our details to be told there was a problem with the site .
F	excellent customer service and very nice people to deal with !
F	phone british_gas . i didn_'_t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .
F	they are always extremely_helpful if i have a question_regarding sizings before i purchase .
F	overall i would recommend dfs to others .
F	the person i spoke to on the telephone was very helpful & friendly .
F	i was very apprehensive_about buying my annuity but as soon as i spoke to george , he made the whole_process so much_easier .
M	the system to book slots for fitting tyres is also poor , it should be possible to view available bookings and select a time , rather_than the booking being sent to the branch and requiring confirmation by them .
F	the warm and friendly service we received throughout the transaction was very much_appreciated .
M	if all internet retailing was like this the high_streets would be even more empty .
F	after 00_minutes on hold . fault department , another round of line testing !!!
M	also didn_'_t get the call 00_minutes before they were arriving , only one when they were 0 minutes away
M	this meant i could not get the correct application .
F	got my discount .
F	on the plus_side it was quick
F	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
M	and it did not come .
M	my first pair ( now 0 months old ) are standing up well to frequent use and washing .
M	excellent
F	i have now rung them over 00 times , half of the times i have been cut_off completely and the other times it is a mixture of no option to leave a message or leave a message .

M	get another job
M	the gentleman dealing_with me seemed a little embarassed and annoyed .
M	go
F	so far , still so good ( though later than i '_d been told ).
M	i am at my place of work all day and apparently the delivery driver tried twice and left a card ( there is only one office door ).
F	the final_result arrived promptly and looks pretty good ( except for the chopped of heads in some pictures ).
M	so the website went down , no emails , no calls to let people know .
M	great selection at great ( sale ) prices .
F	very good service , easy to use website and impressive delivery .
F	arrived on the doorstep very quickly ( 00_hrs ) and sensibly_packaged .
M	talk_talk totally destroys british_telecom on quality and value

M	tried explaining the distance the operator i spoke with but no matter_how much i told them i did not live on an island half way up a mountain with only a dirt track for access , i lived on the mainland 00 miles east of aberdeen & 00 west of inverness in the city of elgin .
M	this is the second year i have used questor and i would recommend their services to anyone who needs insurance .

M	it '_s hectic trying to keep_up with my brothers and sisters .
M	their sister company optimax then ' took on ' the warranty - but all of the ' treatment ' i had from them was displacement activity .
M	we have never used a parking company before and this was our first time so we didn_'_t know what to expect .
M	a bit of compensation for all the upset caused before we left england wouldn_'_t go_amiss !
M	the whole_process was hassle_free , all the staff were very helpful and i would certainly recommend them to others .
M	thank_you go - electrical .
F	i said no as i think that is an insult , i '_ll still be paying £_00 for an item that was sent in error !

F	all of a sudden the courier text me saying they would deliver between 00pm and 0pm .
M	supplement warehouses price match_guarantee saves me money every time i shop !
M	i have received exceptional service in the past and so can only believe that this was an unfortunate blip .
F	city_link definately carded the customer but how could leaving my packing right by my front_door for all passers_by to see and quite easily remove without my knowlege be a safe_place ?
M	this is how it should be done - a fantastic example of customer service at its finest .
M	the company did not have any stock and only after i contacted them did they respond that that they did not have any idea when i would get the product .
F	to get back is a nightmare !
M	for anyone who_wants to receive good quality products or decent customer service , do not use sport and leisure uk .

F	i did try tesco first but it kept on crashing .
M	i had to spend £_00 to get my order on top of the purchase price because your delivery company are stupid

F	will use again .

F	mara , the lady i was in contact with , is friendly , professional , and knowledgeable .
F	so i had to drive twenty miles to the depot to collect it .

F	( this was true ).

M	i was then given an_automated_message_saying due to the launch of the " i phone " they where very busy and ." call back tomorrow ".

M	i have had a mixed experience using your service over the past year , as the heading states the service is often let_down severely by 0 company in particular ( green 0 )
M	!

M	in answering per the manual , i was informed my answer was wrong .
M	hostelbookers is an excellent site - easy to use , intuitive and extremely cheap .
M	very pleased .
M	please , please , please dont use them !!!
F	the whole_procedure has conducted in friendly and professional way .
M	the service is rapid for euro - gbp between france and britain but :
F	when i explained that i didnt pay the full_amount on my bill as my account was in credit , the member of staff continued to say ( as if on loop ) that the bill was for £_000 and i didnt pay that .
M	it also tries to lure you into subscribing to the magazine without making recurring charges clear .
F	the print quality was lower_than i expected .
F	the website was clear about which model could be used .
F	on measuring i discovered the bracelet was actually only 00cm long .
M	a quick and cost_effective method to buy tyres with a personal touchk . the tyre_fitting company recommended was near and effective
F	did an on line search and quoteme0 were coming out the best price , i asked for various different quotes from them and all was dealt_with incredibly efficiently and they answered all my questions very thoroughly .
F	i did this , but with some_confusion .
M	hassle_free and easy to use .
M	but i am shocked at the level of customer service i received from the manager herself , who is supposed to be at the forefront of and a shining_example of customer service .
F	i will definitely recommend them and will use them again .

M	i had to ring them and they bought the car to the airport about 00_minutes latter .
M	received a call to let_me know drivers_name and when he will arrive .
M	don_'_t get the customer to do the donkey work of ringing paypal , do it at the behest of the customer when it '_s your mistake .
F	once i received confirmation it actually isn_'_t a true meet and greet .
M	despite what some customers on here say because they are too stupid to insure their parcel or don_'_t understand what ' non guaranteed ' means , if this happens to me parcel0go ( out of all the courier companies ) provide the best customer service and cheapest rates too .
F	delivery was prompt ( received my order next_day ) - well_done paperstone for your customer service and your very competitive_prices - i will certainly be using your company again in the future .
F	flowers were nice but my card and message were not included , which was a shame as i had written a special poem for the recipient .
F	middlesex .
M	ordered late , still delivered the next_day .

F	re - ordered the belt and it arrived the next_day - wow .
M	i then_proceeded to copy and paste the lines above .
F	webpage not easy to use .
F	overall i was pleased to have received my order promptly , but if i had taken time off work to receive the delivery it wouldn_'_t have worked smoothly at all .
F	refund is the least i expect , she stayed in all day till 00 . 00 waiting .
M	detailed the issue only to get an email response saying ' there is no compatibility_issues between w0 & 000 ' - very patronising and clearly they hadn_'_t read my detailed briefing sheet or taken an interest in my case .
M	you get where you want to in the end .
M	no reply .
F	the envelopes to return the phones were sent within a couple of days and instructions were clear and helpful .
F	concerning .
F	i go off very early , so i stay in the quality hotel and leave my car there - the only_drawback is that breakfast , which is meant to be part of the deal , is not available !

M	quite_simply a fantastic experience .
F	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .

F	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase .
M	i can '_t be helping you pc not working , i said again . look i work in customer service if i write things down that are confidential it can be shredded . why can you not write something , do you have a pen , i can '_t be answering that question . end of call arrrghhh . call 00 . 00am this morning and talk_talk like i said on the phone i am busy have things to do , if i have to call you again i will charge my admin_fee of £_00 . 00 per call

F	waited 00 and didn_'_t got any package even when i had to check with the local royal_mail distribution center and this happened twice .
M	i wasn_'_t overly confident about ordering more ram for my laptop , as i wasn_'_t sure what type i ' d need specifically , and if it ' d fit_properly etc .

M	fully appreciated the assistance of lee from ilford .
M	when i queried this with watchfinder , i did not get the courtesy of a response - i suspect that this is because the watch was guaranteed for 0 years only !
F	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 . meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves . yes . as good as half the amount i paid .
F	i asked if there was anything that could be done on the postage and they refunded it in full .
M	flew with easyjet again after a few_years break , i have to say they '_ve really upped their game . clean planes , friendly cabin_crew , etc . unless ryanair lowered my expectations from the aviation industry ?

F	the process of getting a potential car i was going to buy hpi checked was no problem at all .
M	i contacted alpharooms who told me that they had cancelled it because they had not been able to obtain payment on my card , even_though there was no_indication of payment not going through at the time .
F	was told that they had tried to phone me but no - one had left a message .
F	perhaps with working on them and fitting the lenses , the legs had loosened but the legs were so far apart that they wouldn_'_t stay on my face even when looking_forward never mind moving around and looking down .
M	feedback from the company was fantastic when one of the products was out of stock .
F	and what would i say ?

M	at the onset of a short shower passengers on the top deck were immediately given waterproof ponchos .
M	as there was 0 people and baggage we really had no choice , but the car at we originally chose stated that this would be the correct_size for our party .

M	told when ordered it would be 0_weeks but it did take 0 , they did send some bike lube and jellies with the order though .
M	would i purchase glasses from glasses_direct again very doubtful
M	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
M	no in process of waiting for a response after returning the incorrect glasses .
F	et_pas un seul message pour nous prévenir : c ' est à nous de le découvrir presque " par hasard ".
M	not particular good value , the biltong pack contained just a few very small pieces of meat .
M	all in all i was very pleased , and fail to see why anyone would by a worktop from the big diy_stores at nearly twice the price .

M	always order from chaos_cards really good amazing service 0_star
F	will certainly use them again .
F	for that reason , i wouldn_'_t attempt to book through them again as my issue was something that could have so easily been rectified .
M	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
M	will use parcelforce in future .
M	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
M	the purchase process was easy and simple , delivery was quick and efficient and the overall functionality of the website was simple yet exactly_what you need .

F	the website was easy to use and included all the information i needed to find the correct products .
F	delivery was very organised
F	these bulbs arrived in the blink of an eye - it was an excxellent service and my christmas lights are once again shinging brightly .
F	we were asked to telephone as well as contact the manufacturer of the item ourselves !
F	very impressed i will definitely use country_attire again .
M	i suppose that if ten deliveries to multi_storey premises were made that would enable ten charges to be raised .
M	ordered filing_cabinet that is described as 00 day delivery ( as non standard colour ) 00th_september , preferred delivery any thursday / friday notified at time of purchase .
M	good price for phone so nothing to complain_about .
M	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
M	i run a property_maintenance business and have used your company many_times
F	the flowers them selves were nice though
M	they then mistakenly charged me twice for line rental at our new property , yet another phone_call to them .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending tropic breeze to anyone .
M	no notice that one of my orders was not a availiable and also instructed to deliver order to neighbour which never happened and had to go and collect myself
F	i would definitely not recommend them .
F	0_months on and still no refund .
M	i have to get a bus and a train to get there , which means i have to get up early on my beautiful precious saturday_morning .
M	the current method forces me to pay for 0 days for a 0 day car_hire - not good !
M	i used their drop_off and collect service which suited me , and the recipient down to the ground .
M	much to my pleasant_surprise , i got an email with a couple of hours to say it ' d been dispatched and lo & behold it arrived the following_day .

M	anything_else ?
F	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
F	item was faulty and cost £_00 to return .
F	and the bag was horrible it was cheap and smelly and it wasn_'_t cheap either !
M	all nice people serving though which is always nice .
F	ordered 0_days ago and they still have not turned_up .
F	so would highly_recommend purchasing from them .
M	first time using a mobile_recycling site and couldnt have been easier .
M	ordering and delivery simple and efficient .

F	he also managed an additional sale as i was unaware that i needed software to go with the purchase .
M	ordered flowers they use yodel courier , never arrived on day promised . then receive arrogant call from customer_services can say can arrive up to 0pm that night , will reclaim from from card provider , definately not recommended , avoid plenty of other great websites ?
F	the tap in the utility_room needs changing , it fell_off on use , and i got drenched !
F	i would need a lot of convincing to use this company again
M	sadly expensive on most items .
M	it was very simple to find what we wanted and place an order on the website .
M	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens . in 0 to 00_hours !
F	!
F	apart_from that they were ok
M	will_definately_use again .
F	in future i shall use one of the many other_companies in this field .
M	on my persona
F	the flowers that arrived were smaller_than_expected and different_colours to those specified .
F	until this i was very pleased with the service .
F	after receiving the samples ( which took the full five days to arrive ), we ordered for delivery on 0 / 00 / 00 .
F	the size_guide was useful .
F	they apparently were going to deliver it yesterday pm slot despite waiting in again guess_what its still not here .
F	00_minutes had past making it 00 minues since i originally called and still no one was there to collect my car .
M	starting with the web_site ; the x 0 service enquiries i made ; the tracking_facility provided and then finally with the delivery the whole_operation was seamless , first_class and very professional .
M	frost did phone me and explained there had been a problem on there side as the price was wrong .
F	i can '_t say it '_s all bad , i can see , but quality of general vision has_been compromised to such an extent it '_s very annoying and difficult to simply ignore as much as i try .
F	!
F	we then ordered our order of service .
F	!
M	plesae confirm by return that i have been fully refunded and that no purcase of goods of any desription was made .
M	apparently it '_s yodel '_s fault - yes they use yodel to deliver .
F	i am not impressed with the overall experience really .
F	i '_ve just been on this really great website with discounted perfume and aftershave .
F	i changed the order at_least a dozen_times before i was happy with the presentation .
M	i don_'_t want and i can '_t keep this ring and now i have to return it as well as i have to return the ring of my fiancé .
M	the uk transport was as it should be , the german transport was very slow .
M	!
M	ordered a timber pergola on the 00th .
F	i guess it was my hard luck that my old machine decided to nearly set on fire 0_days before christmas !
F	haven_'_t been disappointed yet , excellent service .
F	abundance of colour and plenty of flowers to be spread over 0 vases .
F	what a sorry_state of affairs .
F	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
M	i placed my order and the parcel was delivered the next_day .
F	ordered .
M	therefore , in the first instance i '_ll be pushing them for an immediate replacement .
M	update 0jan 0000
M	we go every length to make_sure you get everything you need and to keep in touch with you to make_sure everything is running the way you want it to "
M	the first call using wifi / 0g would always be bad ( sound cut up ) but the next call is always a better one .
M	easy to buy policy and very straightforward - the service matters however if i have to claim .
F	their customer service advisors are amazingly rude .
M	also we booked a saab 00 convertible and although we didn_'_t pay any more i was a bit unhappy at the change .
F	i have just received my third order from diet_chef .
M	i would not_hesitate in recommending fonebank as their service is great , i sold a iphone0s and ipad0 to them .

M	.
F	maybe he could explain exactly how we were to find out that a cartridge they say is compatible , wasn_'_t without trying it in the printer ??
M	i have insured with them ( claim free ) for many_years_now and dissapointed that there is no form of recognition when you renew with them and no no claims discount_scheme available .
M	usually it is all fine and that one time it arrives bashed up and the driver thinks its fine ?
F	in the mean time i discovered " pramworld " i ordered a mamas and papas cot_bed mattress on the thursday_evening before good friday and was told it would be here on the following wednesday ( that wasn_'_t convenient ) but with a couple of clicks i could choose another day or could have it left with a neighbour .
M	i nearly always use travel_republic to arrange my holidays .

F	absolute_rubbish as site is a business .
F	the price is a bit expensive but then i am getting a great service and bedding .
M	so wowcher are saying that it was after we bought & paid in full for the deal & booked the accommodation we were then informed of the fact we needed our flight information .
M	never again !
F	only to discover that i have been refunded the full cost of the bouquet because m & s inform_me that due to some kind of hitch , my flowers will not be delivered for another 00_hours ?!
M	phoned helpline all one got on numerious occasions was we are working on system it may take a week to fix , but some orders are getting through . totally unaxceptable get better it support , only because of price did i persist other wise i would have shopped elsewhere . speed up order process , and opperators be a little more helpfull
M	the quality of the suit is good .
F	the aftercare staff are no help what so ever , i booked a car with rentalcars . com was told everything was covered , when i got to my desination i was chanrged another 000_euros , i have tried to call customer service and was told i had to email them , i received an_email back to be told they would contact me again within 00 days , very poor service do not use them unless you want to be ripped_off
F	perhaps someone from virgin will s
M	it took one phone_call and two emails for them to refund me - an unacceptable waste of my time .
M	the police were not impressed .
F	the only_downside was the actual flowers , i '_m not sure what florist they came from but they were awful .
F	when i asked if i could use it online of course the answer is no !!
F	i have friends who have had similar_experiences with end and as a result they have lost not only my custom but also that of friends .
F	mrs kane
M	i order some flowers at 0 : 00 in the afternoon ready for " next_day delivery " to an address in warwickshire , the following_day i called the cust ' service number at 0pm to enquire what the eta was on delivery , the guy checked the tracking_number and the flowers were currently in cambridgeshire !
M	it was also delivered very quickly .
F	i purchased some dressing_table mirrors from this company .
M	they will not pay for return postage .
F	i then went to find the car .
M	would definitely use again .
F	0 on the 00rd_december . yet again a generic_response saying my query had been received , and to allow 00hours for a response and with yet another reference_number !!
M	they then said they would refund me in full .
F	well what can i say !!
M	the product purchased was fantastic , no issues .
M	can only recommend , good price and quick delivery and beautiful flower as !
F	i really thought i had ordered a bouquet of assorted flowers not just carnations
M	quick delivery at a convenient time .
F	spacious_villa well_equipped in a nice location , although we were glad we hired a car as entertainment in calleo salvege was limited .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	all at a very competitive price , couldn_'_t fault service .
M	the quick change lenses are individual and push in and out of the frame .
M	if tdl feel bad about this level of service please email me on peterkennedyjfk @_gmail . com and offer me £_00 in compensation for having to wait around all day thursday and then having to get up at 0am last friday to take delivery .
F	i ordered these for a birthday_gift and my friend was absolutely_delighted .
M	as it was nearly six pm i thought i would wait_until the next_day to hear .
M	00 hr later my money was still not paid to the recipient due to reasons which were opposite of what i was told the previous day .
M	i paid for nitrogen inflation =£ 0 . 00 ( whaaaaat ?!)
F	most of the problems weren_'_t missguided '_s fault , but if i '_d of known a signature was required , i wouldn_'_t of gone with next_day delivery , as it could of been left with the neighbour then .
F	there '_s a quota system anyway , so if they ' re sold out , they ' re sold out - what '_s the difference .
M	if only all suppliers offered a similar service .
M	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
M	?
M	when it comes to using a 0rd part delivery company , that delivery company is representing rubblesole and is typically the only physical contact the customer has with rubbersole .
F	following an upgrade decided to sell my faulty blackberry .
F	villa_plus take a great deal of time and care over their photographs , with lots of props and staging and we realised that and don_'_t expect it to be set_up like that when we arrived , but the totally bare and stark look of the place was a bit off putting .
F	i am sure you would prefer if your customers are happy .
F	i was charged for both and only received one .
F	will be using again
F	will definitely use them again
M	my credit_limit was £ 0 , 000 .
F	they say the dispatch within 0_days but after 0_days i had to ring them .
F	!
M	everything ok
F	i was disappointed and a little annoyed but i found some one that charged me £_00 less_than ao . com if they had of fitted it for me .
F	my order was what i wanted and it was delivered very quickly !
F	the whole_experience has left me out of pocket , upset and with a very very low opinion of this selfish company .
F	well , it does a good job , but the stitching is coming_undone on the velcro to which the strap is attached .
M	no shower delivered .
F	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
M	!
M	i shall no_longer be relying on any reviews on here to make my decisions .
M	first_class product ,
F	and don_'_t blame customers for putting other items on the shelves - perhaps they give up because they could not understand what is actually on an offer !
M	it '_s great that anybody can pay cheaper prices to use the real couriers , this blows post_office out of the water .
M	but that ’_s one bad_experience nestled in amongst a great many good ones !
F	lights were ok as were the brake_discs the wiper needed adjusting .
M	their communication is good , i have had a few_times where they have phoned me to check delivery details etc .
M	ebay protect buyers , even the scammers but are completely unsympathetic to cheated sellers - if there going to end a listing and zero the fees then they should do a complete job - its only a matter of telling the software how to do it .
F	i would have thought that the large_amount of cardboard which my purchase came in would have been taken_away by the van_drivers like other shops do .
M	if i hadn_'_t checked my refunds , i would be seriously out of pocket !!
M	it was 000 $ when i bought my item but credit_card was charged for 000 .
F	we were told not to worry_about it - even_though your literature clearly_states that anyone can enter your room with a lost key .
F	excellent services from_start to finnish .
M	i am going to e_- mail the branch and cancel my order and ask for my money back , it would be a waste of time and the cost of the call to phone hounslow branch .
F	hassle_free .
M	after 0 days i went to deliver my car .
F	they emailed back saying they wanted a photo , i replied and said the box had been disposed of .
F	after half an_hour ( of his work time ), they told him they '_d phone him back .
F	i ordered them months in_advance too .
F	very impressed with mattress purchased for the price paid .
M	this is when i was informed that the last frame had been sold but there were some on there way in a week or two .
F	when we ordered the dolls_house , there was a problem with the online payment page and it was not clear whether the payment had gone_through or not .
M	no tyres .
M	eventually made the 00 mile_round_trip to pick the roof_box up from the couriers which really defeated the object of buying online .
M	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
M	really impressed with the customer service .
F	it also takes_forever to wax the items and it stinks whilst you are doing it .
F	rubbish customer service as i don_'_t want emails saying still no stock , either refund or let the customer chose an_alternative !
F	it was better_than i expected .
F	i think it '_s ridicules .
M	all as expected will no doute use you again
F	all in all , they are a bad company because their website is deceptive and misleading , saying " easy returns " and then listing incomplete and inaccurate_information under their online " returns_policy ."
M	my shorts have not arrived
F	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
F	lovely bedstand but think about a different matress .
F	they took my money and sent an_email that confirmed despatch for delivery next_day .
F	we bought our corner settee unit and oak television_unit from colwick , nottingham , and was promised a wall clock .
F	i had to order from somewhere_else .
F	i still_haven_'_t received my goods , it '_s been 0_weeks .
M	the mountain_equipment crux tee i purchased was the best price i could_find , it was delivered promptly and was well_packaged .
M	paid for next_day delivery , but received a part delivery , a day late .
F	the monday was a bank_holiday , on the tuesday i spoke to a very helpful nice lady i think this was amanda , who looked into it for me and who told me it hadn_'_t been sent out on the thursday , and told me it was being sent out straight_away and i would get it on the wednesday - which i did .
M	they advised me the product had been despatched - on the day i received it .
F	the recipient is disabled and would never have known had her neighbour not told her as no - one left a card through the letter_box regarding the delivery and where to find it .
M	selfish greed has lost you sales and i advise anyone not to purchase from this seller !
F	plus the big black lines use a lot if ink
F	i am in france but did expect that it should have arrived by now ( the 0th ) but still no show
M	immediate sending and delivery of what i needed
M	vehicle provided t &_c van ( no intermediate suv '_s available although confirmed at time of booking ) had to be replaced on day0 for a mechanical problem .
F	i was actually quite embarrassed when my house mate came home with them , considering the price i paid .
F	there are so many different options and it '_s hard to judge from the website .
F	we ordered on the sunday and our coffee_machine was delivered on the wednesday .
F	i ordered in the afternoon and received the goods the next_day , all packed very well . what great service
M	i have used the cyclestore website to purchase mostly specialist cycling_clothing and have yet to be disappointed with either the service or the goods received .
M	sent me four tubes for my fish_tank , two were labelled the wrong_colour and one did not work .
M	a v . good experience .
M	happy_bunny :)
M	all i can say is if you are looking for a company to repair or supply parts for your iphone ipad this company are probably the best you will find , there customer_services is second to none and they really do go the extra_mile to make things write , riki has done more then i could of asked for and there are very few companies that will treat you this way anymore .
F	on returning our car to the car_hire company , enterprise , we were told there was not enough staff on a bank_holiday to leave the desk and check the car back in at gatwick_north airport .
F	it '_s advisable to read old and new reviews as there could be a reason for an improvement or deterioration .
F	prestige have also stopped me posting on their face book page - i put nothing other than the truth , in a reasonable way !
M	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
F	it '_s the worst online ordering experience i have ever had .
F	gatwick moat hotel ( best western ) was brilliant !
M	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
M	i found this an easy to use system where i got exactly_what i needed without_any fuss or bother and at a competitive price
M	after that i finished in 00_minutes .
M	ordered on the internet website , very good description of items i needed .
M	the process was slow - and in the end i had to chase them .
F	fantastic service couldn_'_t fault mazumba
F	but the getting the refund was a nightmare !
M	we eventually got into our rooms , we were offered nothing to make us feel any happier with the situation , the hotel should have offered us complimentary breakfast or at_least wiped the bar bill clear , but nothing !!!
F	we have been in all day !!
F	i contacted customer service but i am afraid i have had no response at all
F	bought some hair products for myself and some perfume for christmas_presents , i was amazed_at how much i saved compared to if i bought the products from the companies themselves , for example tigi shampoos and conditioners usually cost a fortune if you buy them from hairdressers or other beauty wholesalers .
M	purchased on the web , the piano was delivered on the agreed date .
F	the only_reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get_hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander_mcqueen again so i can buy more .
M	tracking it today and the data has_been removed from the tracking yodel data_base so i have no idea when to expect it .
F	i now actually do not have a delivery date .
M	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic_excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
M	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
M	however , considering the display cost £_00 . 00 ( plus 0 . 00 delivery ) i was most disappointed with it .
M	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
M	there really is no excuse for a poor fit with such an array of great products at affordable prices .
M	damaged goods .
F	quick and convenient servoce
M	so affordable for the amount you get .
F	submitted the details on line , paperwork arrived the next_day and phone sent off same day .
F	swith on , swith off , change socked , open the socket , flip the modem , dance samba with modem , everytime the same expertly advised procedures .
F	i want to warn_people about mk exhibition based in milton_keynes , as i have been the victim of the director '_s previous company house0market . co . uk and he has left me £_000 out of pocket .
M	back .
M	i was told a number of things by amazon , such as it will_definitely be delivered in the next 00_hours , 00_hours absolute max ( i was told that twice by two_separate amazon people on different days .
F	now for some accessory purchases .
M	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
F	really fast delivery would buy from you again
M	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough_search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .
F	the customer service was very friendly , helpful and fast .
M	dr c smith
F	they hadn_'_t but suggested i visited the on - line store .
M	after the third day of waiting the courier web_site showed the order had been destroyed .
F	i came in friday_evening , and was absolutely_furious as no one had turned_up .
M	this website purports to be run from the uk it is not , they have a serviced office virtual office address in londons harley_street .
F	wrapped in bubble_wrap and taken_care of very well .
F	i will_continue to buy from cheapsmells it would be silly not to as you can save so much money .
F	i used this florist because they had many choices , including the one i needed .
M	now we have to hope and pray we get our paid for mail .
F	by this time the party was imminent .
M	many_thanks and keep_up the good work !
M	i '_ve purchased suits in store and the customer service and quality has_been fantastic .
F	contacted " the happy_puzzle_company " the item was not in stock but would be in in 0_days and they would send it up first_class .
F	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
M	profuse_apologies from customer_care and replacements sent after i had returned wrong_size .
F	shocking customer service - i will not use again !
F	beautiful flowers by a company who kept you updated until delivered .
M	!
F	when i chose the bouquet i opted to pay an additional £_00 for the largest on offer .
F	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do_business .
F	use a trusted florist or better still marks &_spencer .
F	ordered item but was not told it was out of stock until emailed a week_later !
M	phoned away holidays having seen an on line ad for the maldives spoke to a charming_young_lady_who listened advised and managed to achieve what i wanted in respect of flights , airport , times and price !!
F	as my garden is being landscaped at the moment i have not used the product ordered but i '_m_sure that i will not be disappointed .
F	i have now used fonebank twice over a two year period , both_times selling blackberrys .
M	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
F	when looking for a fridge - freezer , i searched the websites of major companies but found that none of them provided the quality of products and service that i required .
M	if you can , go see it first .
F	i found the web - site easy to use , the goods were delivered promptly and were of good quality .
M	i bought a nokia_lumia_000 in november_0000 and i am pleased with the phone and the deal .
F	good selection easily viewed then very fast delivery .
F	told by female_member of staff that she would authorise a refund and arrange for collection on 0th_jan said that it might not be a two man pick_up !!
M	the ambiguity of the item on the website has caused me to score lower .
F	would definately recommend this company .
M	fast delivery of code , brilliant .
F	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
M	i wanted to find a cheap hire car that was situated close to the south_terminal at gatwick_airport .
M	hand book omitted from pack handed to me .
M	asked for a refund but customer_services they do not have that policy and i need to follow_up with email .
M	will not use again .
M	delivery took four days and the promised emails concerning date and time of delivery were not sent to me .
F	a great team arrived with the sofa , and were most accommodating in getting it into it '_s situation in the basement of the house .
F	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
M	instead you '_ll be out of pocket once you '_ve made your refund .
M	do not buy compatible_inks for a lexmark .
F	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
F	while they have a gift option and perhaps a better box would have been chosen for that purpose people buy premium drinks to display / give as gifts and boxes should be intact !
M	thanx and keep_up the excellent service !
M	comfortable .
F	all in all very happy with the service and will definitely be buying from them again .
M	very convenient that the online service meant i did not have to travel to an optician to do any of this .
M	dispatched next_day arrived the following_day updated on it '_s progress regularly couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	however , the delivery man was not willing / able to put it in my bedroom !!
F	i work all day on a sunday , so there was no way it was delivered to my house .
F	is that a coincidence_?
F	so why_bother choosing one ?
F	i had to go out and left my daughter to sign for the delivery .
M	i would thoroughly_recommend this company and will_certainly be purchasing from them in future .
M	this problem was reported one evening to np_autoparts limited and by late morning the next_day a refund for the defective wiper_blade was offered and accepted .
M	delivery was included and via a courier .
F	this caused me a weekend of absolute panic and hell .
M	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren_'_t able to go on a holiday .
M	another phone_call to be told the part still hadn_'_t come in .
F	i bought a buzz 0 package including pram , car_seat and push_chair .
F	i asked to be dealt_with by another member of staff as at that point i was willing to go elsewhere .
M	the quality here didn_'_t really match the price
M	!
F	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i '_d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
M	i have bought non - branded cartridges before , but i have never been that impressed .
F	i tried to tell the company this , but , yes , you guessed it , they were not interested at all with no apology or offer of refund .
F	my hermes always showed up on time and i '_m very disappointed their services appear to have been dropped .
F	not always the cheapest place , but have managed to find some great offers on the plays and restaurants in london .
F	finally , 0 . 0_months after starting my service , they determined there was a traffic problem in my area .
F	i am still_waiting for my parcel to arrive .
M	but can save up to 00 / 00_euros if planned .
M	customer service useless .
F	good prices and delivery was with us at 0000 on the morning after_placing the order at 0000 the previous day - can '_t get better_than that !!!!!!!!!!
F	!
M	!
F	ec0000 .
F	previously the tops were great , however unfortunately a bit disappointed with this order
M	thanks
M	absolutely no_problems at all .
M	i spent over 00_hours chasing this , jumped through_hoops for the staff at multitrip , completed all the forms , sent all the pictures from the holiday , did everything by the book only to be told we werent covered !
F	received the photo_book fairly quick .
F	as it is a personalised item the company doesn_'_t accept returns .
M	steer_clear of both holidayautos and international .
M	!
M	not even up to the standards
F	ordered the mattress which i was informed would take up to 00 days to arrive .
M	i ordered some valentines flowers for my wife , to be delivered on valentines_day .
M	excellent service .
F	when the light had not arrived by 00th_november , i emailed and received a response to say that it would be delivered to me the following working day .
F	i want to post it abroard , so i need it to get to me in the next few_days .
M	i would never go back to virgin and advise others to be very wary of this poorly run company .
M	engraving looked cheap and only get a few words free .
F	definitely thanking the day my son found this company .
M	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
F	shame same cant be said about the delivery which was not quite what i expected .
F	driver left no message or asked for i . d .
M	my 00 year_old father has had a pride 0 mph scooter for some years which has_been excellent in operation for him .
F	we received a request from a site owner to reconsider [ website ] for compliance with google '_s webmaster guidelines .
F	very good quality , very glassy
F	the process was really straightforward from entering details on the website , to receiving the envelope in the post and posting my phone to mazuma .
F	what ?
F	i called the office the next_day but i had no apology and was more or less told i '_d made the payment incorrectly which i know was not the case . had i not wanted the product quickly i would have cancelled my order .
F	would not use again if my life depended on it .
M	the only thing ' supa ' about this company is the speed at which they took my money .
F	it was meant to be heated .
M	good engraving , trophies as_described , and good value for money .
M	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
F	still no delivery .
F	i have already used them on my cereal and in a sponge cake .
M	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock .
F	i ordered on 00th_march at 0 . 00pm and only
F	the fitter then returned on the 0th_june and the wardrobe_doors were cut incorrectly , and filler panels the incorrect size .
F	i would recommend this service to anyone .
F	.
M	0 month later i find a £_00 charge on my bank_statement for prime .
F	quick delivery and was texted with expected delivery time within an_hour_slot .
F	the quality of the sunglasses are great , it arrived the day after i purchased them .
M	you can do this continuously all morning and you won_'_t get an answer .
M	great service , prompt delivery and goods in perfect_condition .
M	as above in more detail every time i tried to order through your web_sight it kept telling_me the page was not available .
F	they were a small , cellephane wrapped bunch which did not even contain the flowers depicted in the image .
M	but i was not under insured .
F	on arrival at the hotel ( around 0_months after booking , and around 0pm ), the receptionist informed us that alpharooms had not forwarded our requests on for neighbouring rooms , and had not told them that we had booked for 0 people in one room ( one triple and two doubles ).
F	lucky for me the local milkman helped_me when he saw this behaviour .
F	i also found they were rude and defensive , everything was my fault rather_than theirs !
M	why did i deserve to get treated in this terrible manner ?
M	excellent service from purchase to receiving the items . very quick and prompt well_done .
F	i am happy with it but it could have been better .
M	the flowers were nothing like the picture on the website , and the card was damaged with significant spelling_mistakes .
M	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don_'_t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
M	these mistakes were handled very efficiently and courteously , but they shouldn_'_t have happened in the first place .
F	will go for one of the other boards next time .
F	i ordered 0 pairs of track pants on 00th_january_0000 .
M	but for three years i have been fighting bt over poor and declining telephone and broadband service .
F	!
M	my goods had been dispatched within 0 days and had been left at the parcel_force sorting_office .
M	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music_related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
F	where i cannot_fault the communication by serenata_flowers , the actual delivery of my flowers left a lot to be desired , they did not appear until the evening , which , in my view , was far too late .
F	i spoke to animed and they were very apologetic ( obviously this was out of their control ) and they explained that they never usually have problems .
M	thanks alex ps still cheaper_than high_street .
F	i found the phone_call very good , easy to understand and reasuring , and paishant .
M	i thought the instructions re the layout of photos on mug could have been made simpler .
M	very good customer service :)
F	i was looking for a new larder_fridge and came_across appliances_online .
M	!
F	the daily emails therefore have become a bit of a chore .
F	i am a happy customer and will shop with you again .
M	we organised delivery for the saturday of the jubilee bank_holiday .
M	no the woman on the phone said .
M	this will damage the site owners .
M	i bought a sumvision multi card_reader it has developed a fault , i , posted my issue yesterday , i am awaiting a response from the technical_department , they cant be that busy surely .
F	very easy to use website and photo '_s of accomodation were great !
M	others have recommended aviform to me and i have no_hesitations in passing it on to other fanciers .
F	if you want to be healthier buy your excellent quality supplements from here .
F	there seemed to long_periods of inactivity apparently due to lack of response from the other party '_s insurance .
M	great value coconut_oil delivered very quickly .
M	m
F	invitations arrived within the week .
M	consider the form unticked please .
F	it looks great and the service was excellent .
M	either the engineer didn_'_t turn_up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time , but didn_'_t have the part and had to arrange another visit !
F	better_than anything i could_afford on the high_street .
M	this is serial non answering of the phone !
F	called customer service team on wednesday 00 : 00 was told they had called the store and they would be in touch with me .
F	good product for the money , i required it for going to appointments instead of getting a taxi , perfect weight and size for travel .
M	the delivery is very fast and effiecent ( 0 - 0 days ).
M	i '_ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
F	is it only men that need waders ?
M	this went on for a total of 00 weeks when it finally came into stock .
M	they were dispatched the next_day and arrived a couple of days_later .
F	i was prescribed eukanuba by my vet but his price was much more than medicanimal and they even give free_p_&_p - i couldn_'_t go_wrong .
F	this time i got baffled , clicked on online help , and catherine not only sorted it out but sent me links to the right spot in the order process .
F	a member of the team answered quickly to the different questions i had .
F	*************************************************************************************************
M	just tested my download_speed its it is a whopping 0 . 00mbps .
F	the price was reasonable as it was working out much_cheaper_than buying a decent pirate t - shirt and bandana alone .
F	hope it will now be delivered soon , but as its taken a while we will be on holiday , so i am having to make arrangements for someone_else to take the delivery for me .
M	i used this company due to it '_s convenience and had my car collected from work .
F	i don_'_t know where i am supposed to get one now .
M	it '_s really good quality and good value for money .
F	the mower i ordered on line a . m . was in stock and delivery next_day was promised .
M	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).

M	!
M	i went home and checked my statements and realised that they have not refunded me the full_amount .
F	i even spoke with her this morning just to follow it up and she made sure that they will send my package again as soon as possible . there was no problem with the staff but i can '_t say about the delivery service .
M	good range of products , good pricing on everything , very helpfully when speaking to them on the phone .
F	very impressed posted my phone at 00 . 00am wednesday and the money was in my bank by 0pm thursday ,
F	very quickly dispatched .
M	great service and staff who know their onions !
F	all that said , the staff and service are fantastic - as long as you don_'_t have a 0 - 0 job to go to !
F	the returned ones are lovely - just don_'_t suit our shapes !
F	i politely requested a refund but they weren_'_t taking any responsibility and even when i demanded a refund , they still said " you are not getting a refund ".
M	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
F	:)
F	rang customer_services on monday 00th_march and was told i had to email a picture of the flowers .
F	great communication
M	merry_christmas to you too dobs !
F	by the time everyone had finished making their purchases we only had a half an_hour left for dinner .
M	ordered what i thought would be a set of dumbells for just over £_00 including pp
F	the part arrived on the next possible day fantastic
M	they are in breach of this - they are claiming that their confirmation of my booking was not confirmation .
M	i '_ve mainly been happy with the swift service , but the last few orders have contained one or two lenses that have contained no saline fluid and therefore a dried out , un - useable lense .
F	it then took another 0_days to arrive .
F	the chap said he would send the final paperwork to the lady_who signed the contrat , yet he did not .
M	from ordering to receiving the ram took a few_days , even over a bank_holiday .
M	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted_line .
M	no_fuss .
F	which it is not .
F	i am done with this company but unfortunately i still have over a year to put up with it
F	the product was cheaper_than_anywhere_else and delived quickly would defiantly use again !
F	. sp only acting now because i have took it up with the ombudsman .
M	please do not waste your money with this firm , they never delivered the goods and then fob you off with forms you can not down load , and you do not get your money back . i am putting this on facebook .
F	very polite and helpful on the phone and a very fast service .
M	due to the delivery not being in time for christmas , madfun were good to their word and reimbursed half the original cost .
F	fab 0_* hotel in great location .
M	well_done .
M	excellent and fast service with good quality goods at a excellent price
M	please guys , if you need broadband and phones for your business don_'_t search by price , like i did .
M	quick delivery .
F	good seller
M	there is a number of reasons i always go back to them : fantastic prices , speedy delivery , very helpful staff .
M	he has now made his first trip taking it on the bus with ease .
M	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of £ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
M	bought a kitchen_tap and it would not fit to the worktop as the nylon bolt fitting would not tighten and is clearly not fit for purpose .
M	surely such a company would have more staff to answer the phone or emails on what is surely their busiest day of the year ?
M	screws went in threaded ( in a couple of instances so they actually scratched the doors on opening and closing ), units not lined_up , doors not lined_up , one foot bent in the process , and the top panel scratched due to repeated sloppy attempts to fit .
F	there was added delay and i received a lovely letter ( and a gift of a lovely knitted scarf - thank_you by the way ) with an explanation and an_apology about the extra delay .
F	the prices are reasonable and the blinids are great .
F	the second pairs of shoes were perfect and didn_'_t need any " wearing in ", so look to your delivery ecco !!!!
F	i '_ve seldom had any_problems with them and always felt i could trust them
F	will_definately recommend & use again
F	i was told i would be able to or book my flight seats once i had been emailed my info .
M	having placed the order i was expecting delivery 0 days_later ., it arrived after 0 , fitted like a glove and my son is currently putting it through it '_s paces .
F	having waited_patiently for delivery , but to no_avail , he checked his amazon account , which showed that the item had been despatched , although there was no tracking_facility .
F	my call was answered probably within approx 0 mins , i spoke to a very polite man , who told me he was going to put me on hold whilst he investigated my order . at 0 . 00pm i finally got fed_up listening to the music and hung_up , by which time they had closed for the day , so i wasn_'_t able to call back .
F	he seemed surprised that we already knew_exactly_what we wanted and had done our homework already !
F	luckily there were builders working in the road that helped put it in the kitchen .
M	do not waste your time .
M	good choice of delivery date .
F	item is great , received well_packed but disappointed in time taken to arrive and company failure to respond to my request '_s for information .
M	it arrived very quickly and is like new condition .
F	will i ever get this washer ?
M	apart_from this the products arrived in a timely_fashion and were well_packed .
F	my only issue is that when i opened the box and took out one of the two packets of spelt spaghetti , i noticed a big hole in the top of one of the packets which i only discovered after i picked it up and the product dropped all over my floor !
F	i have repeatedly phoned and emailed this company .
M	breakfast , i found it a disappointment , eggs were like frisbies - should be cooked to order and the tea is luke_warm as no boiling_water is available - just hot_water in one of those press the plunger dispensers , i mentioned this to staff but there was no offer to get some boiling_water - its ok though if you drink coffee .
M	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !
F	i have started to take the essential vitamins for good health .
M	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
F	when the online checker came up to ascertain that they were the right tablets there was no problem entering my puppy '_s weight of 0kg ( see ps for my other gripe ) and amazingly my order was accepted .
F	who do they think they are ?
M	when the goods were not delivered i googled & saw all the bad feedback .
F	it arrived well_packed and within two_days of ordering .
F	i cannot think why i didn_'_t order my lens online before as it was so easy and they were delivered in an even more secure_packaging than my previous ones were plus , of course , quite a lot_cheaper too .
M	useless and will never use again .
F	we had to check out at 00am and our flight wasn_'_t until 00 : 00 , i spoke to the rep who stated we could go to a hotel which villa_plus had teamed up with and use their pool and toilet facilities but no way to get a shower etc , she told us to ring around local apartments but said " she couldn_'_t suggest anywhere for us "
F	a great way to start and end holidays
M	i emailed the sales_department and received a prompt reply ( to my relief ).
M	0th order complete in the last_year .
M	some of the women that were contacting me were within the age range of 00 - 00 which i find extremely strange .
M	i didnt know they were damaged until the plumber was here to fit them , word of advice open all packaging as soon as you get your radiators incase the grilles are damaged like my ones .
M	the flowers were left_outside of the upstairs flat .
M	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
M	accordingly i would suggest you do not avail yourself of their services .
F	thanks
M	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
F	we were charged 00 pounds for a full_tank , however we only used a quarter and we were unable to get a refund .
M	thank_you very much .
F	the colour is at_least three shades darker_than the double one and although the description states it is the same size the single unit is almost 0 inches taller so the shelves do not align with the double , it has different feet and the wood is rounded , where as the double unit is straight edged .
M	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
F	ordered my correct prescription but let eye was not strong_enough .
M	how dare they interfere with my brain .
M	well what can i say sterling
F	yodel brought them whilst my husband & i were out at work & unlike every other carrier didn_'_t leave the parcel at the local post_office .
M	ok , the trip over was fine , our car broke_down in holland on the return trip .
M	excellent service with good product and great communication .
M	was suppose to be hear yesterday and still isn_'_t here .
F	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
F	i would shop for furniture on this site again .
F	excellent service and excellent products
M	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
F	a beautifully details little piece of jewellery
M	they would appear to offer no benefit over some of the high_street_opticians and i would advise everyone to give they a wide_berth .
M	it wasn_'_t until 0 :_00pm that i got a text_telling_me the flowers had been delivered and left securely at the front of the property .
F	product as expected
M	boarding and administration and the like went very well .
M	no cards were left through the door so there '_s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
F	this is not clearly_stated on their website - you are offered either 0 - 0 ; 00 - 0 ; 0 - 0 , or 0 - 0 time slots .
F	received my order the following_day which was excellent i am a little_worried that the bow_tie is a bit small it is his_birthday this sunday so he wil see it and i will know if the size is right if not can i return the tie and get a larger one .
F	thanks for the great service , delivery times are always great too
M	brilliant service , got cheque in the post within 00_hrs .
F	so here we are , i '_m still out of pocket they are laughing as they have my money and the item and this seems to be a trend with them i think will contact watchdog about this company and their policies .
M	communication was also good .
F	highly_recommended , their service and delivery is exceptional , order one day and receive the lenses the next_day without having to pay extra_charges for next_day delivery .
M	i would suggest ao review this sales strategy .
F	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
M	i recommend them to all of my friends with iphones and ipads .
F	i requested that they be delivered on the friday , had confirmation that they had been allocated etc . nothing arrived on friday so i sent an_email . didn_'_t get a response . so on saturday i tried to phone at about 0 . 00pm seeing on their website that the office shuts at 0pm only to be told that they were shut . still no flowers arrived . but then on sunday the bouquet arrived , very beautiful as always . i have as still not had a reply to my email and so i am again going to have a go . have used this company before and never had a problem .
M	absolute_rubbish customer service and i would not use them again .
M	alpha_rooms offered this and it was very easy to book the hotel .
M	( 0 / 0 months even 0 months )
M	likewise , rus00 ( bed ) was ordered in may 0000 for £_000 . 00 but in their current ' sale ' it is priced at £_000 . 00 , again higher_than at normal times .
F	i would drfinitely use them again .
F	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
F	yes i would definitely recommend .
M	peter , sheffield
M	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
M	i ordered a brass mooring ring plate from marinestore and another one from one of its competitors , the difference in quality was amazing .
F	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
M	point is i should not have been put in that position .
M	good fast service at a good price
M	i lost more than a full day , from noon on 0 / 0 / 00 to 0 :_00pm on 0 / 0 / 00 because the whole car had to be transported on a tilt - tray truck to the next major town for the tyre to be changed inside a workshop .
M	i was also given a very small car - fiesta - when i booked a salon model .
M	i will be definatly using you again to purchase another large ogio bag for my pack packing trip in febuary .
F	my first order arrived in less_than forty_eight hours my second order in less_than twenty_four hours all items were safely_packed and good quality would certalnly use this firm agaln
M	pleased with foot stall good value well made i would recommend it .
F	cannot really judge this company yet as they cannot deliver until beginning of december , so i have to reserve judgement
M	suffice to say it never turned_up .
M	i would recommend them to anyone .
M	clearly knew his stuff in relation to different versions of the watch .
F	so i couldn_'_t take my dogs out and the dogs didn_'_t alert me to the fact that anyone was trying to deliver something .
M	lot '_s of better options on the internet

F	spent 00_minutes in carphone_warehouse in blackpool bought the gemini tablet online before xmas for a gift less_than a month later packs up customer service say take it back to your local_store which i did today guess_what cos its out of 00 days cant get money back but if an item is faulty by law under the sale of goods_act im entitled to a refund ,, noooo not at carphone stand around and wait while staff yawn , text , mess with their phones , then told we have to send it away for repair , but wait ( another 00_mins ) we dont repair that tablet we replace it ,,, but i dont want a replacement as its crap and will break again , well thats our policy and thats all were offering , well i want to speak to manager cos under the sale of goods_act , remember that ::::::: all goods must be :
F	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
F	delivered promptly and packed well .
F	well i am still_waiting on this refund ,
F	poor service
F	after half an_hour debating my point and arguing my statutory_rights i was no further foward so walked_away quite dissatisfied .
M	not structure or marketing focus .
F	however , if the flowers were delivered more than 0_days late , i would be entitled to a refund on delivery cost !
M	been using viovet for some time .
F	my costume arrived quickley , and i was provided despatch information in the form of text throughout my order .

F	last e . mail was delivery in feb before 00th , like others saying check site order page for details . etc
F	!
M	product delivered as promised .

F	after dark my nan wont answer the front_door ( neither would i to be honest ) and i had requested the delivery be left with a neighbor if there was no response .
F	come on .
M	their offshore customer_support who struggle with basic english will often add to your problems , despite pre written pleasantries about how ebay cares .
F	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release travel hadn_'_t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
F	most of the time i get the same offers - that '_s a shame !
M	after four telephone_calls , the ( first of which i was extremely apologetic for my error ) and two emails when i have repeatedly given the corrected readings , instead of sorting this problem they have written to me saying they are going to quadruple my monthly direct_debit to ' bring my account back on track ' as my dd is not covering my usage .
F	i have given up trying to contact them so i pray to god that none of them break now lol
M	thank_you .
M	i was told i would receive my money back straight_away on my card but 00 days_later nothing , which i then had to chase up to find the credit was in fact not put onto my account .
M	talking to the guys via the support at the barrier has usually fixed it but the first time i tried i was told that i had not done things correctly until i read out exactly_what the booking email said to the guy and only then did he accept that perhaps it was the system that was wrong .
M	previously this has_been at no additional_cost - nothing has changed with the condition but money was requested this time
M	the price was good , the service & delivery was excellent . can '_t ask for more than that !
F	have used this company several tmes since i discovered them , and will happily_recommend them to others .
M	i placed an order on the wednesday , and other than an_automated confirmation_email , received no further confirmation until i chased them on friday ( so much for next_day delivery and good communication !).
M	they advise me to place order again by splitting into smaller orders but refuse to tell me what size order is ok .
F	parcel0go '_s service is quick efficient and i particularly_like the ability to have a live_chat when i have a non standard requirement .
M	the mail asks you to contact serenata , but none of the three numbers in the email are live or working .
M	if you want certain drinks that you can '_t find locally or other drinks with out the hassle use this web_site the drink_shop

M	what more could i ask .
F	they where very helpful and came to pick me up .
F	always a speedy delivery .
F	my first time of using this company and have not been disappointed .
M	service as always is excellent and the prices fair .
F	i will definitely be purchasing from this company again .
F	however , i was away for 0_days & instead of yodel leaving my £_00 delivery with either one of my next doors neighbours , it was left_behind bins outside the front of my house on a busy main_road in the city .
M	after_trawling the web these were the cheapest and easiest to order from .

F	i used to buy a lot of my clothes from here , but no more as they are so expensive and the quality is poorer than ever before .
M	for my initial wellies order ( as advertised on their website ) they were out of stock - quite frustrating .
F	very impressive & very competitive with pricing .
F	not even a note pushed through the door to say it had been left there .
M	plus an equally vast_selection of paint brushes , an array of different art paper , card , mountboards backed by all the miscellaneous items you may require including paint pots , brush holders and cases , specialist tracing papers , erasers , pencils to name a few .
M	its clear he '_s an enthusiast .
F	so lets go then : the looking for properties to rent was easy and straightforward as all you had to do was put in your preferences and a list came out .
M	i clearly_labeled the to and from on the padded_envelope .
F	i really hope i come down on their side since they are really good , value .
F	!

M	i emailed again , same response .
M	delivery was brilliant too !
F	lots of puddles - could not drag cases through this - almost ripped wheels off so not good start - first bus did not pick us up , even_though looked quite empty .
F	amazing prices and speedy delivery .
F	excellent quality everything finished to a really high_standard i would definitely recommend one of their beds .
F	the first extinguisher we received had been damaged in transit but a replacement was immediately sent out and the damaged goods collected .
F	i eventually spoke to [_name_removed_], who appears to be the big wig in the company .
M	on the advice of trading_standards to try and resolve my problem as mentioned in my review basicly the pixels were missing on my galaxy_note 0 after 0 months and went to cw for repair under_warranty and came back with a crack in the screen which was not there when they took the phone from me ( they were responsible for the crack ) anyway on ts advice i wrote to the managing_director by recorded delivery that letter which was signed for by this company has_been totally_ignored , not ever the courtesy of a reply i have sent another letter by recorded delivery will see what happens now . then i am_afraid it off to court i have to say before i took the contract for the phone they were very helpful but once signed on the dotted_line customer service just doesn_'_t exist with these so called professionals anyone_thinking_about using these_people read all the reviews on this site and all over the web first i wish i had .
M	item packed well and competitively_priced .
M	as above to date waiting 0 days_later
F	best buy ever !
M	i then received a phone_call from one of the very friendly staff at havens and she explained that there was only one glass left , and would i like to pick another style , this did cause some problems as it was for a birthday_gift .

M	moreover i have never had problem with all parcel form amazon .
M	however , vodafone offer no other way of warranty such as other_companies do , e . g .
F	the drill itself has plenty of oomph for those tough jobs , though maybe a little on the heavy side .
F	one of the best web best companies i '_ve ordered off !

F	i was a bit_worried that some of the old black and white photos i scanned in wouldn_'_t come out very clearly but they look really good as do a couple of newspaper cuttings i used .
F	il_n ' est_pas dans leur intérêt de jouer comme ça avec les nerfs et_l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prête à comprendre que des délais_de fabrication peuvent être très allongés , qu_' ils ont beaucoup_de commandes ( et certainement de réclamations ) à traiter et qu_' ils sont débordés .
M	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original quote by over £_000 !
F	they recommended a mattress and i took the plunge - after all , why on earth would i buy a mattress i can test for two minutes in a shop , surrounded_by onlookers , when i could love it or return it within a month ?

F	i have sent 0 emails and am awaiting a reply , which i suspect i either wont get or they will ignore the content .
F	it completely_ignored the fact that :
F	excellent quality gift bags .
F	i bought 00 " human_hair , it was so thin i had to go online to find more as it just wasn_'_t enough for a full head .
F	i wrote a letter of complaint when i got home asking to be reimbursed for the expense and the response was ' no chance '!

F	i just hope they are not poisoned .
M	after care at liverpool is a joke .

M	i '_ve shopped a lot of sites and this one is by far the cheapest and you get your products quick .
M	great service , best price , delivered bang on time will_definitely use again
M	i use this company exclusively and deal with sally who ( no matter what day of the week or time ) responds instantly and helps keep my business moving .
M	took a long time to get the system to change this back to 0 - day free delivery .
M	firstly they ignore two emails to check that the parts listed were indeed for the m - sport not the se model and then when i phoned the women had no idea .
F	ideal for those of us that aren_'_t very mobile !!!!
M	bought items from this site , next_day delivery and products fantastic .
F	i think companies should maybe review their prices as with free from foods it would seem that they can charge so much for so longer knowing that people have to buy them .
M	i fitted the new belt this week and it was cutting fine , until one of the blades broke !
F	disappointed that i was able to order and pay for a rug that was out of stock and also disappointed at the lack of communication thereafter which has caused a delay in delivery

F	quick delivery with no_problems , but the box seemed a bit worse for wear , plus the box with the glass in was torn inside .
F	hello , we made an order from a school for pe kit .
M	this company seems to work well at a good price but uses garages who are making such little margin that i believe it would have probably been cheaper to pay more for the tyres and not get ripped_off on tracking .
M	they arrived very quickly and the quality of the materials used is of a high_quality and good value for money .
M	goods got despatched ok but their courier service is rubbish !
M	i have watch the frame come in stock then go out of stock on the web_site during this time .
M	they were not comfortable so i tried to get a refund as their policy .
F	0 ) everywhere you go these days they are rewards cards and loyalty cards and occasionally send you offers and discounts … not virgin …. i spend a ridiculous_amount of money with them and as a loyal_customer i feel that you are never rewarded .
F	my son is very happy with his new matress .
F	didn_'_t arrive when they said they did many emails to customer_services who were helpful to a point but didn_'_t really care , the flowers were very small and turned_up in a smashed up box so half of the flowers were snapped will not be using this company again
F	maybe she was just having a bad day !
F	i would definitely recommend campbells prime meat .
F	tiles arrived later than_expected , when i phoned to ask why , i unfortunately dealt_with what must be the rudest assistant they have .
M	very helpful courteous person i ordered through . good price , best online price i could_find and delivery was pretty quick , very satisfied and would definitely recommend them .
F	what else can i say ?
F	i reported the same to internet_gardener with no response .
M	good pricing , great product !
M	free bumper bulb collection received in good order and planted .
F	two_days time .
M	you have been_warned !
M	it '_s not the first time i '_ve_used urban_industries and it definitely wont be the last !
M	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
F	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
F	their email stated they were confirming an offer to buy , and would let_me know if my order was accepted !
F	i ordered this item as i needed helpto start a diet and thought this sounded good was not impressed at being tie - in and unable to get out with . out a big charge food ok but boring dinners ok lunch all the same and not enough to eat for breakfast , am feeling conned wouldn_'_t recommend at all
M	will not order again or recommend anybody to order from this company .
M	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
M	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you .
F	excellent service from yourselves regarding the invoicing and response , but having amended my delivery day with dpd - as i thought successfully - then having been promised delivery on a specific day , i was neither emailed an_hour delivery slot , nor did i receive the parcel .
F	what a truly ridiculous time to have to wait for a pittance .
M	good prices ,
F	everything happened as advertised .
M	the shipping was free and really fast .
M	for people who consider eating a couple of nuts and a sultana a day a " snack " they may be ok .
F	first time they have send a package back to chemistdirect , marking it as undeliverable !
F	delivery arrived just after 0pm as requested .
M	i won_'_t buy from anywhere_else - it would be simple vanity to go out and spend silly money to complete simple everyday tasks like sending e_- mails and working a crm system .
F	but i guess that is what it is , no thrills get from a to b !
M	the car a fiat_punto grande had dents in every panel , the windows were filthy , the rear doors opened intermittently using the remote and the windows in the rear would not go up or down .
M	it is no more than a blatant rip_off and taking the consumer as a mug .
F	pleased with goods just think they should come with instructions
F	searched around for the best price and this was it by far and then uber impressed with the quick and ' free ' delivery - thank_you .
M	will have to contact my credit_card company for a refund .
M	as there are size / specification restrictions for taking a scooter onto public_transport , i telephoned pro_rider and spoke to [_name_] in sales to get advice on a suitable model .
F	they offer excellent service and well wort recomending to anuyone interested in their fetish to obtain the items they are looking for .
F	i had went_onto this website to buy supports for my daughter as she has ehlers - danlos syndrome .
F	should be next_day delivery
F	i '_m on their mailing_list and i got sent some really good offers for free prints .
F	please do try this company it is great , my birds_love what i get them , it is always good ,
M	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
M	having 0 out of stocks , despite calling to flag this ( which was appreciated ), basically means that i had to go to a store down the road in the end anyway .
F	beautifully_presented .
M	stayed in from 0am til 0pm as instructed so very p * ssed off .
M	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told_him you weren_'_t here so he left ".
F	a spare_tyre would have solved the problem all together .
F	the people at national said they were going to try and free the seized part ( as it was still not fixed ) they then began to hit my car with a sledge hammer and used a blow torch they then had 0 of their men bouncing up and down in the boot of my car .
F	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
F	great products , excellent service and communication , but in this day and age when ordering products via the internet is the norm , the delivery time on rubbersole is far too long .
M	i was asked whether i wished for their sales_department to contact me and i agreed .
M	you really need to be patient , and i am not that patient , as i hate to go through telephone systems , hence my 0_stars !
M	it '_s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
F	i '_m going to be paying £_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
M	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
M	improvement needed in that matter .
F	after opening the box the oil i had ordered had leaked out onto all the other products ruining all the other packaging .
M	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
F	would use this again , highly_recommended .
F	ordered a coat and hat stand which ( although delivered to wrong_address ) was delivered on due date .
F	but customer_services were very polite and helpful .
M	as well as the rip_off factor , i would also like to question your corporate responsibility .
F	all - in - all a hassle - free purchase
F	do not use the company - this is a freud .
F	the catalogue is confusing , giving very little information as to what problems the pills are for .
F	the only thimy i didn_'_t realise was they took the repayment as soon as there '_s money in your account instead of a fixed date .
M	they takes yer money then advise on their site that they '_ve emailed about ' availability '.
M	i have not had reason to need to contact them as far as customer service is concerned , however i would use them again .
M	sat home all day no collection , called in was advised it '_s up to the driver to collect the parcel or not , was surprised a courier driver could make this decision .
F	ordered it at 00 . 00 am was delivered next_day by 0 . 00 am very helpful on phone when i was ordering
F	website said goods ordered before early_afternoon normally shipped same day .
M	in fact the whole_experience was disgraceful .
F	my sandals arrived within days and i was so pleased to be able to have a different colour choice which wasn t on offer in the uk outlets i visited on line .
M	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
F	kerb ramps , they actually come in pairs , great looking product and fit neatly against the kerb like they were made to measure .
F	we will no_longer use them and will find another_supplier
M	unfortunately they sent me the wrong_size for both_pairs i ordered .
M	well there you go , now sue me , if letting people know the truth is a crime . i am guilty .
F	if i had known it would come like this i would not have ordered it knowing my partner would be opening the door .
F	i ordered batteries which i did received but they didn_'_t work at all .
F	it now stocks the colour i really wanted .
F	i don_'_t know who writes 0_star reviews but it '_s the worst internet company i have ever dealt_with .
M	plumbnation refuses to leave items without a signature , even_though i clearly indicated in writing that i would take_responsibility for it .
M	service on - board is hit and miss , the cabin is not always cleaned_properly ( dirty tray - tables eww .) and the food can be a bit mediocre considering it '_s price .
F	!
F	i '_ll definitely be using them next time !
F	!
M	toilet_facilities in airport disgaceful , do not know what visitors to scotland must think .
F	would definatly_recomend to anyone as price was great .
M	staff very knowledgeable .
F	i bought a knee_support on line .
F	however the quality checks could be improved !
M	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
M	not impressed .
M	why ?
M	have been dealing_with the company for a long time the delivery service is very good and will make contact with customer if product is not available and i have always been very satisfied with alternative advice and product replacement
M	defo recommend
F	prompt , no_fuss and polite service .
F	i still didn_'_t get it so i called on monday and the staff that spoke to me found out that it wasn_'_t even sent at all , and she was telling_me she wonders why that should be .
F	i have only used the complete_care shop twice but i would certainly use them again .
M	sixt offering " bring back car emplty " for a fixed cost , this can be cost_effective , but need to check fuel prices at time of travelling and the car fuel_tank capacity , plus gamble on not running out of fuel on returning for drop_off .
F	i know the comments on the website stated there might be a few subsitutes due to which flowers are in season and availability .
F	the wifi never worked so they gave_us a code for a wifi service that kept dropping the connection and ignored our request to have the wifi fixed in the apartment .
M	so what do i do ?
M	payment was quick .
F	you should also provide a map of where the lockers are - the one at victoria is difficult to find from the instructions given by phone .
F	it is a shame that the customer service was such a let_down as everything else was perfect , customers should always be kept up to date when going through a purchase such as this
F	one star only because you ' re products are good
F	the cleaner turned_up ( didn_'_t speak much english ) and after 0 hours , my partner inspected what she had done and it was very poor indeed .
M	i had to find a staff_member to find instructions on how to leave the car_park .
M	i am very happy with the service and product i received and will hopefully be buying our_wedding_rings from you in the future !
M	guess_what ?
M	the annoying_thing is that the status says ' we are preparing your order and it cannot be cancelled or changed ' if i want to cancel then i am within my rights !
F	site very easy to access , find what was needed , ordering very easy , decided to collect itmes as local , even_though i did not know the company exsisted !
F	the aspect team .
M	let '_s wait and see , it is now sunday and since my call i have had no further communication .
F	i would fully recommend this site and their products , the cheapest i found and also next_day delivery free of charge .
M	this is madness as i used a decent stanley tape_measure to take the box sizes and rounded them up before booking the parcel , ditto the same with the weight before i looked for a courier .
F	would i recommend csl to anyone_else . no .
F	the boot offers excellent support and cushioning to my foot allowing me to start walking again .
M	i switched to bulk_powders after a dispute with another leading fitness company and haven_'_t looked back since .
F	i cannot_believe they used a courier to deliver the flowers , if l had known that l would have used interflora .
M	there were footmarks over the items , shower_screen packaging which i presume was caused_by the delivery driver at dx frieght .
M	thankyou !
M	i even buy from some traders on their site and found play to be very helpful if / when any_issues_arise .
M	can '_t fault the service in any way .
M	we would certainly use them again next time .
F	the ideal present just what i was looking for thanks .
F	easy to find , excellent service . no_hassle !
F	prices are good , friendly staff with good communication , speedy delivery , packaged well . 000_%
F	it would go from 00 mbps to 0 mbps to 0 . 00 mbps to 0mbps to 0 . 0 mbps in a matter of a couple minutes .
F	would not advise them to anybody .
F	most definitely it is inconvenient situation for everybody .
F	the staff at stanstead were fantastic !
F	!
M	he then checked their computer system to see that the booking was on and he discovered that it was .
M	instead of the 0 - 0 day yodel / myhermes service i ' d normally use with p0g i got a citylink 00 hour service for the same price .
M	0 foot long masonry chisel , quite hard to find , arrived promptly for a great price and cheap p_&_p .
M	and service was poor too .
M	handset never delivered , but they couldn_'_t find it without ' telephone_number '.
F	will be on the phone tomorrow .
M	the photos he sent were not very good but showed a couple of scuffs marks – not £_000 worth of damage !!!
M	not a bad service though and offered highest price on the internet .
F	quick and easy !
F	i bought a gift set for my boyfriend '_s brother ,, it was delivered within a couple of days and was carefully_packaged to keep from harm .
M	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
F	delivered next_day .
F	just had shopping delivered and yes part of it has not arrived again .
M	i do not feel i have been unreasonable and allowing 0_weeks for a refund after trying to return the phone for 0 months is far to long .
F	long conversations with customer service to establish that there was a repeat_prescription from me in your system .
M	i had a bouquet sent to my mum for her_birthday and she was well impressed .
M	easy sorting delivery , not to mention convienient picking your own day .
F	appalling customer service , i would not recommend using this company .
M	my wife has_been using exactly the same chair sourced from another company for a number of years and so knows exactly how to put it up .
M	i '_ve bought several cameras from jessops including my current slr .
F	great !
M	very quick service and plenty of emails_keeping_me informed of when it would be with me
M	value for money service .
F	would shop there again for sure .
M	nothing to report !
M	the ordered key was received within two_days which was very good .
M	would have been nice for them to have told me and not for me to chase .
F	however we do not intend to keep sending them presents for no reason , every few_months so i changed the delivery address to ours !
M	who said they could not help as the phone was out for delivery .
M	went to this site asit had the best price for the food_mixer i wanted .
F	and be careful with the snug fireplace , the smoke comes back into the room , the chimney may need cleaning .
M	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
M	whenever i tried selecting a contact using the dial pad from the rebtel app , the number of the contact that i choosed never shows up , it always comesback with a uk phone number it can be very annoying .
M	followed up with central customer_services to let them know the £_000 ultrabook i had bought was given to me with a generic power_cable , not the samsung original .
M	delivery of items was excellent but one item ( of two ) does not work - reported to kenable two_days ago but still_waiting for a reply !
F	straight_away i notice that some of the shopping was missing .
M	rubbish !
M	i was pleased at how easily i could_find the article i wanted .
F	contacted again few_days_later , still not acknowledged order change , sent email to confirm - no response .
M	ordered after lunch & through out the day recieved various emails_telling_me my order was being_processed / picked / packed & then despatched .
F	we ordered a set of invites , only to find on chasing the status of our order that they were out of stock .
F	mike came to the rescue again and sorted_out technical problem !
M	i actually didn_'_t go through with another order with dino_pc because i knew i wouldn_'_t be home when it was delivered & then i would have to drive 00 miles to pick it up from the couriers because . you don_'_t leave with neighbours .
F	and every order delivered on time , including next - day service .
M	the reason given was that my communication had not been forwarded to the correct destination i . e .
F	very easy to use site , great value and totally straightforward booking experience .
F	i feel that i have been conned_into paying a high delivery charge .
F	sole function of customer service is to refuse any responsibility and to refuse refunds and / or exchanges .
F	even_though i had an_email to say it was dispatched about a day after order it was not delivered until a week after .
M	company is a joke .
M	housetrip cancelled thousand of euros of booking because of customer complain for cleanings .
F	he is currently trying to get people to give him £_000 for stands at an_exhibition in milton_keynes - they may well find themselves shafted .
M	no where in the high_street can compare with the service .
M	received a good price on the pet_prescription items but the dispatch rate was extremely slow despite providing the requested prescription details when asked .
F	i had to wait for my camera for over a month , when it finally arrived the seal was broken and the advertised 0gb card wasn_'_t included .
M	a well_designed website , easy to use especially for , i have to admit , a senior_citizen like myself who is just about au_fait with technology .
M	paul
F	it turns_out that this delivery time is misleading as the 00 day cooling_off period and the time it takes for the finance to be completed is not mentioned until you are well into the process .
M	wrong - my stupid thoughts that i had for years were put to one side and at last made me money .
F	fab prices and good quality glasses , good communication and fast postage , will_defo be ordering more that '_s for sure !!
F	new machine delivered at 0 . 00 the next_day .
F	i '_ve had to go to my bank and register a dispute .
M	it protects really well yet doesn_'_t add too much bulk .
F	i only placed my order late yesterday_afternoon and took delivery of it this morning within the advised time_slot .
F	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
F	very speedy service and good value
F	0 ) the quality isn_'_t to die for - but would have been bearable if i was at_least treated like a customer they cared to retain .
F	due to the fact that it come '_s anytime during the day i took the day off work .
M	only_downside no instructions for the drum stool and hi hat stand was packed in brown_paper and not boxed .
M	top company , top products , top service , highly_recommended & will use again
M	i - flower were chased on 00th_december and we were assured of delivery before 0pm on new year '_s eve .
F	charm_school uk gave a detailed_description and photo of their product .
F	!
F	what ?!
F	the reason for 0_stars is purely the bunch of flowers themselves .
M	thanks .
M	vvx had the best price on the net .
M	i also called them up and got a great response .
M	so_far on all my orders since using viovet , the company is always slightly_cheaper , when the free delivery is taken into account .
F	i registered my phones to sell & recieved my pre pay bag the next_morning .
F	sadly an integral item was missing and plumber was coming so i had to purchase elsewhere which really let us down and cost us more money .
F	have bought it as a valentine gift so hopefully the tastes will make up for the size ??!
M	it was a lot of fun and big enough for two people and luggage ( including back seat !)
F	i was refunded accordingly but the experience was , altogether , unsatisfactory .
F	my new provider and i have contacted them on 0 occasions with final readings and scottish_power ignore us - pushing forward with a ' system ' that generates threatening_letters stating i '_d have my credit_rating wrecked etc .
F	she double_checked the tyre size and type and told me that the tyres were in stock and could be delivered quickly to my local_national_tyres .
F	i hope this is not damaging my machine as i will have no comeback from nespresso under my guarantee .
F	did this just in case delivery was late by a day and i knew my purchase would be safe & left with a neighbour whilst i was at work .
M	today , spent over 00_mins at various time trying to get through on the telephone - without an answer .
F	she assured me that it would be sorted today .
M	i stopped using them since they charged me £_00 for a hand_luggage that they said was 0cm too high .
F	i have had no reasoning for why the process is so poor , just empty useless excuses .
F	would recommend mazuma for getting_rid of old unwanted_mobiles , quick way of getting a bit of extra_cash !
M	after not receiving it by early_january , i contacted the company via e_- mail and they replied_saying it would be despatched that week .
M	in both_cases they checked and determined my size wasn_'_t stocked .
M	absolutely_shocking !!
M	i certainly would recommend power_tools direct , simple to use site , very good value and quick and prompt delivery service .
F	when questionned , no response received ever .
M	£_00 cheaper_than the rest .
F	if only all online shopping was this enjoyable and hassle_free .
F	ordered online on the 00th_december for delivery to a collect_plus location the next_day .
F	free delivery was very quick and trouble - free and a big plus is free_returns although pleased to say it was not needed in this case !
F	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
F	i have purchased a pink_lining changing_bag which came in great time but found that i didn_'_t really know when it was to arrive .
F	was expecting delivery on a monday however goods arrived on the thursday which was to late for me as i wanted the coat for the tuesday .
M	i found the price more competitive here then everywhere_else
M	can '_t think how that service could have been improved !
M	to their credit , there have been automated updates , but i am frustrated not to have my items yet .
F	!
M	on the upside , service is still good , but now it '_s always worth_checking toolstation et_al as someone_else will usually have the same thing cheaper .
M	even when you say it crystal clearly , it gets it partly right as it repeats it back to you in it '_s mechanical prerecorded voice , but then it throws in a number or letter that sounds nothing like what you had said ( would be funny if it was a comedy sketch , the opposite of funny in real_life ).
F	groupon could not help with this either so we had to find an_alternative which cost us lots more than our original trip .
M	i have recently_upgraded with upgrade experts also i have taken out a new contract .
M	the prices here are about 00 - 00_% of the prices in australia .
M	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
F	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .
M	" nd rug bought from the company in the last 0 months and i will be definetly be going back there .
M	after two_weeks they arrived and i put them on , they seems alright .
F	item arrived promptly and is of good quality .
M	i placed my order via the telephone rather_than online and the person dealing_with it was most helpful .
F	after 0_days i had to give up as just could not stand any of the products other than the porridge , but could not imagine living off of porridge alone for the next few_weeks or months .
F	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has_been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry_eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
M	product & service , urban_industry are second to none .
M	concealed fittings instructions looked a nightmare so i '_m glad i chose to fix through the sign .
M	purchased wood effect blinds for bathroom .
M	imagine surprise next_day an email_saying there were problems with payment .
F	some of the wiring was dodgy too .
F	sorry !
F	it is a flip book in a little plastic case ( all pages are plastic coated so the juice drips won_'_t ruin it ) and gives you loads of different recipes and tells you what health_benefits they each have .
M	the first shoes i ordered weren_'_t to my liking & i returned them with no issues , they gave_me a very fast refund & i managed to find a pair of shoes that were perfect for me .
F	the villa was just as it showed online .
F	i ordered on wednesday_afternoon and received my goods on thursday_morning , a fast and efficient service and i woul certainly use stitcher again .
M	i needed item so continued anyway as time was low to get it .
M	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable prices for ok quality .
F	very good description of the different_varieties , very good prized and very quick delivery .
F	very good quality for the price and i have now placed this company in my favourites .
M	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
F	hence i have many bottles with at_least 0ml in them sitting in a draw .
M	my partner , who is 00 , was going to visit her dying sister in nottingham , tear jerker , but true .
M	i would use again
M	!
M	i don_'_t want to have to sift_through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
F	i was advised the product was out of stock after i '_d placed the order ( no_indication before then ).
M	this company is horrific .
F	i would recommend the company
M	i ordered a nutribullet form high_street tv in response to an ad i saw in the newspaper , ordering was very quick , helpful straight through to an operator who quickly took my order .
F	having found the bar_stool i liked on tesco '_s website cheaper , ( although actually supplied by lakeland ), i called to find out if you would price match if i were to place the order direct with yourselves .
F	these are the best straighteners i have ever used ,
M	dan .
M	i ordered online and made a call the next working day to check the order .
F	new review
F	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
M	in the country .
F	as the shed isnt surrounded along the bearers by pea gravel preventing the rain splashing up onto the wood then i havent installed it correctly ."
M	when the frames finally arrived , they were the gloss frames when i had ordered the matt_finish .
F	made one call to the company there was no problem in exchanging for the larger pan & luckily there was an outlet quite close so took the original pan in & it was swapped very easily
M	easily_navigable_website with huge_range of high_quality fixtures .
M	all prcing should include the add_ons and hiden costs
F	the galway boot size 0 and labelled 00 . 0 was way too small , but the longford showing size 00 only is just perfect !
M	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
F	booked over the phone - fantastic service , very quick , very polite .
M	seen the price on the website , printed it then went to a vauxhall dealership to see if they could match / beat the price .
F	i recommend you to everyone !
F	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .

M	0 .

M	i am not sure why it took so long to ship it .
M	the whole_experience with mazuma_mobile was so easy from getting the price to receiving the cheque , i would surely use them again should i need them and i would recommend them to anyone_else that had a phone for sale .
F	this video is good for me and good for them because i don_'_t send it back because i '_ve messed_up the installation .
M	i was offered the opportunity to phone for support after i had queried this but really it just needed to be supplied with instructions .

M	after a few_months i had sorted all the photographs of our six_years together and using the software to compile the book i put_together a view of my wife through my eyes .

M	while this isn_'_t ideal , i returned the glasses and as it was within their no - quibble timeframe they didn_'_t ask any questions and promptly replaced the lenses and sent them back to me after a week or so .
M	but i believe in * credit where its due *, and they certainly deserve the five_stars .
F	it was so simple just to enter the car '_s registration and be given a good range of tyres to choose from at really good prices .
F	is this a strategy to catch out customers who do not check their receipts ?
M	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’_m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .

M	the eflorist order process does not remind you of these things so it is easy to forget and spend more than you need to .
F	always having problems with the connection and customer service .
M	the reason was that tyre_shopper didn_'_t actually have stock of the tyres that i ' d purchased and had sent a different tyre as a substitute ( not as good ).

F	i ordered my item on the site , and received it the next_day .
M	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .

M	on arriving at long_stay car_park which we had booked in advance , we were directed to the short_stay because it was over booked . on return from our holiday we had the hassle of finding the office to allow use out of the car_park . surely if u book the long_stay that should be where u park !
F	this was my first purchase from ellis_brigham .
M	subsequently contacted by customer service , and told :
F	ordering was easy , basin arrived quickly within promised timescale and is just what we wanted at a very reasonable_price , not fitted yet so hope it looks good when in_situ .
M	e_- mailed them twice with no response .
F	paying the extra was a big con !
M	i had in the past purchased a number of these protectors which out of fairness were excellent , however the customer service i experienced has left a bitter_taste and will not buy from them again .
M	amen " i '_ve said it ten times along with 0 our fathers and hope my soul has now been cleansed !!
M	he said that we must have spoken to a new member of the sales_team ( spoke to the same person for a 0 - 00 month period ) and that the literature should be updated ( which is still as it was two months_ago , today !! )
M	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
M	it was easy .
F	not ideal for either the rental company or the customer !
M	these were all from their rustic ( rus ) range .
M	the capsules sometimes aren_'_t punctured properly and lose a lot of the coffee to the drip tray making the amount in the cup much less_than it should be .
M	taps uk dispatched my kitchen_sink within 0 day to the courier company but the courier has only 0 depot in wolverhampton and they dont come to london very often ( its 000_miles_away ).
F	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
F	when it did arrive there was no reference_number to be seen .
F	i received a text_confirming the order and a text when they '_d been delivered then i got a text from my sister saying they were gorgeous .
M	high_quality blinds delivered quickly .
M	hello ,
M	was dispatched on the 0th_dec and delivered on the 0th_dec .
F	never had a single email either at order or when checking status .
M	they later ring me back and state they did not issue this guarantee , and they have no proof of payment the windows were ever paid for !
F	!
F	more than a month has passed and went back to the shop , showed the text_message to a member of staff and after checking they said they never received the bill and that it was too late to process it again as it had to be done exactly after 0_months .
F	great reward schemes but some of their produce isn_'_t great quality .
F	i ordered the " this works " travel set on the 00th_april and chose the uk saver premium delivery and it did not turn_up in time for my holiday on 00nd .
M	fantastic service , fast delivery !
F	still_waiting for product .
F	it transpired_that another customer had emailed to cancel their order , and complete_care shop cancelled my order instead by mistake .
M	excellent price the genuine_article paid for express delivery and it arrived next working day .
F	we waited_until 0 . 00pm but couldn_'_t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month_old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
M	this time i also emailed and rang ccl and quoted sales of goods_act_0000 and reconfirmed all problems i have had and that i will take matters further by contacting the bbc consumer programs and local newspapers on how i have been treated by ccl and how my xmas has_been ruined .
F	eileen mclean .
M	our next safari has now been booked with him .
F	i was delighted with the quality of the bags that i ordered .
F	the programme " crashed " at_least 0 times and we had to start again .
F	the booking_reference i was sent did not match the reference used by the airline .
M	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
F	on the old system they didn_'_t dispatch on friday because the insulin had to be kept refrigerated and l was fine with that so l adjusted my ordering accordingly .
M	cant just rely_on tesco direct need to move away from this small shop trial and get back to what they do best supermarkets
M	items were reasonably_priced and free delivery was great .
M	if you are considering buying party wear use this company they are brilliant .
M	obviously if i had been able to view these products before buying i would not have bought them .
M	not sure if i will use again .
F	just as well as they should have been for same car .
F	after receiving a delivery note with both my items included and a date for expected delivery , i was surprised to find only one of the two skirts in the package .
F	i didn_’_t want to accept my parcel because of its condition but the " friendly " driver said that i needed to accept it and then re schedule another delivery if i wanted to .
F	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
F	it '_s a shame that the actual dreams stores are unable to provide goods at a better price and shorter time frame - i visited a store and the assistant was so helpful , but could do little about the delivery charge and nothing about the waiting time for delivery .
M	they are now threating me with bailiffs altough as they dont seem to have a clue where i live ill worry_about that later .
M	i couldn_'_t believe the package that arrived in the morning , was the order i placed with chemistdirect on line , the previous day .
F	top quality product at the best price , easy ordering , delivered as promised .
M	went through the booking_procedure last night for two tyres .
F	i phoned to ask for a broacher which was sent very quickly and i ordered what i wanted over the phone and was given a dated of delivery which was spot_on i placed another two orders with the company the goods are high_quality and standard when i had a problem with one of the item they were very quick to to change i would definatley recommend saxone leather to any of my friends
M	unable to leave a message or text .
M	does_exactly_what it says on the tin .
M	the couriers were very polite and helpful and rang in advance to advise what time they would be arriving .
F	my only_complaint is they were ' nt delivered to the correct_address , when i completed the order i requested they were delivered to my work address , when i received my email_telling when they were being delivered you sent them to my home address and could not change this when i requested it .
F	the original port given by you is closed and there is a new one ; ' new venice port ', discovered only by phoning anek in greece .
F	not only do my fitflops sparkle but also the staff as well .
F	i asked for correction which same lady kindly correct it , however my mortgage confirmation again was with the wrong_address !
F	this is ok for me on this occassion because i am backshift but it wouldn t always be convenient .
F	i will not use you again .
M	with the one item that is outstanding , we have had clear communication and this will be delivered shortly .
M	after several more calls i was told that they would try and get the parts sent by special delivery for the thursday this did not happen .
F	goods were received the next_day and when one item was returned for a smaller hat size it was received again the next_day .
F	my tracking says it left on 00th_november , it is now 00th and i still_havent received .
F	the labels were delivered quickly and look great abut they tend to peel away at the ends and some have come off after washing .
F	be careful buying from here if you ' re in a rush - it may be cheap but it isn_'_t fast or caring service !
F	the availability as published on the website was too vague - items supposedly available at the time i ordered took several weeks to arrive ; others supposedly shipped from september arrived much later than i expected .
F	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
F	i booked car_parking with skypark last night ( 0th_july_0000 ) and i kept checking my email to see if my confirmation_email was there , just so i could print this off in case i need it when parking my car .
M	rentalcars 000000000
M	very good .
M	so excellent if you are happy with knowing what you are getting but any problem in returns it is costly both time wise and money wise .
F	they have a large range of supports to suit everybody , everything is also priced very fairly , actually , this is probably one of the cheapest websites you can buy this stuff from .
M	the customer service department was rude , i got no communication to advise , and to boot i got 0 sales emails through every day for 0 days !
M	have already reccmended to a friend
F	used animed many_times before and once again it was a case of place the order and the goods arrived only a day or so after .
M	so i sit .
M	daily i just go delete , delete , delete . etc .
F	i ordered a pair of sunglasses on the wednesday_night and they were delivered by the friday .
M	my order was despatched promptly but took a week to be delivered .
M	i have ordered at_least 0 times because the lighting they sell suits my needs , but god it is a messy business ordering and receiving .
F	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these people out of business .
M	in fairness , the company were extremely good at chasing up their couriers and keeping_me informed that it was delayed and did keep me informed when the tyre was actually delivered to the garage so i cannot_fault their customer service .
M	the service received at the fitting garage was also good .
F	good service , terrible transport agencie
F	went back to marco polo hotel and paid himself to stay there as they did have rooms !
F	i was able to have the delivery when i wanted it , the 0 hour_slot helped_me to plan and the guys were great - my central_london flat is in the middle of lots of building development and they had a very short time_slot to reverse into the site , get the bed and mattress out of the van , up some stairs , into a lift , 00 floors to the flat , and then remove the old mattress via the same process in reverse .
F	delivery was quick but were just left in garden even_though someone was in .
M	excellent service , very happy
F	second time - luckily i was at home and was able to receive the package .
M	the order was acknowledged_immediately and dispatched same day ( of which i was again notified by email ) - brilliant service .
M	either way im happy with shopping at lidl its shopping @ a budget with some nice products for the price .
F	when i asked when they would be delivered i was told that unfortunately the tracking_information had not been updated on screen and that therefore they could not tell me .
F	plus this morning i am asked to leave_feedback about my recent_purchase .
M	bought this super value large fire_extinguisher for my home as my present one is past its best .
F	products were nothing like advertised ones - staff difficult and unhelpful do not order from this company - even_though they say they always publish reviews good or bad they never published mine - couldn_'_t_believe my luck when asked by this independent reviewer to rate my experience !!
F	thank_you geyser for brilliant service at all levels !
M	got two_pairs on the two for one option on two different prescriptions , both single_vision , one for reading and one for distance .
M	the only issue i have ever had with them was when an item was out of stock a lot longer_than they had expected , not exactly their fault and i still got the kit !
M	i was informed that i didn_'_t read the small_print and that this shocker was a fairly common_occurrence .
F	surpirsed they are still in business based on these reviews !
F	tried for an age to ring you eventually gsve up and emailed only to be told , return pick_up would be £_00 . 00 .
F	what excellent forward thinking .
F	goods as_described , delivery as expected , communication excellent
F	also do not pay the £_00 for the welcome_pack , we got a loaf of bread , bottle of water , little packs of butter , a bag of pasta and a small jar of tomato_sauce for the pasta and a very cheap bottle of red_wine .
F	i will definitely use this website again and have no_issues in referring them to my friends and family .
F	highly_recommended .
M	!
F	however baffling is that have been using my address to shop online and receive stuff all over europe and the us .
M	note that their response comes about 0 months after i wrote my initial review .
M	not easy to go back to product list when you ' re reviewing a product in detail / adding to cart
F	we walked across to the other side of the river ( quite a walk !)
M	the white lenses arrived day after ordering .
F	the quality of the materials they use is rather . questionable .
M	the replacements arrived and all was fine .
F	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
M	the discription i should of taken notice off was supposed to inform what was " in the box " but that was wrong also and didn_'_t mention any batteries at all !!
F	i received the goods the day after_placing the order , excellent service .
F	asked why they had not bothered to let_me know of problem but got no response .
M	should have realised when we booked in and a family were booking out early .
F	i was transfered from one dept to another untill finally had enough , asked for the supervisor only to be hung_up on .
F	sales_person extremely_helpful and pleasant .
F	didn_'_t get timely response .
F	i like the idea of quality natural_wood products and this is why i purchased from oakfurnitureland .
M	ordered through_quidco where i saw their advert
F	ordered from this company at reasonable_price delivery was excellent and item is now fitted .
M	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
M	my annoyance at the htc rejection far_outweighs the good experience with the ipad .
M	have used same car_hire company before through different agent and had a better experience .
M	0 kg per square meter .
M	easy to find part on drawing & parts list .
M	frankly i '_m pleased that the african twit has stayed out of my way since i still find it convenient ( and nothing more ) to shop there .
F	well made and simple to put up .
F	let '_s just say our tour_guide was not what we '_d hoped for .
M	great website great cheep price would really reccomend to others will be using you in future
M	but the florist had sent me the voice_mail , and i had to then phone helen and tell her the plan .
M	i tried to pay by pay_pal 0 times and it wouldnt process emptying the basket each time , so had to use visa_card ,
M	i purchased a shoulder sling for my mother who is recovering from an accident .
M	the discount i received made it reasonable value for money although without discount it would in my view would be a bit expensive as all i would be paying for is the card and printing .
M	i remember reading that they would be dispatched within 0 days , but after 0 days i had heard_nothing more from the company .
F	i wasn_'_t impressed with the shipping company and for that reason i probably will not order through furniturecart again .
M	they told me that both items would be in stock at their warehouse on 00 - aug . quite a wait as there was no_indication of this when i placed my order and i had already been charged .
F	price is higher in gbp when ordering from sweden than it would be if i was ordering from uk .
F	they did refund but it was too late for me to replace the purchased item elsewhere .
F	very impressed with speed of delivery and price .
M	i was away when i ordered them so did not see them until the following_day ( when they still looked a bit withered ) but not the best impression for my gf to receive them like that .
F	the wrong product was sent and i have spent a week trying to get details of how i return the unwanted goods and re - order .
F	forty_minutes later i was still_waiting .
F	they were to deliver work for an_exhibition on friday so it is cutting it very fine .
M	i have ordered two_pairs of raybans from selectspecs in the last three_months .
F	because i was not in and depite saying leave in the porch if not in .
F	very easy to use , great price .
M	when i went through to the last page it said my session had expired and that i would have to do it again .
M	however - after sales very good and replacement boxes delivered next_day foc .
F	every time since then parcels delivered to me by this company have taken a minimum of 0_weeks to arrive .
F	the home care range is great especially the reed difusers - they are so much_cheaper then in the department_stores .
F	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
F	there are quite a few books that are not accepted which is disappointing .
M	i bought a pair of vibram running_shoes which have worked out great and as advertised .
M	i '_ve bought everything from watch batteries to rechargeable cordless phone batteries from them and always got a great price , fast delivery and a quality product .
M	we were told that they would be complete in two_weeks which was exactly when the call came through to tell us they were ready .
M	- i had to take action and then finally they cancelled !
F	i was really unhappy with the quality & content of the order & would not recomend this comapny to anyone because of this .
M	the instructions were given to leave the parcel in a safe_place behind the recycling .
F	last time i will buy anything from argos .
M	as i live locally to the source of my last purchase , i went in person to pick_up the article , thinking the vendor would make some reduction because he was not having to finance the delivery .
M	placed the order on thursday and received the 0000 version on saturday .
F	experience over phone and collection was faultless , however a child '_s army outfit lasted one day of wearing before it ripped apart at the sems .
M	whilst i understand that eurofit were not_necessarily responsible for the delay in delivery , i would have thought that they would keep an eye on if things as the item was ' traceable '.
M	customer service failure number 0 !
M	cost .
F	they have just washed their hands of the situation .
M	if you ' re looking for a straight transfer service , you can go no further as this service delivered perfectly .
M	on placing the order with parcels 0go and complying with all the various paperwork required in triplicate for each of the five boxes , i was informed 0_weeks_later that the company , gls had either lost the paper_work or required new paperwork for each of the boxes .
F	other_sites offer next_day delivery very cheaply so i think i '_d be more inclined to use them in the future .
F	rating 0 as required to enter a star_rating .
F	update - i finally got a refund from them with the delivery costs refunded as well but it took quiet a few phone_calls .
M	a few_days_later we received a call to say the engineer found no issues with the chair and it was user error !
M	she could only say they were busy in response to asking her why they don_'_t answer the phone .
M	put the statistics for the models in the pictures on the website as well as the size of the clothing they are wearing .
F	thank_you
F	no phone_call at this end , and if i had been out they didn_'_t leave any message on the machine .
F	i can not fault my experince using fonebank , they were quick and very efficient i recieved my cheque within a week , and recieved the full_amount i was quoted on the website .
F	great service and speedy delivery and very efficient would definitely use again
M	ive ordered from this company before , the order is always correct & speedy .
M	good product information and navigation .
M	when i called them they were verty rude .
M	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
M	my experience would have been a lot smoother had they just concentrated on the job in hand .
F	my boyfriend mother recevied her flowers & was very happy with them thank_you so much for making her birthdays .
M	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture_shows .
M	extremly fast delivery , good quality vest , good fit , great price , looking_forward to trying it out & being warmer .
F	poor quality for a lot of money .
F	i dont_think anybody really likes it .
F	must_say i was not disappointed at all they are just as_described on web_site i certainly won_'_t have any hesitation in recommending glasses_direct to friends and family .
F	this is just the website you need for scent - huge choice and excellent prices !
F	the price was the lowest around for the jacket i liked so i placed an order .
F	we were home , we still are home , and have been home waiting for 0 day becuase of what we '_ve been told every day on the phone .
F	beware !
F	i was very lucky that one of my purchases wasn_'_t broken as the packaging was extreamly damaged .!
M	so .
M	on the rare occassions when they deem it necessairy to put you through to a uk level 0 operative you feel like kissing the phone you are that grateful .
F	i placed an order for a product that was hapf the price of products on other site and i got twice as much for my money .
F	would recommend
F	i tried several_times to contact them by phone and on the one occasion they answered it i was immediately cut_off .
M	had to chase up , and then it was discovered that there was a problem with the courier .
M	i was also impressed with the service as the item was couriered the following_day .
M	no_nonsense , excellent speedy service , as well as being the cheapest for my brand of dog_food .
M	on speaking to another cruise company nearby , i was told that the boat did not leave from the location in your map and i would not be able to get to the proper location in time .
M	very quick delivery , easy to order , we use again
F	anytime you phone the call_centre , the staff either don_'_t have a clue what they ' re talking_about ( i '_ve had to phone apple who '_ve re - directed me back to tesco on numerous occaisions as tesco staff say they can '_t deal with technical questions about iphones !)
F	i had to phone them to to get the money transferred after two_weeks with no response .
M	i have a 000min ( etc ) sim only deal , with them with 00m to go on my little contract .
F	my phone was stolen at one point and they paid out really quickly and easily .
F	the price was really good but the time almost six days to get to me
F	in_spite of this , the parcel arrived the very next_day , which was good , but if i had known i wouldn_'_t have paid and waited another day / two .
M	love the photo_albums , so different to anything_else you find anywhere , they have a hand - crafted feel , avoid all photo - album - look cliches and are perfect for housing your life experiences , particularly travel ones .
M	and refund my credit_card and i would go_elsewhere .
F	i have tried to get a refund but have been told it could be about 00 days which is outrageous .
M	you sent me the bloody email in the first place .
M	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
M	june_00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !
M	top of the line store !
F	if anyone orders a bouquet , they order a complete article and if any part of it is damged then the company should be culpable for it .

M	i was advised on work that would need doing to the car ( even_though i did not ask for this to be done ) which was good .

M	first_class product , i am a great lover of the marriott hotel chain and their beds are the the best in the world .
F	it was left to me hours_later as i didnt know they had done that to try and clear all the polystyrene inside the packaging and then dispose of the very heavy cardboard_box .
M	excellent service and delivery however the joining units from the curved rail to the straight rail fitted_perfectly in the curved section however the rails internal size was smaller i resolved the problem by grinding a few thou off of the joiner however this added a lot of time to what should have been a relatively easy job
F	would definately recomend .
M	don_'_t be put off by some of the negative_reviews , all companies have faults !

M	no apology or follow_up .
F	i '_m so gutted that they are just able to get away with this =[
F	i was prepared to buy a second watch to get it in time for the occasion but they were not keen as they made it clear they would not_necessarily refund me the first .
M	i used kitbag a number of times now and generally the service has_been excellent however for a recent order for which there was a significant delay , there was little in way of customer service communication or am apology when the revised order fulfilment date wasn_'_t met .

F	i contacted services and told them the problem they immediately found the correct_part and told me to check it out on their web_page to make_sure - i did - i ordered and got my refund for my original within a week - excellent service cheaper_than stoves themselves would use again and defo recommend

M	confused ?
F	we sent 00 dvd '_s to music_magpie by courier , and 000 to [_link_] ( as they offered more money ).
F	so disappointed with the poor quality service .
M	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt_with and i will never use this company again .
M	service was exemplary , supplied without_fuss and speedily , just was expecting more robust product
F	from finding atlantic_signs on google - ordering - designing and delivery i have been absolutely_delighted with the whole_process .
M	however still_waiting for the balance of the order i . e .
F	was not worth all the hassle .
M	can not fault anything .
M	i emailed several couriers who advertise on ebay , but for this sort of item which was not in a neat box , and was over 0 . 0m_long and weighed about 00kgs . well 0 out of 0 replied , quoting £_000 and £_000 !
F	i order numerous_times a year with printzone and have always been impressed with their competitive_prices and super_fast delivery ( sometimes next_day delivery ).
M	but no - the beast has arrived , and it is exactly as i had remembered .
F	tracking_number was wrong on email so i have not been able to track my order so waited in on the day it worked out it should be delivered and surprise_surprise no order was delivered so the 0 / 0days for delivery was wrong too .
M	it was too late by that time so i had to accept .
F	though only down_side was i ordered the large size as stated was a uk " 00 to 00 ".
M	this was a great deal and i saw the same product at my local fancy_dress store for £_000 .
F	our daily treat to ourselves , in a busy stressful life , much_appreciated .
F	when i moved_house late last_year , i lost the " lock knob " from my projector and was amazed when the customer service representative actually knew what i was talking_about , and moreover sent me a new one within a few_days !
F	iv called lesters but all they have fine is give me my delivery code ( already had it ) and told me to check on hermes site .
M	also having visited the website several_times before ordering i could have done so sooner had i not been misled by the delivery schedule given with the product description .
F	yodel '_s website tracking said they had left a calling_card at the house but they hadn_'_t .
F	i loved dealing_with the team at paperstone .
F	i went to the depo the net day to be told the parcel wasnt at that depo ,.
F	my house is right next to the reception ; where all parcels arrive .
F	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
M	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .
F	easy to order and my items were delivered on time .
M	i needed a tyre in a hurry as i had a long journey ahead .
F	purchased 0 eyeshadow palettes from crown_brush , when i received the palettes the colors aren_'_t as vibrant as they were on the website so i decided to contact crown_brush to return this item .

M	they are not alamo !!!
F	flowers delivered at nearly 0 pm not acceptable at all .
M	well i have always been a fan of asos , good clothing , good choice , unfortunately in order to get this stuff you have to go through them , and if you love wasting your time and money , then you will love this company !
M	sorted a small problem we had without_fail and within a few_days .
F	can not fault this company good arrived in less_than 00hrs would recommend them
M	i have shopped at blackcircles before and i allways find them good value and good customer service .
F	just received my first order .
F	also a solid_oak corner_unit for the tv which fits_perfectly and looks_stunning .
M	i did get a damaged part but that was corrected almost_instantly !
M	others take_note .
F	my only_complaint with lovefilm is that they say " unlimited ", but it is actually limited by their poor turnaround time .
M	having to now cease the scheduled installation , i had no option other than to ask my credit_card company to investigate this for me under section 00 of the consumer_credit act .
F	thanks , next thing is to start baking !
F	now i '_ve received my new fridge , i am able to say that it is exactly as_described on appliances_online and i am very very pleased with this company and my product .
M	great service & great value .
F	i ordered the sized - up bouquet but didn_'_t think it was really worth the extra .
M	allmarksweets was a very fast service , items were package well and the price was very good .
M	however , with the increasing prices , i really do expect the vessel to be ready on time .
F	also , given the flowers were dispatched at 00 am , they sat a long time in the van .
M	worked .
F	this kind of mark up is unacceptable and we will therefore not be using your site in the future .
M	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
M	thanks
F	i bought one hamper from serenta and one from virginia hayward , both similar price with similar contents .
M	the card that was with the flowers was for someone completely_different !
M	too expensive for such a small item .
F	it was easy to choose and order and the flowers got the big_thumbs_up .
M	i have kept all documentation and copied all the emessages that have been sent to me , for legal use at a later date if need be .
M	!
F	a few_days_later sent another e_- mail from my e_- mail account and another via my account on the site .
M	just to note : black_circles always deliver the tyres together .
F	i have no_hesitation in reccommending their services and would suggest that anyone about to buy an annuity would be well advised to contact them to see what they can offer .
M	i ' d give them another chance
F	have already_recommended to lots of people .
F	only just had experience of this company , but i am impressed so far .
F	i '_m amazed to get a ' please rate us ' after a telephone_call .
M	i '_ve only had a couple of payments come through , some weren_'_t credited at all and this really_annoys_me .
M	i had to chase the company to find out why .
F	the parcel arrived quickly however i was disappointed to find that the dress was not accompanied_by the underwear .
F	she managed to source the table plus 0 matching wave back chairs that were not showing as available on line .
M	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
M	it is a large_chunk of plastic that will stop you from snoring only because you cant sleep
F	!
F	i purchased the white blackout film for a upvc door .
F	so i went abck on to the website to try and find a telephone_number to contact them on .
F	the website is impossible the phone line not much_better .
F	little disappointed to be completely honest .
M	got my stanley level at a good price and quickly .
M	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren_'_t even able to take messages for me !
M	i did offer for them to credit_note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
M	you just lost a customer !
F	i would never order from them again .
M	thanks
M	i ordered a pair of bifocal sunglasses , wanting them for my holidays in a few weeks time .
F	it , sells itself !
F	i was kept_updated on the date and time of the order with emails and texts which was very reassuring .
M	works_perfectly , allows me to train without feeling muscular niggles in my upper legs .
M	in addition , the product was broken - one corner smashed and 0 of the four side_rails loose .
F	the only_downfall is the join on the back of the metal box was broken when i opened it up .
F	will definitely add them to my list of rugby kit suppliers !
F	all that said , the furniture arrived and once i had unpacked it myself it is lovely and well made
M	i have been trying to source a ford_mondeo , and i was offered the details of four main_dealers with , give - or - take , the car i was seeking , but none of the four has actually been able to say if they actually have that car - or even if or when they will be able to obtain it .
F	fantastic will defiantly recommend .
F	we did set_up a monthly order and when this ran_out have never been able to re - activate the monthly order on the website as there appears to be no instruction how to do this
M	ordered ear cones .
M	you should try sending them in bespoke packaging without a growing medium .
F	item despatched quicker_than_expected .
F	!
M	the facts speak for themselves the food is no different to all other_retailers so why pay over the top ?
F	the end product is first_class with deadlines met .
M	on the other occasions , i have had the money_transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
F	plus the service was fast and the cost competitive .
F	the quality of the banner is amazing , the printing is superb and the overall effect is brilliant .
M	tried to cancel my account but they said they couldn_'_t find my details .

F	the prices were extremely good and they arrived within two_days of placing the order .
M	snuggle beds new legend ortho 0000 mattress - ordered and delivered very quickly - now had it for 0 months - very comfortable - good quality at a reasonable price .
F	they looked nothing like the picture of the flowers i ordered .
F	i placed an order for £_00 end of aug and never got it .
F	the time delays have been ridiculous but the worst thing about dealing_with the company has_been the constant_emails and phone_calls i have had to make to get my order processed .
M	ordered a washing_machine from them , as i really needed it next_day .
M	re - booked direct with disney for around original price i got from expedia .
F	would i use again - absolutely not !
F	i was impressed with the emails_confirming my order , confirming dispatch and giving me an_hour_slot for when the item would be delivered .
F	i was unfortunate_enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
M	i placed the order , only to get a call back ten_minutes later to say the order could not be fulfilled by their local suppliers .
M	please allow an extra few_days for us to process your request .
F	delivery prompt but incorrect order as rather_than including the birthday card selected and paid for a sorry card was delivered and sorry written all over the box took the shine off the gift and left my elderly_mother confused .
M	imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work .
M	i would give them zero .
M	i have recomended this site to my friends .
M	!
M	my girlfriend was really happy with the flowers .
M	i would and have highly_recommended them to as many of my winter sports friends as possible !
F	this has_been a most satisfying_experience and i don_'_t see me going anywhere_else for anything i might require in the future .
F	would definitely buy again .
M	these are not issued by default .
M	fairly good service at lanzarote_airport , though we had to wait nearly an_hour for the coach to be allocated and then had to walk a very long way to the coach park ( this bit isn_'_t resorthoppa '_s fault )
M	i kept checking the website and noticed the date slipping out , until finally the date said it would not be dispatched until after xmas .
M	my only extra_cost was postage for returning the wrongly ordered item ,
F	also additional phone help provided by polite cheerful gentleman .
M	if you need an unusual battery they will find it for you and they also have some very good offers from time to time .
M	i placed an online order on the wednesday and paid extra for 0 - 0 day delivery , the package was showing as ' despatched from yodel service centre ' on the thursday , by the friday_afternoon it hadn_'_t updated , on contacting yodel ( automated line ) it said there was a problem with my package and informed me to contact the company i bought it off .
F	this did not happen either .
F	would defo recommend anyone to use mazuma and will , hopefully , use mazuma myself too .
F	regardless of these two issues my partner was still happy with them , however he opened one up and poured into a glass , before he drank any i noticed lots of white pieces floating in it .
F	i have only been using them for a week and already my skin_feels softer and the blemishes are fading .
M	i do not have a strong prescription and both eyes are the same prescription for reading - it should have been relatively simple to get these right first time , however they were so bad i was not inclined to give them a second chance .
F	i ordered several sample invites from bride_& groom_direct , which arrived promptly .
F	the flowers arrived by midday and she described them as ' really beautiful '.
F	they received it the next_day and immemdiately emailed a receipt .
F	the other was found to be blocked .
M	this turned_out to be a rusty screw and a cut in the tube .
M	the plane left on time and arrived slightly early .
F	in the past i have had nothing but praised for this company but after my last purchased my estimations have gone down rapidly .
M	seems of solid_construction , and decent material and a good copy all_round .
M	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
M	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly_£_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
M	you may have gathered from my rather weak comment that whilst i was not enthralled by the item , i was ok with it .
M	ordered for valentine '_s day , received an_automated style mail telling_me the delivery adress was incorrect (!?
M	told the rear_tyres were fine .
F	i was then told in a loud voice " as you have this receipt i can see you have bought the bag , so i will give you the gift voucher ".
M	you should get credited within the next 00hours .
F	well_done !
M	i should have read the details , my fault did not even think it would entail a mini_bus_ride for 0 km to a rental site off airport .
F	stay away & go with a reputable provider who has uk_based call_centres .
M	this was only based on a simple mot .
F	was informed by email of what was happening from bathroom arriving in stock , to bathroom being despatched and date of delivery .
F	the next_day i received a phone_call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
F	i like playing at tombola do feel there is a lot of same names win most games and same jackpot winners .
M	easy to use website , and prompt deliveries .
F	overall it was a good experience apart fr the morose delivery drivers no smiles or hello goodbyes just " where do you want it " !!
F	awful service .
M	fronts with no design on them ( ordered chichester ), the experience has got worse
F	i cannot face another phone_call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
M	no emails or contact yet still not delivered 😳
M	ability to access customer_support , great , only took a few_clicks and we were connected .
M	i '_ve ordered about £_000 of things over four orders since starting to use tohc in summer .
F	he asked me to sign for them .
F	i discovered mazuma_mobile they offered an acceptable amount .
F	great product stock , easy order service , competitive_prices and fantastic delivery .
M	i ordered two franklin and marshall tee_shirts off the web_site when my package arrived only one was sent and a slip of paper inside telling_me the other was out of stock , no email to get alternative no phone_call other than that overall service was good .

F	everything was well_packed easy to open .
M	good service and speedy payment
F	buying a domain is an_absolute_bargain .
F	the customer service agent i spoke to was so polite and so helpful .
F	i have used viovet for some time now .

F	before i purchased it i contacted the supplier to confirm that it was not made of latex .
M	ordered on a wednesday and received on the friday in time for my party on the saturday , costume way above my expectations , loads of comments on saturday_night , went down a treat and scared the life out of people .
F	just what you want .
M	service first_class would buy of again
M	my delivery of tiles arrived on the date promised but no trim was delivered even_though it was on the delivery note .
M	no_quibble on returns
F	service excellent and it was good to be informed by text of progress and actual delivery .
F	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening .
M	if you don_'_t believe me then go to rpc first and see what an_absolute sham they are - then go to mazuma and see the difference !
F	where is my money ????
F	i asked why it couldn_'_t be collected that day as it was hermes who were at fault but the lady i spoke to said they wouldn_'_t collect it that day , it would have to be tomorrow .
F	the number posted on the website was confusing and even the us phone company could not understand how to dial it .
M	looks_like a fatigue fracture .
F	they have amazing products at really good prices .
M	ii was charged differently to what was stated on the final_bill !
F	the biggest pro is this bike is quiet so you can easily bike and watch tv .
F	came quickly but box badly_damaged .
M	the flowers were all damaged and the vase box crumpled how the base was in one piece i dont_know .
F	would now not recommend this site for all the money in the world
M	if a customer places repeat_orders you can tell - and send out the survey only after completion - it '_s the sensible way .
F	the online consultation was very quick and easy to use .
F	the price was marginally better_than theyir competitor .
F	absolute_disgrace !
M	great service .
M	all good manners and smiles .
F	i used it again , hoping that same thing happens but unfortunately , my order was being delivered the next_day early morning .
F	my brand_new eco_friendly house is all glass and wood .
M	the only meats we buy from them now are chateaubriand and lamb racks ( when they are on offer ) and since beginning to use westin_gourmet we haven_'_t seen them advertised in their sales literature .
M	i found the webiste easy to use and finding the glasses was an easy experience , especially as they were a gift for my partner .
M	definately_use again .
F	i ordered some cushions and did not realise that the company were on an annual holiday ( such a nice tradtional practice - kind of old school ) and the owner upon return immediately emailed to let_me know that my cushions were to be dispatched as soon as possible on their return .
M	and when it arrived the next_day it was brilliantly_packaged to save any damage .
M	they dont want to loose custom !
M	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
M	i called their support to block the sim_card , and i was told it was impossible to block the sim_card right away , i would have to rely_on an automatic auto - blocking after 0 months of non usage . so somebody might be using my phone right now , preventing the auto - blocking !
F	brilliant service .
F	will stick to amazon in the future .
M	i would highly_recommend this company , and will be ordering more garments in the very near_future .
F	so i waited the remainder of the day inside waiting for the delivery of package number 0 . no such luck . no phone_calls or email . nothing .
M	then , given balcony seats center for date requested .
M	on time .
M	this company did a great job .
F	both of the tours that i took i do not regret taking - however there was much room for improvement .
F	- no attempts to compensate / take_responsibility .
M	looking for somewhere unbiased to leave an honest review i found trustpilot , and posted a review here .
F	smooth flight but don_'_t think worth the money .
M	i expect to be calling tim again when i next need to book flight tickets and on the basis of my experience would recommend him to anyone .
M	should be quicker and less confusing
F	this folding pair of ray - bans took up nearly no space in a rucksack .
M	the ferry had more things to do than your average village , and it was a enjoyable_experience .
F	only option was to refuse delivery .
M	we have thus sent the boots back and asked for an exchange ( in this instance ).
M	got my order delivered fast , no_problems
M	couldn_'_t ask for a better service .
M	the product displayed a delivery time of 0 - 00 working_days , yet 00_hrs after they took the money i am told there is no stock and the product is back ordered , this could take 0 days - 0_weeks .
M	very very disappointing .
M	a date of delivery was promised .
F	then they told me that they will contact the manufacturer and will email me as soon as they hear from them .
F	fantastic .
F	also the info on tracking items was very good .
F	very happy with the service at mauma .
M	on the morning i was due to have them fitted i rang the garage to ask what time was likely to be quietest for them and to confirm everything was ok .
F	this was my first order which was ordered when the snow was bad , it was delayed a few_days which is fair , and they did let_me know .
M	no , i am told .
F	told i ordered on the last day that xmas delivery was guaranteed now the 00 th dec and items still not received - very disappointing
F	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work_colleague .
M	verb
F	the name on the card is patricia and the number given is 00000000000 however the only facility is to send a text which has not been answered .
M	meal worms were great value for money !
F	however , the time from ordering to receiving was protracted far beyond what i expected , and they arrived the day before we left for a holiday .
F	i am now going out to buy envelopes so i can give to my family this weekend . i am still no closer to getting the envelopes from this site and have requested a refund for the missing envelopes
F	they arrived very quickly and work as they should .
F	we '_d not asked her to do it , but hadn_'_t had time ourselves - but the way the maid0clean office spoke to us , it was like we were animals for leaving a few plates and a couple of baking_trays out .
F	the box was stamped as standard , which it obviously is .
F	i '_d ordered two calendars but after attempting one , i didn_'_t bother ordering the second one .
M	p . s .
F	hassle_free spending and really prompt delivery .
M	easy to use website for people who arent the best with computers and great customer service !
M	perhaps it was hidden in the small_print somewhere but why broadcast this nugget only after the purchase ?
F	i would re - order in the future i think , if i was guaranteed from seller my order would be delivered by another courier who took delivery instructions seriously .
M	clear web_site , easy to use .
M	they said sorry and sent me new papers for the next_day .
M	rus00 ( drawers ) was ordered in may 0000 ( at the time of no special sale ) and it cost £_000 . 00 .
M	cjw
M	internet_gardener contacted me immediately to apologise and therefore will use them again .
F	it would be useful if in the information the dimensions of the ' toy section ' of the pinata is included - not nose to tail .
M	most shut off by 00 for next_day collection .
F	after 0_days i had had no response from customer_services so i called them again .
M	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer service and best of all they never answer the phone .
M	even if it '_s hermes !
M	quality products , great designs and brands .
F	having placed an online order four_weeks_ago , it was only when i emailed them that i was informed my order had been cancelled .
M	first time i '_ve_used this supplier but competitive price and very prompt delivery .
M	result ?
M	i can '_t say i '_m surprised .
M	they have no phone number and don_'_t reply to your emails , its one big scam .
M	my health is greatly_improved & i have saved a lot of money compared to smoking , but my advice would be to buy the best quality products from the start , to avoid_disappointment ?
M	they were very hard to reach .
F	i am really impressed with this product and wil be definately be buying it again , prompt serice and very reasonable_price :)
M	great site , easy to use and great delivery times .
F	it '_s a front for collecting money .
F	when the maid came midweek to change the towels and clean we were out but it was evident no cleaning had been done .
F	disappointed and wont_be using them again

M	can '_t comment on returns , customer_support etc .
F	while the order and delivery process was faultless i was disappointed to receive half of our 0000_euro order in 000_euro notes .
M	from sending the samples to making the order they were very good , there was a problem with delivery but to be honest was the courier , but tile_mountain took responsibility and gave_me a reduction .
M	right ?
F	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !
M	but what '_s the point if the pizza is only fit for the bin ?
F	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
F	i had to ring hfe and ask rachel to explain what i had to do .
M	quick delivery though and customer_support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
F	i did eventually receive my goods .
F	as promised it was delivered on time .
M	rob , who i dealt_with was enthusiastic and very informative . he called me back promptly the following_day so we could go through the booking and gave_me some important advice for when we collect our cars in orlando in 0 week time , for the first timer collecting a car if you have the gold package insurance don_'_t let the desk talk you into buying extra_insurance , your covered and believe me i '_ve been got before years_ago , when kids are running around your feet and everyone '_s tired , don_'_t give in to the seller .
F	i gave all three a reasonable trial , but am returning the unopened_boxes .
F	i have tried to post a review for an item three_times on the website but very do not post it !
F	would have expected something free as an_apology or a discount or something .
F	arrived quickly but i thought the packaging of the item was poor .
M	an extra discount at checkout .
M	it is very rare for me to write such a glowing_report about any product i have purchased but glassesdirect really did stand out .
M	i have contacted the customer service team at resorthoppa four times by email without a reply .
F	i '_ll repeat this 0 more times , leaving my number but never answer their calls .
F	i do not think this is an unreasonable request , nor is it unreasonable to expect this service to be carried_out as expected .
F	not worth will
F	the pool and table_tennis_table were brilliant and much enjoyed .
M	he eventually came out with no apologises .
F	they did not even answer all my questions .
F	ordered for xmas_pressie for son - superdry '_s biggest_fan !!!
M	i '_m not :-(
F	the product was as expected and no_issues here , however the packaging used to post it was terrible and had fallen_apart , the delivery company had tried to patch it up with tape .
M	very in happy .
F	just had a lengthy conversation with an ebooker customer service rep and after being put on hold for a while was then told i have to fill in a form on their website and attach the confirmation they sent us the form and it will be investigated .
F	i am therefore trying to source the product elsewhere , where the postage will be cheaper ( or free ).
M	thanked me for letting them know asbout p_f jones who they are now going to source all their towbars from .
M	good inexpensive buy .
F	oh_yes , they have replied all right .
F	i paid £_00 for these boots .
F	did not receive my item until the following_tuesday .
F	en 00 , og et_par var nærmere en str .
M	unfortunately they went wrong a couple of months later so i emailed them .
F	please_avoid the halford mot nd service centers .
F	experience is generally fine but boots . com is terrible .
M	fear them and stay_away like the plague !
M	was somebody standing on the scales !!
F	i am still_waiting .
M	booked my usual ups delivery service through interparcel yesterday before cut - off time .
F	i have also taken to wearing it when resting during the day and most definitely am experiencing an improvement .
M	good looking watch but the bracelet was difficult to alter .
F	hi there ,
M	if you stay more than 00_minutes a firm called g00 may try to recover a £_000 for breaching parking terms .
F	all three fit_perfectly , operate smoothly are well - made and robust .
F	when they arrived i wasn_'_t disappointed . they can be fitted really easily and look great .
F	blue_chip apartments are usually spotless so we were very surprised .
M	i told amazon over a year_ago that i would not shop with them while they use yodel and since then they have used their own extremely reliable couriers .
F	i would have rated this service much_better but fail to understand_why something like this can occur .
F	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
F	well recommended
F	thank_you prompt service and a user_friendly site .
M	when we tried again the order was taken and we sat back thinking all was well then a few_days_later an email_saying the item is now out of stock !
M	our guide has some cool facts about the tower .
M	shall be returning when we have run out !
F	i am so pleased with my new made to measure_nets with hemmed sides ( grace white plain nets ) they have been made to a very high_standard and hang perfectly , i would not_hesitate to recommend .
F	!
M	i '_ve been a regular customer of play since_0000 , buying mainly dvds and now blu - rays from them .
F	easy purchase , quick delivery , fantastic quality item , great value .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending this excellent company !
F	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
F	i booked villa , flights and transfers with them .
M	i ordered a washer_/ dryer from marks_electrical and as stated they have very helpful friendly well - informed staff , the product delivered on time , and i could see the installers took real pains to install it really well .
F	( p . s i do not see why i have to pay for return postage and nothing was said in regards to the other pair which are useless and unwearable and neither of the issues are my fault as i bought them both in good faith !! )
M	contacted gak via_email late on a thursday_evening enquiring whether they had stock of a synth i was after .
F	also said i would get full_refund and a £_00 voucher , received email voucher but the email address was incorrect so could not use .
M	my father told_him that the review could not be libellous as it was the truth .
M	including ' free delivery ' items .
M	this doesn_'_t really cover it .
F	exactly_what i needed .
F	!
F	then they had the cheek to tell me it would be 00 days for the refund .
M	the first botched delivery took 0_weeks and there '_s still an item in dispute , the second took 0_weeks , third 0_weeks , and the latest a much more reasonable one week .
F	to : gillian coyle
M	i have never been so disapointed with flowers !
F	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
F	email to confirm order , then email day before delivery to advise of arrival , then email on morning of delivery to tell me what 0hour delivery slot had been allocated .
M	i would use this service again and again good quality and value for money
F	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
M	why have they no email address ?
M	i have emailed them so i look_forward to their response .
F	it still has not arrived !
F	the dress came very quickly in the post but the crown that came with it , the gems had fallen out and i didnt have time to send item back so had to superglue them back on , not really happy considering the price i paid .
M	i ordered another same schedule .
F	i '_ve recently bought paloma picasso from this company and it '_s a fake .
F	they charge for 00 hour periods so if your flight time is such that you are away for 00_hours you get to pay another tenner for the extra hour .
F	trainers arrived before expected .
F	also my customers have complained about severe damage to the boxes .
M	this was last time .
M	" it appears that when you first booked your accommodation , you would have been sent a reservation confirmation to this email address advising you of the fact that you need to let the company have your flight details at_least 00 days before you travel ."
M	it '_s been 0_weeks almost since i placed my order , and no delivery !!!
F	now , i don_'_t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that '_s a good thing and in everybody '_s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
M	however , the quality ( given that 0 lights were about £_00 ) was not great .
M	my story , i ordered a new ( ex_display ) sony_tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
M	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy_outfit .
M	the title_says it all .
F	be careful you order the right deal .
M	flowers were nice and delivered in time , the only problem is that the greeting_card was missing so they had no idea who had sent them !
F	communicate with you at every_step of the way and you can even create a memo service to remind you to reorder
M	" the details on the original wowcher deal were correct and you would have had to conform to any further ts_&_cs that were enforced by petchey leisure ."
M	the only down_side was that the case for my glasses was broken inside , however it should be pointed_out that i didnt call to inform them about this , and i '_m_sure if i had it would '_ve been sorted_out with no problem .
M	so i don_'_t watch any more .
F	if only every company were this perfect !
M	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
F	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0_days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder_if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
F	after several days of correspondence the florist sorted_out the issue and showed a more compassionate side .
M	i wasn_'_t prepared to be clamped down with a big contraption attached to my eye ball - no one had explained that to me .
F	no response .
F	glasses_direct provided a service second to none .
M	i disposed of my old shed the day before the delivery date and had to store everything out of it , either in my home or in neighbour '_s sheds and they are still there now almost a month later !
F	far cheaper and more convenient than going to an optician !!!
M	good products , and the price differences are small , but just be sure that you ' re getting the best deal from them .
M	this is stupid enough but it claims a card was left .
M	there was a wide_range and no mimimum order restrictions .
F	i anticipate the next battle will be a return of these monies owed .
F	for me the service from these 0 suppliers are about the same .
M	don_'_t rely_on these_guys if you are on a tight_schedule .
M	i ordered some flyers when i found this site as they have some really nice designs for you to customise .
F	i placed my order on 00th_september_0000 and was advised 0 - 0_days delivery time .
F	hasn_'_t worked for me so although delivery prompt , i '_m disappointed
M	00 og pakken_var hos mig næste dag .
F	no_problems with ordering or delivery .
M	the cost was debited via_paypal on the same day .
F	luckily & " yey " for paypal i have received a refund today .
M	however they did this without_quibble so i was still on the whole ' satisfied '.
M	i know this is a small company , but as i ordered online on christmas day , although i got a confirmation_email automatically , the item didn_'_t get posted until 0th_january as the owner had been away for a few_days
M	nice to use web_site , reasonably_priced and rapid delivery .
M	always excellent service and fast delivery and kept up to date if items not in stock and when they will be
F	i felt my bills were rather high and wanted to find out why .
M	i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to save_money but still wants to use top bodybuilding brands .
M	i always impress about your dispatch time , never been let_down .
F	i do realise that some flowers may have been out if stock but most florists have lilies and roses all year .
F	whoever it was at 000 - reg who came up with this policy needs to go on a course on how not to p *** off existing_customers .
F	they were dispatched as soon as the order was received so you can '_t ask for more than that .
M	the ordering_process was smooth and efficient keeping_me well informed_throughout .
M	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
M	at 0 . 00pm i got through and driver said he would deliver next_day but couldn_'_t give time or even morning or afternoon delivery .
M	needed a 0 . 0 ton trailer collected from croma norfolk the map said you may have to walk the last 0 miles strange but true that aside i searched the net found any van put in the details withina hour i had quotes and reasonable quotes at that i accepted one thinking hear starts the questioning and teeth sucking and the didn_'_t relies it was their and how big wide klong it was and why didn_'_t you tell me it wasn_'_t made off and oh no its one of them !!
M	i ordered some australian salmon cut steaks .
M	purchased an odessey premier flute which was advertised as ex_display and was valued at a fair price .
M	very good service , battery arrived the next_day after ordering
F	some employees i worked with could seem a little sharp , but the end product is well received .
F	ordered the ' purple blaze ' bouquet as a thank_you present .
F	flowers arrived at 0 . 00pm , half_dead and not worth £ 0 let_alone £_00 inc delivery !
M	the agent who called me promised that that they would deliver the fridge_freezer between 0 :_00am and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 0 / 00 without_fail .
M	glasses are cheap product .
M	i will use the company again and recommend them .
M	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
F	it wasn_'_t because it hadn_'_t been updated as i '_d seen the same details of that holiday for 0_weeks .
M	expected to get £_00 tops , got £_00 !
F	in a nutshell .
M	probably not , i can '_t afford to lose money on a job waiting for a delivery that might or might not arrive :-(
F	sono le 0 di sera .
F	i was very pleased with the work .
F	many_thanks to all the team at nextdaycoffee .
M	ordered a pair of climbing_shoes which arrived swiftly after i ordered them , however they did not fit .
M	supposed to deliver some food to my house using a next_day delivery service and did not even have the decency to attempt the delivery .
M	it is water_proof and rodent proof .
F	so all in all i wouldn_'_t bother with another order
F	ordered online and not only confirmed but also text_message sent at each_stage .
M	it looks as though i '_m going to face the hassle of replacing the whole fixture rather_than simply replacing the tube .
F	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
F	without_any fuss or bother
M	appalling !
F	have started_using my new back friend in the car and has already made a difference .
M	i have now ordered from a uk seller ( an opticians ) and ended_up paying £ 0 more and they will be delivered the next_day .

M	hi , car ok car a bigger one than paid for so well pleased .
M	no faults_whatsoever .
F	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
M	dear_sir /_madam i am disappointed and concerned that this company does not attempt to address or respond to any letters or emails sent .
M	so impressed that i have installed the same in my loft and garage !
M	the flowers arrived in unattractive brown_paper and were not as full as expected .
M	fist the club was custom bulit and was 0 inch shorter_than standard , that was not mentiond on the web_page .

M	tesco say their courier delivered it .
F	on friday 00th_december , the delivery man arrived with the parcel .
M	stop ignoring the problems and get it sorted !
F	i have to say as well that i ordered at lunchtime from work using the freephone_number - friendly , knowledgeable and efficient sales_staff is another big plus point !
M	parts arrived in double quick time .
M	why ?
M	i thought this was an insult as we had had to change our holiday and as we couldn_'_t cancel the flights ( or not without being penalised ) we had to agree .
M	however , after driving away , i thought i had better check the level of oil .
M	for what ??
M	they could not deliver products as they promosed .
M	i told hold him the crack was internal and that it was obviously not from something hitting it .
M	pleased to say , i found it at the drink_shop and it was delivered to my glass in next to no time .
F	my brother felt the difference and even offered to let_me sit in premium class for a bit to charm my nerves .
M	!
M	great price and great service .
M	that said good quality cars and helpful staff
M	but the arm issue was still present .
M	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
F	we hired a car from tullamarine airport ( in melbourne ) and assumed incorrectly that it would be no more than 00_mins after exiting the airport before we would be mobile .
M	i got my medicine the next_day so i could get on with my day to day activities .
M	i '_ve now bought a few things from e_- av now and i feel like a regular in a shop - such nice helpful people .
M	ggoreeba @_hotmail . com
M	i recently ordered some spices , they came promptly a couple of days after i ordered them .
M	i would understand it coming in an express pack if i didnt buy it by the case ?
F	i sent my items off about 0_weeks_ago and they emailed me two_weeks_ago asking me to verify my bank details , which i did , but i still_haven_'_t been paid as yet .
M	they input our final meter_reading incorrectly ( by swapping numbers round ) and sent us a final_bill for more than five times the correct amount (£_000 +)
F	my husband was extremely please with his surprize christmas_present , i would definately use the canvas_print again .
M	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .

F	i knew what to expect but just to warn_others it is more like 0 - 0 after care appointments that they say you should really come_back for .
M	you took the money for hotel but you did not book flights . refunded the flight money . nice of you . even_though you did not even book the flights . but kept the hotel money . unbelievably unprofessional does not even deserve one star
M	thankyou .
M	traditional_estate_agents can sell your house and make the whole_process fancy but still just as painful , so save_yourself some money and only pay for what you need - online exposure , for sale sign and an office to handle to correspondance .

M	my order was small but important .

F	the only_thing i have to say is avoid !!!!!

M	outstanding company .
F	a phone_call gave_us all the info we needed .

M	specifications are available for each tyre .
F	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .

M	product ok slow delivery
F	therefore we have the case for the computer but no parts to put in it and had arranged for someone to come this evening to put it together .
F	delivery very quick .
F	also the map they gave_us when leaving was incorrect .
M	a very fast & efficient service .
M	in the mean time we have read that apparently a wowcher refund isn_'_t a refund at all , it '_s a credit_note which has to be used in a short_period of time !
M	lee from yodel , don_'_t even bother mate .
F	needless to say this was more than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn_'_t either !
M	i left the site , checked my email ( nothing from loco0 . com ) and tried again .
M	they were rude and did not respect my choice to be removed from all their marketing / newsletter information .
M	i was reassured by a text_message re safe delivery halfway_through our journey .
F	day 0 - no parcel
F	i could not even see where to swipe my card as it was so dark .
F	next_day delivery and i was kept up to date with the parcels progress by email .
M	we do visit spain three or four times a year plus many of our freinds and all have this hang up over extra_charges at the pick_up desk
F	i was disappointed to book one car_parking firm and be greeted_by another , cheaper , company .
F	in fairness i did get the money credited back to my card however my friend and i wasted a day travelling to and from the venue ( so loss of earnings and petrol money ) and needed to find another activity to use with our holiday days .
M	bought items from shower_doctor ltd - items arrived quickly and were exactly as_described .
F	terrific .
F	i ordered 0 pairs of merrell_shoes for my elderly parent and having bought this brand regularly for years i had no reason to believe there would be any issue with the size .
M	it '_s been 0 days since i ordered now and i '_ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
F	as above , prices are great but since 00 lve had 0 item delivered still_waiting for 0 more but l ordered 0 bottles of the same mens fragrances
M	would definitely recommend handtec to all
F	i arrived at 0 . 00am and was on my way less_than 00_minutes later . staff were polite and friendly .
F	i emailed them and i finally got a reply reporting that they had a larger then expected order , but this does not make it acceptable to get a customer to wait 0_months for a simple beanbag .
M	avoid
F	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
M	so i had the booking_reference_number .
F	.
F	delivered quickly and safely even_though i ordered them 0_days before christmas .
F	i ordered 0 sets of the personalised confetti for a work '_s retirement party .
M	repeat_business says it all .
M	what a brilliant service , everything_went without a hitch .
F	they finally arrived 0_days late , and had delivered the wrong , much_cheaper ( over_£_00 less ) bunch of flowers !
F	would use again
M	i really hope they can get there corporate act_together , for look what '_s coming . next .
M	they sent me a motherboard and ram that was faulty .
F	i tried these_guys once , fortunately paying through paypal so did not have trouble getting a refund .
F	i will definitely be shopping with them again :)
F	rang worldstores and after being on hold for 00_mins on premium_rate number finally got through .
F	these_guys are really trustworthy .
F	they have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this .
F	the ginger snaps were broken and since one of the packs were for my friend i was not happy .
M	that '_s the main positive .
F	on the 00th i received an_email instead of what i had ordered and paid for .
F	excellent .
M	this was not mentioned anywhere when i was buying this product , who in there right mind would buy just one dumbell .
F	what more can one say !
F	i wish i '_d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
F	ordered amazonia with upgrade and would really have liked to see a picture of what the upgrade would look like , especially as i have now seen the flowers and rather wish i had further upgraded .
F	also , i was emailed yesterday to say there was a problem with delivering my flowers and the link took me to an_email to another person and showed that person '_s response !
M	because of the weather_conditions the mail was delayed but still you sent me an intimidating email to say that you still hadn_'_t received the phone and that i had breached the conditions of the sale causing me to panic thinking i was not going to be payed for my phone
M	meter_readings finally accepted on 00 november , but account is still open and no refund cheque issued .
M	update
M	we needed a new oven and by far the best range online was ao online .
F	!
F	however this experience has left me feeling less_than satisfied as a customer and leads me to question as to whether or not i '_d used them again .
F	that says it all really .
M	i ordered these flowers for my girlfriend for valentines .
F	when i visited my friend the next_day , the flowers were not as i had hoped and not the same as the pictures .
F	we were only applying for 00_% ltv as premier customers and still untold misery ensued . oh and by the way , don_'_t bother_writing to the md / ceo as his department doesn_'_t bother responding to correspondence .
M	i then ordered an a0 headlight for my other daughter to be delivered the next_day at her home 000_miles_away so it would be there for me to fit a couple of days_later .
M	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
M	there is also the facility to email them to which i get a reply usually the same day or the next at the latest .
M	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel . not bad i say !!
M	they delivere in under a week . my " same day " opticion quoted 0_weeks and gd were less_than them for 0 pairs than they were for 0pair
F	there is even a great payment protection plan .
F	most impressed with the service ( the person was out and the florist tried to deliver twice in the day ) and the flowers were totally stunning and more than fulfilled expectations , even better_than the picture .
M	couldn_'_t have gone any better , will always order supplements from this site .
M	i was phoned a couple of days_later and told the problem would be quite expensive and on the borderline between having the repair done or buying a new printer .
M	if tdl really cares_about customer_satisfaction don_'_t apologise - just give me £_00 .
F	very frustrating - terrible customer service , don_'_t call back , can '_t handle straightforward changes and appear to lie !!
M	the whole refusal meant that i had to contact the recipient and rendered the whole surprise worthless - not a surprise anymore - unacceptable and one star .
F	would definitely not stay here again .
M	especially as when you send the books or other items they will devalue them and you will not get a full value for your trade .
F	animed delayed my order due to the otodex cream being out of stock , they should have refunded me straight_away for this item so that the cimicat kitten milk i also ordered could have been sent straight_away , i had to contact them a week_later to find out why my order still had not arrived , it was only then that they refunded me and sent the milk .
F	website is so easy to use even for someone like me who hasnt got a clue !
M	i will_certainly be using them for future vehicles for my company .
M	what a refreshing buying experience !
F	within 0 minutes of placing the order i had emailed them the correct details .
M	' sorry we can '_t help you this time '.
M	tivo_box has no memory , it merely creates a marker and streams it back .
F	i also have another contract with 0 as i '_m a committed customer , this made no difference , but was refused a refund on the sim i didn_'_t receive or use and was told it was my fault !
M	next time -- and sadly we have already booked the same routing in september -- we will wear old clothes and i may just refuse to drive my car the last metre up to the car in front .
F	the flowers did not arrive on sunday and as of tonight still have not arrived .
M	bad , unacceptable service all_round .
M	won_'_t buy from them again .
F	feel massively ripped_off and disappointed .
F	interlink sent me a text that morning to say my parcel would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
M	i wont be ever going back to tesco and with my purchases though its store for my home & business as well as entertainment , wine , £_00 per week fuel and credit_card its lost a minimum of £ 0000 from me which now go straight to sainsburys .
M	the gap was way too small for an adult male .
M	i requested that i be refunded the euro00 that i paid through the website as i missed the cruise not through any fault of my own but due to the wrong or misleading location information being displayed on the company website .
F	after much negotiation , i managed to get the admin_charge dropped but i still paid for the return carriage .
F	you then have to purchase a full_tank of fuel £_00 on arrival at airport .
F	do what they say to the letter .
F	purchased rose_bush in a pink bucket - looks very poor with only three flowers in bloom not worth £_00 paid .
F	i literally had yodel and very on speed dial trying track where my order was .
M	0 ) my expectations of quality were too high for hand made furniture .
M	however when she tries to use the money she put on it comes back saying rejected .
M	thanks
F	despite checking their ' tracking ' website there were no more updates and it was wednesday_lunchtime before my delivery arrived .
F	b ) why they took money from my account for items they didn_'_t stock
F	it was collected on 00th_november
M	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .
M	still chasing .
F	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
M	top company ten stars
F	hi , purchased these fab 0 pairs of glasses @ glasses_direct , cant_believe_how little they cost & fantastic quality !!
F	it gives several options with clear guidelines
F	you will not receive your goods as the company went into_liquidation months_ago .
F	if i was younger i '_d offer to have his babies .
F	thank_you !
F	informed when my order was despatched
F	great service
F	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
F	i paid £_00 . 00 for a bunch of half_dead flowers which would have cost me no more than £_00 from asda , and they would have been superior quality .
F	lovely lady spoke to me on the phone , my only_criticism is that i was promised a phone_call at 0 - 00 and it was actually 0 - 00 when i got the call .
F	products are excellent but the delivery man expected me to collect the heavy box from him two flights of stairs below - i paid full price for delivery and that to me means to my front_door .
M	worst of all they were advertising '' 000_% guaranteed real customer feedback .
F	its awful !
M	i use to detsroy pillows within a couple of months , but this memory_foam pillow has now lasted me over a year and is still as comfortable as the day i purchased it .
M	many_thanks , i '_ll be using you again and recommending you to family and friends .
F	my grandchildren have enjoyed all the things i have purchased from happy_puzzle and i am always spoilt for choice .
F	their price is cheaper_than buying from the manufacturer director !!
M	oh no .
M	jm
F	the deposit was in my account within the 0 hours specified , however they take the money back at a not so good time and then when it says you can deposit another 000_pound it doesn_'_t let you add anything which is not very good if you specify an amount that a customer can borrow they should be able to have that amount not say available amount then when u process it not let you take anything out .
M	when they do bother to return emails ( which isn_'_t often ) they make promises they don_'_t keep and after we contact archos direct 0_weeks_ago , they told us they ' d only just received machine .
M	it is probably more suited to use on furnoiture than floors .
M	i rang the company and was able to send the lady an email and then order the goods over the phone .
F	thankyou
F	i asked the driver politely to move his van from my drive .
M	shiply fine be careful book early allow time to go else where .
M	they have again agreed to reimburse me .
F	we have used etyres for a number of years .
F	would recommend tho .
F	just as_descibed .
F	not left_securely ( even_tho they reported back that they were .)
M	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm_deadline ( for a secret_santa ).
M	pleased with the service .
F	- and it '_s easy to use .
F	thank_you !
M	i have cancelled the order but i am told it will take from 0 to 00 days for my credit_card to be refunded ' minus cancellation_charges where_applicable .'
F	i would use them again and recommend them .
F	update 00 . 0 . 00 : amazing - my order has arrived .
M	it seems their order system hadn_'_t worked properly , didn_'_t go to visa secure check .
M	i use interparcel on a daily_basis , spending between £_000 - 000 a week with them .
F	we have been unable to monitor our usage of electricity as they don_'_t enter our readings onto our on - line account and , as a result , we haven_'_t been able to view any bills .
F	received item quickly , sooner_than_expected and it was very well_packaged , haven_'_t used it yet so can '_t comment on use , but don_'_t expect any_problems .
M	".
M	i find their website dead easy to navigate , and their product range is extensive .
M	the courier emailed me the next_morning stating that i could expect delivery prior to 0pm .
M	they sucks !!
M	and by 00 noon nothing had arrived .
M	brill will now get my seeds from here
F	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don_'_t know if we get on with our neighbours .
F	i placed an order at the beginning of august .
F	!
M	a further two letters , both recorded delivery and both signed for by soho00 at their listed address but no response .
M	i switched my electricity_supply from scottish_power to isupply energy on 00 november .
F	i was sorry to see that i had to insure the parcel against loss or theft when i am already paying for the safe deilvery of the parcel to start with .
F	( i would say at_least 0 . 0 inches too long in the foot !
F	i have raised a complaint via pay_pal and will report the company to their local trading_standards .
M	as they are grown up easter_eggs would be inappropriate but these gifts are just right .
M	i contacted 0wisemoneyks and the product manufacturer .

M	buying second_hand equipment is always a bit_risky , will it work , have i done the right thing , what if if it goes_wrong .
M	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer_/ dryer from electricshop .
M	there were fundamental errors in the build of both of them .
F	communication about order status post sale was excellent and delivery was very quick .
F	order a couple of item , got them ok , they never take too long but yeah but , the thing is , order both item same times to save money , and they charge twice for deliver never happy with that .
F	happy with the service , happy with everything
M	would recommend that everyone stays away from they are a complete disappointment .
F	arrived very quickly but wrong color not large enough for my shower
F	thankyou so much strimmer is now up and running again 😊
M	eaasy to fit .
F	i waited all week for the order to arrive but after 0_days i decided to contact pharmacy0u and find out what was happening .
F	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
M	delivery details advised by text and email 0 - 0 days ahead .
M	i hope this feedback is useful
M	i also wanted to arrange an mot , as i then qualified for this at half - price .
M	on checking with madfun the following_day , it was still in their warehouse , and would go out shortly .
M	i won_'_t be using them again !
F	when i asked why he has not taken the time to call me today i was informed that they could not deliver today and when they sorted the routes out tomorrow they will ring me and let_me know what is happening .
F	will never use them again and i will deter everyone i know from the same .
M	i have purchased a few items from stevenson_heating and every purchase has_been dealt_with quickly .

M	viewing the flowers this morning they look very sad indeed with chrisants and roses with already curled up leaves .
F	as the heading said . not as seen in the picture !
M	muscle_food support not much help either ; asked them to request delivery to a neighbour but didn_'_t get done .
M	some items which the website said were in stock , were actually not available so they had to refund those .
F	!
F	they took my credit_card_details and assured me that i would receive my reglazed glasses back within 00 working_days .
M	i also did not heal correctly so it has left me short of 00 / 00 vision but still within driving_standards which is good .
M	it is now sunday 00rd february and as yet i have had no response .
F	and i have posted my proof of purchase and still heard_nothing .
F	i liked the fact that p_&_p was free .
F	went to the shops twice before package arrived !
M	i have since received pushy_sales calls from the broker company which is behind moneysupermarket . com .
M	clear , concise support when i needed it and refunded more than required to make_amends for prior service issue - thanks sammie !
M	am not impressed , when i tried to email you with a complaint of 0 faulty lens from the package i could not get through .
F	i have used villa_plus on numerous_occasions and have been very happy with them . this year i went to coral_bay in cyprus fantastic place but was disappointed with villa_plus .
M	i have looked at several suppliers of supplementary medicines , but have always returned to simplysupplements for quality and price .
M	i signed_up through thevirtualnumbercompany and this website still says " no small_print " and " 00 days cancellation notice "
M	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower price but besides the point , surely this isn_'_t how a business should actually operate ).
F	i called the number but was intercepted by a receptionist who pretended he was not in ( of course he was , but hiding from all his creditors and customers no_doubt ).
F	within 00_hours we had a travel plan put_together for us and after after several tweaks ( us being fussy ) we had the perfect holiday planned !
F	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
F	i ordered a pack of0000 ( 0x00 ") poly_bags to put on my avon brochures as part of my business .
M	note that you have no form of redress or compensation for cancellation - all you can do is leave " negative_feedback " and ask for your initial deposit to be returned .
M	the end was very damaged and a lump was taken out of the side .
F	i love the ease in which you can choose your frames - such a fabulous idea ).
F	access to my house is through a doorway from the street and there is nowhere_else to leave packages .
M	store manager andy is very poorly_trained and not management material at all .
F	we agreed that the tiles would be delivered on 00st_january ( some 0_days_later than originally ordered ).
M	it seemed i had no_longer hit send than tricia was on the phone thanking_me for her spectacular pink bouquet and her box of chockies , all to her thelf !
M	overall , very impressed by these products , and a pleasure to consume !
F	that '_s what i thought i '_d ordered .
M	sent in my phone and they decide it was faulty ( but wouldn_'_t say what was wrong ) and offered me sixty pounds less_than the quote .
M	please could you explain to me your costings , and if this is correct .
M	- good for their cashflow .
M	this is bad service .
F	only when you are really sure contact your advisor and proceed if the plan is right for you
F	obviously my husband mislaid it because he only gave_me the one .
M	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
M	!
F	i complained and the company agreed to give me a 00_%_discount , yet we are now around one month post - complaint and despite me phoning them in the mean time to ask what was happening , i am yet to receive any money .
F	as my item apparently arrived to bozowi after their ' 00 day quote guarantee period ' they sent me a ridiculous revised_offer of £ 0 .
F	very glad , i didn_'_t buy from this site .
M	i used parcelhero as the reviews seemed to be very good and even_though not as cheap as some couriers , i thought it would be a better service as the service used ups as the courier .
M	and that they are often unclear ( i very deliberately and slowly give my telephone_number - and slowly repeat it again at the end ).
M	communications were excellent and informative and delivery fast
M	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after_seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
F	very pleased with the product .
M	good value as well .
M	i '_m glad it wasn_'_t me that went out to ask the guy .
F	lovely looking flowers and great customer service but disappointing small bouquet for the price .
F	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
F	the sofas are now less_than 00 months old and already showing poor signs of wear .
F	extra money was taken from my bank_account .
F	it was left down the side of the house the package was open at one end and had cost £_000_+ i arranged for it to be recollected on july 0th but telephoned to change that to july 00th as i couldn_'_t access it in my garage .
M	and
M	highly_recommend .
F	as this didn_'_t occur until after we '_d retired for the night , the manager had to put a note on our door asking the guest not to enter .
M	get the card right and you '_ll get a good review
F	the price is good and the customer service staff are polite , but the processing speed is much below standard .
M	had i known , i could have bought them locally for less .
M	fully recommended .
F	this company seems to go out of its way to help customers .
M	however , accessing the website from romania is sometimes a pain , mostly conisisting in ( very ) slow page load time .
F	. we will be using again in the future and would recommend them to anyone .
F	i had to get replacement balloons on sunday morning for my son '_s party which was quite stressing and even then the helium of course wasn_'_t enough to fill all the balloons i needed for each child .
M	if you request tesco bank to collect a payment , confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request .
F	bought many things from ebay great to deal with would recommend this site to all
F	what a rip_off this company are .
F	was really simple to use .
M	very poor customer service and after many emails received refund a month later with no explanation of the problem .
M	***_update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
M	controls - left
F	would recommend
F	overall , nice coffee , great ideas , but the new design still needs ' tweaking ' before i '_ll purchase any more .
M	so i have to been more hands - on when making coffee .
F	so specials sales ( not ) just refund my £_00 . 00 .
F	( no discount for me !)
M	i then ordered the scooter and was asked when i would like it delivered .
F	on arrival we were given a fiat_000 !!
M	!
M	avoid_avoid_avoid .
F	thanks !
M	this was only ok .
M	if you want one of the best products at a reasonable rate , and full after sales support , then do yourself a favor , look no further !!!!!!
F	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
M	car was stuck in garage with a failed battery .
F	ordered 00 pygmy bulbs but was sent two different brands - they are not identical shape or colour and yet they all go onto a large 00 bulb light_fitting .
F	flowers arrived late at night , just left on the door_step even_though the house was occupied at the time and i did request them to be left with a neighbour in case no was home .
M	they then contacted us to tell us the supplier had made a mistake with shipping and the items would be delivered by the 0rd of april .
M	the shed base was good and did the job .
F	they initially offered me £_00 for my ipod .
M	no where near it !!!
M	what a stupid way to do_business .
F	awful alertpay
F	the flowers are always a long_lasting quality and well_packed .
F	flowers left in conservatory my mother only found them on her way out of the house .
M	i think this website is an excellent idea , i use it often to book train_journeys from london across_europe .
M	it will benefit from some careful sanding .
F	great price and great service .
F	i recently ordered a seat_belt with you for my kia carens .
F	these people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
M	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong_cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough_handling by couriers .
F	i '_ll be buying some more for sure , as i don_'_t always get a chance to get out of the office at lunch_time so to have a store cupboard of now yummy back ups is great as you can combine most with the packet rice to make a proper meal out of it .
F	the apartment was in a great position .
F	we purchased a display_unit and nest of tables .
M	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don_'_t leave a card when attempting delivery , it '_s like they expect us to be mind readers !
M	i don_'_t know what kind of customers reidys usually deal with , but i expect the benefit of the doubt at_least until they '_ve examined it !
M	fairly cheap ?
F	shocked !!
M	i drove from long eaton to optical_express shop in derby and after five_minutes of filling forms they told that there is no sugical procedures to correct my vision but i obviously need glasses ( how sly are these_people ).
M	whilst writing this update i have recieved an email from superfi stating that my order has joined the que for picking , the first email in relation to this purchase & have a guess_what . it didnt go into my spam_folder either !!
M	however the final product received is great so all '_s well that ends well
F	i then_proceeded to buy this car ; it stated no accidents and hp checked clear !
M	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
F	would have preferred to call customer service rather_than having to use email to correspond .
M	i purchased 0 sticks of 0gb_memory to upgrade my desktop_pc , very easy to order and very quick delivery , but on upgrading my pc on first boot up my pc totally froze and locked up .
M	and they will probably delete my account after_reading my review
M	we were charged 00_euros for this .
F	i will use them again .
F	trustpilot may also want to get my name correct , it '_s julia .
F	i tried over a period of 0 or 0_days to be able to book the ticket .
M	if they had sent the rest of the order all would be fine but withholding the order to wait for one part made me go else whare for my goods
M	was a bit_apprehensive_about using an online tyre service but i shouldn_'_t have worried .
M	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
F	when she realised i am really angry she said she will transfer me to another department but i need to answer several security questions again !
F	i did order something and as such i have a right to review your service .
F	i would definitely buy from them again !
F	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
F	i bought a solar_light watering_can decorated with flowers ; a lovely present for a friend .
M	had to contact the guy via the exit_barrier . who asked for my booking_reference . just as well i had hung on to it or it was £_000 or no car . my be a problem that needs to get sorted .
M	for example , there was no queue in the restaurant , so we went for some food .
F	but the tracking was great - told me within the hour when it was arriving and allowed me to have the option to leave with a neighbour .
F	i had filled that in on every attempt .
F	as an octogenarian who is not very computer_literate even i found it easy to follow .
M	their range of products is vast , including many lines not available off - the - shelf in the main trade warehouses . in all the orders i have placed so_far i have not experienced the usual ' out - of - stock ' issues i get elsewhere , delivery has_been fast and reasonably_priced .
M	i book a hostel with them , went to the property , paid cash , and everything_went well .
F	easy to order and book date for fitter to call .
M	overall a very bad customer experience .
M	the following_tuesday it finally arrived , having missed the birthday and had to phone up a number of times chasing this .
F	prompt delivery and excellent after sales service .
M	i used the postage - paid return bag and got a refund following_day with no_quibble .
F	most of the flat packed furniture ihave ever purchased has had to be sent back and replacement ordered because vital parts are missing & my one of my few electrical purchases had to be sent back and reordered because it didnt work !
M	!
M	meh , may as well , i thought .
F	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
M	i followed the automated_system for collection .
F	delivery is always quick , and i get regular email to track the progress of dispatch and delivery , and usually 00_hours warning of when the delivery is coming .
F	top_class to deal with fast orders no_messing .
M	the following_day i received an email_saying the items would be a few weeks until they were in stock .
F	the site was reconmended to me by my work collegue , who has_been using natures_best for years , so i thought i '_d give them a go .
F	not reccomended !
M	what i can advise is to be very wary of their quoted prices in currencies other than gbp .
F	ordering online was very straight - forward and delivery very prompt .
M	this is the first time i have used your service .
M	yes the prices at 0game are sometimes extremely competitive however i have received none uk release games which are then not able to be traded in .
M	the state field is case sensitive .
M	when i confronted it about this she refused to answer and totally_ignored my continued messages .
M	had to call customer_services twice to find where my order was .
F	they also did not fit the machine properly they had to be forced in .
M	was told to change my order in the basket even_though it was not posible as i did try .
F	new one arriving wed 0 november really hope its not dragged out lorry again as sleeping on the floor isn_'_t that great .
M	well_done to a quick and reliable seller
F	communication was fantastic .
F	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don_'_t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
F	they refused and so i asked for a full_refund .
M	chased up customer service on the 0th_july and told i would have it monday ( 00th ) as it had been on back order .
F	a mistake we will not repeat elsewhere and most certainly never again with ofl .
F	i have only had lens replacement in the right eye at present as the aberrations / blurring were quite alarming in the beginning and at week 00 has settled to some degree .
M	many_thanks to all the team at nationwide .
M	i have used the services of hello_canvas several_times and been very happy with the results .
F	however my experience on my return to the uk was quite different - i was left waiting at the airport as the driver was half an_hour late to arrive , and once he had arrived he did not even apologise for the delay nor did he offer to help me to the car with my luggage .
F	no_problems with the mug - it was wrapped in a ' jiffy ' bag and well_protected .
F	but i they dont mention the fact its shipped from the usa !
M	definitely use for future requirements .
F	communication was excellent , they did all the hard_work .
M	poor !!
F	had i know the item was not in stock i would not have put the order in .
M	layout and feature overhauls aren_'_t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn_'_t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
M	in - store - £_00 . 00 . which leads me onto the prices themselves .
F	dead simple to order and good quality result .
M	the will investigate and they will get back to me !!
F	not cheap !
F	it has ben 0_weeks i haven_'_t received my item .
M	i can '_t vouch for taste because i got them unflavoured but they work great in the recipes i '_m using them for .
F	this system is fiddly , only a few local restaurants take it and it has very restrictive conditions .
M	did just as promised .
M	as its not held in stock by bestheating , i have to send in photos and wait for the supplier / manufacturer to come_back for a replacement part .
M	have used them over the last 0 years and any_problems have been sorted_out quickly , usually by a pleasant lady somewhere in london . but now when things go_wrong , you need to speak with an agent somewhere in asia who can speak_english , but can '_t understand it , and just tells you to wait for 00 days for a further reply .
M	if the phone is engaged when you ring their support line they ring you back .
M	conclusion_:
F	0 had scags and 0 were not finished off properly .
M	ordered them , they arrived within_00hours and was kept_informed_throughout the process by emails .
F	a great product but no instructions , invoice or return details if the product was faulty or not suitable was enclosed with the product , so very poor customer service .
F	they demand returns within 0_days for online sales . could be a breach of distance_selling regulations .
M	oak_doors had no grasp on the delivery , it was sent to the invoice_address and not the delivery address .
M	joke .
F	also had to pay for delivery and return even_though i wished to order a replacement which again i will have to pay for .
F	!
M	all a - ok .
M	good way to get_rid of a customer too .
F	the parcel arrived the next_day , even_though it was during the peak christmas delivery period .
M	zilch .
M	will_definitely shop again !
M	reality is this product is of such quality it should never_fail in normal use - everything it ' engineered ' & fits together perfectly .
F	hatched is one of the least expensive estate_agents , but their service is limited .
M	i decided to look around and found mr . memory and behold - a full upgrade to 00gb for £_00 . 00 ( inc . delivery ).
M	magic 0 - 0 day delivery was next_day .
F	i now know rs where to get the tights i need .
F	i was very impressed
M	then wait for your main course .
M	the orders now seen to take a week or just over .
F	will never shop_here again .
F	and the large calendar i ordered had the imprint of the smaller calendar '_s metal binding on the first couple of pages due to there being no protective_packaging round the smaller one .
F	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
M	which we will never use and a large bottle of capsules which we do not use or want .
F	not happy , will find other company to use
M	despite_being in ni , the delivery to england was very quick which i wasn_'_t expecting .
F	but i must_say that the delivery wasn_'_t great .
M	thanks .
F	i am sure that like other things i have bought from you they will do what they are made
M	the site is easily_navigated and product is of a good quality .
M	hi mattress was delivered within_0days very promt .
F	since then we have been unable to submit our electricity readings and have had to send them through via the ' contact us ' facility .
F	i ordered my item paid for it and received confirmation emails to reflect this , i also received an_email to say the order had been dispatched .
F	i would definitely use this company again .
F	my grandchildren have just taken delivery of their new cornilleau_table_tennis_table .
M	strangely , though , another email arrived the very next_morning saying they had arrived and a cheque was on its way .
M	( not holding my breath )
F	this guy then told me i wasn_'_t authorised to do anything , could my husband phone back .
F	i was still a little humm ahhh about it but i really wanted the game so i went with it .
F	it '_s not the cheapest for everything but i '_ll certainly look there first for anything i want to buy .
F	prompt receipt of insurance certificate and associated documents :)
F	i got this went to book my seats and guess_what you can '_t do it .
F	would defiantly use again and recommend
M	good quality used parts that can be_relied_upon .
M	accepted my order for nearly_£_000 of perfume .
F	adam at my local printing . com office is very helpful and lovely !
M	> placing into a vase ( not easy with only one functioning arm ).
F	other rooms were small with tables and chairs next to the pool or with terraces walked through by other guests .
M	as a result this cost us more to send it to the right place .
F	alway fine but needs better picture quality
M	the kit we ordered did arrive quickly , well_packaged and is as we hoped .
F	i contacted customer service about a problem and the response was unsatisfactory .
F	also v competitive_pricing .
M	not only was my order dealt_with quickly the inkjet_cartridges were also packed in a sensible box that fitted through the letter_box .
M	will not use website again .
F	i was told that i cannot get my deposit back so i stuck to it but i really am not happy with all experience .
M	positives for slr_hut are good prices and a telephone_call to make_sure you are genuine .
M	i would have thought because i had been inconvenienced an offer of goodwill would be forthcoming .
M	as they were varifocals , i put this down to the fact that you really do need to go to a high_street_optician , to get an accurate fitting .
M	bought a consumer_unit fully_loaded and our electrician thought it was excellent quality and value for money
F	as a result the pictures in the calendar look a bit grainy .
M	thanks
F	grunden til at nelly får tre stjerner , er den gratis og hurtige levering_og at deres produkter i knap halvdelen af tilfældene lever op_til forventningerne .
M	everyone should use this company .
M	my order was accepted & payment made on the basis of next_day delivery , therefore a contract is in place & the company is required to deliver in line with that which was agreed , the company failed to do so and is therefore in clear breach of contract , and in my view should have made amends swiftly & openly .
M	i am still assessing printerinks .
M	the flowers were just left on the path and could have been removed by anyone passing .
F	brandalley took my money immediately despite my order not being ' ready for at_least 0_days .
M	all in all a quick and easy way to buy good quality glass ware .
M	i received this survey yesterday the 0th of january which prompted me to call uk_tool_centre to ask where my goods were .
M	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
M	oh , and it isn_'_t previewed beforehand and can '_t be edited / deleted !
F	thank_you
F	finally i managed to make the booking .
F	despite customer_services telling_me that a bottle of conditioner would be sent to me ( and to keep the body_wash , which was a nice_touch ), nothing '_s been received .
F	i am still_waiting for my order but have been advised to wait 00 days .
F	supplier resent and paid next_day deliver .
F	ordered a northface top , received a northface top but a different style .
F	good value for money .
F	in fact the last pair i bought , i missed the 0pm_deadline for next_day delivery , but they were still delivered only 0 day later !
F	the same day i received a call from the store where the delivery originated from ( calcot ), an_apology for the apalling behaviour of their driver and an assurance that the driver would be dealt_with !
F	delivery man said you can note delivery note that item was damaged if you want to .
M	the protein is also great quality .
M	so what i ' d thought would be a quick tyre replacement job turned into a saga .
M	useless pieces of paper i now have to deal with thanks for nothing .
M	follow on facebook and twitter and you often gets deals from there too . ones that only last for 00_hours or so . well_worth it .
M	was going to delete this review and write it again on the trust_pilot link on wiggles website but wiggle have hidden the link and i couldn_'_t proceed .
F	also requested a call back .
F	perfect_fit no_hassle delivery .
M	the service was excellent to .
M	the other one was realy good though
F	item finally reached derby apparently on 0th_april when it was apparently put out for delivery .
M	not easy to clearly see what the cover is .
M	can you confirm if you received the item or not .
F	few_days after purchasing , the items went on a offer + 00_%_discount ( from £_000 to 000 ), wish i had waited a little_bit longer .
F	brilliant service .
M	still book came quickly looks great and happy to recommend the product .
F	the flowers i ordered arrived when they were supposed too and were also very fresh however i could not have been more disappointed .
M	all was in order and prompt .
M	helen couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
M	the advertised flowers showed no_resemblance to those supplied and i feel that my experience with serenata_flowers is close to false pretences or at_least one of misrepresentation .
F	i have bought items from this site and the quality , fit and availablity leave a lot to be desired .
F	there '_s so much choice on the site it took me ages to pick one but it wasn_'_t long at all before it was delierved .
F	wish there was an easy option .
F	further call today , 0_days before delivery due , still reflecting original wrong order .
M	but amy was fantastic and i received my banner 0 days ago ( about 0 days from ordering ) and it exceeded my expectations with the quality of printing and construction .
F	they made a stressful journe , y due to torrential_rain , even more stressful when we arrived at the airport to leave the car , we waited 00_minutes for anyone to collect the car .
M	fast and efficient
M	we were left with a full garage of packaging which i had to take to the dump .
F	!
F	ordered a precsription medicine for first time .
M	which they sent a few_days lateall this over a weekend meaning unable to put up shelves for 0 days !
M	even after a protracted trial it was impossible to read using these glasses .
F	still not sure if it has worked though .
F	was hoping to order some more but wouldn_'_t as the flickering could drive you mad .
M	i was very impressed by the very prompt response and resolution to the problem , which was totally out with the companies control as the damage was caused in transit .
F	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking_down .
M	they even give you a link that is constantly_updating to show you where the driver is and how many drops away from you he is , this means you can be getting on with other things rather_than being camped out by the door waiting for your delivery .
F	zoomfishgadgets dealt very efficiently with my transaction .
F	i '_m so happy with the designer radiators i bought from geyser .
F	no reply to emails .
M	not the cheapest but then the do guarantee to match prices of the competition .
M	searched for a good price on a akg radio mike i wanted to match with my existing one .
F	firstly , i purchased my air - walker directly from the physio_room - it was reduced to £_00 . 00 plus £ 0 postage , so i ordered it thinking i was saving myself a few_quid .
M	of course , had i been in the shop , they ' d not have done that since i would have noticed .
M	the company haven_'_t even bothered replying to me or answering there phone , astonishingly poor customer service .
M	and she slammed the phone down again .
F	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
M	i '_ve spent over an_hour working out what they have done wrong , and what needs to be fixed .
F	great job - everyone happy :-)
F	the flights and connections the car_hire and kept it all within a budget we were happy with .
M	my plead to you is !!!
F	disappointed with this as my phone was in immaculate_condition and i had followed the instructions word for word .
M	when they came i got a detailed_explanation involving adidas and the olympics .
M	the best price i found on net and said that the washer_dryer was in stock and would be delivered a few_days_later .
F	most of this is lies as he is a director , was involved as i dealt_with him and he can_afford to start up 0 new companies , but not reimburse his customers .
M	easy to deal with quick smart delivery great communication will use time after time
M	they also have a good range of accessories such as chargers .
F	they are actually making me ill with all this , in fact just sitting here typing thisiis making my blood boil !
F	i use them for my live food and have done for ages now .
M	i was reluctant to give the garment any stars for i '_ve not had the chance to wear it .
M	ordered friday , expected monday , was not dispatched until monday
M	poor control and integrity of ordering on website can '_t be trusted . avoid !
M	i ordered a pair of mountain_equipment pants which arrived the next_day .
F	not any of the money i have paid on this so called debt !
F	there was no box for it or paperwork like i have had with other genuine batteries .
M	will try them again though , as they did get back to me quickly with an explanation , refund and an_apology .
M	definitely use again .
M	the ordering and delivery service was good as always , but the quality of the handles was not as good as expected for the price .
M	helpful information through our .
F	then to find the box the trainers had come in was damaged , ( an_avid trainer collector always keeps the boxes ) so this was a disappointment .
M	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
M	asked later in the conversation , if i send the shorts next_day delivery , arrive with them on wednesday , would they confirm the correct shorts will be sent wednesday using next_day .
F	strengths
F	excellent swift service .
M	extra bank charges for the charge + the credit on the difference ( two_weeks post return ) don_'_t leave the best taste in the mouth .
M	there appears to be a reluctance to help once the money has changed hands .
M	but i gave them the details of where it was !!!!
M	!
F	we certainly live there so , i don_'_t know if the driver had a bad dream the night before and was still in it .
F	i ordered the sanderson quilt throw from bedeck as i had already bought the rest of the bedding_set from house of fraser sale but they had no throws left .
F	i decided to revive them by sending them to reglazemyglasses , using the £_00 discount_code on moneysavingexpert . com .
M	the service was excellent and would certainly recommend !
M	would do it again .
F	the food is of very good quality ( apart_from one bad packet of peanuts ) and the prices are very competitive .
M	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
F	great item and price .
F	really pleased - great blind and so reasonable and so quick - thanks
M	quick transaction and simple instructions !
F	we had worked with groupon on and off for 0 years and to start with even_though we were paying a lot for the advertising we got quite good expose so we just ignored the cost but as time has_gone on , the service they provide has got worst we have had to wait weeks to get paid and this after they have had the money from our clients weeks if not months before hand , no business provides a service and then should have to wait weeks to get paid and then only after threatening legal_action do we get paid .
M	nearly christmas .
F	compared to other clinics such as skin where you get such thorough and almost ott care throughout i actually laughed about my experience at nu cosmetics with my husband , in and out in 0 minutes flat !
M	the reglaze services i received recently plus membership discount are unparalleled .
M	it is rather frustrating when this happens and wastes time .
M	very impressed .
F	love , love this product
M	if you want a cheap flight do use travelup but do not use there link to a visa website .
F	i ordered 0 pairs of fit_flops in the sale which were extremely good value for money .
M	so decided to try the pest stop humane trip trap .
F	the ordering was straight_forward .
M	very good on delivery but found 0 monkeys had slight splits and would not blow up all the rest flamingos , palm trees was very good
F	btw , all the items i sent them were good resalable condition a pity they still operate and that nothing can be done except to warn_others not to make the same mistake us reviewers have .
M	fast good and cheap , most unusual in today '_s world .
M	this is the first time i have ordered from the uk_tool_centre and i was very impressed with their easy to order system on line and delivery time .
F	their procedure takes 0 - 0_weeks .
F	the what is meant to be an under bust corset has no structure so when you pull the ribbon it just bunches up and the bottom curls up so the dressmaker is fixing the for me too .
M	?
F	i paid for next_day delivery , which was bang_on time , and the service very efficient the new computer battery was easily fitted and was a reasonable_price .
F	when i informed him that i '_d called the previous day and been promised a delivery the day before , he went to " check " and all of a sudden my pc was actually complete with a motherboard and he '_d made a mistake !
F	i had never_heard of via go go before .
F	the payment flipped me from paypal to another system and my computer gave up and crashed .
M	as i needed the item for my forthcoming holiday , i contacted the seller who arranged for the item to be fast - tracked and delivered to be within 00_hours .
M	ordered some dog_food at a good price on the sunday .
F	mazuma_mobile was very quick , no_complaints :)
M	bit too much input left me confused and studio colour palet froze on rear design got red signs where blue was required .
M	great service , glad i stumbled_across these sunglass_shop having looked up what i wanted on the official ray_ban site .
F	not cheap , but the best price we could find on the internet .
M	i was dissapointed about this and had to spend time transferring the contents to another box i had which had almost run out .
F	im still_waiting for my travel documents to be posted .
F	i needed them next_day for my hols , and so paid the extra for next_day special delivery and they were with me the next_morning .
F	i then ordered on line , delivery was very prompt but one item was missing .
M	thus one complete day wasted by client waiting in vain .
F	thank_you !
M	a note of caution then .
F	thank_you
F	i was unfortunate to have had a puncture .
M	explain_why your system took the order & didnt tell me that you were out of stock ?
F	0 .
M	it is not i repeat not worth the effort of putting the books on for trade and be let_down .
F	did not get confirmation when ordering the first time so therefore ordered again , however , ended_up with 0 orders .
M	one detractor is the shipping cost but when you use the thanks0 coupon_code it basically discounts the shipping to what you might pay with other_sites .
M	the car itself was very good and i have no_complaints , neither do i of the staff who issued the car , once i had reached the front of the queue .
M	i inserted a video and the film strip graphic was added to the page , but the mock perforations of the film strip allow the surrounding photos to show through which looks messy .
M	we do not have much control over the funds that are release from the escrow .
F	i was impressed at the showroom , however now that i have had a few_weeks to really look at the furniture i notice that one of the doors on the sideboard is wonky and the dining_table has a very light streak along the centre .
F	i was supposed to get £_00 cashback after 0_months and went to the shop , as its just round the corner from where i live , i took the bill requested and they processed it for me .
M	i order all of my equipment from these_guys .
F	i '_ve_used serenata a lot and never had any_problems but on this occasion i have been very let_down .
F	woolovers tell me that this is why it was a ' second ' but that '_s not what the website says !
M	part laziness . part stupidity - don_'_t be the same and do yourself a favour - sign up !
M	i '_ve no_complaints .
M	will defanatly be using them again
M	told they would be received by such and such a date then heard_nothing .
F	excellent service .
F	unfortunatly the person delivering my goodies , rude , unpleasant and generally not helpful .
M	( they seem very keen to send an ' invoice ' when we wanted all the details .)
F	very helpful and efficient .
M	they upped the price just as i left the store .
F	surely zen_bedrooms realise that the many negative_comments about their delivery system reflects very badly on them ?
M	but having said all that the car was great and we would probably use you again .
M	i am caring for a friend with a tumour .
M	the products i purchased were really good and i will use these again .
M	i '_ve_used mazuma several_times .
M	however , the delivery times are poor .
M	if you order anything online from their website i cannot_fault them .
F	to ring and ask a few questions .
F	to be told it was with ups .
M	we ordered this item late on boxing_day and it arrived first post on 00th_december .
F	southbank
M	multitrip wasn_'_t on which ?
M	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won_'_t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
F	everyone needs a wowcher !!!!
F	i thought this would be a great way to dispose of my old_mobile phone in an environmentally_friendly way , whilst getting some cash_back to boot .
F	there are basically no detailed_instructions on how to safely fill the cart .
M	can '_t say more .
M	you have not responded to any of my emails !!!!
M	its easy but its costs more than going your self i always get less_than when i go and do it myself you cant look for the deals either !
F	item received well in time .
F	i ordered late on saturday ( about 0pm ) and needed the outfit quickly , it was shipped that day and arrived on the next working day . amazing , outfit was good quality and perfect for what we needed .
M	in addition , you do not allow the user to chose the currency he / she wants to be billed in .
M	we had delivery when you said we would with out any chasing
M	i can_honestly_say , everytime i receive rave_reviews on the quality of the flowers , how long some last and presentation is always top_drawer .
F	we were a group of 0 adults and 0 young_children in london for the weekend on a family celebration .
F	as i have no_intention of sitting on the phone for ages to clear this matter up again , costing me more money and time please either contact me on my home line ( tel num removed ) or by return e_- mail .
M	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
F	i was very impressed with the friendly and efficient service when i placed my order , even more impressed with the prompt delivery and well_packaged item .
F	i haven_'_t detailed all our issues on here because it '_s just more of the same as in previous posts .
M	packed quite well but ripped where slight bulge in cardboard where bag of components were - no damage though .
M	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
F	customer service stated that they did not know how this could_possibly happen as the flowers had to be checked five times before arriving at destination .
M	the service is first_rate with super_fast , reliable delivery , products are excellent , as_described and also reasonably_priced compared to a lot of other_outlets i '_ve looked at , really refreshing to find a company such as this and i would have no_reservations_whatsoever about recommending them to anyone .
M	!
F	as they said it isn_’_t their responsibility !
F	easy website to follow .
F	all done and dusted in 0_days u can '_t get quicker_than that .
M	director failed to respond to my letter with my given timescale of 0_weeks .
M	pleasure
M	!
F	rude off hand , failed the m . o . t on the head light which needed a small adjustment to the beam on their machines reading , couldn_'_t do it then ( citreon are doing it for free but i have to pay again ) unhelpful wanted me to leave it for some more time with them they are based in the middle of an industrial_estate and i had my 00 year_old daughter with me , he just shrugged when i pointed this out .
M	thank_you keep_up the excellent work .
F	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
F	the tablets have made my pet sick .
M	rebooking is easy if needs be .
F	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
M	i was a little_sceptical at first of online companies , but this service on rentalcar . com turned_out to be very easy , accurate and much_cheaper .
M	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .
F	quidco have never had a problem paying up , their rates maybe less . but you actually see cash .
M	simon clarke
M	good value and don_'_t take the p ** s with the delivery charge like many do - my preferred_supplier for all metals because if the good fast fast service and sensible attitude to delivery
M	i was a little_nervous making a purchase from a company outside the us .
F	), with all such contact ignored .
M	the quality is superb considering that the camera was very old and the film taken about 00 years_ago .
F	will be back .
M	very slow to respond to my queries about their telephone charges ie over 0_weeks and as it turned_out there are mistakes on the pricing page on the zen site and this is still not resolved !!
M	unable to contact lakeland on sat morning .
F	usually your delivery is excellent but on this occasion it has not been , so i will have to consider getting my supplies from someone_who employs a better courier service .
F	i '_ve_used animed several_times and have always been really impressed with how quickly i have received my items on the free delivery option .
M	very fast and cheap delivery .
M	they were polite , efficient and my order was with me quicker_than they said it would be .
M	quick pricing , quick collection , quick confirmation of trade and then payment .
M	i would still recommend spending the full 00_mins allotted to you upon delivery to ensure the items are as you would want .
M	it had been quite a long time but i was happy with the response .
M	all in all an unpleasant_experience and a mistake i will not make again
M	a really slick process .
M	we are thrilled with them .
M	but if picking_up a car having arrived in malaga by other means , or earlier , locating the collection_point is not obvious .
M	thanks
M	polite and friendly .
M	could not fault the process at all .
F	never buy from them again .
M	today we asked to talk to a manager and jodie tried every thing under the sun to stop us doing this , she finally relented and told my wife she would get a call in forty_eight_hours , this is disgusting service from one of the big_boys who do not give a hoot about their customers , pity we could not all withhold payment as a protest , they would soon get the message , people have the power to make or break a company , if i knew how and was forty_years younger i would do this .
M	when i said that had i put an exact description that they would have had less knowledge than my previous description i got a very rude email from someone there who said if it happened again they would close down my account .
F	!
M	on the fourth week i followed up with telephone_call to be told that it was being shipped the next_day .
M	it '_s as easy as putting ya socks on .
M	having to walk 0 . 0 miles three_days_later to post_office , far from ideal .
F	the homepage is very nice and easy to use .
M	can '_t beat the price compared to anywhere_else .
M	not a bad_experience all in all , but they really do need to work or their correspondence .
M	not just great blinds but great customer service as well !
F	easy web_site , several emails_keeping the customer updated with progress of order , efficient service and delivery .
F	service and delivery excellent .
M	you may have won a single order but repeat_business will be lost with this attitude to customers .
M	i will not be shopping with these_people again .
M	items .
M	unfortunately the next_day delivery took 0 days .
M	very happy with range and service
M	i could go into driving hours and multi - drop rules ( assuming they don_'_t use a tachograph which would be more punitive to driving hours ).
M	no emails or any updates sent to me .
F	he suggesed ao .
M	excuse for long delays is " staff sickness ".
F	parts of my order were missing when the box was delivered , i sent an_email but had no reply as yet .
F	thank god i hadn_'_t got to bank detail stage steer_clear .
M	so once again i called the warranty shop .
M	it was easy to set_up an account with mazuma , and sending the phone bag and receiving payment into my bank_account was very straight_forward , i have used other phone_recycling_companies before and have been let_down by poor service and sneaky clauses , but mazuma was different and i would recommend them to my friends and family .
F	we chose the polished knobs and it looks great !
F	i had been looking for professional cards for ages .
F	also fast delivery and a text to let you know , when it will arrive with emails also telling you that your item is despatched and where about it is .
F	very offhanded .
F	this is such a wonderful site and it gives us all the chance to air your views of places and hotels , restaurants etc .
F	i used this company last_year and as a result i received a loyalty_discount which i decided to use this year for some christmas_presents .
F	had to apologise to me aunt for send such a crappy bunch flowers .
F	just a few_weeks after purchase i tried to grate chocolate , but the motor made a loud noise , the bowl cracked and the lid flew off , i returned the item together with a detailed_explanation of what had happened and asked for a refund as i did not think that the quality was sturdy enough to perform the tasks i had purchased it for .
F	the flowers i ordered from you on thursday where delivered yesterday and she said they are beautiful .
M	arrived exactly on time to change tyres on my drive with minimum of fuss . great and professional service , no mess and friendly .
F	0 . are unhelpful ,
M	).

F	the silver_lining .
M	sales knew the product from my description without a photo .
F	they weren_'_t , instead preferring to pass the buck and employ delaying_tactics .
M	it '_s the pricing thing that annoys_me .
F	other than dat lenses look good an was easy to place the order
M	their website will tell you items are in stock , then tell you they '_ve been sent , then tell you they ' re out of stock and not being sent . rubbish !
F	this isn_'_t the quality of service i expected from jessops .
M	the second i clicked the submit button on the checkout , i received my code via_email . never_experienced anything quite so fast !
F	i then tried to ring the customer service team starting from 0 : 00 .
F	received only bits and pieces of items ordered at various dates .
F	no , it didn_'_t like that - and i had to resort to the phoning a human_being , to be told that both numbers cannot be entered in the box and the mobile only should be entered .
F	would recommend to anyone , especially if you need to transfer money regularly .
M	the service on line was good too ,
F	and an excellent service from ghd :-)
F	please do not order if your in a hurry . but price of goods is really good . excellent value , excellent price .

M	then having reached our first stopover we tried to ' add another journey ' but this just didn_'_t seem to work until we opened another window and entered it as a new journey .
F	we all love the sparkles they jog our memories of our past and of happy times
F	only to discover that that bus_stop was not being serviced either !
F	with the terrible_weather over the last 0_days , i today found the cardboard package sodden & falling_apart .

M	daniel was open and honest about the mistake and even upgraded my order to special deliver as soon as the watch that i had ordered arrived with them .
F	would definitely not hold my breasts , and does not hold in anything as it just hang at the waist with a good 0 " between my tummy and the corset adjusted at the tightest at the bottom .

F	always arrive next_day - never any_problems
F	some hours_later my neighbour delivered card -
F	the only_downside was the trek from the airport - next time we '_ll take the cases on a trolley !
M	my newly fitted shower required a pump and after much research i selected a grundfos spt0 . 0b and again after more research found anchor_pumps to be the most competitive .
F	if anything_goes_wrong with the booking , it '_s almost_impossible to contact them , except to receive cit and pasdte tandc until you give up .
F	all nearly went_swimmingly , the site is easy to use and i was very happy with the final_result .
M	0 months later i receive a letter from a debt_agency advising i owe £ 0000 - called them explained i had no contract with o0 and explained what had happened with the fraud dept , it was advised they would take this up with o0 .
M	for this reason i have cancelled my policy and made a formal_complaint .
M	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
F	one suggested taking it out of the box , but the other was quick to dismiss that saying it would then be second_hand and couldn_'_t be returned .
M	ordered some christams presants off amazon on 00rd_december today the 00 / 00 / 00 and still no sign of any of the products .

F	i can '_t thank them enough for taking all the stress out of my claim .
M	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
M	by way of compensation a pair of remote_control units was received .
F	as above good service but poor quality of flowers ( ie not very fresh and overpriced ) arrangement was £_00 and the quantity of flowers in arrangement were very small ie was very small .
M	they offered more_expensive ones !!!
F	did not listen to problem , their way is right you the customer have no rights .
M	this seemed a great deal especially when looking at the prices on the website .
F	they have a big variety of everything “ birdie ”
M	their customer service support was superb
F	fortunately i was able to sort_out with my neighbour to take the delivery in .
M	any question or reservation i had was answered in an honest , frank and calming manner .
F	website easy to use .
F	i ordered the flowers before 0am and was promised same day delivery .
M	this has sadly , tarnished my experience of them .
M	they tried to deliver wednesday and left a card saying they would " try tomorrow ".
M	easy website
M	nowhere on the website does it say that .
F	quick efficient delivery .
M	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world . at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !

F	my meat box arrived on time and i received a confirmation e_- mail both before and after .
M	apart_from one being red and the other yellow , there is no difference at all between the long handled fine and the long handled style combs - not that i can see !
M	the product was in fantastic condition and arrived in record time .
M	for a genuinely nicer experience i shop at independents ( health_food stores ) or waitrose where the price is comparable and the quality and service superior .
F	have used site a few_times with no_problems .
M	assorted stock and prices but when ordered normally efficient service
F	it is purely and simply false_advertising .
F	never recycled a phone before but glad i did as it was easy and got a fair price too .
M	so with no ' apparent ' email or answering of the phone i was about to phone my bank for a chargeback .
F	first goalpost had faulty connectors and wrong number of parts .
M	i was also quite happy that i wasn_'_t forced to make an account to purchase my item .
M	in my opinion it is a very empty thank_you and left me feeling out of pocket .
F	have had more pleasant shop experiences .
M	and i will be taking my complaint much further .
F	we unpacked this item carefully and assembly was straight_forward with helpful numbering of pieces and clear_instructions .
F	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les_produits disponibles immediatement .
M	have been going to the same tyre place for 00 years - was checking typical prices online and decided i ' d give blackcircles a try .

F	i ordered two tennis rackets for my grand_children on their birthdays .

M	best online buying experience i '_ve ever had i think .
M	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
F	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over_£_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
F	even better is the prices - can '_t be_beaten .
F	the merchandise arrived in plenty of time however the carton that was pictured with the pirate galleon was not included .
F	i '_d been round a few diy_stores to find the right bracket to no_avail so emailed shower_doctor for advice and got a very speedy response .
F	also i qualified for free - postage , but didn_'_t want to risk waiting for the time , when it may have arrived , so i paid for postage and made an order after 00 am .
F	so this is the complaint i have just sent them .
F	my phone has_been stolen twice .
M	avoid this company like the plague !!!
M	i am told by amanda that , next time she will have to charge me for the courier .
M	suddenly i received notification that my item would be delivered on monday 00th_march .

F	so a month later no sim and can '_t get through on the phone because they won_'_t speak to me without me telling them my last bill amount ( not payment , bill ).
M	support technique assez médiocre comparé à ce qu ' on peut trouver rue montgallet ou auprès des constructeurs .
M	ordered a pool_table and paid it fine 0 days_later requested men to set it up when they brought it it was . nt till then i was told they could not deliver up to our area as it was to far .
M	didn_'_t greet me as he was on his phone .
M	that said , i will always check them out first because they are usually cheapest ( need to check quality sometimes though ).
M	however , i don_'_t like the delivery service .
M	thanks to all at 0dvd .
M	delays happen , and the measure if any company is what they do to put things right - kitbag always used to be my first_port of call but .
M	great service and flowers my other half was happy when i got them delivered to her she said they was nice and smelt really good so if shes happy im happy to use you again
F	there are always great tidbits of information on there , especially about hotels / b_& bs and things to do in a certain place .
F	i have found higher_nature to provide great products with a great service !
M	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
M	i believed that for that amount of money they would deliver it by hand , in the vase .
M	we will be transferring our accounts shortly .
F	would recommend to friends and family .
M	we are yet to see these flowers 0 days after the guaranteed delivery , i have had no response from their customer service team about the non - delivery , and there is actually no phone number to call to discuss how to get my money back after a failed delivery .
M	i have just had two months of being run around by talk_talk '_s customer_services .
F	i explained that if you were offering a ' like for like ' alternative , i would expect it to be like for like , and that i checked out the sizing .
F	i ordered several items for christmas_gifts and was overwhelmingly surprised by the excellent standard and quality of these products .
M	there was a premium_rate ( 00p_per_minute on 0 ) number to call for further information .

M	fast delivery very pleased with company .
F	after 0 hours , your eyes will become very dry and start to look red .
F	glasses received quickly but they are mis shapen and as i need them not really practical to return .
F	the parcel took a long time to arrive .
M	the debited my account with the agreed_amount the day they received the phone .
F	however , after my partner had explained firmly their mistake , they did manage to ' squeeze it on the van '.
M	rather annoying that i had to go to a more_expensive competitor and also pay for next_day delivery to get the additional unit in time for the job i needed them for .
F	they have completely_ignored my claim and what is worst they haven_'_t even care to remove the property - yarden sea side apartments from the system , to avoid other people to get into the same situation i was in .
F	would recomend and use again
F	fast delivery of the packaging , very fast processing of my old phone and making of the payment to my account .
M	thanks [_name_] :-)
M	i was very impressed with both the products themselves and the site .
F	when i receivedthem , one was missing and i was not believed at first that i was telling the truth .
F	it never got to the address !!
M	roll on 0000 !

M	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer service .
M	i find chaoscards an excellent site forthe display of cards and very reasonably_priced .
M	they order tyres from the wholesaler / manufacturer , and then rely_on them to arrange delivery to a third_party fitter .
F	?
M	having never_heard of the site before i was a tad anxious to purchase .
F	should have been confused . com
M	i used to buy from holland and barrett but , across their range , they are replacing a competitively - priced line with more_expensive alternatives .
F	amazing service considering i only ordered the flowers less_than 00_hours beforehand .
M	viagogo provided box seats at a very good price .
M	status : successfully authorised transaction .
M	if you use a paypal_account to do so , the system crashes . doesn_'_t inspire_confidence .
F	thank_you so so much .
F	highly_recommend this site .
F	this was while i was in the local phone shop , max was rude to the saleman and to me , telling us that it was the phone and not the network .
M	no - one should ever feel as frustrated and angry as i did walking out of that store today .
M	most of the petals had come off during_transit , which is hardly_surprising when on checking the online tracking_facility , they had been despatched from wednesbury to horndean the previous night , and were finally delivered late_afternoon on the day requested !!!
M	fast , affordable and good all_round eggs !
M	i have just left another message on their answer phone asking them to get back to me , i doubt they will but it ’_s worth a try .
M	if you want to buy flowers for someone , you '_ll be better served spending a tenner at tesco or asda than you will be buying a deluxe product from this company .
M	so all you need is some clear property details , online exposure through the popular property search websites , and a guide price .
F	im very embarrassed about the whole situation and disappointed in your company .
M	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort : d
F	said 0_weeks , it took 0 week to get it delivered and after delivery driver left after checking product codes and name on boxes , open boxes and despite all boxes saying white , the units are a gare - ish blue .
M	had to go_elsewhere .
F	superdry were really quick to deliver and emailed me to keep in touch with my order .
F	they didnt reply to that email within their 0 day time_scale .
M	i chased again and found that actually they couldn_'_t deliver and that they ' d be offering me a refund .
M	the good news is that when i did get to talk to someone they refunded all the extra_insurance i had paid and added 0 %.
M	while not expensive , but definitely higher priced for same make and model than on other_websites , especially those from the us .
F	have since gone with an_alternative provider which has_been excellent .
M	seriously ?
M	i ordered 0 identical bouquets , one was ok the other was half the size of the first !!!!!!!!!!
M	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering_around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily_identifiable .
M	business
M	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
F	when you order something online you expect the picture you see to be what you get the bunch that was received looks nothing like it hardly_any flowers all scrunched_up
M	goods dispatched promptly .
M	very poor . i `_ll take my business elsewhere !
F	the logo i thought would be embroided just like previous t - shirts we have ordered however they were printed on .
F	i can '_t comment on the service until i get feedback from the recipient .
M	your response here quite_frankly is utter nonsense and a poor attempt of trying to defend a 0_star report that you more than deserve .
F	i emailed on christmas day and to my surprise , got a reply within a matter of hours .
F	i topped_up £_00 .£ 0 . 00 off . i checked my meter . it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
M	i was very , very impressed with the packing .
M	if you ( like at my company ) did not agree with the terms of a supplier then you can either get them to change the way they operate or you could drop them as a supplier , from this i conclude that you have sat down with them at formal meetings and agreed all charges and ways of working , you have therefore agreed to these scams .
F	i wish i had sent it back as it '_s cost us quite a lot of money buying new timber and windows to replace some of the worst effected .
M	however , i had been sent a pair of vehicle dolleys by mistake .
F	i registered my phone on the saturday , the envelope had arrived by tuesday , i posted my phone off on the wednesday and the money was in my bank on the thursday .
M	yes , you will have todo it .
F	i absolutely love my latest canvas .
M	oliver m .
M	other times just throw over fence .
M	bad for selling because of ebay rules which are highly stacked against you , you need a lot of luck with your buyers as i can tell you that all of the idiots in the world also go to ebay just to mess things up and because that you do need a lot of luck not to be dealing_with one of them and if you do you cannot rely_on ebay to help you out .
F	i cannot_fault it .
M	next_day delivery and great items at great prices !
M	in addition i had to contact them during the ordering_process as i had spent over £_00 and been charged for delivery .
F	i booked this service and arranged collection between_0am and 0pm no one turned_up to collect my parcel .
M	they tried to find me suitable_alternative tyres from national , but none in stock .
F	having looked around for quite a while for a small set of lights that were reasonably_priced , i eventually found some on festive_lights .
F	my request was refused .
F	i booked for my tyres to be done on a specific day that was said to be available , a day i had taken off work to do so , after lots of messing_about and unreturned phone_calls i was told that my tyres hadn_'_t arrived , wasted my time as i had to arrange another day to have them done !
F	what an embarrassment
F	i contacted serenata with a complaint and got an_automated_response saying it had been passed to customer service .
M	booked a hotel now .
F	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
M	the delivery was very fast .
F	still pursuing trying to change an order made on 0th_march , contacted same day 0 times to try and change .
F	have used in the past and will_continue to do so all the time they maintain their high_level of customer service .
M	there should be a system in place where i can get them back if they ' re not going to buy them .
M	i don_'_t expect the best customer service from a website that '_s pushing products like these_folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
F	we have a driveway which had two cars on and a side way leading to the garden , it would have been better if he driver was to lazy to knock to have placed the flowers in a safer place to prevent them being on display on the front step for any one to take a liking and pinch them .
F	i am now on email number 0 and 0 , same crappy generic_response and lets just say i wont_be holding my breath .
F	my only_gripe was that there is a small pen mark ( 0cm long in black , could be a dressmaker '_s mark ?)
F	b . comples and vit . c .
F	the quality of the flowers was good though
F	i just couldn_'_t eat them .
F	i had to demand a refund was soo not happy .
M	despite request by mail no one answered .
F	wouldn_'_t use company again .
F	not really got time to do this so would prefer some notification to save making a second purchase .
M	would be back in no time .
F	the company i bought the item from have now given me a discount as good customer service .
F	surely , you could find a better way to package this so it doesn_'_t look like i '_ve bought it off a market_stall ?
F	i found golfgarb when trying to find smart white shorts for a client .
M	few_days after the had charged the money on my credit_card .
F	great quality and value and the service was outstanding .
M	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
M	i live in portugal and had a problem with my keyboard , i flew it back to them and they got me a new one dispatched straight to my uk address on christmas_eve ( amazing ) and ready in time for gigs over the new year !
M	i would recommend this online shop to anyone and everyone and i have no doubt i will be using them again - i am always looking for new samples and vst collections in my work as a music producer and composer .
M	put my order in and got it the next_day .
M	item collected 00th due del 00th paid for texts none arrived left in dark don_'_t know if item on way or delivered etc
M	fast , reliable and honest
F	but
F	doreen
F	all i can say is ; poor quality , poor customer service and therefore overpriced .
M	probabally the worst web_site for ordering goods
F	asked for a refund , but was still made to pay for postage and packaging although company sent wrong part .
F	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
F	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn_'_t expect such shoddy service , i think it '_s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people '_s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
M	this courier was great .
F	good job that we are in a good neighbourhood !.
F	no attention to detail , many items missed .
F	the chap i spoke to was very efficient and answered all of my questions .
F	no further update received .
F	the worst aftercare i have ever had no help what so ever happy to sell the phone and as soon as it sold they don_'_t want to know never ever will i go in the shop again
F	purchased a product in the wrong_size , rang to change and was advised that it would cost £ 0 . 00 to deliver replacement goods but also would need to pay for a courier to return the incorrect items back to the supplier .
F	the glasses were not polished , and the box and glasses were dusty - i would have expected £_000 sunglasses which still cost me over_£_000 in the sales to be sent to me in better condition .
M	sent email on saturday and got no reply until tuesday pm only to be told that fri would be next available delivery day .
M	£ 0 . 00 .
F	plus the website was quite easy to use , they have a great range of wigs !
M	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook '_s case i think that user opposition is justified .
F	and now eflorist have had the cheek to say they have replied .
F	i havent bothered , because i dont have time .
F	i must add that the is not the first time that royal_mail take shortcuts on their parcel delivery !
F	fast delivery and good service
M	shame about 0 person in customer service who thinks he is bigger than the customer !
M	was informed when delivery would be and it did come within the 0 hour time_slot , although i did not receive a 00 minute notice call as informed .
F	will unfortunately make me reconsider using preciouslittleone again as this service is unacceptable .
M	would recommend this shop to anyone great clothes and service superb
F	will
F	need to be careful not too put too high powered bulbs in , i have 00w x 0 and could probably do with going down to 00w or evern 00w .
M	i bought a ' pro ' cycle stand - after_trawling numerous sites i found the price to be the cheapest on cyclestore , with delivery no extra_charge as well !
M	online live support un maned
M	i spend more then 00 in on taxi to finde this plase !!
M	i didn_'_t think you could get this much power and performance from a re - chargeable vacuum_cleaner .
F	knowmalaria . com site is easy to navigate and you get hassle_free assessment and choices and delivery next_day .
F	business_cards look expensive , unique really stand_out from the competition , fun
M	ordered friday and delivered monday .
M	thanks escapade but i think we will have to find another supplier in future we have lost so much time with ordering , returning , re - ordering its been a real_pain .
F	it is nice to know that good customer service is still out there .
M	over a week_later , was e_- mailed to say it was out of stock , order had been cancelled and card refunded .
F	now all of this was happening in the lead up to & immediately following christmas .
M	more than three_days of trying !
F	had a delivery of edging blocks as they were out of stock in b_& q .
F	thanks guys .
F	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour .
M	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
F	the manufacturers said it was not faulty as it worked on their system ( of course ) victoria_plumbing refused a refund as the item was " not faulty " and had been used and slightly marked whilst attaching .
F	i '_m_sure my other half will enjoy this pistol of rum , the only_thing i was disappointed about was that it didn_'_t come in a box , which it was pictured with !
F	i received confirmation of dispatch from mr pets which implies all of the order is being sent together which it wasn_'_t .
M	saying it pushes the payment to the bank - so what ?
M	nothing was forthcoming .
M	i will not be buying from you again
F	being honest hurts no one .
F	i can '_t wait to change them over at renewal !!
F	i ordered my invitations through thie website and was happy when they arrived - this was short lived as the envelopes were missing from the order .
F	thanks
M	full_marks to danielle rees , who guided & helped in every way possible .
F	000 fra miniinthebox - og_de kom , dog efter længere tid end forventet .
M	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone_call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
F	not only that , but the box '_s were in very bad condition with wood showing through .
F	this would usually not be a problem but felt it was a little inconsiderate as they were for a funeral and there was a reason for the date specified .
M	to post a dvd , or cd u . s . a . royal_mail charge £ 0 . 00 . while amazon give you £ 0 . 00 pence for postage
M	decided not to go with bg , my old boiler works_perfectly fine so just having hive fitted so i have better control of the boiler .
F	but as i say , my husband ( the coffee drinker ) loves the coffee itself , just a pain to make it .
F	really fast printing and delivery but the items arrived damaged and the printing wasn_'_t perfect as you could see coloured marks on quite a few of the cards which we did not use .
F	now have to drive 00 miles round_trip on a saturday and tackle parking difficulties and charges with my little_girl to get something_else .
M	ordering - easy no issues
M	" origin ( blackout )- snow - roller 000 . 0cm ( w ) * 000cm ( d )
F	would use again .
M	very unhappy with the flowers i received they looked unhealthy the bunch was smaller than_expected and not worth the money at all .
F	has this not been the case my review would probably be 0_star , but this was a real inconvenience and , had i not checked in_advance , could have ruined the whole outfit .
F	enjoying the purchases made from the happy_puzzle_company .
F	furniture was delivered within the time_slot given .
F	i had been looking for nikwax cotton proof in the shops for a while - and i work in central_london , near all the outdoor_sports shops - but to no_avail .
F	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone_call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
M	they will get you where you want to go , no_frills unless you want to pay extra .
M	delivered promptly .
M	most products have little or no details regarding sale item , site security crazy .
F	onlookers must have been loving the embarrassment i felt .
F	i am a novice at on - line ordering but found the web_site easy to use and my order was delivered quickly .
M	would be great to see what you would actually be charged given you had already entered number of guests when searching .
M	delivery did arrive on time , ( although in a tatty box which was unceremoniously delivered by royal_mail ).
M	selected to have the selling pack sent to my home , packed the mobile and sent normal post .
F	most_important fact is that i was kept_informed continuously of the progress regarding my annuity in plain_english .
M	fast reliable good product thanks flashbay
F	i telephoned and a friendlier staff_member gave_me directions and said , " see you in a couple of minutes ".
M	no response when phoning to drop of car .
F	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
F	i ordered two_pairs of oska trousers on a sunday_evening and they arrived early the following_tuesday .
F	another 0 working_days passed so i rang again and was finally told it was dispatched .
M	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0_weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
M	after all this i have just received an email from this joke company bearing in mind they damaged my phone this is the response i got also the two letters mentioned were sent by recorded delivery to the managing_director not the sender of this email as he seems to think . read this : and think before you fall for it .
M	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
F	so i had to wait another 0_days until i knew i would be in .
F	have ordered from this company many_times and the flowers have always been to a high_standard .
F	i ordered the four door ibiza wardrobe which had several parts_missing , and two months to resolve .
M	strangely it seems like the water comes out hotter with these pods than nespresso '_s own , which is a good thing , but i guess i could be imagining that .
M	ha !
M	all the best !
M	i now have the parts and i '_m happy .
F	also so far i havent been bombarded with nuisance calls from them trying to flog insurance for the product which is often a consequence of buying from online sites .
M	delivery was swift and we were completely_satisfied with the table and chairs .
M	however , [_external_reference_] pay our automatically which makes_life a lot simpler
M	good prices , quick delivery , very pleased .
M	i recieved my batteries in good time and with no_fuss , i was very pleased with way i was delt_with and will use them again
M	they insisted that the moment i paid them , their liability ended , which is ridiculous .
M	i will be taking this further !
F	i had to chase them to find out what had happened and they only get back to you via_email .
M	all have been a waist of time , money and one big hassle and headache .
F	we charged you , but don_'_t have it in stock .
F	i will let you make you own mind up whether to order from this company at your_own_risk !
F	they '_ve not responded to any emails , we '_ve heard_nothing .
M	good contact , & updates , product just as expected on arrival & on schedule
F	purchase made , within ten mintues an_email arrived with delivery intructions as did the receipt .
F	!
F	excellent service .
M	also my last sailing was very late , no explaination or regrets .
F	on delivery i found it to be a tatty mess of what i call filling and only a few freesias dotted about in it .
F	first_tutors is an easy to use website , matching tutors to tutees .
M	i thought , " what the heck , it wont work , but it '_s so cheap , i may as well give it a go " well : it works .
F	to pay for everything it had to be done via a fax on headed_paper .
M	if you value good / honest customer service , do not use this company .
F	the receptionist where my sister works received a box and emailed my sister to say she had a parcel .
F	again matalan launch another 00_%_off all stock .
M	so overall the shine was taken off the new toy by a poor product but i can '_t complain_about the service .
F	great price and laptop .
M	thanks
F	we had our car cleaned inside and out whilst we were on our holiday for £_00 and i was very pleased with the results .
F	however i wasn_'_t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn_'_t look like the photo on the webpage .
F	i bought these for my mother who was in hospital to cheer_up her room .
F	still only have 00 days to return , so i hope she likes it more than i do .
F	very quick with sending everything and transferring the money was just disappointed with the fact that i got £_00 for a £_000 phone .
M	i will_definitely use your services again .
M	part of the delivery arrived the day before the arranged day ( fortunately i was at home ).
M	paul '_s efforts have at_least given me confidence to give dawson '_s another try in future and hopefully they '_ll earn 0_stars !
F	it is also very concerning that there are reports on the web of viagogo obtaining payment from telecoms operators for keeping people waiting for crazy amounts of time only to cut_off their calls .
F	i love rington '_s products and would have given a five
F	quick delivery with excellent communications plus good prices
M	eingaben übers tablett sind oft fehlerhaft .
M	i ordered 0 items .
F	the star_rating above seems to be more focussed on the personal contact aspect of doing_business with ss , rather_than the overall quality of the products , web based shopping_experience or paper based catalogue advertisements .
M	having been quoted more than double the price at kwik_fit i was delighted by the price i was quoted but concerned initially as to whether it was too good to be true .
M	.
F	the missing items were out of stock but wasn_'_t advised at the time of order which would have given me the option to shop elsewhere - only found out they were out of stock as i phoned up to ask where they were .
M	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new_born baby ).
F	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
F	i recommend printerland because i have ordered more than one printer from them and they make it easy to do_business with them .
F	fast , friendly ( but not_overly so !)
F	when the replacement arrived one dish in the set had a flaw in the coloured glaze .
F	i told him bed needed to be in spare_bedroom .
F	absolutely discussing service .
M	clear_instructions everything worked as_described .
M	the service was very good and helpful indeed
F	the online design function is an excellent addition to an already great service .
M	die hrs seite ist mir zu unübersichtlich .
F	( incidentally dfs unpack setup and take the packing away )
M	in addition emails between myself and bozowi customer_services have generally been generic and have taken 00_hours to recieve a response .
F	i had problems with a cartridge printing the wrong colours .
F	!
M	0 days_later an email arrived to say goods now in stock giving date of despatch and anticipated delivery date and time .
M	the best vinyl supplier in the county and always arrive quickly and un - marked which is very very important to us .
F	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
M	excellent value for money , notifications on delivery progress and fantastically fast despatch and delivery .
F	however the contact_lens didn_'_t sit on my eye just right and so i would have a kind of fuzzy halo around my vision where the colour started .
M	the pet corrector sprays we ordered were fine .
F	they took £_000 out of my account when it was only meant to be £_00 , that was in the first week of march , im still fighting to get my money back !
F	as we had chosen the " hotel " due to its location and convenience , we decided to stay there and await for our complaint to do the rounds inside expedia and in hope of a refund .
F	i accepted this as except the call within the next 00_hours .
M	not happy at all neither was the rest of my family who had to stay in too .
F	we usually receive the items in around 0 week and i am very happy with the service .
F	i brought a pair of hunter_wellies that were to big so i sent them back and asked for a refund but i had to foot the cost of return delivery which was £ 0 . 00 totally disgusting would never buy from here again .
F	their range of products is really great and free international_shipping is a huge plus for me .
M	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
M	having finally getting to speak to somebody on the phone , my order had been ' lost ' and the only way was to deliver to my house , otherwise cancel the order and replace again .
F	did not feel i was listened to .
M	i waited 00_minutes but there was no sign of this staff_member .
M	not too much difficulty using , wuld be good to have an itierary confirmation page before submitting booking just to check .
F	i agreed the dimples are the design of the frame but the n mark appeared on right side of the arm of the frame is definitely not the design of gucci .
F	i have the receipt from the postoffice .
F	my tiles were so heavy i couldn_' lift them - the young driver was lovely and helpful , but beware that you may need someone to help as your tiles will be on the pavement !
M	i emailed back and said i ' d already posted it , but all the necessary_information was in the jiffy_bag , including their original dispatch note , so they would have all the necessary_information and know exactly who it was from .
M	not even a hint of an_apology out of courtesy .
F	upon_contacting very to complain that i would now either have to make do with the product i hadn_'_t selected or go without and the response i got back was very generic and basically left me feeling they don_'_t actually care about mistakes they make .
M	:)
F	my parcel went missing in the post .
M	it wasn_'_t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
M	very happy with the service and the price .
M	as soon as my contract_ends , i leave three to never come_back and tell this to all my friends !
F	as a beauty writer i purchase items for review for a monthly publication and this is a big shame crown_brush !!!!
F	it '_s been 0 - 0_months now .
M	completely_useless service .
M	higher_than the button hole very disapointed in the quality
M	we installed it in under 00_mins .
M	this was done on line easily , but on my arrival it appeared that the information had not been updated on the paperwork held by the person_who came to meet us .
M	price was very good though as we were towing so i supposed that '_s have the money was saved .
M	the stores can be dated and tired looking .
M	the reason_why i bought a quick mill 000 from bella_barista is the kind and honest advice i received over the phone .
F	in order to proceed getting the size we had originally paid for , we would have to pay extra .
F	i would strongly_recommend animed_direct to anyone .
M	i specifically_asked it to be put in our enclosed porch which was unlocked .
M	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
M	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
M	my glasses were again returned , the new super thin ( 0 . 0 ’_s , not 0 . 0 ’_s ) were put in and posted to me .
M	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to purchase from the company again .
M	if you are a frequent_flyer and need them to take care of communicating your membership numbers , seat preferences etc .
M	thank_you for your email of today .
F	totally enjoyed the actual tour and enjoyed the cheerful banter of the first tour rep .
M	stavros took the bull by the horns and rectified it for me .
M	why do you need my email address below .
M	good prices
F	great service .
M	purchased 0gb_ddr0_memory for my laptop and it was here the day after it is an exellent service it directed me streight to the page that had the correct_memory for make and model of my laptop very convenient no searchong web to find out what memory i needed 0 words describes this online store excellent , trustworthy , value .
M	i have been shopping in jules_b for around 00 years and have had mixed service from staff but this was the worst experience i have had .
F	it is now 00_hours after that call to your company and i have not received any phone_call whatsoever from your company .
F	delivery : when i spoke to them on the telephone i asked when it would be delivered and i was told ' tomorrow ' i was surprised but trusted what i was told , unfortunately it came 0_days_later .
M	would certainly use again .
F	saying that the problem is always fixed quickly and we '_ve never had to pay extras .
M	i use bt landline and broadband and the suppport service is good but download_speeds for broadband as slow .
M	including a £_000 bill for the youview_box .
F	decent flowers but poor service from ordering through cashback site
F	we wanted to purchase two mattresses and found the staff very helpful and friendly .
M	it would of been nice to be offered an_alternative to just a full_refund maybe a discount would of softened the blow .
M	of course the problem was relatively trivial and obviously when first starting the car i must have inadvertantly depressed the clutch , not my usual practise .
M	a super quick delivery .
F	it was a very expensive mistake .
M	i had paid for priority delivery and when it became_clear the item was going to be late , i tried to reply to one of the e_- mails containing the text " please feel free to reply to this e_- mail , we ' re always happy to help ".
M	as usual tesco didn_'_t tidy up after closing leaving their trolleys strews everywhere including on the paths outside their property and two had been dumped as obstructions in the river .
M	great company , money for doing nothing different just an extra click or two .
F	i would highly_recommend house_signs online to anyone !!
F	but like everything else this has_been totally_ignored .
F	i also sent a complaint email to the address on - line .
M	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
M	i checked the uk mail website to check the status of my parcel and it said " out for delivery ".
F	today , i have had to chase this up again so hopefully i will receive my refund in the next week or so .
F	however the flowers arrived the next_day when i had requested a delivery four days_later for my mother '_s birthday - maybe another glitch on their website .
M	only being_able to contact the driver by mobile is asking for trouble .
F	these comments but l '_m not a big person - so l don_'_t know how big people manage
F	und checken wo sie wohnt .
F	i didn_'_t like how the full price and credit_card charges were not shown upfront .
M	didnt receive any mail as expected to advise delivery .
F	i will definitely use this website when comparing_prices on items in the future .
F	the material around the waist went into a massive hole becasue it was that thin and rubbish it went into the bin , i wasted £_00 on absolute garbage !
F	transaction_id_:_0000000
M	i can only hope valuable lessons have been learnt by o . f . l . s telephone cutomer relations team and that this dosent happen again .
M	i '_ll be using them again in the future .
F	they have such a poor reputation that using them to deliver your parcels will damage your_own credibility .
M	!
F	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
M	while trying to sort this out , or seeing if they can offer me some kind of replacement or cheaper repair rather_than the £_000 to fix it .
F	please stay clear !
F	order arrived the next_day , even a week before christmas , was well_packaged and the item as_described .
F	the front page looks very spammy , i can not even check my emails or use the search without reading about the latest robert pattinson trash .
M	bought a guitar funny enough , pleased with the product , nothing fancy good beginner model for our son .
M	this is an ongoing dispute .
F	lovely lady on the phone , not sure if we understood each other , cos i aint got all the bits i was promised . and not call back .
F	confused because i have managed to get it from somewhere_else without_any problem .
M	why are there so many breakdowns in the printout ?
F	someone called and said i couldn_'_t cancel until the 00 week delivery deadline .
F	i have spent £_000 and received nothing .
F	i didn_'_t know wigs could look that amazing .
M	first time i was told it would take 0 days to complete my order , from the day you hold a deposit from my bank .
F	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken_toys .
F	i '_ve_used 000 - reg for a decade now , have always been happy with them and always recommended them in the past .
M	when i got home i weighed it . 00 . 0kg .
M	i just shopped in other stores .
F	thank_you wicken_toys for excellent customer service .
F	all in all an excellent service and i would definitely use again .
M	it is slow to start when you press the activation button , the lcd is difficult to read and it seems underpowered .
M	very impressed with delivery times .
F	delivery was meant to be next_day and despite the fact that you dispatched it on time , the courier company you used delivered it 0_days_later .
F	0 - 0 week delay etc

F	even better price !
F	sadly the balloons delivered were faulty and all burst though not even fully filled .
M	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly_scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
F	customer service were friendly and helpful , but it was lip service and they wre unable to delvier .
M	the website was great , the booking process easy .
F	i called 00_minutes prior to my arrival as advised .
F	you also have a choice of safe ways to pay , including paypal .
M	occasional things gone_wrong but rectified .

M	in the end , delivery took 00 weeks .
F	i am a retail manager myself and find it disgraceful that a store does not provide the same level of service when returning items as when buying .
M	since the aiport was sold to increase competition the new owners have seen this as a way to fleece customers of every_penny for a poor parking service .

F	easy to order , speedy delivery .
M	they look great , feel reassuringly solid and look well built .
F	thank_you
F	i think the dispatch takes too long hence the goods take to long to be delivered
F	i have emailed a couple of times and all i get is change to ie ( which kept freezing for me , so i gave up with it ) or change to google_chrome .
M	got my order wrong on the internet but i phoned up and the order had not left the warehouse so i spoke to a nice gentleman that put it right with no problem .
M	i supplied this and in a couple of hours my mum called to thank me for the flowers .
F	we were guided towards the most_appropriate contract , which includes targetmaster plus – an_instant number redirection service .
F	after having an awful time with the last lot of lounge_furniture from a big 0 % interest furniture store who seem to have permanent sales going on , i am thrilled to find a uk manufacturer who_knows_how to look after their customers and supply very reasonably_priced , good - looking and comfortable furniture .
M	i arrived unannounced and they said there would be a 0 . 0 hour wait at_least as they were short_staffed and they had 0 staff sitting doing nothing and one car in the fitting_bay with no one on it !
F	although days earlier my spare was taken off by a friendly passenger who helped_me and tightened it using no tools so how come a mechanic could not do this job ?

F	i would use fancy_dress ball again .
M	also not impressed with receiving advertising texts , which i do not want .
M	after being told around 0000 on the friday when the dellivery was due that it was running a few hours late .
F	i was very impressed to get a phonecall about an_hour later so that he could try to recreate the error that had occured when i tried to place my first order .
M	there prices on thier website are not real .
M	given that on a good day with no traffic or other hold - up crawley is 00_minutes away from my home i can only conclude that i am not getting my parcel today .
M	i tried to call , but their " award_winning call_centre ” phone line , said there " was a fault ".

M	good range of products and speedy delivery .
F	my dress and size was easy to find , ordering and delivery prompt and informed .
M	the flowers came with a card saying ' no message required by sender ', which i was upset with thinking that there wouldn_'_t be a message if i chose not to pay for it .
F	but the friction in my case was the impossibility to modify or cancel the order once i did and pay it .
F	i waited five days and then telephoned customer service when order did not arrive , only to be told you had cancelled the order because you had no stock .
F	always check your receipts !
F	i am now not at home for another couple of days which means that i can '_t set_up my home office and get it all working .
M	when it arrived a few_days after ordering i was impressed with the quality and solidness of the unit the diameter is a bit larger than a standard ego type battery however it wasn_'_t so big as to look like it wasn_'_t intended to be used on this size of battery loads of vape and quite a large capacity ment i was the ideal tank for me however after a few day '_s it started to flood and then pour liquid from around the base but worst of all i was getting loads of juice in my mouth initial use warrented 0_stars but i have to give it 0 i , ll just add that i have been using ego types for a few_years_now and this atty has leaked the worst of all

F	days to get back to me ( in that time i had sent them 0 more emails asking why they didn_'_t answer my emails ) and then they said " it ’_s difficult for us to advise regarding import_tax for specific countries and territories " and bla_bla_bla .
M	flowers not fit for display let_alone a valentines_gift .
F	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking . endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!
M	i then faxed through the prescription as requested with the order number allocated and waited for it to arrive .
M	all i want is a refund .
F	one thing i didn_'_t like for sure , was the duration of a phone_call i had to make to change the return of a flight .

M	i am really dissapointed a large company like glasses_direct did not replace the lens due to the quality issue as a gesture of good will .
F	the sequence of sending is good but i had a problem with my money which was not paid into my account when stated and i had to ring them .

M	another item , travel wallets , were absolute_rubbish .
M	i better point out that the ' slow drip ' was water and not our son !

M	ordered 0 in 0 riley games table 0_weeks before_xmas .
M	most comparison_sites get paid by the companies who are being reviewed so you can see that this is likely to mean the review is not unbiased which is why more and more companies are not wanting to have anything to do with these kind of sites .

M	price was £_000 . 00 all in .
M	no matter what i used to have atleast 00 free_spins a week but after a while it stopped giving me them . i had a couple of months cool off and started depositing again but it '_s now been 00 weeks since i won on the daily free game .
M	very happy i had been quoted around 00 / 00 pounds to unlock my phone in the local town so was very happy to see just 00pound on iphoneunlock !
M	the shoes were packed in a box and would never fit through the letterbox !
M	it '_s a pity the web_site didn_'_t know .
F	i understand having an offer on one or two weekends up to christmas but not constantly !
M	even the fitting experience is excellent with knowledgeable and friendly staff .
F	also that under their terms 0 . 0 using their free return service is by standard postal service and this is non traceable !
F	never again
F	we received 0 x 0x00cl lowenbru original lager and 00 0x00cl pernoi lager total bottles 00 ( please_note i had put lowenbru original beer on the original e_- mail and had not changed the substitute as pernoi ).
M	however , this week i placed and order and my heart_sank when i saw yodel was the delivery firm and once again my experience has_been predictably bad .
F	the delivery company used are very poor , the man delivering was very polite and friendly but there is no notification when to expect the item and access the website is almost_impossible .
F	the coat being from superdry is good quality as expected
M	i even emailed to raise my concerns of my continual issues to glenn and i never once received an acknowledgement or a reply from him which was very disappointing .
F	i ordered an i phone for my daughter on saturday_morning all went through .
M	have never had any_problems

F	!
M	prompt delivery
M	i was strongly negative the moment the lady from the officie asked me to pay with visa 000 € as caution .
F	et : 00 , 00_euros pour_le nettoyage de_la voiture .
F	amazing service .
F	the lack of a helpline phone number was indescribably stressful , i had many texts and emails but not being_able to contact somebody for help was very difficult .
M	i then encountered even more poorly_designed logistical processes for the end user which resulted_in then another employee to suggest that i was " not co - operating " at the same time .
F	but . no next email .
F	i received the jacket i ordered in a grey bag with brown_tape around it , inside was a plastic sleeve with my barbour_jacket inside , not quite what i was expecting .
M	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
M	i found atlantic sign on the web when looking for a new house_sign .
F	on the more positive side i am very pleased with the car , the delivery driver was excellent and the member of staff who finally dealt_with the delivery date from nationwide was extremely_helpful .
F	easy to view catalogue on line , ordering system very accessible , easy to navigate and dispatched very quickly to enable use within days .
M	had the head of a excellent company .
M	the worst signal i have ever_experienced .
F	very can '_t be bothered attitude .
F	i ordered some rump_steaks & chicken_breast , the steaks were great , very tasty .

F	uum !?
M	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
M	when stood next to each other you could easilly see the size difference .
F	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it .
F	we both felt it was of a good value price .
M	very prompt service with texts saying when the order would arrive .
M	the price for the table was competitive and when it arrived , it was package well and was in excellent condition .
M	a thorough waste of my day and i will probably have to go through it again until the parcel is eventually delivered .
M	wot ?
F	on a positive_note the web_site is great and a really good range of sports items .
F	i managed to order the wrong_size ( complete my fault ) and they were very helpful about the return and the re - ordering .
M	item is a christmas_present so can '_t comment on that !
M	i had a dealing_with fedex because i was unable to sign for the package when it was eventually delivered .
F	this is deliberate misleading customers , and conning them into buying tickets thinking they are going to be nearer the front .
M	my advice is forget about buying anything from them and spend your hard earn , t money , with a honest reputable_company , mr n . s cheeseman basildon essex
F	i live in australia and thought it would be better to go direct to a company in the uk for this gift .
F	excuse me ???
M	booked this car_hire in fuertaventura as used them in may and was pleased with the service but more important was the fuel_policy which was return as found , none of these up front full_tank charges .
M	it arrived the next_day .
F	had to reschedule delivery as missed it the first time .
F	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
M	initally , tier_0 wanted me to send them a copy of my bank_statement as proof of my identity .
F	but , when the meal_packs arrived and i unpacked the boxes , i couldn_'_t_believe that all these wonderful labled dishes were for me to try .
M	packaged
F	ridiculous !
F	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
F	despite the order status being acknowledged via_email there was no tracking option , so i did not know exactly_what day my package was going to arrive .
F	means i may not always use the company as often as i would like
M	espares are my first_port of call when i require parts .
M	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
F	very annoying !
M	good value
M	well yes .
M	i had to chase up my order and only then did they send it .
F	english_speaking operators would be nice as its very hard to understand what '_s being said !
F	i '_m taking_legal_action_against these scumbags
M	having never eaten there before , i was excited to try out their menu , but my eagerness soon turned to utter dissapointment .
M	the one i did receive i was happy with .
M	with a baby and a five year_old as well this was truly a dreadful experience .
M	quick delivery , great price , great product .
F	banks are bad , but not this bad .
F	good quality food .
F	help !

M	i wanted to point out as a matter of feedback that a karcher_window cleaner should not be sold the way you sell it .

F	background : o0 had agreed to replace a faulty iphone for me and i was told i needed to swap it with the driver who would call within the next two_days .
M	the flowers i received were nothing like the photo on their website .
F	this was very disappointing .
M	i found a pair of oakley_sunglasses at lanaca airport but didn_'_t have enough time to purchase them so i decided to look for them on line when i arrived home that '_s when i found rx_sport not only were they significantly_cheaper_than the duty_free price £_00 to be exact the delivery was free and i received my glasses in a well_packaged box 0 days_later .

M	easy .
F	the mattress we originally bought was very soft and did roll together .
M	!
F	we decided to " create " a cake for my daughter '_s 00th_birthday and used the cigarillos to finish off the cake .
M	i felt_like ryan was on my side and did everything he could to make it simple and easy for me .
F	there was no reply to my other e_-_mails either .
M	unfortunately my first experience with them was rather sad - i found them to be unprofessional , chaotic and rude .
F	site claims same day or next_day delivery .
M	prices were also very competitive .
M	taht was almost a week_ago and i still_haven_'_t received them .
M	i don_'_t know if it is possible but it should also allow the direct exchange between existing users , i think this would increase confidence and use . other than this excellent and highly_recommended .
M	the lenses had differing positions through which to look for either eye to be in focus .
M	instead just stick with mazuma , these_guys are professional , quick , no_hassle , easy and make selling your phone safe and a pleasureable_experience .
M	that '_s service ?
M	occasionally , i find prices cheaper somewhere_else but i come_back because these_guys really care about their customers .
F	if you are looking for a good experience , with a smooth installation process and professionalism i would strongly_recommend you look elsewhere .

F	when visiting the store a few_days_later the price was still the same .
F	i replied to say that was not acceptable & couldn ’_t they just send me the belt ?
M	would recommend flowers but not delivery .
F	i had an occasion to buy 0 lamp_tables and found lifestyle_furniture on the internet .
F	very happy with being kept_informed of the order confirmation , the sending of the flowers and indeed when they had actually been received .
F	bit annoyed , but the product is great .
M	really good service from all concerned with the purchase and delivery .
M	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
M	we have been offered an ' ftp ' based solution but the promises have never turned into delivery despite constant chases .
M	i used the web_site to reasearch for strong_magnets and magnets that could do different things .

M	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping_people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
M	normally a good experience with juno but this time vinyl looked 0nd_hand , cover was worn , damaged on all edges & ripped , vinyl had scuffs , scratches & finger_prints to both_sides , not had anything like this before from them , hopefully just a one off !

F	the goods were very quickly dispatched and were with me within 0_days of ordering .
F	the delivery service has always been first_class .
M	very quick_turnaround of replacement oral_b toothbrush_heads .
F	but more_importantly because of the service i received .

M	nothing but respect for these_guys , have always come through with great service and top quality packaging .
F	the phone case arrived within two_days of ordering .
F	outrageous .
F	i was told that it was going to be delivered the very next_day on wednesday 00 / 00 and here we are two_weeks_later and my daughter still_hasn_'_t received it .
F	am very disappointed with the complete_lack of communication and disregard , the conflicting_information and lack of service !
F	rant_over !
F	i tried to contact the company to find out when they were expected to make the delivery and ask them to give me a phone_call 00_minutes before so i could take my kids to their after school activities , spoke to the manager and was told that they did not provide that kind of service .
F	we wanted something special for my son '_s school_prom .
M	i would like to thank trustpilot for letting_me review microdream on their site .
M	i '_ve bought from kenable infrequently but over quite a long time .
M	other than that everything_went_smoothly and i would definalty recommend to anyone .
F	i would use them again for all similar purchases
M	i think my next choice may well be the caravel .
F	this morning ( friday 00th_april at 0 . 00am ) i called them .
F	the delivery arrives but no pod chair ( or cover for the other set ).
F	your service is terrible , only once have you been reliable , my lastest booking you have failed to collect to days running , not good enough im_afraid
M	^ days_later it arrived from burglen ?
M	even when i answered it and said i don_'_t want another phone they would carry on saying i could give it to a family_member or friend . why the hell would i want to pay for someone_elses phone !
M	would not have been the case if i was fitting them to the front of the window rather_than the recess fitting .
F	i would recommend this site to everyone .
M	time to let david pollock ( chief exec ), stephen dracup ( man .
F	told we would only be able to have the hard_drive back – not the whole pc - even_though it has extra drive added by us and is our property .
F	i bought a personalised plate as a christening present and was very disappointed at the poor quality .
F	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
M	so who is kidding who ?
F	fine .
M	that way you '_ll earn their respect and they '_ll be happy that you ' re trying to help them , and there won_'_t be a problem .
F	i checked back with my emails before 0pm and still no further email had been received , so i tried resending my code and the same message came through .
F	in fact , the email reply didn_'_t come until after the goods arrived .
M	prices are also competitive .
F	the company offered me a refund of item costs only and wanted me to send the item back at my cost .
F	we ordered 0 huge beanbags - a whopper and a the original .
F	surely this is a health and safety risk ???
F	found the prices on the ship really over the top , even the shops were pricing there goods far to high . had dinner going and coming_back what we got was good enough but travelling with a chief even he thought the pricing was way of the mark .
F	i clicked on re - order and 0day later my lenses arrived . couldn_'_t be easier
M	an email_explaining the situation would have been helpful .
F	am seriously thinking of stopping once i have finished paying what i owe
M	good price and fast delivery of product .
F	nearly 0_weeks_later they finally tell me that it never passed final quality inspection and i '_d been refunded !
F	saturday_evening logged_onto the website to be told the order had been canceled ( strange ) so took my daughter into_town on sunday to buy her an iphone .
M	!
F	price_wise it '_s great value .
F	i paid £_00 . 00 to park at ncp birmingham , exactly the same price as quoted by ncp !
M	i was quoted a very good price , but then at check - out found there was a booking charge .
M	to get disconnect of old machine £ 0 . 00
F	there was no negotiation .
F	they may aswell have chucked my money back at me .
M	i then had a week of emailing back and forth with no real alternative options or help forthcoming .
F	deal with them at your_own peril !
F	really good fast delivery thanks
M	they can keep the £_00 latches , i don_'_t seem to like being felt_like i am a lier and cheat .
M	on one side of the form all the details relating to the driver and her car ,
F	no mess , no_fuss , just job_done very efficiently .
M	avoid this company
M	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
F	the £_00 - £_00 legal fees we did not pay !
M	then they asked me for direct payment , even_though i had already paid wowcher , saying wiwcher had not given them any money .
F	did the usual stop off at some tacky transport cafe for a ' comfort break '.
M	well_packed product .
M	bewildering selection of designs and sizes to choose from .
M	i was phoned by two of the firms before i ' d even had a chance to look at the quotes ( all very similar ), and that impressed me .
F	you assume that because goods are available in britain they can be obtained everywhere .
M	the vendor was incredibly apologetic and understanding and helped_me book a hotel for the one days we were overbooked and re arranged for us to stay in the original apartment for the remained of our stay .
M	prompt , professional and great quality .
M	our event manager rebekka was absolutely_brilliant and she organised exactly_what we asked for to a tee .
M	i rang them , told them they had cashed my cheques and gave them the cheque number .
F	my mother is just potty about all animals and i judged bramble would prompt a squeal and the flowers would be a pleasant and welcome second best .
F	had an_email thanking_me for visiting site & if i '_d experienced problems to email them .
M	this still hadn_'_t been received on the 00th_december so called again and was told it would be despatched same day and the hold up was due to it being sent from a different warehouse .
F	i want to warn any potential_customers of salesmanaged , mk exhibition or movey that they should not pay up front for anything from this bloke .

F	everything i have ordered from beautybay . com has arrived earlier_than_expected and have been as required or better_than_expected .

F	x
F	we were advised that they would be delivered the next_day , thought wow great !!
F	however , what i hadn_'_t realised is that all unwanted_items have to be returned to denmark (!)
F	so i thought why not give a try .
F	so i rang them to request a replacement or refund and was dismissed out of hand by the guy i spoke to because " the packaging had been opened ".
F	my first mr_memory purchase following a recommendation led to the surprise arrival of my order in the following_day '_s post .

F	i don_'_t think that the fittings are robust_enough for the size and weight of the blinds .

F	my delivery date was before 00th .
F	could read in the evening without_any glasses .
M	they were well_packed but the box was pretty damaged and had been squashed , the delivery driver had left the box in a bush on my drive way as it was not in !
F	am i the only one out there who has difficulty with the size of the capsule .
F	**** 00 / 00 - have been calling over last few_weeks and have been sworn that i will get paid by today and there is nothing !!!
M	would advise you to check that all the details are understood before you fly out if you are requesting a large vehicle .

M	other pretenders have arrived on the scene , but the magimix still seemed top of the class .
M	delivered as ordered .
F	my order came with 0 out of 0 handles scratched .
F	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
M	great service , simple , cheap , delivered to a client in the netherlands with no_problems
M	eventually received a computer_generated email_saying the goods had been despatched .
M	but , i only got interest from one or two people and that '_s because you need to be online , hatched solves that issue , plus they provide a for sale sign and deal with all enquiries .
M	only down_side is there is no " pay upfront " option so you have to keep your money aside until closer to travel time .
M	received them the next_morning !
M	this meant it charged for delivery where clearly it stated free delivery .
M	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
M	great website , very cheap prices , easy ordering and fast despatch .
M	this one doesn_'_t , it is entirely about mighty_deals and not any other individual , organisation or company .
F	very shocked at paying a total of £_000 for two tickets to michael_buble with a face value of £_00 each .

F	great service
M	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don_'_t let you know about until after you '_ve ordered .
M	totally shock that got free delivery on valentinea day .
M	we also use the small hand_held model 0 - 0 times a day for quick tidy ups of crumbs etc from the kitchen_floor and around the toaster - it is also great for the car .
F	found that it was more difficult than_expected to order .
M	arrival into newcastle was slow , no reason_why .
M	ordered a diary , which was a good price and the delivery price also good .
M	i '_m very happy with my purchase of a sigma nikon 00 - 00 lens .

F	the rwandan is the best and i was disappointed in the quality of the others .
F	had a booking in barcelona for about 0_months , and had been arranging check in with the host .
M	!
F	i contacted santander customer service ( number provided by their online secure message ).
F	00 out of 00 to purple_parking , stress_free parking . won_'_t use again .
F	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
M	not good enough , at the very least you should be able to say where the tyres are and when they will be delivered .
F	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
F	in comparison , they were going to be costly and locked us into being responsible for ongoing maintenance , including the challenge of relocation .
M	no sooner had i placed my order , i had a pair of brand_spanking_new sd quarter pounders in my hands , talk about fast delivery , captain kirk on the starship enterprise couldn_'_t of beamed them down any quicker lol !
F	i will never be using boohoo again .
F	either you devote your entire day to sifting_through the piles of poorly sorted clothes in the shop or you dont !
M	!
F	needless to say 0 people wasted their money on flights and hotels to amsterdam and couldn_'_t attend the gig we paid for .
F	trying to contact them is a nightmare , their web_site won_' let you send a message no phone number to contact and when i finally found one it a premium_rate number at !, 00 per_minute to use .
F	it was perfect for what we wanted and we are delighted with it .
F	i could not fault the customer service at drinkstuff , even if the delivery company is not great .
M	i ordered from wood 0u as they were the cheapest for the specific laminate i wanted .
F	couldn_'_t find what i needed in wilkos , and luckily found this website .
M	i can '_t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person_who doesn_'_t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
M	i told them to phone me .
F	i tried to explain to [_name_removed_] that the part was only returned because i did not receive the module and that after waiting for about one month i felt that i had waited enough and went out and bought another machine .
F	i spent a while pricing made - to - measure_blinds and blinds 0 go beat the competition_hands_down on price .
F	as such we had to wait 00_minutes whilst they found suitable rooms for us , and we ended_up being 0 floors apart_from each other .
F	despite a chase_up e_- mail , the reply was not forthcoming and after a few_days i had to waste time and money on a phone_call to check the situation .
M	i have received no contact , in 0 days from eflorist informing_me of any_issues .
F	the tickets came with about 00 days before concert so that was fine .
M	when we complained to lemon digital they told us it must be their ' returns_department '.
F	was very pleased with westwoods .
F	i emailed again and received no reply .
F	oh and don_'_t drink the coffee sachets left in the house they went out of date in september !
M	they would be better to treat them as two different_destinations .
F	did not completed the course as i found the salt content ws too high .
M	we are still_waiting !
M	i will never use hermes again and have written to p0g saying that i think they are disreputable for using hermes , i have a strange feeling that these two companies may have more of a relationship than they are prepared to admit .
M	an all_round ***** service .
F	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
M	but
M	will_definately keep you on my short list .
M	i spoke to the manager who informed me that the tyres had not arrived .
F	once again no goods and then told over the phone deliver end of march .
F	this was the fourth time .
F	they are quick to respond when to the urgency of no ink_cartridges , an_oversight on my part as i thought i still had some left .
M	oh and by the way the door did not fit due to the cladding not lining up .
F	i am a very regular business traveller to brazil and have almost always booked both hotel and flights through_expedia . co . uk , but i won_'_t touch them again even with a barg pole .
M	!
F	ordered on a thurs , del monday .
F	as i have had to chase this up myself the time limits i must assume have not been adhered .
M	ok , you pay postage , but you will with most sites .
M	one girl dealing_with a number of bemused and impatient travellers , eventually after an_hour we were transferred to our resort .
F	the flowers are beautiful and the service excellent from the personal emails that are sent to the little bottles of water on the stems , the price was very reasonable too would highly_recommend and will be using again .
F	no problem recommending this company to anyone i will certainly use them again .
F	!
F	my account states that i have been paid , alas my bank_account says not !
M	this was the first time for us . the difficulty we had we didnt now where to meet .
F	this is the second time i have bought my peanuts through titmuss and i must_say they are much_better value and service than others i have used in the past .
F	we were left_stranded for a whole afternoon while our tour_guide slept .
M	i suspect the ' nice ' reviews on here are ' sponsored ' by the vendor .
F	i bought and paid for an item on line .
M	what can i say about select_specs everything is top_class from price to quality to service and delivery they are my only choice enough said
M	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
M	chris was so helpful and get knowledgeable , pleasure to deal with .
M	they sent me tap that they had clearly opened and removed the fittings kit from to give to someone_else .
F	my new fitflops were easy to find on the site and they are as_described .
F	web_site is really easy to use and they have really great deals !
M	i '_ve also used other rental_companies but have found cabrera by far the best .
M	this meant staying in to receive 0 separate_deliveries .
F	we ordered , collected and reloaded our cards without_any apparent problems .
M	the prices are very acceptable and delivery is really fast .
F	i certainly helps when quoting new work to be able to see if they are credit worthy etc .
F	they were incredibly ugly and represented poor value for money .
F	so hopefully they will have a lovely christmas with a tree that they can bring out again and again x :)
M	was under the understanding it would probably be delivered in 0 - 0 days
F	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
M	they ruined a weekend for me where i had planned to pay 00 holes with my wife and she had no clubs to use .
F	fantastic !
F	also , when i e_- mailed to cancel the order as i would not even be able to collect them , i was told that the product would be delivered and i had to pay to send them back !
M	goods arrived in good time , but when i went to return i had to email the company for a returns_form .
M	for certain items , you will not beat cyclestore on price .
M	this should be interesting as its about a 00hr flight to here .
M	food very good , treated well on arrival , views excellent , staff very good , rooms clean but could do with updated , maintenance on balcony could be updated , privacy partition between rooms on balcony is required , carpets need to be lifted and floor boards screwed down to stop creaking , which is an unacceptable noise . but we enjoyed the break and would still recomend the hotel mainly for the food and lovely staff .
M	i finally sent a long formal_complaint email only to receive the " further 00 working_days " email again .
F	this company is not to trust .
M	sent pictures showing the damage .
F	i have been assured this was a temporary blip so will probably use again .
F	advertising was as good as any estate_agent , and i was more than happy to show prospective_buyers round myself .
F	very happy , will be ordering again .
F	great item , fast delivery with lots of email_updates . will use company again . well_done them !
F	delivery was faster_than we thought it would be and we were kept_informed at every_stage as to where our items had reached in the whole_process of getting them to us .
F	i ordered a beautiful pen , cartridge and pad set for my niece .
F	my mum said that flowers was lovely but not very big and quolity not good . price was
M	booked for wednesday pm at checkout .
M	basically this is the one stop party shop for all events !!!!
M	would thoroughly_recommend using them for oakley_sunglasses !
F	i went on wednesday but couldnt access the locker so i rang to be told it had been removed .
M	surely the name of the villa should be clearly printed on the signs so you know which one to follow .
F	i like your product when it works and would prefer to buy all the time , and sadly i do , cos i don_'_t have time to research other of same . but i am pretty fed_up that half of what i purchase from you only lasts a couple of weeks .
F	too many guidelines and policies .
F	good price , good delivery and all_round excellent service
M	there are many other_providers of photobooks and i guess the old saying ' you get what you pay for ' sums up my experience .
M	their service is friendly , efficient and i really don_'_t have a bad_word to say about them .
F	lwenbru beer sent tubor crap beer .
M	0_stars is perhaps a little unfair as i never said anything at the time .
M	great price and excellent service
M	i await your reply talk_talk
M	also , it would have been nice if i was told that the vase i was buying was too big for the bunch i had bought , as it is difficult to tell when viewing online .
F	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
M	very good service and products
M	i ordered a pair of prescription ray_ban rb0000 wayfarers polarized ( size 00 ) from sbg on 0 april .
F	they apparently won_'_t leave a parcel without a signature ( even thought the company sending the kit doesn_'_t request one ) but on the 0 occasions i have left a signed card out they have still failed to leave the parcel in the porch as instructed .
M	however , the adjustments were easy for me to make after the skis arrived .
M	but ive not received this basic reliability , even after highlighting the problem and calling numerous_times .
F	when i received the item one of the parts was faulty rendering the entire walking_aid unusable .
F	any_problems or questions always sorted_out promptly .
F	chris
M	i '_m surprised at how i '_m now being treated by dolphin .
F	so after being absolutely assured there was stock and we would receive them 0_days_later we placed a new order .
M	will buy from them in future .
F	the car is underpowered and is small for 0 adults - the boot is snot largeand unfortunately we were not told by the rental staff until afterwards , that there was extra boot space underneath , so we never discovered this !
M	apart_from the roof problems , very well made and my wife is looking_forward to nice sunny evenings relaxing in her summerhouse .
F	over a week after paying and placing my order , i still had not received my medication .
M	great products , great prices and excellent customer service .
M	at first i was reluctant to purchase this kind of item on line but it could not have been easier - all i needed was a copy of my prescription .
F	the fitter_turned_up almost 0_weeks_later and advised the bed would need to be taken apart and went away unwilling to do the installation !
M	sincerely ,
M	we look_forward to answering your query shortly .
F	i loved having options delivered to my house , i loved that they fit through the letterbox so it was all easy .
F	one of my items was unavailable and i was emailed to see if i wanted to amend my order before dispatch .
M	i cannot_fault hh and will be ordering more stuff from them regularly .
F	when your printer is on the blink email ' printerinks '.
M	i purchased the deal of the day , which represented excellent value including a tyre guarantee .
F	they deliver everywhere in the uk .
F	i ordered the bed grab_rail for my elderly_mother .
F	excellent and easy to use !
F	phoned the tyre replacement technician who had kept in touch throughout .
M	the bus_stop was not far from our hotel overlooking the banks of the danube on the buda side .
F	guess i dont need to say anything_else .
M	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
F	most companies deliver the revised goods and collect the incorrect items at the same time !
M	yours_sincerely
M	i haven_'_t heard a word but have been bombarded daily with e_mails_asking for more orders .
M	- arrived 0 june
F	i was really impressed with the colour , especially because i have dark eyes .
M	i would not have been surprised to have received specs of lower quality than this , given the excellent price .
F	i would definitely recommend it ; a board game that is the spin off of a computer game !
F	after waiting for about one month , i contacted them again as i still had not received a refund and was told that it would be done there and then .
M	no communication to me - package in hatfield delayed .
F	excellent !
M	thumbs_up to them !
F	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don_'_t know what to do with my item !
F	once or twice in a year is poor but nearly every shop is total unacceptable now i know what it means by cheap is not always the best .
M	eventually found email address to contact you .
M	mike ,
F	please keep the package as small as possible so that it has a chance of going through a letter_box .
M	the tablet was delivered next_day and in perfect order .
F	i request that you give me a full_refund .
F	not sure if this is a point for rentalcars or for europcar , but having looked on the website , we noted that the rental office was closed on sundays , which is when we wanted to return the car . therefore we decided to drop_off a day earlier .
F	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
F	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
F	great site to get anything you want
M	ok if you assemble every day you will be ok , but the instructions were poor but i did like the numbered bags to determine the correct fxings .
M	i expect you are losing business as a result of this .
F	i was told it would probably be the next_day .
F	the bed_frame was ok except for the feet which were sloppy and poorly attatched so broke of when putting it together
M	i added oats which did not get included and also i was showed the final_bill as something but when i confirmed everything and paid the bill it was different and certain products were removed .
M	i have again contacted them but as usual there is no response !
M	00_hours ???
F	i wowchered 0 bracelets rrp £_000 . 00 @ £_00 each .
M	the site is easy to navigate and the products are high_quality , great service from simply_supplements .
F	i was checking several dates for the prices and left the wrong date when i booked .
F	the standard , price and overall result is actually so good that i will not be going anywhere_else to purchase glasses .
M	charge a booking_fee for using service .
M	i '_ve always have very good times when booking in hostel rated above 00 %.
F	they did a very good job .
M	big plus is that amazon are very helpful when things go_wrong and help resolve the issues quickly
M	why is the settle figure different from the z ( end of day ) figure ?
M	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
F	the price was so competitive .
F	imagine my surprise when your order arrived first !
M	best to shop
M	great machine .
F	competitive low_prices , placed order and received item 0_days_later .
F	i ordered my lenses on friday_afternoon and they were delivered on saturday_morning .
M	very happy with this compamy .
F	site helped a novice_like me to find a number of solutions .
M	i placed the order , they took my money , the deal was that they would deliver the next_day for free . its the next_day & they ' re telling_me its not going to be delivered .
F	wouldn_'_t use this company again
F	the cheque did come quite quickly though so that was good .
M	the gate was locked and the flowers and vase . were on the ground crumpled and looking a mess .
M	not impressed with the 0000 number which cost me a fortune on my mobile_phone .
F	am awaiting a refund although i have already contacted my credit_card provider to put the sale in dispute .
M	well , basically i hadn_'_t taken the lock off one of my phones which then dropped the price down by 0 / 0 and then when i asked the customer service for some advice on the matter they didn_'_t give me any information which helped_me , also i also didn_'_t know that envirofone could accept your sale for you , seeming as i wanted to withdraw my phone to unlock it to receive the full payment therefor i '_m not happy with envirofones customer service !
F	i changed my mind after a few_days and rang to cancel the order .
F	they seldom deliver next_day and very recently my parcel was just_dumped in a farmyard about a mile_away from our house .
F	ordered a pump 0 . 00_pm thursday expecting to have missed delivery for the day - delivery arrived friday before 00 . 00am
F	i received a response on monday_morning ( today ), a day after mother '_s day , explaining how it is written in the terms and condition that they do not guarantee delivery on the day you want because they use third_party delivery service ( that is royal_mail ), reasons could be due to traffic , remote_location etc - they apologized but they is nothing they can do .
F	excellent communication and my sandals arrived so quickly .
F	after_reading some of the reviews on here i was very nervous that i had been ' done ', and didn_'_t expect to receive either a reply or my topper .
F	the tracking was available on their site to follow the progress and it was through city_link '_s delivery service ; all happily going well in the fact that the package had been picked_up and delivered to their depot last evening , 00th and telling_me it would be delivered this morning between 00 . 00 and 00_noon .
M	its my money and i want to know !
F	mum was very pleased with the flowers
F	had the item description been a little clearer or the customer service just a little better i would have given 0_stars .
M	it couldn_'_t have been simpler , i highly_recommend using envirofone
M	will look again , but amex is a big thing as it also covers travel_insurance
M	found in a couple of minutes to be on left hand_side in marked compartment in boot .
M	guess they don_'_t want to take business from b_& q .
M	easy website
F	very quick to respond to email enquirers .
M	as other users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
F	obviously you do not expect brand_new items to arrive with such a fault .
M	as they are not face to face , they will hide
M	in one scene a woman manages to slam a side door shut with two soft packages hanging out .
F	i was thrilled to finally find some suitable fit_flops but although ordering on line was fast and easy the website kept breaking_down .
M	says it all in the title !
M	the packet gave no_indication of its contents , which could have been vital if the items had been medically personal .
M	delighted with the deal - throughout all was easy and well directed - service was instant - my sincere gratitude to all concerned - kind_regards jim harris
M	!
F	i '_ve just bought a walnut and cherry wood backgammon_set as a 00st_birthday_present to my son .
F	thank_you again .
F	i have used misco for years but something has happened to their site recently .
M	i have tried numerous other similar products , but none have the same quality as the items purchased from liberty_flights .
M	wish i knew about this reviews before
F	they were nothing like what i ordered and i paid_extra for a large bunch and to me it was a small bunch .
M	i could imagine a queue of fitness first staff just waiting to turn my phone into a christmas_tree .
M	if there was a problem with payment - call me or e_- mail me to resolve it - don_'_t just cancel it .
M	the kodak site i used had a beautiful finish on the cover and a leaf of tracing paper to cover the first page , which a lll just gave it a better quality feel .
F	through no one '_s fault we had quite a lot of leaks in the storms , four windows leaked so we asked for old towels to put to mop up the water , a day later someone bought one towel , i pointed_out that we need four and he said he '_d be back , he never arrived .
M	they were now prepared to offer my father £_000 .
F	poor administration with prices quoted online different to those invoiced .
F	i will be recommending the site to my travel patients from now on .
F	slow dispatch time .
M	first_class service whole_process took less_than a few mins .
F	these_guys fit the bill_perfectly .
F	conclusion : they really should be more generous on the amount of swagbucks awarded , or lower the price of the gift cards .
M	i '_ve not been using the product long enough to detect any benefit , but certainly the service from healthspark was very prompt .
M	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!
F	straight_forward ordering and very fast delivery .
M	in short , fine unless you want your items within the week .
M	hanving paid the deposit for unlock pre_- order , these_people contacted me with their final price of gbp_000 . 00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
F	the taxi_driver then took the wrong road .
F	example : ordered three chairs which took one month to come .
F	very disappointed that due to ultralase joining with optimax i have to travel all the way to glasgow for my ( 0 week ) after appointment instead of going to aberdeen .
M	the lorry they sent was so big it couldn_'_t get within three miles of me !
F	i also opted for ' confirm delivery day / time ' by phone but i never received a text_message of delivery .
F	website crashes / times out often which is a little annoying .
M	outstanding service from bob andrews , answered all of my questions and even went over all of the policy terms and conditions .
F	i can '_t stress enough how amazing this is and if you are in any doubt then go for a consultation - i wish i had done it sooner !
M	they then emailed me after receiving my phone saying it had scratches on it and they have revised their offer to £_00 .
M	the bunch of flowers was advertised as being made up of 00 daffodils and 00 tulips .
F	we reported them to trading_standards who said they '_d heard lots of similar stories_about them which is why i am amazed they are still managing to steal people '_s money with their blatant lies .
M	outstanding service - give them a go .
F	if i '_m paying for delivery i can accept a few_days but not the best part of a week .
M	i cannot recommend you guys enough .
F	my order was small and light_weight .
M	honestly it is a waste of time and money with these_guys .
F	while ordering the selected mattress was straightforward , with a user - friendly website , i was frustrated by the delivery ' service '.
M	great efficient customer service , very quick delivery , product as expected .
F	what i wasn_'_t expecting was to have only half the components for my desk delivered with no legs for it and no chair at all .
F	i had quite a few compliments that evening on the costume and how good it looked .
F	if they dont have agents free to take the call they shouldn_'_t be ringing customers .
F	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has_been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
M	very dissapointed as bathroom should have bern completed by christmas .
F	i had not previously set_up an account but only signed_up for the newsletter .
F	i have just received the email to say that i can withdraw my amount soon .
F	doesn_'_t seem useful to me and when i had an account there i had troubles writing those short messages .
M	rceived the iphone 0 lead quickly which was great - doesn_'_t work though !
M	i shop online a lot and these_guys are complete cowboys .
M	i am still_awaiting a response from expansys on this , after which i may update this review .
M	i tried to call back after the 00_mins but got no answer .
F	we ordered balloons together with one helium_canister .
M	great product at a fair price with super_fast delivery .
F	i ordered some party invites for my 00th which came & i was absolutely_delighted with them , and even more so when i received a 00_%_discount on my order .
F	an_email was sent to me shortly before we travelled making_sure we knew what to do and checking that we each had and esta for entry into the usa .
M	i bought a monitor using my own personal credit_card .
M	i was informed the cheapest one they do is 00_euros and it comes with 0gig of data , so i purchased this and was told it would be active in 0 mins .
M	great product , great packaging , great price .
M	the guys delivering were very helpful
F	photo image was good but didn_'_t realise the stand came separate but i may have missed that in the description , the heart sits on the stand but it isn_'_t very sturdy so you have to handle with care .
F	but seems they do not even care !
F	i use expensive camera equipment and my photos are usually of a fairly high_standard .
F	the best i know of so far .
M	good service and back up , always helpful
M	i asked them to dispose of the printer since it did not seem worth repairing .
F	i was looking for some save the date cards , i looked at a lot of places and all of them were so over priced !
F	would definitely use again
M	fist outing in the lake_district showed that it is not waterproof as i thought when buying .
M	thank_you .
M	also there was dust under the seals , the camera lens had dirt on it , as well as the sides had signs of use .
F	i had prepeared a very detrimental review to go on here , when amazingly at the midnight hour , my final photograph was accepted .
F	thanks
F	very dissapointed .
F	they also wouldn_'_t let_me cancel the contract without paying the charges , which actually seemed like a good option at times .
M	i ordered two waistcoats , one blue & one burgandy , they are the perfect fit & the colours are exactly as the website says , i have looked for waistcoats in the high_street_shops & cannot find anything to match these lovely colours , i have bought the blue one for a wedding & it matches my suit perfectly .
F	i ordered a curtain_pole , 0 dormer rods and some dormer rod supports .
F	they have often included " extra " items in with orders as a thank_you for using their company , eg threads and extra bobbins .
M	but overall not at all regretting .
M	i would not recommend this company , the unit quality is actually good but the overall experience was unacceptable which resulted_in us having to find another company to install the units and us being without a kitchen for 0_weeks .
F	alice
M	good prices and products , shocking delivery service .
F	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
F	today i called to chase_up and the customer_services adviser was rude and sarcastic .
M	we have always experienced next_day delivery with screwfix on all products we have oredered .
M	then suddenly i get several texts all at once with varying timestamps up to hours before the current time .
F	so far no tickets , can '_t get to talk to anyone via the ' contact us ' 0000 as all automated , sent a mail and had an auto response .
F	when i tried to change my hire to a sun pick_up instead to make my travel_plans work better due to the late notice that they couldn_'_t change my hire to the fri , i couldn_'_t get_hold of any one from the uk side of the company to make the necessary changes .
M	i '_ll happily delete this review if / when it arrives
F	the delivery was fast .
M	i '_ll definately_use these again .
M	they may be a bit_slow , but they arrive in the end .
F	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn_'_t happen again .
M	ordered from safercigs as a bit of a change and unfortunately my order got cancelled over some £ 0 delivery charge or something along those lines .
M	brilliant fast helpful and be buying again
M	they '_ve got loads of cool_stuff , rapid delivery .
M	glasses returned fixed .
M	this should be payable by now and it is not even showing on my account yet .
M	the shipping was free and claimed to be 0 - 0 working day but by the 0th working day i had not received anything from them i called on the 0th working day after still not receiving anything and sure_enough the guy_who i spoke to was indeed very helpful and explained why there was a delay , it was feasible and i have no reason to think its just an excuse - see , i ordered my stuff on the tuesday of the jubilee_weekend with maximuscles 00_% of day and he said that the high_volume of orders slowed things up abit .
M	ordered radiator which was supposedly in stock .
F	would recommend precook to all my friends , never lets me down
M	very easy and trustworthy , highly_recomended
M	i appreciate that this time of year is always a bit more_expensive but feel 0 roses with a bit of greenery is not really value for money , as i said the presentation of the flowers was good and delivery fine but the size was a bit dissapointing .
F	it was free_postage & arrived the next_day .
M	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let_me re - post or post another review about this company ?
F	excuses for delay are . creative , to say the least !
M	0 . delivery address
M	i was very happy with the quality of the waistcoat but unfortunately it arrived rather badly_creased .
F	00 days_later they still hadn_'_t arrived .
M	maybe they want to wait_until they make the money back in sales before sending it out , or just hold it for a bit to make some interest .
M	the last two products i bought were faulty .
M	fantastic !
M	.
F	i can '_t_believe the choice available on fragrancedirect .
M	needed new inks for my hp_photosmart c0000 printer , ordered two a colour and black one , thought i would give them a try as nothing ventured nothing gained , after ages i got the printer to accept the coloured one as for the black after two_days of trying the printer would not accept it , maybe i was unlucky i dont_know as i am not a printer mechanic , but without me saying it you can guess where i will be getting my printer_inks in future , and if they ask me to return it as i am_disabled there is no way , i buy many different things using my computer , i will put it down to experience , as the saying goes you get what you pay for .
M	apparently even if you give the proper notice to switch line provider , and after they have given you a mac_code , if the new provider takes over the service even 0 day early , they hit you with this charge .
M	bought a graphics_card from them , about £_000 at the time .
M	i then realised i had made a mistake on the engraving so tried online_chat again and got better service and engraving changed .
M	i have used many supplement companies in the past , bodybuildingwarehouse is the only one i have returned too .
M	the problem was the hoards of teenage boys filling the practice rooms and shop floor all playing really loud and really badly .
M	however , since being sold by baa you have hiked up your prices and now levy a ' handling_fee ' for certain methods of payment .
M	i purchased a musto kingston coat from angling_active and the service is a credit to them fast and efficient and they were the cheapest on - line .
M	good value , as_described , free delivery and arrived next_day
F	ordering was easy and prices are very good when your pet is on long_term treatment . the website is well_laid_out and uncomplicated to order from also .
M	i wear contact_lenses most of the time so i wanted a pair of glasses as back up and didn_'_t want to pay too much but still wanted something of reasonable quality .
F	quick emails responses by the staff .
M	when call was answered , the computers were down and person wasn_'_t sure what the status of my order was , said they would call back ( sounding familiar ?).
M	after about half an_hour however , i was given two cars ; the second one without charge .
M	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
M	there is also no email sent to notify of goods dispatch .
M	the performance was appalling not able to go up the smallest of gradients .
F	big mistake .
M	i '_ve said all i need to say .
M	i will be using hertz next time .
M	this jean company is a fraud .
F	i waited_until it was valid ( after 0pm the next_day ) and tried to use it .
M	he couldnt understand_why i was getting annoyed .
M	just received my batteries one month to the day , i would
M	the result is constantly failing backups and a service that i cannot rely_on or trust and one that i have to supplement with local manual backups .
M	i ordered online around mid - afternoon and was surprised when my order turned_up the next_day .

M	my overall experience of surgery was tainted a lack of medical cover when a difficulty arose .
M	my teenage_son is addicted to pizza and over the last few_months we have tried several pizzahuts in london '_s west_end .
F	when i finally got through to the customer_services ( phone is always busy or not being picked_up ; also when promised to be called back , they did not do so ), i was told the 0rd item is still to be delivered .
M	they hold a great range of products .
M	i had read_reviews and comments regarding the onboard prices and they were not wrong .
M	based on my experience i wouldn_'_t use again .
M	good special_offers and well_presented bouquet .
M	would like the one piece to be replaced though .
F	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
F	det hade varit bra med_en bättre kvalitetskontroll som troligtvis hade upptäckt missfärgningen .
F	i will leave it up to you to decide if this is someone you would want to do_business with ?!
F	sadly only the shampoo was delivered ( but works really well !)
F	most complaints seemed to refer to the overnight ferry_crossings where a boat had been changed and the newer one was smaller so that there was no_longer enough room for all bookings .
F	me and my wife both sold our phones and we both got the price we were quoted very quick and prompt service would use again .
M	they also had clocked up over 00 miles on my car so not so impressed this time .
F	!
M	thankfully we had included our phone number in the purchase procedure and that was showing on the box and allowed the recipient to call us .
M	in addition , its prices are comparable with the cheapest ( for genuine goods ) on ebay .

M	thanks for everything
F	extremely easy and quick transaction .

M	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky_tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
M	and i would still recommend them .
F	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
M	rang on two other occasions , complaining the item hadn_'_t been delivered , the guy promised to come_back to me , heard_nothing at all .
F	poor performance we put down to out internet broadband_connection so eventually we upgraded it .
F	service is excellent , web - site easy to find your way around , there is no

M	i recently used watchfinder to source an omega_seamaster .

F	i have had a great experience with glasses_direct , and i would recommend them to anyone in search of their new frames .
M	. wish all bus and train services operated like the big_bus tours !
M	too expensive , otherwise a valuable service .

M	if there is a gutter in communication , facebook is right there .
F	website was easy to use , previewing item before final ordering .
M	easy transaction , fast delivery
F	the truth is that they are not happy to see i only ordered products on offer .
M	disappointing .
M	i used to love facebook , but someone somewhere is getting paid too much money to screw the site right up .
F	accessible through ebay , i was able to buy this style ( fluro animal ) in the size i wanted using paypal and they arrived quickly so i could wear them the next weekend .
M	items arrived on time , shipped by either dpd or a specalist " heavy move " courier and were as_described .
M	i received it 00 days after_placing the order .
F	trouble is the quantity doesn_'_t match the quality .
F	i chose to collect from store but even_though the order confirmation_email stated the store would ring / contact when it '_s ready , no one did .
F	when i got this later in the evening , i understood why this had been !
M	the delivery was fine , but this sort of attitude suggests a lack of customer_care .
M	i suspect another £_00 or so .
F	took a while to arrive and when it did delivery box was open and very soggy .
M	i ordered flowers well in advance for valentines_day , but the 00th came and went with no sign of the flowers .
F	really glad that i did service was quick and perfect , no_issues with product upon delivery and it turned_out being exactly how i hoped .
M	really helpful .
F	researched internet for best prices , fonebank came out on top , sent phones off , cheque came by return post , could not be simpler .
F	i rang to re - arrange the delivery & was told between 00 - 0 pm the next_day which was another work day so no - one at home .
F	will definitely buy from again .
F	i was so pleased with the service from glasses_direct , the free_trials service was great because i could see which frames suited me and then decide which to go for rather_than guessing !
F	the order didn_'_t arrive when it should have they said that a delivery had been attempted but no delivery note was left !
M	ordered by phone after_reviewing dutch barn shed and base online and needed to ask a few questions , which were answered fully .
M	repertoire is a decent website !
M	about twice each year i would trawl_through all the oil companies to see who was offering the best deal , this would take about an_hour each time .
M	i could have carried on driving and the car could have been seriously damaged , or the brakes could have failed etc_etc .
F	free delivery and my orders were received within 0_days .
M	when calling complaints , the advisor i spoke to told me he was the head trainer for consumer_law in the department .
M	please check emails in future .
F	great site , never a problem with bookings - but the quality varies hugely from one to another .
F	but the date on the coupon was already expired , like if you place order on the 0th of feb_0000 , the coupon expires on the 0th of june_0000 .
F	thumbs_up .
M	i have used thorntons and hotel chocolate in the past but now will use this company in future .
F	it seemed a task for staff to serve at the various bars .
M	excellent service from the tyre_fitting company .
M	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
F	we ordered a kitchen_sink and monobloc tap .
M	very impressive as i placed my order on the tuesday , the postage envelope turned_up on the thursday , posted the phone and the money was in my account on the friday lunch time .
F	keith and his_mate did an excellent job - i cannot_praise them highly_enough .
M	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account_managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
F	i '_ve_used petmeds twice_now and would recommend them for a fast , reliable service .
M	i did not receive any receipt from a garage , as he told me that i should contact you ( tyre_shopper ) to get it as i paid you , not them .
F	this is confusing for someone_who booked online and of course my home telephone_number was not recognised by the system .
F	my items were 00 small plastic_containers which arrived in a huge box .
F	0 large central lights sent urgently and received as promised the next_day , absolutely perfect .
M	was then given a last possible worse case delivery date of 00th of january .
M	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn_'_t completed the returns_slip !
M	on this occasion they didnt have the pressure_washer that i originally ordered as it was discontinued so i had to order a more_expensive product .
M	thanks rob
F	they only_thing they guarantee is taking your money .
M	would avoid .
M	in full so i was worried when i came back that i would be charged again
M	the service was very courteous , professional and extremely efficient and couldn_'_t be_faulted .
F	had 0nd eye done eye was a lot more painful this time for a week
F	0st_july , do i still want the order ?
M	i did phone up and was asked to send photo of the item i did receive , so they didnt take my name for it [ item cost less_than £ 0 ] item i got maybe at a guess £ 0 ].
F	it arrived and looked cheap , poor quality , no shape and far toooo long .
M	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
M	been dealing_with just_kampers since_0000 .
M	i paid and waited for the coin to arrive .
F	it does indicate i don_'_t expect people to use that entrance unless the storm doors are open to my front_door .
M	but the two were successfully combined in our ' shopping_basket '.
M	so i looked for a replacement and brought a salamander rhp 0 . 0 bar
F	wasted 0_weeks for the blind to be put up .
M	hermes do not , they park down the road , or behind the office and wont walk up the stairs to collect from us .
M	00 / 00 , a really good service to use , but check stoke levels by talking to someone if you need the quick .
F	and then inform_me if i still wanted the item (!?!?!
F	i explained the recipient was disabled , over 000_miles from me and relys on the help of carers and that to get a photos would be difficult .
M	but they had it in stock , so i ordered anyway .
M	you can trust you are not going to be ripped_off
M	bad points are that my flat is on the second floor but they would only deliver it to the first floor , leaving me to carry a 00kg package by myself .
F	made a complaint to expedia by phone shortly_after arriving at the " hotel ".
F	the whole point was missed , however ,.
M	delivery is prompt enough for me .
M	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
F	special instructions : please kindly deliver as late as possible but before 0pm as birthday is on sunday only .
F	i ordered the silver collar stiffeners as a gift for my husband .
M	i just want my money back !.
F	rentify archives all your adverts so the next time you need to advertise a property ( and this could be in two years time or longer ) the advert will still be there , in your account .
F	always prompt , good prices , never have any_problems .
F	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
F	we had a lovely week and will definitely use villaplus again .
F	when i asked to be returned to my original contact i was ignored with no explanation what so ever .
M	i bought a pair of beetle wings which im_afraid are ' nt that good regards the quality that there made .
F	well this was over 0_days ago and the last response i had was yesterday morning asking me to respond by 0000 if i wanted delivery today , i responded_immediately but of course nothing .
M	ordered a costume and paid £_00 for express delivery only for my product to arrive after the date for which it was needed .
F	we still have the tickets and would appreciate a refund .
M	the whole service was disappointing .
M	at last i have got my refund of over £_000 , but it '_s taken almost a month .
M	they were great pulled up told them i was booked for tyres to be fitted they said back in bay lad will watch you in asked what i wanted done i told them and they got on with the job i had a coffee from the machine and next thing signed paperwork and my van was ready to leave there site job_done great service would recommend them 0st_class
F	i was flabbergasted and appalled .
M	arranged for the flowers to be delivered on a specific day as special_occasion .
M	micro - manage people !
M	keep_up the good work ao setting the benchmark for others !
M	they are easy to deal with , friendly and professional when you encounter a problem and most_importantly they are great on price and service .
F	it is such poor quality .
F	would recommend to anyone and everyone .
M	they also used the same to silence an entire community forum from sharing with you the truth .
F	i phoned customer service and was informed that the pictures were for illusration purposes and were not of the actual item ( you have to ask why_bother then ?)
F	hopefully they will be sent back post_haste and be of an excellent quality as the other 0 are .
F	the goods arrived very promptly and at the time and date stated .
M	plus , it '_s very attractive and fits_perfectly !!!
F	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
F	then i emailed again as my daughters_birthday was the 00th_may .
F	they were ready to be downloaded a week before the event as they had stated when i purchased them .
M	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
M	the fact management took time out and called to discuss the order and delay issues i think shows genuine commitment , care , and strive to taking positive / proactive steps forward .
M	would not_hesitate in recommending this company .
M	clear_instructions and paperwork .
F	the skirt is full_length and has a mesh lining within which is nice and warm for this weather .
F	the other 00_% however , is not so great , i have had many broken / damaged items which have to go back , incorrect items , things taking months , things withdrawn after purchase - ie they have had my money for a month or so and then say the items are not available , customer_services is only by email and therefore slow .
F	brilliant company fast delivery and fantastic communication
M	they want me to remove the remaining surviving screw and photograph it so they know what sort of screw to send me as replacement .
F	however one large box of the tiles was completely damaged on receipt and the young_lady i spoke to at walls and floors was quite curt and abrupt when i rang to explain .
F	i was recommended by a friend who had used watchfinder .
M	no_hassle web_site , and easy contact if any_problems . 000_% satisfied .
F	had a few things go missing and was resent without_any_problems .
M	i have tried to phone you find out what has happened but despite your website giving 00 . 00 as your closing time for a friday your phone system is closed . also poor service .
M	arrived next_day once i queried its whereabouts so 00 / 00 for the customer_services group who sorted it out !
F	just a thought .
M	great product , great service ,
F	i would definitely use shopto again !
M	got the exact tent i wanted for a much_cheaper price and more quickly delivered than anyone_else on the whole flippin ' internet .
F	i ordered flowers for my mum in law for mothers_day , she was so delighted with the basket and colours of the flowers .
M	when i went back and read the small_print , as i should have done at first , it was clear that this was not so .
F	i ordered a large pack of goodies and have not been disappointed .
M	easy to order . prompt same day contact by phone .
F	i would like to see recyclable alterantives being used which would fit better with the ethos of healthy , organic and sustainable produce .
M	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
F	we are taking note and watching !
M	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior_warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer service .
M	if i was looking to buy any supplement products i would use bodybuilding_warehouse first .
M	a bit disappointed steve from hoddesdon
F	i noticed its " compare market " link shows giffgaff as the cheapest payg uk provider .
F	staff reflect their surroundings and dont care either .
M	and you can '_t verify yourself to make a review using your email .
M	excellent service , fantasticl products , quick delivery , 0st_class purchasing experience :-)
F	!
F	maybe because they were orchids , maybe because that '_s usual for serenata , i don_'_t know - but i wouldn_'_t have ordered them if i '_d known .
F	xx
M	next time i will just go to a shop rather and buy the item directly .
M	so , overall the experience was ok but a bit rough around the edges .
M	ordered it one day got the next brilliant service
M	we have had a high_spec kitchen fitted .
M	however the car given was a nice citroen , despite not being the car i had paid for and promised .
M	so who made and kept the copy ?
M	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
M	for a few_pence more you can have lovely coffee delivered from a pod that works every time , no mess , no_hassle .
F	yet a couple of weeks_later the took the money and sent the book to the local_store .
M	on the plus_side wide_range offered and cost pretty competitive so maybe my experience is somewhat isolated .
M	i then needed to get a couple of the links removed , so again i called in to the store in the royal_exchange at bank and terry then helped with assisting me to make_sure i got the right fit .
F	in the instructions box i specifically said " she will be in the house so please knock on the door ."
F	ok i thought to myself i will just cancel one . not so easy as you have to wait for delivery before sending it back !
F	everything comes really quickly & i have never had anything damaged or broken because they pack things so well .
M	something needs to be done :(
M	not much to say really .
F	!
F	description and variety on web_site is fantastic .
M	i ' d recommend maximuscle and their products to anyone .
M	i took my wife to town and dropped her off at the shop in bold street to do a exchange , she was served first by a assiatant who again was very help full but the manageress took over and this is were it changed .
F	not at all happy !
F	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
M	the website was easy to use .
F	mrs worden
F	when there is a choice of delivery providers , i choose yodel as they are usually very quick in delivery , including_saturdays .
M	terrible company .
M	watch this space and i will update in a few weeks .
M	i would_gladly order from kenable again .
M	driver told us they can '_t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
M	when i raised this with them it took 0 days to get a response .
M	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn_'_t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
M	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day '_s hosting .
F	its so convenient
M	i cant_comment !
F	we urgently_needed a good car set toy for a long car journey and it arrived promptly and was just the ticket !
M	my business partner ordered a euro instant trading solution from them .
F	the flowers were not delivered to where they needed to go to .
F	great company
F	after a short_period and the parcel had not been located they replaced the goods free of charge .
F	i was informed that i would have too pay an amount for dropping the car at a different location when i picked_up the car , that an additional driver could be included or free & i availed of the excess .
M	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
M	one final note is the sheer_amount of emails i receive from yourselves around 0 a day minimum , the fact u bombard people with emails will probably make them not want to purchase things off you .
M	there is nothing difficult here to understand !
F	would highly_recommend kiddies_kingdom .
M	even this morning they look tired .
F	you keep posting package with home delivery without placing my phone number over the package .
F	my husband and i are desperately_trying to put it down as a bad_experience , and are trying to just forget about the villa .
M	what a refreshing_change for a company to have excellent customer service , second to none !
M	!
M	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music_equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
M	very very poor .
M	obviously our order can '_t have been shipped when it said it was . mis_- communication .
M	the thing is with virgin , if it is working it is great but prepare yourselves for when it isn_'_t .
F	this also translates in stock sent out in its factory clear bags and a posting bag .
M	!
F	i sent a further e_- mail and photo '_s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
F	0 simple_steps and then you got cover and it was reasonably_priced as well .
F	the service was great in that i was kept up to date with the posting of my goods etc .
M	i am not pleased with my purchase as its faulty as a first time buyer from this website i don_'_t expect the goods to be faulty .
M	the people i corresponded with by email and by telephone were very helpful and sent a replacement very quickly .
M	my 0st experience of buying from ph and i was well pleased with everything from ease of use of the website to the speed in which it arrived .
M	the quality of the items is excellent .
M	spot on .
M	great but do you have any advice that would cost me nothing more .
F	i have used this service for a number of years and found it to be swift , accurate and friendly .
M	further more as they havent followed it up i shalnt use them again in the future .
F	all of the family enjoyed these exellent steaks would definetly reccomend .
F	after some reservations_about sending my htc_desire phone to an_unknown company in exchange for £_00 i was very pleased with the service i received from fonebank .
F	so , yea , i definitely recommend them !
M	i usually find a few %_off using a discount_code too .
F	i would definitely use trophy_store again .
F	i '_m just about to sit my cbt so wanted just a basic helmet and gloves to wear on the day .
M	the unfair part of the contract in my view is that you have to pay for a full_tank of fuel on collection and , as the desk said , " waste it " before you bring it back .
M	the outdoor shop provided a first_class service and i would recommend them to anyone_wishing to buy from their range of goods .
F	simon said that their terms and conditions clearly_stated that parts that had been fitted but not used would not be refunded .
M	the folding fischer walking_stick is of very good quality & arrived very quickly .
F	this is the first time i '_ve bought dentocare products online .
M	so i decided to contact them via their online email form .
M	on arrival ( after a delay of one day over the guaranteed delivery date due to royal_mail mislaying a bag ) was annoyed that a 0000 coin arrived .
F	such an easy and smooth_transaction .
M	apart_from a little_confusion at first over items in stock / items not in stock the order arrived promptly in good condition and i '_m very happy with it
M	partmaster and they asked for additional fridge number information but i had given it the first time .
F	excellent service , easy to use site , from stock check to ordering to payment .
M	!
M	i question whether i will use tyre_shopper again
F	0 .
M	well_done to the customer service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
F	stayed in for 0 full days including requested day for delivery - and no chance wouldn_'_t hear the door .
F	dubole that i dont_know i send flowers to my mum finland 0 times a year . anne
M	emails and txts telling exactly when your items will arrive
M	they should stick to making volkswagens . lol
F	it was such an easy thing to arrange .
F	they are not to be trusted .
M	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
M	the box was sent to our registered address and not to the factory address as requested .
M	so instead of putting in another order for more than £_000 plus exchanging the bedding i got to a larger_size which i would have paid the difference in price .
F	been using petmeds for a couple of years_now and never been disappointed with the service - always prompt and good prices
F	the costume i wore was the brittania dress one .
F	as i had a nubuck cleaning block i was able to remove them ( 00_%) & decided not to return as i need them next week .
F	this was sent back my royal_mail .
F	very happy customer .
F	totally duped and down right conned .
F	i ordered my sunglasses using a groupon_voucher .
F	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
M	these products are great .
F	i don_'_t reccomend to anyone !
M	easy to order and prompt delivery .
M	so the ordering and installation went really well and the price was great !
M	couldn_'_t fault the time it took to receive the flowers , 00_minutes .
M	my car is a ford_focus which i drove to the airport in england with passengers and luggage comfortably .
F	i just do not know how the can continue to trade .
M	great service and just what i wanted .
M	words are cheap and actions speak_louder_than words .
F	this can then be a long_drawn_out process for little reward .
M	i liked the price of the item and it was delivered quickly and in excellent condition .
F	would be very happy to recommend them to friends or to use them again myself .
F	yes , would totally recommend and now know where to go to first when seeking a similar product .
F	uk power networks said that the meter was your responsibility and had to be replaced by utility_warehouse as the supplier .
F	every_aspect of dealing_with bisley_direct has_been a pleasure .
F	it was less hamper more just shredded_paper in a box , especially when compared with the wicker_basket and tissue_paper that the virginia hayward contents were presented in .
M	found the blade unlock very hard to use and am still trying to find saw as advertised .
M	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
M	it is a disgrace .
F	ordered some contact_lens and to know faulk to lenstore they did what they was supposed to do .
M	no contact so_far after complaint
M	if u are in uk , do not use them !
F	one printer i ordered wasn_'_t the right size for my office and printerland made it so easy to return that printer and order a more appropriate sized one .
F	the virgin flight staff are lovely and helpful . but the space i found was not good enough for the price we paid for our flight . go premium class . well_worth it . x
F	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
F	packages arrived on time and service online and via telephone was speedy .
F	really happy with product , which honestly i always i '_m , just a shame never a sale on as i '_d buy a lot more
M	went over to the milton_keynes branch last_week .
M	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial_contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
M	didn_'_t like the ' add £_00 if you want size 00 ' - that was a con .
F	i ordered a pair of biom walking_shoes .
F	thanks
F	the order arrived in a very strong box , however more packing tape could be used to seal the box , especially with fresh_meat inside , the single length of tape across the boxes length was nowhere strong_enough to hold the boxes weight and the 0 main flaps had seperated and the box was partially open , the box contents was still cold though .
M	very easy to book on line , and competitive_prices , but slightly_confusing in terms of process when arriving at airport .
F	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
M	called company to check all was well with order , spoke to a foreign lady , quite unhelpful , typical receptionist , told me they were not in stock and i had to wait a few weeks ,( they had my money !)
M	i think it '_s time for a fresh network come december !
F	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
F	we had to spend a lot of time working out where things were and how they operated .
M	not the suppliers fault i am sure .
F	thankyou very much !
M	would recommend .
F	holiday travel may be a money spinner , but i think this is just a little unnecessary .
M	but thay left it out side and i didn_'_t get the chocolate
M	this is great when i am so busy and need that support .
M	mats were delivered quickly and in my opinion very good quality and value for money .
M	had a great experience using loco0 , the ease of use and the speed of response was outstanding .
M	treated_myself to a business class seat from arlanda to heathrow .
M	i get about £_000 back every year , and it '_s tax free , as it is a discount on purchases .
F	not a good food choice for children and there were quite a few children on board thought there would be more .
M	i sent the items back and they were indeed found to be faulty .
M	website ordering excellent .
M	would i recommend them to a friend ?
M	i wouldn_'_t shop with any other company .
M	used before and will use again .
F	nobody listened , they just rattled off another email using set phrases .
M	now looking at other ones .
F	no flexibility .
F	really great customer service
M	my god .
M	it would seem i am not the only customer complaining of returned shoes .
M	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small_amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
M	i wiuld not_hesitate to recomend mazuma they are excellant
F	i ordered one day , and it was delivered by noon the next , also i was kept_informed by email of the progress
F	i will be using this company again .
F	i ordered about 0pm one day & the parcel was delivered to perthshire , scotland the next_day .
F	great website , easy to use with idiot_proof instructions for the computer_illiterate .
M	so to get a 0_star_review based on user getting an item super quick is harder as we , as good retailers do this in our sleep .
M	great company initially however when i arrived at the airport ( bordeaux ) the chap behind the desk was unable to read my special request which was simply for a car_seat for a three year_old .
F	i spent a long time looking for flowers for my sister '_s birthday , on the internet the flowers that i ordered looked blue .
F	this service is very useful for transporting bulky items reliably from one office to a private home , i would return and do this again .
F	to date i have had no reply to the e_mail and no apology for such shoddy service .
F	do not instruct maid0clean ever !
M	plus my tyres were cheap !
M	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
F	hi , i use interparcel regulary and our courier is always the same one and very friendly , the website is very easy to use and quick especially as i can store all my customers addresses and card_details on line .
F	i was disappointed with the last batch i ordered , the scent had changed - has this been reformulated , can only smell the aldehydes ?
M	not sure i would use chillisauce again unless they sort_out there confirmation of rooms and follow_up issues with some type of apology as hopefully i only have one stag_do .
F	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
M	i should have been given what i ordered and paid for .
M	by 00am on delivery day nothing had arrived so i decided to call to find out what time i might expect it .
F	the prices are great and much_lower ( for my items anyway ) than
M	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
F	as i sit here on the last day of september waiting for a technician to deign to turn_up . again , we still don_'_t have our ' perfect sofa '.
M	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling_regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
F	good upload and viewing options before purchase of canvas_print .
F	the following_day they called me to confirm that my glasses had been received , and to check what thickness lenses i required .
F	staff very helpful and polite .
M	0_weeks_later grips and chain arrive .
F	ordering was easy and the price was great - a pair of glasses and a pair of sunglasses , both with thinner_lenses than standard for about £_000 - brilliant .
M	being somewhat nervous_about ordering cards online having heard plenty of horror_stories in the past i have been blown_away with how good the people at magic_madhouse are from the prompt dispatches to the really helpful sales staff i honestly cant say enough good things about them but will leave you with 0 examples . the thursday before_xmas i ordered about 00 quids_worth of cards for myself and others . couple of yugioh starter decks and a booster box . now xmas being the following wednesdayand xmas post being its usual helpful self i was fully expecting ( and would have been happy with ) a j begining of jan_0000 delivery . the very next_day my items were dispatched and the following_monday my items turned_up . thats the monday before_xmas !!!!!!!!
F	!
M	the agent took one look at my allianz insurance_cover and laughed !
M	if you must use sites like these my advice would be to use another one .
F	we would not use this service again .
M	cheaper in kwick_fit by £ 0 . 00 , not a big issue , as this was a partner of csma it should have been a bit cheaper .
M	it is utterly rubbish .
M	not in a box .
M	was looking for a key for a game i wanted and found this site through google .
M	not clear it was coming from spain
M	customer service is excellent at apologising .
F	on return sadly a different_story as we had to wait 00_minutes for pick_up in wet cold and windy_weather .
M	this is the third time i have ordered a camera ' over the years ', and i must_say how pleased i am with this company .
F	got email asking for more money as new frames more_expensive .

F	four days_later my parcel arrived with two_pairs of trousers that were identical !
F	the whole villa looked as if it had been decorated in 0000 which was a bit of a shame .
M	we were very happy with the items and the prompt delivery .
F	most of the clothing i have ever purchased has had to be sent back for being poor quality .
M	if they can sort it out by the end of the day they will have redeemed_themselves somewhat , but i '_m really not impressed .
M	fantastic service and delivery .
F	usually i end up having to collect my parcel when i have been out
F	lenses from here arrived few_days_later .

F	i am quite prepared to believe that i made the wrong choice of coffee although i did try 0 different_varieties .
M	as a regular_user , you can arrange a regular delivery with the added_bonus of a 00_%_discount .
M	really good to have a such a brilliant reliable electrical wholesaler , pity you were not located closer to me as i would use your team everyday
M	very competitive_prices and clear item details but lacking good comms .
F	easiest sell i have ever done and no fees were taken out , defiantly will use them again .
M	all they seem interested in is selling me an overpriced second_hand kindle .
F	excellent service , prompt and efficient delivery to ireland
F	showerdoc were extremely_helpful and knowledgable !
M	i had to leave for work so they promised that someone would be in touch to rearrange same day delivery .
M	the place was easy to find but when the employee gone out to deliver another car he asked me to stay outside the rental office in the hot sun to wait for him .
F	which made my total order amount appear to be £_00 when it was £_00 . 00 as stated on my invoice .
M	finally had a phone_call at 0 . 00pm saying tyres were in .
F	never again will i use an overprice well_known high_street diy_store .
F	service and delivery excellent , very happy with the table we purchased good value for money good solid table .

F	they didn_'_t offer a refund nor a holding response that they would check with royal_mail .
F	i am yet to test my theory on double_sided velcro because i need to find some first .
F	lauren
M	they promise one thing but their customer_support is shocking .
M	you should be really proud of yourself because this must have made you millions of pounds whilst distressing thousands of your customers , not just me .
F	first time ordering from this company and would definetly use them again . i had asked a couple of questions_regarding delivery and postage and they answered me literally straight_away which was very helpful !!!
M	faultless service .
F	i would recommend that you look elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .

M	had a rush job on and the power_tools were delivered as promised , great service .
F	i had a poor customer experience in the covent_garden shop and was unable to try on the range of sizes i needed .
F	quite_expensive for what you actually get , although there is a good range to choose from .
M	!
M	the charge for returning was a further £_00 !!!
M	i also love the way it remembers our personal details , so forming a second company with common ownership etc couldn_'_t be easier !
F	completed online quick easy and straight_forward so simple to do , great price very reasonable for a impressive policy offer .
F	i ordered on line easily , one evening but when i realised that delivery could take a few_days and i wanted it earlier , i rang to cancel at 0 . 00 the start of the next working day .
F	called to order and i was told no price match on chanel and they had made a mistake .
F	this made us late for a dinner reservation and was very annoying .
M	however , the boiler suit was poor quality and the zip_broke after a few uses in one night .
M	the site said order before 00 and you '_ll have it the next_day so i was expecting it to arrive the day after .
M	i have spent in excess of £ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
M	the entire time i was working on getting my payment done , i was helped very professionally and with nice care .
M	i couldn_'_t be more happy .
F	i recommend it to anyone who needs to use earplugs frequently or for different occasions .
M	barry hester
F	placed an order for anbesol liquid , you took card_details and sent me an_email_confirmation with order number .
F	after we placed the order on - line , i wish it was required that every order is discussed with a customer representative .
F	im used to flower_deliveries ive bought from other_florists arriving alot earlier !
M	i also don_'_t remember the system ever presenting me with a final order to confirm everything before it went_onto payment , though i might be mis_- remembering .
M	i bought two haynes manuals from np_autoparts .
F	i ordered on 00 jan_0000 , today is 00 feb_0000 and i still don_'_t have my order .

F	the call_centre cannot answer any_questions about delivery .
M	no_problems at all with this parking company .
F	dear catherine ,
M	i requested next_day delivery .
M	i '_m quite reasonable , but i will not be treated as a fool .
M	if the item is in stock , urban_industry will always be opt he first place i order my kicks from !
F	transferwise is actually the best idea ever .
M	away we went .
M	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
F	placed order and quoted delivery by tuesday .
F	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
M	i cancelled the order verbally and followed up with an email to their after - sales address .
F	i bought the metal shed about two_weeks_ago , just check against the list of items and found three parts_missing ( gable brace and both side of the angle caps ) and the included anchoring kit too !!!!!
M	i ordered an extension_cable for my keyboard .
M	they charge a reasonable and flexible fee which is in line with the service that they provide .

F	excellent service and great quality .
F	in debt your are now £_00 in debt .
F	have saved them in my favourites on my tablet and will definitely be using them again !
F	i was delighted with the service , nicola staczek was great at following up , chasing artwork , spotting that the original didn_'_t look good and getting it amended .
F	my mum in law ended_up getting forced_into a contract with them due to a family_member not paying the bill in her name and they were absolutely awful when she called to try and get a copy of the original contact and change the tariff .
F	if you can get that wrong - what else ?
M	i ordered flowers as a present for my girlfriend while she is at uni .
M	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
F	the only_reason you have one star is that a lovely girl called rosie very kindly arranged to have our package redelivered in lucy '_s absence and was very friendly and helpful .
F	i went in to the jessops store on manchester to look at examples of the different albums to help me decide on what size to get , what type of cover and to get design ideas .
M	i have spent of £ 0000 in the store as they are pretty_much my fist stop for games electronics ect always offering great prices .
M	well so there you are , no car everything closed and holding for rentalcars . com to pick_up the phone .
F	go with someone_else .
F	the service has always been excellent and very speedy .
F	at other_sites , i was paying as much for shipping as i would pay for each bottle , but supplementwarehouse . com was much less for both .
F	i guess im lucky i got the items at all .
M	very speedy and professional company !!
F	very very happy .
M	even phoned to confirm a few details .
F	it took four deliveries of the same blind for it to arrive undamaged .
F	spectrum really are great to work with !
M	so easy !
F	we costumes were supposed to be delivered on friday , we were going to a party on saturday , so no costumes
M	i ordered the same product by in slightly_larger_quantities .
F	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
F	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
F	i was furious to say the least and cancelled the order , rejecting an offer of an upgraded delivery for the next_day .
M	isn_'_t it amazing that to be able to sample the best of something as great as chocolate is relatively affordable !
F	customer service good .
F	she isn_'_t yet aware of them arriving but i '_m now going to have to tell her so that she won_'_t think i '_ve been on some inferior site and sent shoddy flowers .
F	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
M	gb0e - q0rp - tsc0 - bk0o
M	didn_' like having to pay for a full_tank .
M	seats were comfortable and plenty of room .
M	it is great knowing we have found a designer that we can use again and again .
F	i '_m so impressed . am thinking of putting something on my facebook_page . even the bit about the babies !
F	the delivery guy left it on the street lent against the house as said he couldn_'_t move it further due to a bad shoulder .
F	they are the taking effect and im feeling happier and healthier .
F	speedy delivery but the packaging wasn_'_t strong_enough and the product leaks .
F	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
F	the product was good value .
M	i dread to think what simplysupplements paid for what was allegedly a 00 hour delivery .
M	very pleased with price & quality of product - upset that the delivery company took it to a different company ( shop ) some half mile_away and it was only due to their dillegence that they rad the label and bothered to get it to me .
F	they do what they say they will , no_catches , no_grumbles .
F	im a v . happy customer x
M	cue highly anxious husband waiting desperately for doorbell to ring .
M	guide was humorous and knowledgeable , fun experience
F	it '_s just that their expectations may not be the same as yours if you are middle_aged / elderly .
M	at £_00 against a product price of £_000 this was exorbitant .
F	product is excellent and was delivered exactly when it said it would be .
F	harrison from dialaflight arranged our flights and car_hire for our recent_trip to the usa .
M	i would recommend it to friends .
F	the blinds were delivered exactly when promised , fitted_perfectly and look great .
M	this takes them 00 days to return .
F	i have emailed enquiries at wowcher and have asked to cancel my order and get my money back .
M	thanks to guy and the back office team at warrington for this .
F	there were no_problems at all with their service and recipient was happy with flowers .
F	overall , a friendly service but a little disappointed in the final_result .
M	excellent service from the company and the carrier .
F	on arriving and parking the car at the long_stay car_park the signs as to where you had parked were not easily seen .
F	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
F	ordering was easy and delivery was on time .
M	i much prefered buying from status as i could collect on the way home , and compare the goods new for old , before handing_over the cash .
F	to this day , i still_haven_'_t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
M	cleans main floor areas but useless for corners .
M	that '_s what tracked mail costs , you are probably just overcharging to boost your profits for an extra few_pounds by being so cheap and not tracking your post .
M	or do you need to re - train staff !
M	the shed was of dissapointing quality .
M	coffee fine but plastic capsules not as good in my magimix machine as the real thing and feel as if they are putting a terrific strain on it when i close the lever .
F	it was absolutely ridiculous !
F	also the frame had dust and dirt and i can see small scratch around the glasses , - obviously dispatched very careless .
M	i think you do this so that people will think they are getting a good offer and then have to buy the other one because they have payed so much for pp .
F	for once i '_d taken out the insurance and thought it wouldn_'_t be too complicated a process to claim .
M	if any manager from this watch_hut reading this please get a grip of your staff , or you all will be out of a job .
M	i did have a problem with the laptop supplied , not a simplyasus problem i might_add , and the technical supprt team were excellent with the resolution of the situation .
F	received an_email a week_later telling_me order being delivered that day , over two_weeks and several emails chasing , still no delivery .
M	but because oak_furnitureland wash their hands of any responsibility with regards to returning items , we are keeping it .
F	good size and for price paid well_worth it
M	the grower contacted us to apologise and explain that the pellets were slug pellets ( rat_poison , slug poison . both are not really part of a healthy_diet ).
M	booked next - day delivery for an exercise_bike .
M	in practice , however , it only dispatches dark red and this only becomes apparent once the goods are delivered .
M	they received it , checked it and put the money in my bank the same day , and i had it cleared in my account 0 days_later .
M	the risk of getting something whilst on board was too high .
M	i have purchased a number of watches from various companies in the last few_years but i have to say terry at watchfinder has_been great .
F	if i do get through , i get the impression no - one gives a damn and i don_'_t get an_apology or a justified reason as to why my delivery is either missing or delayed .
F	quick , easy and reliable service .
M	i lost some treasured rayban wrap - arounds bought in the usa just before receiving the latest email and decided to give them a try .
F	men selv at betale for det kunne_ikke lade sig gøre .
F	i was contacted about half way through the morning scheduled for the fitting so had waited around for their arrival only to be told they would then not be coming .
M	the cushions are not made of an appropriate material .
F	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
F	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
M	i told_him to send the package back to amazon !
M	0 to 0 working_days days for delivery not acheived
M	dale
F	i am happy to send you a photo of the fault and send them back , please advice what email address to send the pictures to ?
M	this german company delivered valentines_day flowers four days late into holland .
M	i would recommend this company to friends .
M	the one important_thing about the service received was that though the money was ordered for a monday and the confirmation_email sent on the previous friday made it quite clear that unless a saturday delivery had been paid for that is when it would be delivered it was delivered on saturday anyway .
M	however last_week i received an email from them advising me that due to limited stock they would need me to pay in advance for a game called quantum break for xbox one , or my pre_- order would be made available to other customers .
F	the sizes are very strange , very long legs on trousers .
M	i would say , its the cheapest buy , and knowing what you buy works , but when i bought it i tried the ps0 and switched it on , but the controller kept blinking and didn_'_t work properly , as it had a faulty usb connection .
F	reason being , i was short despatched on an item and the length of time it took to resolve the replacement of the missing item along with poor communication means that my confidence to order with them again has_gone .
M	i '_ll use you again
F	i '_ll buy again .
M	competence of communications - 0 *
F	because of this it has often come unclipped from the brackets .
M	when we arrived at terminal 0 , we eventually found the avis_desk , which advised us to report to terminal 0 !
M	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
M	( sounds allegedly only audible to mice .)
F	moreover , once i put a wrong_address by mistake and only noticed it when i got shipment confirmation .
F	amazing service , perfect - he came he loaded all our rubbish , was smiley and friendly and drive it all to the commercial tip so we didn_'_t have to - def use them again :)
F	but : over the years there have been so many cut backs , which has made the trip less enjoyable .
M	at no point was a refund offered for the priority delivery that was so blatantly flouted .
M	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let_me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
M	popular guitar took_ages to arrive .
M	despite going through in fine detail my phone order with the assistant , the delivery was not as ordered .
F	i carefully chose from the selection shown as ' available for delivery that day ', a bunch to the taste , colour and favourite blooms of my mum who is a keen_gardener and knows her plants !
F	avoid at all costs and find a reputable_company to deal with .
M	they could have dropped the box to me out of the sky and it would still arrived in perfect_condition .
F	however , i thought it was a shame that i had to pay £_00 return for my ticket , when i was under the impression that advance tickets that are also civ are available sometimes . but not from your website ?
F	not even an_email to say why .
M	i had been advised it was the divertor valve and then the circuit_board , but it was this part that solved the fault .
M	i have used wiggle on several_occasions , i find their website easy to use , informative regarding the items being purchased and their postage is fast and free !
M	this form was emailed to me but was a standard form , what was the point of that ?
M	thanks .
M	overall it worked out well for us , thanks
M	i arrived to be tenth in a que of never moving people .
F	i do wish they ` d get bigger_sizes in .
F	awful .
F	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
M	the service and speed of delivery was excellent .
F	i would highly_recommend serenata_flowers .
M	then , i get a call on the day of delivery that the driver had been waiting outside my house and could not wait any longer and had left .
M	because the co - op reduced my credit to £_000 .
F	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une_semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
M	it was rushed out for the next monday - the day i was leaving so i had a real rush fitting it .
M	in the meantime no phonecall , email or text to say why it was taking so long .
M	the 00 - day no_quibble money back guarantee makes buying from them totally risk - free , not to mention excellent value .
F	they gave_me a time_slot the evening before delivery and stuck to it !
F	black iphone 0 being delivered to my door in the snow at christmas was another thumbs_up .
M	needed tyres urgently and caqrl at their call_centre was really helpful and sorted_out quickly and without_fuss !
M	after waiting for 0_weeks i got fed_up with all abbeys excuses , got husqvarna involved and they sent me a new blade themselves and it arrived the next_day , as abbey still hadn_'_t sent one .
M	there is no choice of type of paper ( e . g .
F	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
M	ordered a slack handful of tankards and shot glasses all arrived quick and in one peice .
F	we ordered a small shed from internet_gardener last_week .
F	so i '_m still trying to get compensation for everything they did wrong to me & for costs_incurred as a result of being suddenly cut_off without_any warning !
M	the beautiful area of wye valley and forest of dean on the doorstep .
M	i would defiantly use them again
M	so my rating is 0 , overall my issues got resolved swiftly and i '_m satisfied with the product now , but guess my initial_impressions were not great with the delivery mix_up , lack of product sealing and missing part , but all were since explained and accounted for .
M	would recommend with a 0_star_rating .
F	cant recommend enough , and the actual food packets taste good for being on a weight_loss programme .
M	thanks .
F	would , and will recommend to anyone_wanting light_bulbs .
M	these relate to the apparent three_attempts she has made to deliver the delivery .
M	from opening the order to recieving the cheque took less_than a week .
M	three years_ago i booked a rtw ticket with rte and the service was very good , particularly when on arriving in sydney my travel_arrangements were compromised by cyclone yasi .
M	if i had realised there was no option to talk to a human i would not have used their service .
M	i found travel house quoting excellent business class fares online last saturday .
F	also , i had sent an_email asking if the petticoat was included , which was promptly answered ( it wasn_'_t included ).
M	neither of the ladies were particularly welcoming either .
M	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
M	i dropped my car off with the company , all very easy .
M	just from the customer service alone encouraged me to make my final_decision on the purchase so i would recommend this shop to people starting on their musical journey to those on a career path .
F	0 different strings have came away in first few daysand mechanism for pulling blinds up and down isnt very smooth at all and needs to be played around with to get blinds down
F	b ) they would be as good as the picture
M	i have to say that what i '_ve seen and eaten so_far has_been great .
M	had my vouchers the following_tuesday .
F	found the site very easy to use .
M	they simply provide apparatus for these " deals " and contracts between individuals and traders / movers to go_ahead .
F	i had a voucher worth more than $ 0000 and thought that the wording meant i couldn_'_t use it .
F	great service .
F	found site by_accident and ordered because of other excellent reviews .
F	given the value of the quilt - £_00 . 00 – i find this quite insulting .
F	we arrived later than_expected and were quite stressed and was worried to see cars driving round and round trying to find a space .
M	every day i get emails with dozens of wowcher offers ( most , if not all are not in my choice category !)
F	turnaround time was quick , and i am delighted with both the products i ordered and the general level of service .
M	as a customer for some years and using the service to protect the data for a small company ( 0 pcs ) we need a service we can_rely_on .
F	i have been contacting them for the last_week .
M	my review and all other reviews were removed .
M	i wonder were the manager was , and worse still when a potential customer leaves your store will they come_back .
F	arranged an exchange but had to call again to bring price of boots back down .
F	promotion invalidated because tesco couldn_'_t deliver goods advertised ( 0_weeks in a row )
M	reasonably_priced .
F	they were not .
M	on the plus_side the delivery was very prompt .
F	nothing much more to say that the above .
F	i awaited more detail regarding the time but after 0_days had nothing .
M	i needed to return them due to fit and reorder the correct_size which again arrived very quickly .
F	prepare to be wowed_by a company that truly understands what great customer service means .
F	no waiting time staff were all polite as we are bikers and dress rough would definitely use you again .
F	all their costs are hidden and when we add them up they are not far from hertz / europcar etc and less hassle .
M	good quality products with a prompt service .
M	they should add this on their website or perhaps only allow 0 item to be bought online .
F	lovely carpet and quick delivery
F	our children loved being so close to the beach .
F	won_'_t be buying again from this website !
M	they could not offer a replacement soon .
M	mazuma make it easy , fun and simple to sell your unwanted_mobile_phone .
F	first order lost by carrier , but this was picked_up by polybags who swiftly issued a new order .
M	despite a disapointing flash banner on their website suggesting ' free delivery ' - this comes with some caveats that were not mentioned by the sales staff even after having a conversation about needing the kit quickly and then after the delivery date had passed , discovering that it had not ben sent yet due to being ' upgraded ' to free delivery - the kit is good quality and after a small rant on the phone they shipped it next_day for no charge .
F	call 0 - oh sorry , your order was cancelled you should have been told and have been refunded , and oh_yes you should have been told when you called earlier as we knew then .
F	described as ` magenta ` which is a maroon pink , shocking_pink arrived , so i was disappointed as i had spent valuable time selecting the right colour .
M	these are the same thickness as my old glasses !
F	had used excel for many_years but learnt lots of things i didn_'_t know were there , also lots of shortcuts .
F	why do people waste thier money on such shoddy service and over priced delivery charges
F	items ordered arrived as per delivery estimate but the way they were packed was a big_disappointment .
M	very good service and highly_recommended if you want a quirky gift for someone that already has everything !
F	communication was very poor i have been charged for a cross_trainer i have still not received .
M	we bought 0 chairs in store back on january 00th and were astounded to be told that they would be delivered on march 00nd .
F	awaiting delivery of outstanding order .
M	i would either like to get what i ordered or my money back a . s . a . p !!
F	however at easter i ordered a basket of fruit to be delivered on the thursday before easter and it did not arrive .
F	good job .
F	easy to use ordering , good email information provided and delivery arrived next_day .
M	i dont normally complain_about things , however this was such a poor service which disappointed me and my partner so much i feel urged to write to avoid anyone_else experiencing such upset .
F	i think the problem should have been picked_up at quality control before sending it out .
F	easy to use on line , but found flowers to be small considering i sepnt £_00
M	david
M	plenty on the web so may look else where .
M	a new table leg was duley dispached and an engineer fitted it yesterday . my table looks stuning now and im over the moon with it .
F	you can pick a delivery date which suits you so thumbs_up all_round .
F	the next order took a good 0_weeks but at_least they came that time .
M	i spoke on the phone to breakingfree to get some advice re delivery etc , at 0 . 00pm
M	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
M	however , no phone_call - bad for customer_relations .
F	prices are the cheapest i can find , free delivery and service is always speedy
M	value for money , well_done .
M	i sent him another email same auto_generated email .
M	the car was ok , but having a flat tyre is a complete pain in the arse .
F	what fantastic service - deliveries are so efficient , they always have the products i want and at great prices too .
F	courteous sales , and impressive customer_care and service .
M	just the job !
F	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
F	they just think they are big enough to treat badley their existing_customers .
M	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
M	this is a difficult one to write as it '_s the first time we used this service , but overall the staff were very friendly and quick to respond , unfortunately there was number of issues , we have not seen the flowers , as they were delivered to the funeral_directors when we couldn_'_t attend , but the picture on the web_site was brilliant , and caught our eye instantly , we had never seen such a powerful vibrant look , and the price was good , we can only hope to get there in time to see them in person before its to late .
F	not a happy_bunny .
F	so no wrecks , just one very satisfied_customer .
F	i '_m a relatively new shopper with little_sunflowers and have been drawn back from early on by the very obvious care and attention bev & andy put into what they do .
M	tyreleader show as a . co . uk website which leads you to believe that they are a uk company .
M	they own us about 0000 euros and when we ask for a call back they say that at the moment they cannot make any call !!
F	00 days_later , when i still hadn_'_t had a tracking code , i emailed zen_bedrooms to enquire and john replied the next_day to say they were still_waiting for it from the shipping company , and that " the tracking code will give you an expected delivery date so that you can be at home to receive your order ".
M	ordered prescription_sunglasses , but they arrived as " clear ", so no tint sunglasses .
F	awaiting a response from you ,
M	great delivery and price - pity about the call_centre .
F	this arrived smashed due to poor packaging .
F	received cards and a surname was spelt wrong with a v instead of a y .
F	otherwise very please and would recommend to anyone - well_done !
F	thank_you .
F	the food was amazing , couldn_'_t_believe i was eating a ready_meal !
F	so far i have written to the md twice ( with the photos they demanded ) and not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement of my letter .
M	i ordered a bulky computer case ( weighing a solid 0kg ) and it was delivered within two_days of me purchasing the item , kudos to amazon for the quick dispatch also .
F	we havent received the order yet
F	what more could you ask for - job_done !!
F	the office staff at villa_plus in england and in majorca was very pleasant and helpful .
M	this does not match the really strong flavours offered by nespresso
F	goods always packed well and never had any damaged goods .
F	i ordered items from this company on 00 / 0 /_0000 .
M	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
F	why would anyone sell a product without making_sure all the relevant pieces are enclosed and available .
M	stay well away .
F	finally got through and apparently both devices are being returned to me by courier tonight .
M	wide birth , avoid .
F	mon chien s ' est raffolé de_l ' os et a assez aimé les petits os au gout de poulet , mais il_n ' apprécie pas du_tout la contenu du coffret " i love my pet " surtout composé de biscuits .
M	i noticed it immediately after i sent it and quickly emailed them to tell them of my mistake .
F	ordered pm , received am next_day . how good is that for customer service ?
F	i would recommend ao . com to anyone .
M	no courier has yet managed to find our house , it is in a little known awkward to find location .
F	i understand things sometime can go_wrong , and i hope the cleaners will take better care of other people '_s homes .
M	dear azimo ,
M	the service provided by this company is exemplary .
F	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
M	has always made buying things simple .
F	the order was quite a long time arriving and when i rang to enquire they explained that there had been a problem with the supplier .
F	i got a text to say they had been left_securely , but was then surprised not to get a thank_you from the recipient .
M	thank_god it was postage free
M	i did not get them at all
M	i rarely need proper next_day delivery but as luck would have it ; that ’_s the one that went sour .
F	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month_old_grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
M	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
M	i would have awarded 0_stars , however the supplied power_cable for the fender amplifier had a non - uk_plug fitted .
M	i spent an unhappy hour strugging to find another source of help on the internet .
F	everything i orded fits nice & looked just how they looked on picture including the colours
M	the correct product at attractive prices and prompt delivery .
M	edit after response ; thank_you very much for responding to my review , after ringing you and telling the driver the circumstances the flowers were delivered on the monday , she has just picked them up on tuesday due to the office being closed very early monday_afternoon .
M	i ordered goods .
F	the tracking_link didn_'_t work so i waited in all day all day friday and had to leave a note on my front_door that a neighbour would sign for me in case i didn_'_t hear the bell or was out and as i was away most of the weekend i had no idea when they would arrive !
M	so i cancelled the direct_debit and then suddenly they could_find my details and it still took 0 months and dozens of phone_calls to get account cancelled .
M	don_'_t expect to be sent items with damaged packaging , but otherwise good .
M	i had a good google around to find suppliers for my modest home coffee making needs and was impressed by the range that bella_barista stocks at clearly competitive_prices .
F	so you can buy with ebookers but thats it .
M	the range and quality was excellent and the price too made them stand out .
M	you dont get a second chance to make a first impression , i wont be shopping with superfi again .
F	i had some brilliant advice from the man that worked in the lincoln shop , fast delivery and and friendly delivery drivers .
M	it was supposed to be collected on the following_day with ups .
M	amazon were almost as useless as yodel telling_me to just be patient and to wait .
F	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .
M	the calorie free sauces taste like cheating , and there are a variety of ready_meals for lunch times too .
F	on contacting curry '_s & spending 00_minutes on the phone i was promised a replacement ( a further delivery of fridge_/ freezers expected on the 00th ).
M	from ordering a sample to actual delivery first_class !
M	they look great on the car so i '_m very pleased .
F	i had a bit of a problem with the download as something_else came with it .
M	as usual be prepared for the extra_insurance when you collect to get fully covered even thoigh it says it us included as a special_offer .
M	very poor .
F	didn_'_t think this was very good considering shipping was an extra_charge .
F	i checked my email again but no email was found .
F	do not buy from this company .
F	when i arrived to pick_up the car their rep had gone home !!
M	i loved the fact hay was used as a packing_material .
F	very happy with my purchase , i '_ll definitely consider_using them again .
F	the delivery was a pain - having to sign for parcel not clear at check out or i would '_ve_used work address - quite a low value package surprised could not just leave it here .
M	my advice , stay well clear of this ( at best ) incompetent company !
F	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
M	i would recommend them to anyone .
F	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
F	hassle sorting it all out !
F	placed order as chosen by my little_girl for her big brothers_birthday .
F	.
F	it was admired_by so many people that i have placed a new order on behalf of a relative .
M	took them 0 days to tell me too !
M	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
F	also made us wonder_if the problem was due to insufficient maintenance of the ship - worrying .
F	they were pitiful and for the first time from serenta i felt they were most definitely not worth the money i paid for them .
M	after sales service stated they would send shelf_supports and i received 00 supports for 0 shelves , had to contact them again for another one !
F	it appears now that although the parcels have been getting there , they have not been getting them signed for and have just been leaving them on doorsteps etc in all_weathers , open to potential thieves too !
M	try someone_else as the only way is up from here !
M	my mum got caught out with this scam but luckily she realised within the time she is aloud to cancel her " 0nd line "
M	other than that , a near brand_new vehicle , good value and very comfortable .
M	i ' d definitely recommend the whisky_exchange to anyone - great prices , and no concerns necessary re .
M	thank_you
F	definite room for improvement in communication .
F	will not be using you again .
F	i tried over 00_hours to delay my order as the recipient was away .
M	from the first enquiry to pay out was less_than 00_hrs .
F	thanks to everyone at cartridge world , i will be back !
F	i am therefore disappointed with this aspect and would have been prepared to pay a few extra pounds to have decent quality pull chords .
F	many emails later , with their apologies for delay , i was eventually told the product was now in stock .
F	arrived at dublin_airport , to an empty desk , i had to go couple mins ( drive ) down the road to collect the car .
M	one half_dead , other totally dead .
F	excellent every time
F	boo !
M	i would highly_recommend them .
M	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
M	it was advertised postage free .
F	with every other website i '_ve tried my iphone never completely stays unlocked but with official_iphone_unlock now it '_s locked for good !
M	i still prefer visiting subway for their quality of food and good service .
F	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
M	lovely staff , know their stuff and always willing to help .
F	avoid at all costs .
M	best regards ,
M	also , they don_'_t work weekends , so discs they receive on saturday aren_'_t processed until monday .
F	now the reason i wanted to be home was because i was due 0 items , one of which i tried to cancel but was told by amazon it was too late and just to refuse delivery .
F	i '_m really impressed with the service from sunglasses_shop .
M	!
M	you have my money give me the goods .
F	it would be nice to have the £_00 postage waived as a good will gesture considering i have spent so much money in the previous purchase .
F	only_thing i had some problem is the delivery actualy the man who delivers it in my area by the currier yodel but i sorted that with the company ,
F	i always go to wiggle first .
M	having never owned kitchen knives not purchased from a supermarket before , was always happy to let someone_else attempt to carve the meat , cut the veg etc .
M	i will be avoiding in future .
M	excellent quality , excellent price , excellent service , fast delivery .
M	order was placed on 00th_august , their website states 0 - 0 days to despatch goods , items were marked as dispatched on the 0th day , they advise 0 - 0 days for delivery , and website advises if items not arrived after 0_weeks to contact them and they will re - print .
F	its a shame that in 0000 this profession still treats women like idiots !!!
F	he was very rude to me on the phone and also to the recipient of my delivery .
F	was it against some rules ?
M	cheers for the refund , could have done something more useful with the money , but i suppose you did me a favour in making me save it .
M	their system is flawed .
F	animed did what it said on the tin .
F	would definitely do_business again .
M	i wiil recommend floraqueen and will_continue to use floraqueen in the future as they are florabrilliant .
F	i usually use marks &_spencer who provide excellent customer service and have always delivered .
F	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
F	however , i had to return it at my own cost , they checked the product and stated that this noise was standard for these players and therefore there was no fault .
F	if you are happy to take the risk , go_ahead .
M	last order there was 00 tiles chipped because of bad packing , just managed to finish my tiling job by extra cutting .
M	delivery was very poor waited in all day got a message to say they had been dispatched about 00 : 00 and flowers arrived at 00 : 00 .
F	at 0pm ( 0 hours after collection ) i first noticed there was a problem via the online tracking .
F	i would rather pay an extra few_pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
F	will definitely use them for future events .
F	as i found one number on the wind screen i did not continue to look for other numbers in the car .
F	i ordered at 00 : 00 , cut_off was 00 : 00 .
M	i ordered a gill dry bag which i had had earlier problems sourcing from another outlet .
M	easy to use website , good selection of stock .
M	they were brilliant .
M	arranged delivery to a neighbour as was at work , i texted the house number of the neighbour when selecting this option , when the item was delivered i recieved a tex sayingt it was delivered to 000 i live at 000 so not a neighbour actually on the other side of the road and 000 meters down the road , i called at the strangers address they werent in so went home and found card saying it was delivered to 000 !
M	when i look thrrough the catalogue i see some fantastic items and mark them for future referance , then i order a few items and it takes so long to get them that i revert_back to my usual suppliers as they only take a few_days 0 / 0 at the most . frost is almost always 0 / 00 days . why
M	i had to help_unload as the load was too heavy for the driver who was by himself .
M	renew automatically online but they give plenty of warning as renewal approaches with advice on how to cancel auto_renewal .
F	sat_nav was no use at all because the postcode takes you to a completely_different road .
M	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
M	booking the day off work and i am sure if you thought your sofa was being delivered the following_day you most certainly would not have your old one meaning people are left to sit on the floor .
M	until know great deals great line '_s and material great service what a start to the season ty
M	update_: talked to customers services , they said talk to the branch , branch took my details including contact details and said would pass on to head_office to sort_out , and guess_what . no further contact .
F	have used jokers_masquerade on numerous occations as the quality of clothing good , not too expensive and delivery quick , i recomend to friends all the time .
M	i booked a job with one " company " via anyvan , and despite_repeated_attempts to contact them , the day before they were due to arrive and move me and my belongings they finally responded with a cancellation .
F	i cannot log_into my account either , wont accept my password which i know is correct .
M	we completed the necessary_paperwork and went off for lunch and a pint .
M	please avoid at all costs .
F	i needed a tyre asap as i had gouged a serious score in the tyre wall & my work commitment s couldn_'_t guarantee me a time to get it down .
F	fab european delivery and free uk delivery .
F	he also got me an enhanced_annuity because i was on certain medication , and got me a very good deal .
M	it happens .
F	£ 0 for postage for a small item and not even next_day delivery .
M	only giving a star for the sheer bloody nerve of them !
M	a one minute phone_call would have established location rather_than a four hour experience for me !!!
F	i placed my order in the evening and received it by ups 0 working day later !
F	the order was placed about 0_days before delivery .
M	gak had the cheapest price on what i was looking for , superfast free delivery , kept me updated every_step of the way until my amp came through the door .
F	product came very quickly and lots of e_-_mails_keeping_me informed .
M	they then changed my flights back but to a different airport , it was only when i googled the directors details and asked to speak to him the sorted the flights out
F	thank_you for delivering my dogs_meds promptly .
M	but expensive - not value for money really
M	the return was less straightforward but okay .
F	so we came home and placed our order over the internet .
F	simple to apply , clear and concise information .
F	i want my printer to a ) be fast b ) be easy to maintain and c ) cost_effective .
M	gateway left me " speechless "
M	fair_enough if it '_s no_longer made but no explanation had arrived with the order which was a random alternative shape i ' d had no say in choosing .
M	fast & prompt delivery service .
M	contacted a call_centre on the 0000 no .
F	this makes your statement that delivery is free for all countries untrue , since i in fact are paying more than uk customers for the products .
M	best and most varied trophy types on the web .
M	they sent email with a link to sagepay to pay for flights .
F	didn_'_t know whether to order from actual superdry or another retailer .
M	always a pleasure to deal with .
F	what a brilliant service i would definitely recommend tons of tiles to my friends and family
M	from initial sample to deliver , my experience with worktop_express has_been top_class .
M	*** the only thing that worries me is the possibility of the goods being refurbished as they come in a white box with no manufacturer warranty . only their own 00 months warranty .
F	they refuse to give me a phone number or contact details for the carrier service , dhl .
M	they ' re nice when they fit though .
F	best price i could find on - line .
M	royal_mail post seem to never loose anything !!!!
F	i recieved an e_- mail on the friday_morning informing_me the ramps had been dispatched and would be delivered on the saturday between 0 and 0 .
M	0 .
F	however i informed about the restricted access to the cottage with limit at a luton van size vehicle .
M	we checked the tracking_info on the hermes , or herpes as we call them , website .
M	ordered 00 / 00 /_0000 , engineer due out 00 / 00 /_0000
M	the reimbursement i received is a joke , let '_s just say it wouldn_'_t even cover one tank of fuel .
M	all items can be tracked online .
F	i use serenata every time i need to send flowers .
F	disappointing i didn_'_t even get to wear the leggings due to the holes .
M	have used fragrancedirect before .
M	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but . shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that '_s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc . makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery '_s beyond 00kg otherwise you '_ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
M	i bought an audi_a0 window winder for my daughter '_s a0 which arrived at my home the next_day - perfect but not essential .
M	it is a complete self_assembly , the like of which i have never seen before .
F	you just have to guess_what flowers at that cost might , or might not look like .
M	can i possibly have my money back or a pair of sunglasses if its not too much_trouble ?
M	when i phoned customer service they said what i ' d purchased didnt qualify for the promotion .
M	hopefully be here this week .
M	products have all been good quality on this and past orders .
M	so after a while i found a travelex airside in t0 and queued up but then they told me i had to go to a different one .
M	and not to mention , the so quick delivery of the shades to my house very next_day .
F	would definitely recommend this company for price and how quickly it arrived .
M	no communcation as to how long it would take to do these , but apart_from that no_problems .
M	i have ordered from herbies before but this time i was blown_away at how fast i received my order .
F	as delivery was for mother in law in hospital complete_waste of time as she was back home saturday_night !
F	norma
M	the offers often seem too good to be true . because the are !
M	sorry but when ordering my glasses from ozeal i didn_'_t think they would take so long if your desperate for glasses go to a high_st store you can get them in half the time took over two_weeks from the date i ordered them you can get them off high_st shops in three_days i ordered them for driving before i went on hols and had to go without them has i ordered them over two_weeks before i went away
M	sellers sell none .
F	would definitely use again and recommend .
F	brilliant - i was always comfortable with the old frames so why_bother getting new ones ( i love recycling anyway !)
F	quality of goods exceeded_expectation .
M	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
M	the incorrect pair of shoes was sent to myself and when i questioned my refund i was advised the item was not received at the warehouse .
M	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
F	never again l wil ; l be cancelling all contracts and dealing_with a uk_based company where l can deal with people face to face . stores not much_better not interested .
F	why would i write that if it was not my experience ?
F	brilliant !
F	youe have lost a customer
M	customer service failure number 0 !
M	once paid the invoice pops_up , which requires you to print it off ,
M	delivery within 0 days . unreal .
M	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
M	i then had to reoder them .
F	they arrived during the early_afternoon .
F	after looking around and calling in what looked like a muddy field we decided not to leave our car here and proceeded to a " proper car_park "
M	so right now i have four things
F	i went in there to exchange a pair of trainers , which were a size too small .
F	i would say their customer service is completely non - existent as you can not get your issue resolved .
F	the aftershave is for a present next week so if it doesn_'_t arrive this week clearly it '_s lost and there won_'_t be time for me to order it in time !!!
F	my aftershave arrived in good time and was well_packaged .
F	very pleased to deal with a company that did exactly as promised .
F	in the end , the flowers and wine were delivered and my friend said they were beautiful .
F	i have always received my order the next_day .
M	i bought these gloves for my wife , who has reynaulds and carpal tunnel and she tells_me that since using the gloves , the pain in her hands has_improved tremendously .
F	.
F	excellent prices too .
F	on phoning the store yesterday , i discovered that the gift had been left at a nearby post officce , although they were unable to get parcelforce to establish whether a note had been left .
M	!
M	i have used your service many_times and have never been disappointed please_accept my thanks once again
M	i am appalled that when i made a compliant it is not acted_upon , self righteous staff
M	our aftershave order came very quickly .
M	however , over charged me , didn_'_t recognise their own paypal_account when querying overcharge , taken over a week of correspondence , spoken to several people about the same issue each time requesting different information or just plan right rude and uninterested in dealing_with the query .
M	in a single word , it is " great ".
F	if you wear branded perfume , makeup etc .
F	however , i was in desperate_need for the machine and appreciated it was the christmas_period with bank_holidays and was told a couple of times " you should hopefully get delivery on ." due to my desperation with 0 small children and no washing_machine , i hung on to every word i was told so was disappointed when told " i don_'_t know why someone said that day as it won_'_t be coming then ".
M	website information on the product was comprehensive and accurate .
M	i would urge_anyone to avoid this company !
M	i am incredibly upset about this .
M	delivery is steadily getting worse .
M	this is simply not acceptable .
M	every time i go to tesco their prices go up , what happened to this new scheme on prices they are advertising , or is that just in larger stores ?
M	i would and do recommend aria all of the time !
M	i was told the delivery lorry had broken down earlier in the day .
F	if you are looking to save a few_pounds and don_'_t mind the heartache of being_messed_around then ' bathroom0u ' is company for you .
M	shipping is quite expensive now and this example shows how it can increase the costs of items by 00 %.
M	anyway all ok on departure but did not really like that .
F	!
F	do not order from them !
M	just one small error in all the years i have used moonpig and i use them a lot .
M	i recently ' brought ' a dell inspirion mini laptop from the mitcham store , instead of being delivered a laptop i have instead been sent a numark cd mixer .
F	i received the swarovski photo frame the following_day .
M	not a good experience .
F	i struggled to find answers to outstanding questions and the call_centre was closed .
M	if a company tells_me they are using citylink now , and if there '_s an_alternative supplier , i always take the alternative .
M	didn_'_t look like the picture and actually had parts missing .
M	however the qulaity of the flowers was average and many were wilting .
M	i would not use this company or recommend them
F	we sat in and waited and no parcel arrived .
M	slight_problem in using the online ordering as i was not able to download the repeat_prescription for the item i wanted to order .
F	very happy with the costume i ordered .
M	parking included is essential if driving to miami beach ).
M	key number correct and it is a halfords roof_box .
M	you can be confident .
M	you also told me that you were going to have the it department change the adverts going forward .
M	i do not like being_ripped_off !
M	i '_m_sure that we are not alone in finding it very hard to purchase from one of the only su [ pliers in britain who will not offer a trade account .
F	as to how to proceed through each_step
F	when i rocked up to collect the car , i was told that if i wanted real insurance it would cost an additional 00 euro a day and that what i had purchased was some kinda insurance against the excess ( whatever that means ) . the rental_car company then blocked off 0000_euro of my credit_card ( apparently this is the excess ). i '_ve rented lots of cars in dublin and normally they block off between 000 - 000_euro .
F	a big thanks to [_name ].
F	we will certainly use them again .
M	the six lights were easy to set_up but we are having to recharge the batteries every other day which seems a pity as they seemed a bargain price .
M	as above , would have been 0_stars if there hadn_'_t been a mix_up with the order , and i had to reorder , staff very friendly and helpful via e_- mail .
M	great for getting_rid of unwanted junk but watch out for the selling charge which is sometimes difficult to see if you are an infrequent user .
F	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early . even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
M	ordered stuff from them as they did next_day delivery and local_stockist was out of stock .
F	i did not complain but i promise i will never order anything anymore from this website .
F	i have ordered 0 or 0 times_now and i find the service very good , however , i have come to realise that i can buy the white rice flour , potato flour and fine semolina flour cheaper at asda or holland and barratt , and without the added postage expence !
M	which looked nothing like website image at all .
M	i was also told that the engineers word would be taken over mine even_though what he said was total rubbish !
M	i found this on the physioroom site , and what appeared identical braces on other_sites - but costing a lot more .
M	please advise .
M	the choice of print size appears to be restricted to the two sizes mentioned , and there are no facilities which i could_find for cropping , printing some id on the back of prints etc .
F	still better_than nothing but just not good enough .
F	they hurt , they are big ( so they dont stay over your eye ) so i think i have payed for nothing .
M	also gave_me the highest amount for my old phone .
M	be warned before you buy from this company .
F	item finally arrived yesterday and i am delighted with the quality of it .
M	!
M	it '_s not so much the money , i just don_'_t want others to be caught out and left in the lurch .
M	0nd journey , driver was rude , argumentative , sent him away had to wait for a replacement driver , better but middle lane hogger
F	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
M	i received the item in question ( slightly later than hoped ) but the delivery team were simply excellent and would not accept a tip ( suggested i donate to charity which i did ).
M	i requested a refund which they agreed to .
F	exactly as_described on the web_site .
M	and as it was there mess up i asked if it could be delivered on the saturday ( next_day ) which i previously had chosen on the tuesday !!
F	i then found that two payments of £_000 had been taken by groupon from my account .
M	i just gave up and excepted it .
M	sas are probably the most punctual airline i fly with , but this comes at a cost , the service is very expensive , there seems to be no limit to how much they charge on some routes , the price for an economy return ticket from manchester to stockholm can be as high as £_000 during busy weeks , meaning i often use lufthansa via frankfurt instead even_though this service is a lot more inconvenient and very prone to long delays .
M	there are plenty of other_websites available to book hostels online which do not charge this fee .
F	the ordering & delivery service was excellent but i was disappointed how poorly protected the worktops and upstands were , being merely placed inside a big clear polythene_bag .
M	loving it , thanks chris .
F	cette_fois la date de_livraison_est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu_' à le confirmer .
F	after a few more emails of me asking for my device back they finally told me it had been recycled and i cannot get it back .
M	dewalt_cordless_drill exactly as_described and delivered first thing next working day - as promised .
M	we chose appliances_online because for value but also because they delivered free on a sunday .
M	don_'_t mind_paying for next_day delivery but don_'_t like when the items arrives 0 days_later by royal_mail with a 00 hour delivery sticker on it .
F	to be honest at times i wondered_whether the company still existed as it felt really odd and nothing seemed to match up .
M	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
M	the price was excellent compared to anywhere_else .
F	described as oak , not even veneer !
M	school boy error to make !!!
M	i have supplied images of the dying flowers but am still over a week_later waiting for a response .
F	so lovely to have a friendly and helpful voice on the other end of the phone .
M	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
F	have been waiting 0_weeks since sending order off and still not received my money !
M	avoid this chain at all costs
M	their e_- mail address is a uk one and they display a post_office symbol on their home page .
F	speedy delivery
F	the order system was quick and simple to use .
F	det_er jo spild af min tid , da_jeg jo bare gerne vil gøre en handel .
F	i haven_'_t had any confirmation they '_ve been despached so not sure how to review figleaves !
F	without_any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
M	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
M	phone staff either say technical problems or we will send you a cheque in april for balance .
F	i ordered the britax eclipse car_seat for my grandaughter on a saturday and it was delivered by parcel_force on the tuesday .
M	had a query with the pricing , only the vat element , reply came back same day .
M	it '_s great you buy the phones but now the free_postage gone its £ 0 plus even before made any profit
M	we agreed i would like a refund , and amanda arranged a courier to collect it .
F	i am afraid i have had to send the product back because we ordered a uk size 0 , we received a us 0 which turned_out to be too_big .
M	didn_'_t arrive , now have to go to client without the canvas i ' d_hoped to give them .
F	will use again
F	i bought a tv from them and it was delivered very quickly to my surprise .
M	company miss sold iphone insurance for my wifes and mine .
F	so , it is either argus who are not describing the size of vehicle properly or it is alamo in florida who say you have undersized just to get you to pay extra , both mis_- advertising .
M	except my order is still to be fulfilled
F	cant_believe i ordered my washing_machine at 0pm and got it delivered 00am next_day .
M	the boat cruise was a bit of a disappointment .
F	had a home delivery booked 00 - 0 . now 0pm gone and still no food even_though ive rung twice to chase_up . terrible service when ive kids to feed . wont_be using them again .
M	?
F	i told you twice about this and you failed to remedy it .
F	in the end we had to just leave it with him or miss check in .
M	i '_ve never actually bought plants online before , always having been rather nervous of what you might get , but not finding what i wanted locally finally decided to give it a try .
M	my trophies were engraved and delivered in a very short time indeed .
F	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn_'_t as it is very shimmery .
F	thanks .
M	the letting you know the item is in the post is a good touch .
M	even better_than we thought they would look .
F	whoever is the buyer has a great eye for women '_s clothes that you want to wear .
M	.
F	!
M	no reply .
M	it was all boxed very nicely so all i had to do was wrap it up .
F	it was one of the gas_lift poles from the bar_stool that was protruding from the box and had caused it to rip open .
F	would probably use a different site in future to be honest .
F	the adsa non drowsy hayfever / allergy 00 pk x 0 which had been substituted but had not been sent .
M	i don_'_t have a printer in my house so it means i '_m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn_'_t open_till tuseday when my funeral is .
F	the trophys are good for the price i paid , however , the engraving shields were not fixed properly to the wooden sheild so i had to hammer the nails in more so that they were secure .
F	first_impressions were good , very sturdy_construction , but the velcro_straps are almost 0 ," wide and it was almost_impossible for me to pull the velcro_straps apart , and that was before i had the boot on .
F	gift basket very nice but was expecting pink_roses for a little_girl birth and not red_roses , was a bit disappointed .
M	the handover at the rental office was insufficient as it stated on the form less damage / stratches to the vehicle than had been discussed at the office .
M	i ordered one for our bungalow , and all i can say is the finish and attention to detail is superb , great communication , delivered when stated .
M	not sure what i got for this .
M	surely when you buy out a company you are buying an existing client base , so why would you think changing everything would be a good idea .
F	they are lovely and i appreciate the flowers are expensive ones but i think i would have upgraded to the top level as they don_'_t " look " much .
F	but it had a cracked_screen , and this is where i feel the site lets its customers down .
F	ordered a replacement shower_seal on - line on sunday and it arrived on tuesday .
M	however they are good at giving you a stupid answer that has nothing to do with the question . cute .
M	we cleaned and deep cleaned the printer head without_success in the end we purchased the original lexmark inks and it was perfect .
F	about gluten_free dietry requirements , vegetarian , whether the chalet has unlimited wine ( yeah im a student )
F	this was a good introduction for us to living and self - catering for one month and let us see what we could expect from this type of holiday .
M	good value , good communications and reliable , thanks !
M	had i been advised of the delivery problems i would have looked elsewhere
M	if you do fall asleep you will still snore . or so my wife tells_me
M	not only did best0systems have the part in stock , they dispatched it that afternoon and it was delivered first thing next_day .
M	will use again .
M	perhaps an_oversight on my part for not studying the details of the purchase but i had assumed the product would have come pre_- assembled or assembled on site ( as i was informed it would be a 0 man delivery i had assumed this - this had been the procedure when i purchased my first treadmill ).
M	customer_services were helpful but still had to take the time to pack it up and send it back before getting a replacement .
M	geoff .
F	hi it was my first visit to your web_site wasn_'_t quite sure what i was doing didn_'_t understand some of the lingo didn_'_t find it easy to follow .
M	at last i '_m still_waiting for a parcel after 0 days !
F	to use a promotion_code i had to send everything back and re order at time to me
M	i cannot recall anything about this company or service other than they have contacted me by email .
M	huzzah !
M	p . s no brain cells were damaged reviewing this site .
F	communication about delivery was great .
M	unfortunately they are let_down by a poor courier service who state they have tried to deliver but don_'_t leave cards and information given when phoning them conflicts with information given by email .
M	i bought a netgear wireless range extender .
F	they wanted an order number .
F	i wanted fast delivery - they were there in 0_days ( on the day that suited me ).
F	several comments were made about the wi_-_fi in the guest_book , yet the owners had done nothing .
M	one big negative was the wifi .
M	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
M	and this is an extra don_’_t forget on top of the car_hire cost which was inclusive of insurance .
M	on a positive_note it was delivered quickly and the design is nice .
M	the item purchased is exactly_what was required .
F	nothing put through her door to say they were there .
F	the thing to remember when reading people '_s reviews , is that a lot of it comes down to personal_taste .
F	no ones fault just one of those things .
M	although to be fair a free replacment is usually sent if this happens rightly so !
F	delivery prompt and i was kept up to date with emails_confirming order , payment and dispatch .
F	great product , great website , " so - so " ordering experience , disappointing delivery options .
M	it cost 00 pounds !
F	if like me you suffer from food_intolerances ( wheat / dairy / gluten ) you will know how difficult it is to find tasty food that you can eat .
M	the price was good as well .
M	the same would apply if you accessed the site with your tablet or smartphone !)
F	!
M	great gloves , my son_loves them .
F	been sent goods that were obviously ' seconds '
M	stay_away !
F	delivery arrived next_day .
M	i ordered what i believed to be a beautiful_bouquet of flowers including a box of luxury chocolates costing_£_00 for delivery to my elderly_mother from her son on mothers_day .
F	this was so fast i had to ring again to get the number down .
M	on a positive_note , they offer good choice of products and competitivly_priced .
M	generally the attitude was poor - not particularly the advisor on the call who , in fairness , was trying to help , but more the company policy .
M	the drawback however was the long length of time it took from the order being placed to dispatch , hence the 0_stars .
M	terrible company .
M	i will_certainly be buying more of the cases as my collection grows .
F	the matchbooks were beautiful unfortunately the party was on saturday and they didnt arrive until monday !
F	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get_hold of my daughters_school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
M	f . eks at ram - brikker er satt i på rett vis .
F	george
M	i now do not have to over worry_about losing the only key , as i now have two spares .
M	a hugely wide_choice of tyres , with very competitive_prices , are found on an very easy to use website .
M	agent will try to push an upgrade on you for a price .
M	avoid
M	i regret spending my money on the big_bus_tour .
M	i have been ordering products from aria for many_years .
F	i said that was exactly_what i just said i didn_’_t want .
M	i have now return the vest hoping to get the correct_size .
F	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
M	good earner that !
F	i '_d a lot of cds to sell but used a competitor for most of them as they offered much_better prices .
F	the debacle with parcelforce not leaving a card has now resulted_in my friend not getting his present before christmas ( he had left for his family '_s house by the time i found out it had been left at the post_office ) and also not getting it as a surprise , which has upset me and made me seriously question whether this was a good spend of £_00 .
M	there were a number of problems on separate days regarding the bathrooms and toilets , but the villa_plus agents were very helpful and had plumbers on sight in a short time .
M	prompt delivery , item as_described .
F	had to use the panel as the fitting had already been arranged .
M	i found partyrama ok first time shoper of course so i want to be ffair to all .
F	to cut a long_story_short , i was stranded without a dime , only my debit_card on me at 0pm on the airport road .
F	when i had not heard_anything by a week i rang again and was told they were waiting for them to come in !
F	the service was excellent and the products are very good too .
M	i was immediately charged for the items and after 0 week the status of my order was still " in processing " so i contacted the company .
M	best price by far and quick delivery
M	update
M	as a result we had to put ourselves in great danger and take it up ourselves .
M	i explained that i didn_'_t want to start downloading and setting_up new browsers just so i could use their website and was then promised a callback .
M	watch out for the cyclestore deals , too !
M	turned_out all right in the end and dealt_with politely and efficiently .
M	then one day i happened_upon the tier0 web_site .
F	unfortunately , i could not post this review without giving them 0_star .
M	the mats look great and have improved the interior of my car .
M	without a doubt the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
M	so a mixed_bag really .
F	i called again and asked what was going on .
M	just looks very uncared for .
F	just want to be paid so i can close account .
M	some of the products were not in the parcel
M	looked for ggf endorsement and expected quality work .
F	the prices offered are very competitive but items they claim are in stock take a long time to arrive - fine as long as you are aware of this beforehand .
F	slightly .
M	unbeatable service .
F	buying online means you get so much more variety of items .
F	the despatch_note looked like it had been crumpled up in the plam of your hand to get it to squeeze in the packet .
F	i am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn_'_t seem to be anyone who will take_responsibility for this .
M	miss information , poor communication and a total_disregard for the customer .
M	the service is very good .
F	we purchased a cabinet and the delivery driver who assumed my wife was on her own proceeded to bully her ( bearing in mind that she is only 0ft 0 ".)
M	if you had better communication it would have been 0_stars .
M	low and behold , they didn_'_t have this one in stock either , i waited a couple of weeks and had no contact from nigel_o ' hara , not even an email to let_me know they had placed a new order for me .
M	was unsure of what to do with our old_iphones but came_across mazuma_mobile via a friend .
M	i was contacted by phone the following_day to be informed of the delivery process and to arrange a date for delivery .
F	collection by city_link was not arranged when promised so i used up a day '_s leave for nothing .
M	there was nothing wrong with the service or the flowers i ordered .
F	the paper_work and order history was correct but obviously the product was pick incorrectly .
F	i returned one pair as i ordered 0 so that i could choose and posted the unwanted pair back the following_day .
M	the warranty they offered on parts was 0 year , yet the manufacturers_warranty on new product was 0 , upon querying she didnt know why that was . selling refurbished product perhaps i suggested . hmmm
F	i would highly_recommend jokers ' masquerade , we have used them a few_times_now and the service is brilliant .
M	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another £_00 to get micro - sim .
F	. i '_ve never been given that back . all as i '_ve been given is the meter wiped .
F	i don_'_t .
M	i '_m very satisfied .
F	i am also told that they have brought in specialist resource to look at improving the way they do things from a customers perspective .
F	the item received , wall_mounted , solar_powered pir lamp , did not match the image of the item as shown on the website .
F	needless to say we received a card through the letter_box informing us of a missed delivery .
F	brilliant service .
F	there '_s nothing wrong with this , but it '_s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
F	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it '_s because it is .
F	the order was delivered within a few_days and was free delivery too !
M	i paid for next_day delivery but the items took 0 days to arrive - problems with the delivery company unfortunatly .
M	would definitely use and recommend again .
M	out of the box there were no issues ( aside from me not flicking the power switch on !)
M	i came_across this company as a reputable source of unlocking an i phone , i made a commitment to a friend i would unlock there phone for them , i quite happily paid the money and from then i had the most appalling service , i got an email_saying it would be done within 00_hours , made a complaint and was told it would be done soon , in the meantime 00_hours_later my friend to my embarrassment went and unlocked it on the high_street .
M	i could even track the delivery driver .
M	i had to phone twice to get info about my order and shipping .
F	only had to wait 00_minutes from collecting baggage and making phone_call .
M	fantastic service and very well_designed process to keep me informed .
M	millions of repeat questionos and holds from indian_call staff , very obstructive and rude .
F	paid for 0st_class delivery .
F	i sent numerous_emails and tried_ringing but to no_avail this went on for a few_days eventually i got an answer from someone i told them i wanted my ipad back immediately he tried to say it wouldn_'_t be returned yet but i kicked off told him it was my property and wanted it back he then turned around and said i would have it back by two_days time .
F	had purchased the tree as a thank_you gift for someone but the delay lessened the gesture somewhat .
F	i ordered my envelopes on sat ( which were stated as ' in stock ') and thought that was the process finished .
F	i '_ve had to ring my card_holder and have them intervene .
F	they were slightly too small and , being plastic , the machine was not able to pierce them .
M	do your own reviews jk if you want to know what customers really think of your products .
F	revived communications that my phone was cleared in the checks , but i was given and then sent out a reduced price on what the guaranteed offer was .
F	the money came out of my bank accound on the 0nd_december .
M	after several more emails back and forth i have finally ascertained that they have finally been delivered a week late - but it '_s taken me 0 emails back and forth ( and no real apology ) to get to this stage .
F	shop with caution .
M	!
F	just about to leave home at 00 to 0 and received a call with the excuse that my appointment was cancelled as they couldn_'_t open the clinic door .
M	very dissapointing as the event for which i requried the item of clothing has now passed .
F	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
M	looked on lamps on line site and not only did they have the right lamp , the right colour , they were also the cheapest , so even with postage_charges i saved time and money .
F	delivered on time and i was kept_informed by email and text .
M	i '_ve found myself going from buying the odd bottle for a relative to developing my own collection of whiskys as well as whiskeys from all the world .
M	i have been defrauded out of £_00 . 00 !
F	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0_days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be for the next 0 - 0_weeks .
M	superb service and quality .
F	i bought this set as a surprise for my daughter for christmas as she says ghd products are the best .
M	disapointing , if they could not fulfill , they should not have accepted extra postage_costs .
F	the bike was delivered on time by a friendly delivery guy .
F	the website was easy to use .
F	hertz made an exception and accepted a hefty cash deposit - their staff were friendly and tried to be accommodating .
F	it took around 0 minutes and i had sold my phone !
M	. will always use these_guys x
M	got the despicable me tee here , perfect and totally happy with shipping .
F	and to top it all off , i wrote a post on their facebook_page last night to say that their customer service was poor - when i checked just now , it has_been removed , and i cannot seem to find the facility to enable me to write another post . funny that .
M	smooth ordering and delivery process , but all seemed to fall_apart when we needed to return one item .
F	.
M	great company to deal with
F	when i phoned the customer help line on the day the order was expected it was swiftly confirmed that the tiles were on their way .
F	wud come out with keys but needed £_00 extra to do so !!
M	first time i have topped_up a mobile_phone and it was easy , next time it will be easier
M	i liked the idea of hiring a long lens for a family safari , but unfortunately chose lenses for hire .
F	asos have no contact number and no e_mail address and you literally have to go through loops on their automated answer system to send them an e_mail .
M	they will automatically renew your domain_registration without sending any reminders and silently increase the price each time .
M	there is a lot of competition for our business online so next time i '_ll look at another e_- florist ?
F	just about to order another bouquet again , fingers_crossed .
M	good meat at a good price , but as they use city_link for delivery i won_'_t be buying again .
M	i only hope npower is better !
F	shower_tray was faulty but as it couldn_'_t be inspected until the plumber came to fit it - builders in house and couldn_'_t leave a shower_tray unwrapped and unprotected there was nothing i could do about it - 0 day policy
F	the games i bought for my grandchildren were really exciting and the chess learning game is especially used .
F	i then purchased one separately , which turned_out to be unnecessary , as the dress skirt was poofy enough .
M	we tried to ask for a delivery any afternoon after 0 :_00pm and they could not accommodate us , so after 0 cancelled delivery slots i booked the day off .
M	i thought never mind i '_ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
M	the cost of energy is everything and by moving to scottish_power i will be saving £_000 + a year .
F	thanks .
F	although , i did request that the flower be delivered with a neighbour if no one was in .
F	therefore future patronage is in doubt .
M	instead of saying sorry for your trouble here have another one that isn_'_t faulty they make it very difficult by asking you to send photos and then more photos and even more photos .
M	fast service .
M	having not visited australia before it was good to have someone in the uk to make the booking for us .
F	i have ordered flowers before for donegal from a different website with no_problems , and didn_'_t expect an issue .
M	i drove the car back to f0 cambridge with smoke still coming out of the front_wheels .
F	as above when i have used the site i will look_forward to seeing the changes if there is any
F	i think i have just ordered a blank card with the flowers !
F	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
F	over all the service was good , just a shame the flowers didn_'_t do the company justice on this occasion .
F	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and very lucky for me google took me to castlegate .
F	kundenfreundlich , nein nicht wirklich , zeitgemäss nein auch nicht .
M	thanks .
F	the parcel was supposed to be collected on monday 00th_april .
F	i have been a customer at just fabrics in burford for many_years , specifically for fabrics for small upholstery projects .
M	the admin_fee was over half what we had paid for the return crossing .
M	excess fees for using a credit_card are being eradicated .
M	after that we had three_months of invoice errors and have been waiting four weeks while the matter is investigated .
F	x
M	the wardrobe that was delivered could not be dismantled and it spent a month in our_hallway whilst laura_ashley argued over their returns_policy .
M	consignment_number zfbrfu000000
M	at this point i had a serious sense of humour failure & hung_up on the lady .
F	i '_d paid for a large bouquet , but it looked decidedly small , and not arranged to the standard displayed on the website .
M	too expensive , ripped me off on postage_costs , item didn_'_t arrive on time and no offer to compensate for that .
F	je rendrai compte régulièrement de_l ' avancée de tout_ceci sur trustpilot et d ' autres forums / blogs .
M	at 00 : 00hrs i tried tracking the parcel .
M	my experience is similar to others sent my phone they offered me £_00 then when it arrived the offer was reduced to £ 0 .
F	told them they never left calling cards to prove they '_d called , which fell on deaf_ears .
F	the phone came back a week_later , working .
F	i tried to contact them using the numbers and email addresses on the website and saw that the website was all inactive and there was nobody answering the phone .
M	to my amazement it arrived on the thursday !!
M	dreams firstly delivered the wrong_size mattress and the correct headboard but with the wrong fittings .
F	or a door_knocker , or bell .
F	was continuously told that the email had been sent and that it was a problem with their computers . rather conveniently though the email with the link for payment seemed to arrive in my inbox just fine .!
F	driver mumbled something about having two buggies on board , which_meant nothing to us and then drove_off .
F	was a bit_unsure of the web - site which was displayed during an amazon search .
F	i even tried reporting the problem to rotary without effect .
M	i had a call from a tnt driver on monday_afternoon to ask for directions and he quite easily brought a 0 ton lorry almost to my door !!
F	the package i ordered indicated a pack of chicken wings would have 00 - 00 pieces .
M	coach took_ages waiting for other passengers , fortunately we arrived quite early , but it would have been a nightmare if we had arrived on a late flight .
F	i was very happy with the speedy delivery and was very surprised at the value for money very happy with the purchase
F	it is very frustrating when you are planning a 0hour journey to dover and all i phoned for was a postcode , she seemed to think that i wanted a postcode to calais which is rediculous sine the ferry takes you there !
F	!
M	the product was just what i needed .
F	many_thanks
M	how you respond to that will be what counts .
F	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
M	you would seriously be a sad state of mind to pay for any program on itv_player , now i like a lot of itv programs but if i miss them on normal tv i just put it down to experience .
F	this was very inconvenient when i had expected it to be delivered .
M	when it did eventually arrive the machine constantly rebooted with a " error 0000 no os ( operating_system )".
F	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
M	i had to press very hard all the way and after a lot of complaining and messing_about with “ finding the phone_call tapes ” etc_., they did eventually call me on my mobile to confirm refund .
F	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
M	i was told that if i call bt they will help me to switch back to them , calling tomorrow . . maybe after new year , i '_m used to ahve a bad service for a few_years so i can hold 0 more weeks
M	my wife doesn_'_t believe that , besides she wants to top up her phone which is why she got the card .
M	they had my email address and my phone number but failed to contact me , they say they tried but i definitely didn_'_t email me and i had no missed calls on my phone .
M	i suggested that they knew they couldn_'_t fulfill the order when i first made it - and suggested they have a word with their it people to prevent orders at the point of payment .
M	!
F	this was at the end of the day a list of human_error and my warning to you is check the paperwork thoroughly .
M	this was the first time i ordered from davpack and i have to say that the service and the products have been excellent .
M	the service provided by walls and floors is very good as regards materials , delivery and advice , however when advertised that orders over €_000 get free delivery and also being offered a 00_%_discount_code disappointingly when discount is applied and your order goes below €_000 you then fall_foul and get a large delivery charge , this then meaning buy more to get over the €_000 threshold again to get your free delivery .
M	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .
M	i have now had to get the credit_card company involved to try and get my money back
F	told to ring back 00th .
M	i find buying from strings_direct easy , as they use paypal .
F	you make the whole_process so difficult .
F	customer_services do not know anything about consumer_law .
F	ho ordinato il divano jonah , sono rimasta sopresa dalla comodità e dai colori bellissimi che sono disponibili , l ' unico problema è_stato scegliere tra i campioni di tessuto ricevuti il più bello .
F	ordering was easy and the items arrived in excellent condition in a shorter timescale than was listed on the website .
F	the man i spoke to said there was no one there that could help me as it was a sunday so he told me to call back 0am on monday .
M	and what will they be doing in the 00 days ?
M	unbelievably poor customer_services !
F	- thank_you :)
M	worthless .
M	booking accepted - waited in all day - no collection .
M	product arrived as on time and well_packed but i had to pay a customs fee to dhl as this company are not uk_based .
F	game was rescheduled for 0th_may but unable to get refund for tickets - take_note people !
M	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
M	the customer service team would not issue new tyres or a refund without checking the tyres on a photo first .
M	i will_definitely buy my next game from here !!!
M	thank_you for brilliant service .
F	dealt_with very quick and smoothly and the money was paid into my bank_account quickly .
F	always competitive_prices if not the best prices , trustworthy and efficient , speedy delivery .
M	you would expect your money back right away , but no .
F	great machine with fantastic extras .
F	a card was left and i had to phone the courier they said they were not alloowed to redeliver the next_day .
F	quick response , good price and fast delivery
M	to be fair once i had queried it they expedited the order and i got 0 of the items the next_day .
F	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
F	perfect .
M	it appears as though their depot staff deliberately damage items , and the company are fully_aware of these issues , but cannot be_bothered to address them .
M	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
F	despite the confirmation of delivery , no flowers had been received .
M	but apart_from that the pc is quiet and the price was right .
F	i absolutely love tripadvisor .
M	- no communication
M	found the website on google , e_- mailed them to enquire has to whether they delivered to bfpo , a lady_called kate responded with an email within minutes to inform_me that there was an extra service discount and the vat was knocked_off as well for items going to a bfpo_address made the jacket much_cheaper .
M	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
M	good quality items as prescribed , next_day delivery and very well_packaged .
M	during this time i had no reply to any email , the phone manner was unpleasant when i did speak to them and overall a very poor service .
F	partyrama advertises free delivery over_£_00 , but it doesn_'_t work automatically and is not clear on the store delivery or checkout pages .
F	i urge them to seruiously reconsider their returns process and how they deal with these in future .
F	i think is the best deal available .
M	after over 0 letters from them i was threatened with the bailiff , then received very nasty threatening_letters from a debt collecting service .
F	brilliant service usually but slightly_disappointed this time .
F	will defiantly recommend to my friends and family !
F	got my browser highjacked by malware .
M	having_searched the net for the best price on a berghaus_jacket from a retailer i had heard of i was disappointed to find that my size was not in stock . however i took_advantage of the suggestion to receive email notification when my size was in stock ( an estimation had appeared on the website ).
M	00_hours_later i received an e_- mail saying , ' as a gesture of good will ' they would replace and collect the faulty trolley on the same day - but not to my time_scale and too late for my match !
M	i saw the effect after one week , even with a lower dose .
F	will be purchasing my shoes this way next time
F	ordering was easy .
F	left our car and went away for a week .
F	i stopped_smoking at the beginning of the new year and this gum really works for me and my husband .
M	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
M	after 0 days and no contact i cancelled the order .
F	although i '_d rather have sorted this in private via my account with you .
F	where i appreciate that iflorist do a great job usually as ive used them many_times and always been happy with the flowers i do feel they need to visit the shops they have registered with them as some are not shops but con women posing as florist shops .
F	parking staff and service couldn_'_t be better , but fastrack security upgrade was a waste of money .
M	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd_sports .
F	i had a problem with my fridge_freezer the freezer stopped_working on the friday .
M	pride and place above the mantle .
M	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden_frame bed for them to collect .
F	!
M	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
F	i would definately recommend this website to others .
F	great flowers , fabulous price and same day delivery !
M	it was obvious it wasn_'_t in stock so i cancelled .
M	parcel arrived well_packaged and safe a couple of days_later .
M	also had to chase after delivery driver when i realised that he had failed to deliver the most_important of the two packages , although clearly that is not an ffx problem .
F	really good company to do_business with and received a small discount for my order .
M	good rate of exchange for pounds to euros but having placed the order on wednesday , transferred the money within minutes of receiving the confirmation on wednesday , had to chase them on friday to find out why the order was still sitting in pending , awaiting funds .
F	the long_distance flight was awesome : excellent service , nice & experienced staff , great media centre with lots of movies to pick .
F	the bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault .
F	after finding them on the internet , i requested a free sample which arrived within a couple of days .
M	i '_ve been through all this and i have had it with yodel so don_'_t act like you are bothered now .
F	when i arrived on monday_morning to collect the flowers i waited at information , there were two staff on , both with customers , neither acknowledged me or said we wont_be long , after a few_minutes i went into flower area , rang the bell and no - one responded , returned to information where another lady was in the queue by now , she walked off referring to lack of service .
M	trustpilot uses a system to allow retailers to request a review guideline and in the interim period not show the review .
M	ideal !
F	so it was all squashed and split_open .
M	the site was easy to navigate through .
M	when i phoned drum_stop to question this i was told that they received it from the manufacturer without the bag . and that was it !
M	i thought that i was getting a tester from ' rapitest ' but it was actually from ' tenax '.
F	i '_ve also noticed it with other sections too .
F	thanks !
F	festive_lights had a huge_selection of beautiful garden solar_lights .
F	der flug konnte umgebucht werden das war nicht das problem nicht aber das hotel , wie oben erwähnt . bei abklärungen mit dem hotel wurde uns mitgeteilt , dass das hotel keine entschädigung erhält sondern alles zu gunsten von ebookerst geht .
F	!
M	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
F	the 0nd_pair i ordered killed my feet on the first time of wearing them and so are useless to me now too as are not just extremely uncomfortable , not true to size and they left me with numerous blisters !
M	have to assist drive to get your items from the van
F	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave_us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
F	it was considerably_cheaper_than elsewhere !
M	a clue .
M	0_stars lost for the web_site not indicating out of stock , and lack of initial_contact .
F	flowers were delivered on time and fresh but paid_extra for a larger bouquet and it so wasn_'_t worth it , although i '_d be worried how small the bunch would have been i '_d gone for the regular one !
F	:-)
F	i wrote to dpd but was totally_ignored .
F	i love the 000_% mullberry silk throw i bought . it '_s like a soft , snuggly blanket .
F	we had to wait a while for our order as it was initially declared out of stock but this was understandable as each item is apparantly ' made to order '.
F	i want my money back .
M	eventually got 00000000000 number ( why do amazon customers get an_alternative to the 0000 number ) and spoke to team_leader .
F	you are loosing out on so many customers .
M	got the same gent again .
M	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
M	thrilled with the black_diamond chute , which accommodates my rigging rope perfectly , is comfortable to carry and looks_like it will be durable .
M	didn_'_t take too long to dispatch , and once dispatched took 0 days .
F	i desperately_needed some tough and comfortable dog - walking_wellies and some garden_clogs - and i wanted them at a good price .
M	the payment goes through and the reservation made , and then it gets cancelled a few hours_later and the money refunded .
F	if i had managed to get_hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
M	great company , very easy transaction , will be using again
F	my experience with serenata_flowers was absolutely awful , they were a present for my mum , as they arrived they were in a dreadful state , half of them were dead , some of the flower_heads were coming off im not happy what so ever .
F	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
M	in addition , i will be ringing / emailing their head_office to make an official_complaint .
F	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i '_m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
F	payment taken by worldstores on 00th_december .
M	the balance of the payment was taken from my account without_prompting i . e : paid deposit and chose vehicle etc , gave flight number etc , next thing , recieved an email to say full outstanding_balance had been taken off my visa account .
M	" 0 x rentokil bed_bug killer ."
F	part fine but took about 00 days to arrive !
M	then again , it was a gift to someone and they were thoroughly pleased with the result .
M	its mostly impossible to get through on the phone in less_than an_hour and when i have raised a query its ignored .
M	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
F	my sister tells_me that they were bright purple and looked as though they hade been dyed purple as well .
F	i told them to have more flowers sent out as they did admit they were not as full as they should have been .
F	i think envirofone should give the option of telling them if your phone isnt working in the first quote instead of after youve been quoted and sent your phone off .
F	not great service at all especially on a very hot day .
M	thanks very much .
F	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
M	mail order is the only answer .
M	staff on site were not very pleaseant to deal with and a bit rude .
F	i just have a bit complain_about the information they gave on their website about a model of contact_lenses , that wasn_'_t completely right .
F	i was then advised that the items were on pre_- order and would be delivered mid - january ( this was in november !).
M	delivery company leaves a lot to be desired as parcel turned_up soaking_wet and i had to unpack on door_step as it fell_apart .
M	luckily they let_me in but it could have been nasty .
F	thanks for a great service !
M	cabin was clean although noisy at floor 0
M	wish them continued_success
M	i shall now investigate my vet '_s attitude to providing prescriptions , as i can see from your weebsite that some prescription items - eg advocate spot - on - are even more heavily_discounted .
M	it was neverr requested to send a copy of my prescription if in doubt .
F	easy to order online and delivery arrived on time .
F	missing instructions received but the hardware provided and the instructions still didn_'_t match - called to tell them only to be told that they would get someone adept to diy to call me . how condescending . like i '_m incapable and it me that '_s at fault not the instructions .
M	i have been buying flowers regularly for many_years and the quality of those that you have sent is certainly as good as any i have had in the past .
F	would have appreciated something from the company on why it has_been delayed , especially when the money was taken out very promptly over a month_ago .
F	we had to thoroughly clean the kitchen on arrival as it poorly cleaned and the maid service was poor , they only made the beds nothing else .
F	my husband was very pleased with his coat but i was disappointed with the quality of it .
F	best price i could find anywhere .
M	groupon say that the item was despatched to royal_mail for delivery but have no proof of this .
F	the invitations arrived quickly , but they weren_'_t square ( i could tell that with the naked_eye ) and the envelope stock was so poor that i had to line them or you could see the invitation through them .
F	when i asked how long before it would be back to normal i was told i had to contact vodafone to find out .
F	recommended .
M	customer service promised to send me an email update on the friday if they came in with the possibility of a saturday delivery .
M	bullguard have decided to upgrade the service during oct ' 00 without_any warning to customers or any information on their service status page .
F	i purchased flowers on hearing death of a friends mother .
M	can '_t ask much more than that .
F	!
F	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
F	the time scales given were a little optimistic , but manageable .
M	the adverts never seem to have a problem . think about it !!!
M	i got confirmation it would be delivered with parcel_force within 00_hours a day after i bought it .
F	the furniture is excellent and the delivery men were enthusiastic and helpful .
M	i am robs wife .
M	brilliant site , lots of choice but £ 0 . 00 to ship a 00gram shackle is outrageous .
F	!
F	great collection of nice bits and pieces for kiddies .
M	i could understand say maybe £_00 for your troubles .
F	i am extremely disappointed at my service and agitated that i have received no response .
M	really disappointed with this service !
F	this was my third order over three years , and every one has_been mismanaged by this company enticing me back with a voucher_code that never works . their strange way of saying sorry !
F	as these are such important_documents , i sent them by recorded & tracked delivery .
F	very impressed , this is how easy ordering should be which in turn will most definitely mean i will order again with absolutely no_hesitation .
F	he was friendly and cheerful and gave_us good advice about unpacking and inspecting the items .
M	get a legally_binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
M	lesson is to be alert when booking !
F	estimated delivery 0 - 00 days .
F	we paid release months before .
F	previous feedback had made them seem as if they were so dependable and used quality flowers .
M	spoke with this company direct and they admitted fault and apologised , so not a fault of 0wisemonkeys .
F	efficient , the turn_around from placing the order was very quick !
M	they boast they have 0000 vans .
M	we have still not received a call or letter from them .
F	our prime_oak_worktops look truly stunning and we would highly_recommend that you check out worktop_express for price , quality and choice .
M	that is if i can ever find anything in stock !!!!.
M	i received notification , and tracked same , yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 that it would be delivered on same day .
M	chased by telephone , and the lady answering was courteous and said she would look into things .
M	quality of mats good but holes don_'_t line up exactly .
F	i was then even more impressed when i realised i would be able to receive delivery of my item in just two_days !
M	i have been with bt for many_years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
F	she then covered her name tag and said she is not called_amy .
M	to the directors of laptops direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
F	i used the old jessops quite a lot and that was speedier somehow .
M	they are friendly , efficient and their prices are very competitive ; deliveries are also quite prompt .
F	i refused ( who wouldn_'_t ?).
F	i will be using jessops again .
M	i use iphone for internet .
M	i shall be very surprised if i hear from tdl .
F	the process went_smoothly .
F	it seems they are now scraping the barrel to get companies to sign up to offer a deal .
M	very bad – unacceptable experience , unreasonable , sly , rottens fraud and rude_conduct as a customer under two years contract with 0 more months to go .
F	i finally called superdry to be asked ( by an uninterested employee ) for a reference which i didn_'_t have !
M	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
M	original review :
F	spotted several suppliers advertising the exact_same goods , but these were the cheapest ( why pay more ?).
M	significant funds go through the account .
M	delivery etc was all good .
F	i queried via_email if my items would definitely be despatched same day for next_day delivery and received a reply from customer_services .
M	straight - finish 0 "
F	it was so easy to order and check out the video on the products !
M	all very good
F	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
F	the embroidery was wrong ( and different from the sample i had had to pester the company to let_me see and agree to ).
F	my order arrived within 0 working_days , the product is fantastic and has worked_brilliantly , very happy customer will buy from here in future .
F	rep signed us up then ignored us . goods damaged in shipping .
M	however , one pair i could not see through , obviously the wrong prescription - both orders had the correct prescription .
F	got the job_done , as best as i can tell .
F	i ordered a blue lagoon for my grandmothers_birthday and upgraded it to medium so it appeared exactly as on the website .
F	the old addage of ." if you think it '_s too good to be true " rings here .
M	they said the colour i ordered was now discontinued and that the new colour would arrive in the next few_days and they would despatch for delivery the folowing week .
M	ordered several products , but suunto computer was supplied with almost dead battery and surface_scratches on the screen .
M	the complaints_department never responded or took calls .
M	so the shipping itself was easy .
F	the driver rang and said he would be 00_minutes and he was .
F	disappointing .
F	now my first point of call for environ_products : service second to none , very fast delivery and competitively_priced .
M	good price of products
M	as it turned_out my worries were totally_unfounded .
M	website said 0 units in stock .
M	october_0000 , i contacted them about a guitar i was interested in and brought to their attention that it was £_00 more_expensive on their site than other music stores on the web , on the plus_side they reduced the price to bring it inline with the other stores i had seen it advertised on , i ordered the guitar . on opening the packagaing found the inner foam protective bag ripped and holed , on taking the guitar out found the protective_film on the pickups missing , body and headstock dirty and covered in fingermarks and dust , no protective_film on the scratchplate , and chips out of the paintwork .
F	awful customer service , rude and arrogant .
M	well_worth the money !!
M	only when i got a call from the driver saying he was outside my house did it was arriving !
M	sound website , good and interesting products , speedy delivery .
M	i cannot_fault the service , delivery or the product from this company .
M	first time order and delivery .
M	i '_ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
F	on telephoning the staff were extremely_helpful and knowledgable .
F	but , this is the only time i '_ve had problems with them .
M	i personally use pro 0 complex and whey_protein smoothie , both mix well and have helped_me achieve my personal goals .
M	i wasted a days hols as it rained in the afternoon so could not fit them .
F	even_though we advised our opening_hours of 0am - 0pm , the delivery was made at 0am and left with an adjoining building - no card put through our door , it was left up to that company to come and advise us of our delivery .
F	so i went and got the card cancelled and was issued with a new one .
F	brake_discs worn and pitted £_000 . windscreen_wiper not clearing windscreen properly the list_goes on . total_cost £_000 . 00 !!!!!!!!
F	their accounts_department got in touch with their claims_department who said thay had not heard of us .
F	ordered 0_seater ford galaxy or similar and was given a vw transporter which is a 0_seater .
F	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
M	complete con .
M	its useful over all and can save you money .
F	and then i sent mails no reply from them .
F	we must acknowledge that the next_day a portable heater was provided by the owners for our parents room .
M	they couldn_'_t even tell me which courier firm they had used .
M	whose customer service is 000_% reliable .
M	i will say that i '_ll not be ordering any other flowers this was again and i certainly wouldn_'_t recommend it to anyone .
F	the course was cancelled but i was not advised .
M	brought one item which i wanted which was fine .
F	so we went into a 0 store .
M	goods were delivered to the wrong house , about three miles_away .
F	pictures of products areclear , the site is easy to use and they have my favourite_brands .
M	likewise in store , a few of the staff have been helpful and polite , but my do they have more than their share of staff who really do them no favours .
M	corruption !
M	the only fault that i encountered was with the express service whereby it was with royal_mail .
F	try to " read between the lines " if you can and build your_own opinion .
M	it would appear they have absolutely no_intention of publishing reviews below 0 or 0_star , despite their claims of guaranteed ' real customer feedback ' - it seems all reviews go before ekomi '_s review team who release the review providing there are no 0 , 0 or 0_star_ratings , if there are it goes to ' mediation '.
M	i then spoke to your online_chat_feature and the person_who was " helping " me was rather rude , gave_me a vague response and cut me off .
F	despite the fact that it wasn_'_t their fault that i hadn_'_t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without_any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
M	i can '_t express how poor their accounts_department seems to be .
M	i asked for photos as i said that the scooter was clean and had only been ridden for a few yards .
F	the service is spot_on and the price cannot be_beaten .
F	my order was checked and it was noticed by staff that products were for two different cars .
F	ordered a pair of william morris glasses from them having obtained a code from wowcher .
M	payment is easy and protected .
M	after ten days i contacted them and was told it would be another 00 days .
M	an easy to use web_site and swift delivery .
F	it was dirty and unclean .
F	on the 00 th we received an e_mail to day that they did not have enough stock . we cancelled .
F	the sentence_above_says it all
F	i would recommend swimshop for hassle_free good service .
M	total_waste of time & money !!
M	' so how do i get it up here ?'
F	i had no_problems_whatsoever , i ordered one day , the order arrived the next_day , well_packed , and everything was correct as per my order .
F	i will not be using them again for this reason .
F	- all i got was the same line said several_times " we don_'_t do price matching retrospectively !"
F	i really dont like the ' sit back and wait ' strategy as i have no idea if it was ever sent or if the seller even received my order .
M	i work from before 0 untill late every night and to be accused of having signed for something when no - one was at my home and i have evidence of this was shocking , bad service and rude customer_care - i have told 0 that unless they change courier i will not order with them again .
M	great service which couldn_'_t be_faulted .
M	!
F	i have been with orange for a few_years_now and i have only stayed with them because of the orange_wednesdays but even that has lost its appeal .
F	thought they were great to speak to over phone - i had to re - order some tiles and they were good matching the batch .
M	0st order was good .
M	will happily shop at surfmountaiun again .
F	easy website , competitive_prices & excellent delivery , thank_you
F	i was a bit_dubious when ordering 0 pairs of glasses for so little and so was my partner as they were for him .
F	they provide an excellent one stop on line store .
M	it said 0 were in stock on the order ???
M	the 00 june came and went .
F	they sent it to me with the belt missing .
M	the ferry trip i took from belfast to cairnyan was one of the best i '_ve ever had .
M	the product was as_described but over a week from order befor shiped and then only sent by normal mail .
M	this meant i was without insurance_excess_waiver , so i raised a ticket on your website asking how to extend the policy term .
F	the complaints are logged , so the more people who complain to them , the more likely it is that action will be taken .
M	the website is very easy to use , with lots of offers .
M	fender screws arrived just two_days after ordering .
F	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can '_t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
F	brilliant service , kept me well updated .
F	will be using again .
M	money was paid as agreed , but it took nearly three_weeks for money to hit my account .
F	~
M	thanks
M	leicestershire , uk .
M	driver knew nothing about the timings .
F	the food arrived on time and was well_packed .
M	when you can get 0kg of chicken_breast for £_00 , that '_s a deal !
F	if you sell stuff - telling people its free isnt funny ( or imaginitive !!)
M	the local tyre_fitting facility i selected turned_out to have closed_down .
M	i tried several * fixes * ( extra silica gel etc_.)
F	with nothing showing up on my emails for a couple of minutes i assumed that the order hadn_'_t gone_through so i re - ordered .
F	i will indefinitely use this site again !
F	i have used tyre_shopper twice_now , for two different cars .
F	am always impressed by the speed of delivery too .
F	definitely recommended .
F	i lost over_£_000 in food and meat which was extremely annoying especially as my husband is disabled and i had to give up work 0 years_ago to care for him , we were left out of pocket .
F	we found him uninterested and lazy , often ignoring us to talk to other vietnamese tourguides or locals .
F	would recommend this company .
F	very easy to use and personalise the templates .
F	ordered at 0pm and got it the next_morning !
F	i will order from this company again !
F	however , although i had written my greeting for the card , it was just a blank card .
F	goods as_described and packaged well .
M	they emailed me a day and time for delivery and kept to it .
M	all done by email .
M	net result no camera ( was a christmas_present ) and no refund yet .
F	i was informed that they were processing my order but then i received another email the following_day with a revised_offer of which was no where near my quote online , in fact £_00 less which i found insulting .
M	i used the lift away , and that only used the dust setting .
M	on the 0nd order 0 out of 0 items delivered were faulty .
F	they sent me my pack out straight_away and it was a quick service .
M	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0_weeks .
F	the cleaning and maintenance was carried_out as per the description .
F	was told between 0 - 0pm on the saturday and the fitter arrived bang_on time .
F	!
M	shame that the upstand ordered was not pre_- oiled .
F	then we saw that they were very wilted and unattractive .
F	efficient delivery .
M	i sent an email to customer_services who stated i had received the order i wanted .
M	i hear the same about the store from friends , family , and just people i know passing me in the street , keighley argos has a terrible reputation , especially regarding its staff .
F	many_thanks swimshop .
F	would recommend this site to friends .
M	i placed an order for a new watch_strap and was delighted when the strap arrived 00hrs_later , i will_definitely buy from bablas again .
F	also black and white and i think it '_s too dark .
F	my son was so excited to choose the colour he wanted himself & when it arrived there was no stopping him putting it straight on .
F	this meant when i opened the box items were missing ( this was couriers fault and not partyrama ) i got onto partyrama and was dealt_with promptly and my missing items were sent out that day and arrived the next .
F	i have bought two embroidery machines hoops consumables and more from this site .
F	i '_m not even sure this is legal as per our consumer_rights , but i simply couldn_'_t be bothered with the faff of returning the thing .
M	without even calling_card being left on doors .
F	never used you guys before but good value and quick deliver .
M	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit
M	the range of fragrances is better_than competitors and the prices are keen too .
F	far to late .
M	when i checked my bank_balance i ' d had £_00 took out of my account by shopto . net even_though i hadn_'_t ordered anything .
M	when i tried to amend the order and later cancel it i couldn_'_t get in touch with anyone as they don_'_t have a phone number and the e_mail page wouldn_'_t work .
M	shoes were exactly as_described and delivered quickly as promised .
F	i found the company on google .
F	the company is quick to take the money but refuse to refund the item within a few_days .
M	0_weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
F	we were told balance of order would be with us on 00th , they were not
M	customer_support took a very aggressive / unhelpful approach .
M	all this said , ki would certainly use the service again .
M	buy with caution
M	paid the amount , instantly received an email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .
M	its worth_paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
M	it is not a question of my having ' resorted ' to cancelling my order .
F	also very competitive_prices having checked other_websites .
M	!
M	further follow_up : the owner of the company continues to object to factual feedback left for his company .
M	would use them again in the future
F	really easy site to use and very quick_turnaround .
M	!
M	everything about the chat took_ages and was as annoying as everything else in this sorry_saga .
M	sent iphone 0 in good condition , sent recorded delivery , then got email_saying screen_cracked which is a joke as this had bubble_rap and was in a case , said phone screen_cracked so it was put down form 000 to 00 , i have sent many phone before with out problem , this has made me so mad and i will never trust this company again , would not surprise me if the company has_been sold to somebody_else .
M	great
M	however , they take payment for the new tyre right away , saying that they will refund the difference if the new tyre is not needed .
F	the ordering experience was very good .
F	the boat was roomy and comfortable .
F	!
M	i walked_away and i '_ll never use them again .
F	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
M	( 0 ) immediate and considerate customer_support .
M	!
M	thankyou
M	wow thanks so much , you mean you wont charge me to send something you have not provided me with in the first place !
F	delivery was excellent and no problem exchanging .
F	well_done eflorist i will definitely use again
F	obviously now i have to wait for my refund and locate the instrument at another shop all in time for father ’_s day !
M	!
M	diamond ice grippers are the bench_mark for quality reliability and durability .
M	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
F	would definately recommend .
M	good price .
M	i had to make 0 telephone_conversations on the day to make it happen .
F	delivery quicker_than i expected & great to receive a text_advising one hour time_slot :) would recommend
M	long_standing staff stood around making small talk wth clients they knew , while i was stood for about 0 minutes with an eton shirt in my hand wanting to try it on .
F	i wanted to rent a car , and purchase insurance . i rented a car ( no_issues there ) and purchased the extra excess_insurance offered .
M	the handedness of the curved leg supports was not evident in the instruction .
F	you get to the end of it all and the installation date .
M	( trying to phone monarch did not help , as travel_republic have all the booking details of the flights , and to do it over the phone you need this . monarch tell you to book it via your travel_agent )
F	you need to look at this or i won_'_t be ordering for this site again .
F	in the end i dealt_with the matter by email but it took several emails to get all the information i needed . with the bigger websites such as net a porter or matches , the returns / exchange process is seamless .
M	the boots i ordered which are pediwear brand are only okay .
F	the order went through easily and was delivered within two_days .
F	00th_january
M	delivered as promised , so_far so good .
F	i needed to administer it ( as one of my cats , has tapeworms ) so i used it .
F	found the gravy / sauce a bit thin ( especially in the pork and madeira product ).
F	i really have no idea why this company has a 0 . 0 rating !
F	thank_you .
M	i didn_'_t like at all how clumsy and difficult it was to cancel .
M	instead amazon are trying to entice you to purchase the film rather_than simply wait for the rental to become_available .
M	i am very pleased indeed with digitalrev !
M	got my quote friday_afternoon . return pack turned_up saturday .
M	ordered my items with this company as it said they had the items in stock .
M	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
M	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
F	website gives false_information on parts and the call_centre when questioned on the confusing information seemingly also have no clue .
M	first time use for this company and was very impressed with efficiency of their sevice and range of products available , all at competitive_prices .
M	otherwise fine .
M	awful flight now room at all .
F	it had a further 0 tears and a crack .
M	helpful advice from o0 shop in seeking mobile_phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history .
M	in sum , a most impressive service and a golf_gear supplier that will be my first choice from now on .
M	they came the next_day in the post and were very well priced .
M	my requirement ( for several reasons ) was for an identical replacement and there were several such items on the web including some cheap new ones on ebay , but i chose the tradeworks item as i could get it quickly and with ( or so i thought ) the 00v power_cable and adapter included .
F	i don_'_t think the price structure took the smaller therapist into_consideration and am quite disappointed in proto col .
F	had ben looking for this type of saucepan for ages so delighted with my product .
F	a fab range of drinks and also mixers to accompany them .
M	i would like to say that it takes a lot to make me write a negative_review about a company , but kwik_fit have persuaded me to do so with their abysmal service .
F	we were charged an extra 00 euro for checking in on a monday that was a bank_holiday even_though we were the ones inconvenienced .
M	update november 00 : and here we are , coming up to a month later and no reply from co - operative banking .
F	i have ordered 0 x 00g whole allspice more than a week_ago , still_haven_'_t received it .
F	and the best part is , the prices are normal , not over the top rip_off ones .
F	if you can avoid it , don_'_t use this company to collect parcels .
F	?
M	i phoned them up and said that there wasnt a fault so they ' re - tested ' it and surprisingly there was indeed no faults and i got my full_amount of money .
M	this threw up the result ' your package has_gone for re - delivery '.
F	my main criticism is that the centre of the pages do not flow into each other as they used to and you can loose some of the picture because of this .
M	the day went_smoothly and the night was amazing !
M	shine taken off an otherwise good experience .
F	great service , quick and efficient .
M	!
F	package arrived in excellent shape , and wonderfully fast .
M	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
M	i ended_up walking out , all they are interested in is money .
M	goods arrived in perfect_condition .
M	keep an eye on the site as prices fluctuate hourly , possibly with the euro rate as they are holland based not uk despite the co . uk domain .
M	so , back to the website - it tells_me the ticket number and postcode i have entered don_'_t match ( hello .
F	it was next_day delivery and i didn_'_t recieve it next_day so i rang them two_days_later to chase .
F	not even sure i will !
F	the replacement product fits well but i did have to telephone to find out the dimensions .
M	researched mora knife on youtube and it has lived_up to expectations .
F	purchased quite a lot of sparklers for halloween / bonfire weekend .
M	the tank size was only 00 litres !
F	shame you don_'_t do xl in this jacket as love the colour .
F	the belt per_se is brilliant but the smell is just unacceptable .
M	i have emailed their customer_services .
F	at 00 . 00pm i received another text to say they had tried to deliver and would try again the next_day .
M	maybe update your pics ?!
F	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public_forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
F	in a gleeful tone .
F	thanks
F	the site had some tips for packing and moving in general which were handy , especially for a first time mover .
M	however if you enjoy excellent coffee and you have gone to the trouble and expense of buying a nespresso_machine why compromise on the coffee ?
M	i also found it very strange that there was no reply when the door was knocked as i knew she was in and she has two dogs that bark as soon as the door is knocked .
M	nice furniture but long wait
M	good prices .
F	however they kept their promises by delivering quickily .
F	service , delivery and customer_care .
M	well_laid_out & easy to use website - simple payment system & fast response & delivery .
M	she_loved it so i went from near divorce to hero for the day .
M	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
M	good prices , good products , good service .
M	please_accept my apologies that we are unable to further your complaint .
F	excellent on prices as well .
M	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
F	thanx simply_supplements .
M	i am still_waiting for the call but surprisingly the product was delivered by post the next_day even_though it was a different_colour from the one ordered .
F	i ordered 0 mother '_s day bouquets .
F	the flowers looked like a non - professional had thrown them together .
M	would be great and would be use the site so much more if they could get a fast free reliable delivery sorted .
M	in future i will be thinking twice on which courier company i wish to use .
M	the first lot of flowers were in my opinion sub - standard , but when i told seranata that this was so and sent photos they immediately sent another bouquet without and hesitation .
F	ordered headphones paid_extra for next_day delivery three_days on still_waiting .
M	overall , an experience to be recommended – and at half the high_street price !
F	i thought that i was going to have to get it through tax avoiding amazon , and was really pleased to come_across simplyhike .
M	personally , everything i '_ve purchased from them has worked_perfectly , but it does make one worry to hear such stories .
F	never had this before !
M	i ordered flowers to arrive at my partners work on friday i stupidly didn_'_t check delivery times although at no point in making the order online does the website clearly show delivery times .
F	at lunch_time , having heard_nothing once again , i telephoned blinds0uk and was connected to the same rude representative i had initially dealt_with , who barked at me " hold on " and placed me on hold .
M	the reply gave an excuse which had no bearing on the circumstances and included an itinerary which did not reflect what had been given , at a price of £ 0000 , ie almost £_000 more .
M	on leaving he spun the van wheels in the gravel , leaving deep ruts , crashed over a large rock placed to keep vehicles off of the grass , and drove across part of the lawn , leaving wheel marks .
M	three things i value the most when online shopping !
F	the price of the meal deal and what was involved is definitely worth considering if staying there and will use that facility again .
F	well reccommend to other custmers .
M	on the second order i was again wrongly charged a delivery fee after inputing the appropriate offer code .
F	also there was absolutely no mention of £_00 for petrol at the time of purchase .
M	i will be shopping here again as the price was competetive even with the delivery charge !
F	quick reliable service , will use again .
F	the site was really easy to use and the product is amazing quality .
M	some credit on your account ?
F	to top it all prestige lodged a claim on trust_pilot that my review was not accurate !
F	have been a loyal_customer of orange for many_years , yet when i have a problem customer_services don_'_t want to know .
M	we thought these were rat_poison and were horrified to think what could have happened had the grandchildren been with us and helped themselves to the fruit .
M	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
M	however i sold my wii and brought a samsung_smart_tv and all the good stuff dis appeared .
F	they were very helpful friendly and efficient .
F	the flowers were not what i expected the picture shows a completely_different view of the flowers .
M	?
M	thanks again
M	if you need any radiators check out this website .
M	delivered exactly as stated .
F	i can '_t find it cheaper anywhere_else .
M	some flavours are very good but others are just too wishy washy ( weak ) which turned me off .
F	infact i think on one occasion titmuss forgot to arrange for delivery as citylink had no details of it .
M	customer service has since been in touch and have declared that this was a rare mishap , i think 0_stars is fair .
M	having checked the website it doesn_'_t even look like its possible to order what my wife actually received !!!
F	my iphone was coming with yodel .
M	it '_s exactly as_described and good quality product .
F	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord .) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
F	the tupperware was advertised as £ 0 . 00 reduced from £_00 . 00 .
M	i have heard staff aggressively effing and blinding on the shop floor without a care that customers are walking around .
M	i love the whisky_exchange !

F	such great bargains and delivery so fast
M	they refused to pay out and i had to pay full cost of the car to the lease company and they black listed me so now have to pay over £_000 per_month for insurance instead of £_000 per year .
M	i '_m very angry at this time , actually it has never happened before with the other orders , don_'_t know if i have to blame interlink_express but for three_times i recieve a email with " we tried to deliver your order from affordable_supplements limited however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below "!
F	have not tested it in a fire and hopefully t ; hat will not hapen
M	i also asked for 0 pair to have photo chromic lenses ( again i thought i had ordered this type ) the supervisor offered a 00_% reduction , which i accepted .

M	so when i needed 0 new tyres , i shopped_around and tyre_shopper were the best value for money .
F	examples of unnatural linking could include buying links to pass pagerank or participating in link schemes .
M	a normal royal airmail package usually takes 0 to 0 days to sweden from uk when i have bought from other_sellers in uk , but most of the time i have to wait 00 days or more to get the package from chemical - records .
M	0 . 00am the next_day i receive an email to say my payment was accepted but still no xbox_points .
M	top_notch !
M	highly_recommended and i '_ll be using them again .
M	justice was served !!
M	i phoned boots customer_care , to complain and felt_like i was being_fobbed_off , a report would be made nothing more .
M	the jobs were done quickly and efficiently , kept contact with me throughout with any_issues and updates .
M	to get removal of old washer £ 0 . 00
F	i found paypal payment option really handy and fuss - free as well as secure .
M	i was very pleased to have picked this company to short out my retiement policey
M	no issues with the product that was great , but delivery was slow this time .
M	let '_s not get too excited . it '_s only a box of paper !
F	!
F	would definately recommend webtogs .
F	either having 0 man to deliver so that they can actually deliver to the location or note to the customers could have avoided this bad_experience with delivery .
M	well_done
F	by then , he confirmed that the motor had been received but because it had been bolted on to the machine , but never used , they would not refund any money to me .
F	they arrived not suitable , so wasted all that time and very disappointed in the quality .
M	sometimes it takes months for money to come through but when it does it is a nice bonus .
M	will use again .
M	shipping time not bad considering coming from overseas .
M	mike huston
M	in the end i submitted my own divorce petition to the court , using online help notes and a bit of " trial and error " training .

M	i '_ve lost_count how many issues i '_ve had with city_link .
F	unfortunately , one has a scratch just above the engraving ( if it had been on the underside this would not have been noiticed , so rather spoils a great looking gift ) ie one is perfect , one is not - shame ( also had something sticky on it , luckily i managed to remove this ) thanks anyway
F	keep in touch
F	it begins to get too much and takes up too much time decding what i want and in the end i just close it down and put off purchasing .
F	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don_'_t think the other girls will either .
M	thank_you , satisfy
F	to go on the website today and see it has_been ceased is very worrying they have 0 new phones worth a total of £_000 .
M	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
F	i thought the whole_process from ordering , allocaed delivery slots of 0 hours , to final delivery were first_rate .
M	i rang three_times and the person on phone assured me he would leave the parcel .
M	please carry on the good work !!
M	can '_t fault delivery service though !

M	i am very pleased with the watches , and would definitely purchase from iconic_watches again .
M	after ordering polybags the delivery days were 0 - 0 working_days .
M	then i saw this site .
M	later in the evening i noticed my account was empty and i was left embarrassed at the supermarket unable to pay .
F	the delivery was very quick and was impressed by this however the major letdown was having to unroll it out of the ball it had been screwed_up into and flung in a bag - having to iron it before i could even consider letting him see it - a product of this quality i would have expected that the time could have at_least been taken to fold it overall good product but i will try and buy i store from now on
M	the good : scubastore products are well priced and delivery time is fair .
F	good price , £_00 off rrp
F	thanks heinnie_haynes

F	arrived speedily .
M	i bought a goldtop epiphone_les_paul standard a few weeks_ago and it was my first purchase with guitarguitar so i was a bit_apprehensive anyway as all of my purchases are usually made from richtone_music .
M	highly_recommended ; would use again !
F	we had to call made .
F	whilst i appreciate that the lilies will last longer when closed it was a smaller display than in the photo than i was expecting
M	ordering_process on their website is quick and easy , the payment was secured through palpal and delivery arrived when expected on all 0 occasions .
M	not what i ' d_hoped . they clearly saw me coming !
F	i would like to suggest that if a picture is going to be blown up over a double page spread or if the quality isn_'_t perhaps up to scratch , that jessops and cewe warn you , either by a pop - up or by contacting you directly as i would have then been warned and my expectations would not have been so high .
M	not the best start to a trip and certainly not meet and greet , as i view it .
F	not the case here .
M	sony_xperia s

M	its the first time i used an on - line pet company to order food from but these_guys popped up on my search and there website caught my eye and the prices , so i placed an order for my barking heads dog_food i also entered a discount_code and got some money off result !
M	i mean for god sake the only thing u didn_'_t ask me for was blood .
F	in the uk it is unusual to offer £_00 notes let_alone £_000 ones which is the nearest to these so why do travelex use them ?
M	staff are polite , sometimes french staff onboard and notice they can be abrupt and rather impolite .
F	which is why they set_up and their whole marketing_campaign .
M	however when received the pack to send of i noticed that if you wanted it sent with tracking_information it would cost 0 . 00 hang on why would i pay to sent my phone off ?
F	will attempt to use the website again .
M	i did however order a microwave because it was the one i wanted and the price seemed ok .
M	everything arrives next_day for a small special delivery cost - well_worth it .
M	no_problems at all - would recommend to others .

M	i have written to groupon and will be making lots more waves . please do not trust anything important ( like photos ) to this bunch of miscreants .
M	good advert for them !
M	it should be pointed_out that the calender was sent in completly the wrong order so i had to take it apart and put it all back together again correctly which was a pain in the backside .
M	hence unless you come upfront with any fees , incl them in your offer or at_least lower them to comparable levels i will shy_away to use your site for numerous trips me and my family are taking regularly .
M	buy from hotrox if you wish , but you just better hope that you don_'_t get a problem . for me this is too much of a risk when you are spending large_amount of money !

F	i then put the phone down as this was so rude .
F	it had broken by the end of january ( completely dead for no apparent_reason ).
F	liquids last and good value for money but the menthol are not as minty as i like .

M	best of all she_loved the roses and they looked fantastic .

F	we are waiting for stereophonic tickets for the assembly rooms derby this monday_00rd .
F	at this point another employee arrived and i said i wasn t really as they had an overpricing policy to which they became quite confrontational and said i could take it further if i wanted but it would be looked at as fraud and it would seems as if i was in collusions ( their exact wording ) with the checkout girl .
F	i know it was my fault with the time mistake , but it does not take this long to rectify a problem .
M	i received a reply saying " further to your request , we would like you to adress your inquiry to expedia with which you booked your flight ."

F	it was the same price as h . o .
M	the national_tyre_fitters were great , but suitably very embarrassed about the whole_thing . tyre_shopper on the other hand couldn_'_t have cared less . i had to purchase more_expensive tyres in the end . and funnily_enough they were in stock .
F	the flowers were of excellent quality .
F	matter sorted now but not happy at the time .
F	they refused to let_me return it .
F	you are unable to email them directly and i could not find a telephone_number to contact them .
M	stop dumping ( you call it delivering ) parcels in bins !!
F	i have since seen the flowers and even the so called upgrade i am extremely unhappy about the quality of an expensive flower gift
F	i '_ve read so many bad_reviews , don_'_t use them , we never will again .
M	secondly the web_site stated the sunglasses i ordered were in stock , they werent .
F	on line i ' phoned to be told my account had been cancelled for some reason even_though i had an acknowledgement via_email to say it was on its way .
M	remote came with battery .
F	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
F	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
M	delivery was fast and well_packaged , would use this site again .
M	a complete disgrace .
M	i booked the holiday using our joint credit_card .
M	supaglazing were emailed with a detailed list 0_weeks before he finally phoned us .
M	it '_s the first time i '_ve_used parts_gateway , and generally i like the way it works .
F	cats had a good go at their new cheap food and they ' re normally quite fussy !
M	will not buy from again .
F	friend loved them .
M	i have a hire car for three_weeks in portugal during july this year and i needed insurance to cover damage_excess , which is not covered by the local hire car insurance .
M	just what they offered - right on time - good price - and they sent me a text to say they had been delivered
M	the doors are good quality , hardware is over priced and delivery is slow , quoted me 0 - 0 working_days but took 0
M	no_hassle .
M	mobile replaced eventually , with another one that didnt work .
F	they were dead and the sorriest flowers i '_ve ever_seen .
F	it meant we had no_surprises when we received the item it was exactly_what we wanted .
F	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
M	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
M	if i could_find evidence to the contrary in the confirmation_email , let them know and they would investigate_further , needless to say , i could not find the email and so the matter had to be dropped .
F	on the whole an excelllent service but i received numerous phone_calls immediately following the placement of my online order trying to sell me insurance_policies for my furniture .
M	as it happens , i will be keeping my purchase .
F	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
F	i will be using these as one of my vendors to buy my prroducts in the future
F	we were disappointed with the personal tour_guide as his commentary was not very informative or knowledgeable - we were hoping to hear about the history of the buildings , etc - instead he spoke about purse snatching and relatives living in the states .
F	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
F	amazed that from my sketch and measurements we have a perfectly fitting worktop .
F	the country guides provide a good insight to various destinations and the shipping calculator is a nifty idea .
F	font_size is probably about four ( non - bold ) and green lettering on a yellow background ( for instance ) gives poor contrast .
M	so buying is great , talking to them afterwards isn_'_t .
M	i dont_think that is fair when there is no facility to try on goods beforehand
M	each product i have bought has worked for me , so i have confidence in this company , and would recommend them to anyone .
F	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher '_s poor service .
M	i pressed the link supplied and hey_presto , a nearly blank web_page stating " this site is not supported ".
M	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
M	surprisingly , having uploaded all 00 to the 0x0 boxes ( the only option ), i then had to change each one separately to 0x0 , as i could_find no way to select more than one at a time to change them .
F	would recommend this company
F	i never let the tap run when cleaning my teeth , we have two water butts and looking for another before the summer comes , always take a shower and not a bath and reuse water when we can .
F	so although adequate and will probably do the job ok i was disappointed with the fit .
F	good shopping_experience , too bad they dont have some of the more popular choices for people my age .
M	just log in & paste the amazon link & they '_ll send you an offer , usually within_00hrs .
F	i wrote an earlier , rather negative_review based entirely on the fact that i hadn_'_t received my order after 0_weeks .
F	just a thought !
F	treated with suspicion .
M	when i received it , it was even better_than i expected , i was soo happy with the quality of the gift and also the speed in which it was delivered , even with special requirements .
F	great products and excellent service
M	switch arrived , fitted , and we are now back up and running in single man operation . my wife no_longer has to operate a manual switch every time i brake .
F	tina hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
M	i accepted .
M	wish i ' d read other reviews .
F	what can i say apart_from the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about the products and the service is excellent .
M	the good lady knew what she wanted but being a housewife wanted the pennies to go further .
F	bt is fixing it , i promise with my life and soul i will call you in 0_days .
M	i left a 0_star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that '_s what i can call it ) with them .
F	this is a very easy and friendly site to use with plenty of confirmation emails along the way so you know how your order is proceeding .
M	can '_t fault this . amazing product and fast delivery .
M	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
M	what more could you want ?
F	the box was barely taped and very weak .
F	one cabinet was fine , the other looked like it had been dropped before being packed .
M	if we ' re lucky !
M	not good enough and the goods took three_weeks to arrive making it unlucky to put up will have to wait_until next year to use .
M	and it was not resolved with a full_refund .
F	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
M	very good customer service .
F	would highly_recommend phonebank
F	we almost always use alpharooms due to the competative_prices and user_friendly site .
F	hoping iflorist will at_least respond , & then explain & resolve the issue .
M	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email_telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days . then got an email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has_been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
M	we run a bed & breakfast in the limousin , france .
F	however i found the written instructions about attaching lettering to a banner very unclear .
F	the thing i think they need to change is the carasoul thing where it asks if you would like to meet so and so and if you both say yes it notifies you but then you have to pay to be able to see that persons profile !!
F	on opening the rubber selledhet get it tolerable .
F	therefore will not use this service again .
F	they say they are happy to refund without_fuss any items you may be dissatisfied with . but when you request a return_label from their website , you are charged 0 . 00 pounds which will be withdrawn from your refund !
F	at which point he walked back to his van and drove_off .
M	i was cleaning my unit out from top to bottom .
F	i was promised a call back but heard no more until i contacted them again after the weekend .
M	when i need any more evening wear i will be back
M	i am well pleased with the blower vac , i cant_wait for spring to use it . it will save my back no end . no more bending down , great edward bussey .
M	when they arrived , i only received one pair of glasses , so not such good value :(
F	fantastic value for money - delivered as requested - flowers gorgeous - would have no_hesitation in recommending !
M	the system is easy to understand and payment prompt after claiming .
F	in the beginning they are great , a little_slow but try to help .
F	there really are no strings , i couldn_'_t_believe it until i tried it and i just got £_00 back - brilliant , i am telling_everyone i know .
M	**
M	).
F	i really like your styles , colour options and the quality of the materials used , however , i have had to send many things back because your size 0 is very large by normal standards and you don_'_t do many things in size 0 .
M	if he was a bird he would fly .
M	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
M	i need to get something for a friend overseas .
F	at most cost of postage would have been around £ 0 . 00 first_class .
M	next my bags did not arrive back in the uk with me from las_vegas , we had baggage cover for delay & loss - however once again multitrip . com refused to pay out .
F	use amazon !
F	it was mortifying .
M	quality of goods and best of all prices .
F	hi
M	we have given them a month to try and repair it and they have failed .
F	i did consider returning them , but the electrician was standing beside me waiting to install them ( i bought two wall - lights and a hanging pendant ) and i didn_'_t want to have to wait while i went through the whole_process again .
F	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
M	i always leave it to the last_minute to order charlie '_s pills but as usual you got them to me the next_day .
M	in terms of the two letters that you have advised you have sent to carphone_warehouse ; if these letters have been received in our central office , it is possible that they have not reached our department yet .
F	i bought tickets , could just about afford to buy them and then found a massive booking_fee and postage cost which didn_'_t show up till i '_d made the decision to buy !
F	thankyou
F	brilliant low price .
F	i '_m currently embroiled in a war of worlds with them over a mistake they have made .
M	the arrangements for ordering a car for our holiday was fast , effi - cient and reliable .
M	however , the edging strips for use at each end of shed roof had numerous splits in the grain and therefore split even more when nailed to the shed .
M	had what i wanted , price was good and delivery excellant .
F	on saturday i telephoned , and the gentleman i spoke to was no help at all .
F	i got the impression of a small operation .
M	very dull , boring and depressing colours .
F	communication was excellent and price was unbeatable elsewhere .
F	i bought a ski_jacket in the sale - much_better priced than_anywhere_else on the internet with a really good selection of clothes .
F	i have tried again today and the phone is saying the same .
M	not just whisky , but loads of different specialist drinks .
M	!
M	dealing_with the salesman himself was fine and he did hid best .
M	took nearly 0 months getting here .
M	he said that the brake problem was nothing to do with what the mechanic had told me originally , and said it was just the wax burning off and it would have been fine to drive .
F	parcels ended_up being returned to the company web - blinds , despite three_separate promises that they would be redelivered the next_day .
M	while people were cashing in by selling them on ebay , coolshop sold it for a very reasonable price .
M	a free and easy return service made for a good experience .
F	well , i know it is nearly christmas but i placed an order on 00th_dec . it was not dispatched until 00rd .
M	will now by the parts i was looking at individually but this leaves me shopping elsewhere as what the attraction was to cyberpowersystem was the complete build already built .
M	mobile is just about acceptable
F	i had calculated that there was going to be a bank_holiday but this date would give me enough food for my little sick dog to cover a short delay .
F	it was christmas_present for my partner ( who has ibs )
M	great website with fast and efficient service from date of order to delivery .
F	will be booking next year with
M	item ( black dress_shirt ) i ordered got lost in the post , which is obviously not my tuxedo '_s fault , but did mean i didn_'_t have the item for when i needed it .
F	buy with confidence from chorley_group nissan at blackpool .
M	i '_m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so_far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
F	excellent
F	couldn_'_t have been easier or better .
M	i used to use parcel0go but after many failed_collections i moved to interparcel .
F	would definitely recommend and use again !
M	andrew smith
M	no apology , just another tirade about no - one had phoned him .
F	this is my first swiss gym_ball and i am not entirely_sure about the quality yet - the plastic seems to be thinner in some places .
M	payment was received by cheque a few of days after i sent the phone .
M	when i called for return instructions was told correct replacement would cost an additional £_00 . 00 , and also essentially told i was an_idiot .
M	i ordered a size too big , returned it and ordered a smaller one .
F	we ( boyfriend and i ) stumbled_across vietnamtravelplan ( part of rickshaw_travel ) whilst looking at photos of vietnam online , emailed them the next_day with a rough_idea of dates we wanted to go and that we wanted to fit in as much of the countries as we could , that was it .
F	- i don_'_t think so .
F	this company are dishonest , unreliable and employ extremely rude , unpleasant and unhelpful staff who never return calls .
F	the company are now refusing to refund me what i paid them despite not giving me any service .
F	got a call from my friend who absolutely loved her delivery , wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again or recommend to others .
F	the driver then asked us what time our flight was !
F	goods not received .
M	ordered swiss gear rucksack off the website - good prices and delivery was quicker_than stated - very happy with service given .
F	!
F	alot of it didn_'_t seem to relate to the item .
M	got a text offering an ipad , accepted than tried to cancel due to personal_circumstances email went back and forth over the period of 0 - 0 months trying to get it cancelled while still being charged .
F	thanks .
M	thank_you very much for this perfect purchase
F	quick delivery and great products .
F	arrived promptly and well_packaged .
M	i did eventually get my game but had to go through extensive verification that is way too much than necessary , i can see why you have so much verification but this needs to be toned down significantly as it makes the checking out process very complicated and lengthy .
M	i ordered ginkgo and as always it arrived quickly .
M	now being a linux user , it is frustrating that tech companies don_'_t support the os so i enquired as to possible future support .
F	has now exceeded my expectations on 0 occasions .
M	got first_class advice on the telephone at the time of purchase and delivery was swift ., but my items when taken out the box in a pretty mucky condition ( looking as though they have sat for some time collecting_dust and dirt on a shop floor / warehouse since the dawn of time ) not a massive issue as i washed all the items soon after taking out the box but it did ruin that new purchase feeling .
M	i recently organised a stag_do for 00 lads in bristol ( not an easy thing to do ).
F	ordering was straight_forward and simple , information on the product i ordered was easy to find .
F	another note , the womens medium polo_shirt ismmore llike a large .
F	the new dentocare 000 brushes in the upright pack are not nearly as good as the ones which used to come in a flatter green pack .
F	it is really antisocial - couldnt wear it to work - what would my clients think .
F	i received a response back stating that i would receive a reply in 0_days .
M	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
F	the bouquet was quite small and the flowers were not packed in a way which either helped them to stay fresh - they were looking quite limp after waiting a few hours to be presented as part of a leaving gift , or attractive - brown_paper inside plastic doesn_'_t look very nice .
M	don_'_t think i will use them again
F	bought this item for a pirate fancy_dress_party .
F	also people were asking where i had got it , so happily recommended escapade .
F	00 august ( 0_weeks_later ) and still nothing had been received .
F	!
M	beautiful strong plants obviously grown by experts i could not be more pleased , if i ' d been there picking them myself i doubt i could have done better .
M	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .

M	i do resent being told " you must stay in to receive these goods ".
M	given option to accept or reject
F	i am very embarassed as i had been given the job to order the flowers as a surprise for my friends birthday .
M	don_'_t even waste your time .
M	disembarking also fast and precise .
M	yes , it may make it simpler to code the ordering system that way , but it seems in no way necessary .
M	only took couple days to arrive .
M	car hand over and admin all went well .
M	how things should be .
M	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
M	- no choice of a mobile fitter to come to home address .
M	baz

F	really fast and efficient service - great !
F	thanks viagogo
F	the rucksack is the ideal size for what i need - backpacking_trip through america next month - and fits my single bivi tent , sleeping_bag , sleeping mat , clothes , walking_shoes , and sandals , toiletries and spare bits with no problem .
F	delivery service was very prompt .
F	good service
M	they not only have a wide_range of cameras and lenses but they also offer some good deals .
F	love the fact they colour code their bag so you know which food is frozen , chilled or room_temperature and that they will carry it right to the kitchen for you , rather_than just leaving it at the front_door .
M	annoyingly they close the toilets prior to the conclusion of the journey .
F	!
M	a special_offer , maybe , but certainly not special .
M	i got a courtesy_call after i had ordered the dac , and it arrived the next_day .
F	the person i spoke to on the first number was unable to help me and said that every time i sent a further email , my issue got pushed to the bottom of the pile .
M	but i did not expect to wait 0 days for them to be delivered .
M	sunglassesshop . com were also very quick on the delivery , so save the time searching for the best price when it is at the top of the search_engine !
F	was advised that this would be dleivered before this time as there is usually a 00 hour delivery turnaround .
F	great deals and gift_ideas too . looking_forward to carry on shopping with cheapsmells , com
M	" oh well " thinks i , " it '_s a busy day .
M	so don_'_t buy from this don_'_t - buy - jeans . net site .

F	fantastic on price and delivery next_day !
F	many_thanks
M	that said last time i used it the system worked correctly so maybe some glitches have been fixed .
M	i contacted customer_services ( very helpful ) who sent return authorisation etc , unwanted pair was returned - i '_ve not yet checked to see if the money was refunded .
F	happy with most of the products i ordered except the purple balloon_weights .
M	they seem_incapable of leaving with a neighbour , or on door - step .
F	now it is scheduled for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	the faulty items would be delivered around the 00th_feb , but get an e_- mail on the
M	looking at the website you would think it is a respectable company .
M	the web_site is easy to use , informative and a doggle to order equipment .
F	sent my phone on the 0th_june special delivery recieved by them on the 00th_june still no payment i called on friday 0th_july as i think i have given them more then enough time now to pay up , they told me the money would be in my account in the enxt 00hours .
M	the first part of my order arrived very promptly , despite the two bank_holidays .
M	on receipt i was not happy with it so returned it for full_refund at my own cost under dsr ( distance_selling_regulations ).
F	fast efficient service , easy to use website and good price too .
M	we still_await the guarantee certificate and fensa documents for our the installation completed in august .
M	when your prescription changes every two years , as mine does , it seems silly to pay hundreds of pounds for them each time .
M	i used to love dialtosave and made it my only option of purchase for international cards but now its been losing my customs due to technical_error which keeps on repeating all the time . as a busy man i found it a bit_annoying to contact customer service everytime .
F	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
F	this policy seems ok but i haven_'_t had cause to make a claim on it so it '_s hard to tell .
M	the process is easy to navigate , but , in the last few_years , fees have been added to the transaction cost , negating the advantage of a good exchange_rate for smaller transactions .
M	if i could zero_stars but as i cannot they get one just for answering the phone ( even then badly )
M	great service & price ; very convenient
F	it took longer to get to the resort than to get from liverpool to barcelona .
F	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working_properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
F	after sending e_mails to ceo and threatening them with legal_action and watchdog i finally got response .
M	to take a customers payment and then to take 00_hours to inform the customer and make the refund just adds insult to injury !
F	bought some of these for our office two years_ago , have moved_into a bigger space and needed more .
M	excellent service all_round
F	on box a note says please knock hard i did not select that and overall was very disappointed and won_'_t be using again
F	he said he made a phone_call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
M	i then tried shiply and another courier wholesaler .
F	somehow people seem to have lost interest on bidding and ebaying .
F	all services i place with interparcel are great , excellent customer service , and overall all third part companies are great .
M	it was easy to identify my phone using the drop down_menus .
M	would someone explain how you can get even £_00 . 00 back without spending £ 0000 '_s
M	i had the misfortune on an offer from photobox , spent 0 hours on web , trying to upload_photos for calender , speaking on chat numerous_times with tracie currie , poor customer service as saying will not upload_photos from google chromebook ? saying i need to try different computer . well surely i am not going to buy another computer when i have new chromebook and there systemscare not up to date , very unproffesional service , avoid at all costs .
M	room for improvement in your processing times .
M	picked car up 0 hour later - tyres_fitted and car washed ( nice_touch lads , thanks )
F	google searched this jacket and found it £_00 . 00 cheaper_than anyone_else what more
M	none of the flowers have been delivered up to yet so yeah getting really worried .
M	i don_'_t really have much more to add
M	i chose the cheaper delivery option but it came within 0 days by royal_mail .
F	how this is to be replaced or creditied .
F	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction_site so i assumed that they were reliable .
M	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an email that was replied to promptly .
F	i '_m just hoping i get my refund soon oh and by the way ordered the same sheds from someone_else on tuesday and they r coming tomorrow .
M	if they say hermes /_herpes we tell them they have lost a sale as a result and we shop somewhere_else .
M	finally got here after 0 - 0_weeks .
F	both materials were very see through and you could tell the quality was not good .
F	ignore their 000_% customer_satisfaction_guarantee .
F	good tasty products .
F	i have asked her to pass my complaints onto the regional manager who will address hopefully some of the issues i have had with xdp .
M	delivery was fast and private .
F	bought tuin grande gazebo , oringinally quoted £_000 fitting by the company which fitter increased to £_000 ( price confirmed in text ) when it was identified that the gazebo needed concreting into the ground .
M	the driver was very friendly but the car stank .
M	now they do not want to replace them .
F	costumes arrived within 00_hrs which was fantastic considering it was during the pre christmas_rush .
M	the website appeared to be a uk company and the price was good , so i ordered the camera .
M	nu_er_der så gået 00 dage uden jeg_har hørt noget som_helst fra debusy og_de tilbageholder stadig mine_penge :-(
M	excellent service - e_- mailed on day of order to confirm item had been dispatched that evening and it arrived without_any_issues the following_day .
M	provider seemed to be marginal compared to main hire_companies
M	i have to do all the work to try and make things_happen .
M	excellent range of products and quick service but could just do with larger_sizes ie true 0xl +
M	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
F	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
M	drive into a car_park got a ticket but was not sure if this was the correct
F	* argos p * ss poor delivery service update *
M	ordered a tokina lens and after_reading the review forums decided that they must be placing very large orders with their suppliers in order to get such discounts .
M	however no options for delivery for specific time ex .
M	thanks !
M	i ordered a product in a particular colour and size .
F	the annoying thing about jet0 , like all low_cost airlines , is that you have a cost for the flight that you '_ve worked out based on the best time to fly etc , then they add on baggage , a cost for checking in no matter what you choose , a sneaky way to get you to pay for choosing particular seats on the plane and for paying with credit_card .
M	the collection arrangements were conducted in a smooth , efficient and matter of fact way .
F	hoping it withstands the winds and that i have more success growing in the tunnel than i have previously outside !
F	cheap and nasty
M	then nothing .
M	i also needed to extend my booking due to a medical emergency , so i called the renter direct .
M	it then took over an_hour .
F	despite the fact that delivery address is an_independent , off - campus house with its own street address , at all times accessible and occupied , serenata decided to take the flowers to the postroom of the college ( not the address i gave them ) as a result they arrived on monday three_days after my daughter '_s birthday and were dried up .
M	they were responsive to all my emails
F	delivery was spot_on . all items were delivered next_day by_fedex and were tracked all the way .
F	after waiting over a week my lenses still hadn_'_t arrived i contacted lenstore and spoke to a very helpful lady_who advised she would resend my lenses by recorded mail .
F	think that they should do more earliey travel deals , with discouts , at good hotels .
F	do not use this website , they are a scam !
M	!
F	think the website and ordering are fine it '_s just the delivery service that isn_'_t good . very
F	pool and garden area lovely and very well_maintained .
F	friendly customer service but they screwed_up with the delivery and sent to the wrong_address .
F	my consignment_number is zwadjf000000 and the delivery guys name unless he have me false_information was david edward
M	easy to navigate website and fast and efficient service .
F	to tell you the truth , the whole_experience has stressed me out beyond imagination , they literally have reduced me to tears .
F	i would definitely use this company again .
F	i picked the goggles as they were a certain spec that i desired and the alternatives were none of these .
F	sofa arrived , and shortly_afterwards discovered a fault .
M	i recommend them highly .
F	contacted me promptly once bid accepted , quick scheduling of long_distance job , good communication re delivery .
F	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
M	i asked . " oh_yes , they ' re slightly out , we ' d recommend having them tracked ".
F	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
F	the man who fitted the tyres was very helpful and efficient .
M	if anyone is interested in joining me in contacting watchdog about this second - rate , shoddy outfit , please do so .
F	always a good price , excellent products and a very quick delivery service .
M	i have placed just one order - due to stock issues i '_m having to wait a few weeks - not too much of a problem in this particular instance - just slightly frustrating .
M	by the time we went past hamleys toy store , me and my friend got off the bus and never got back on !
F	delivery was wicket than i expected however i ordered a travel set and something had leaked in it ruining the lining of my new vanity case .
F	this is the first time i have used eflorist and will definitely be the last !
F	groupon won_'_t take any responsibility for not checking the availability for what they have advertised .
F	delivery time was also very good .
F	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer service lines .
M	excellent and professional attitude of staff when needed .
F	numerous_times my days out with my children has_been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
F	i found the website easy to navigate and found just the combination of options in a shower that i wanted and for a good price too .
M	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
M	on the car .
F	deeply annoying , especially when the item is for a gift for a child .
M	in fact , after i have finished my journey in a self - hired rental car , rentalcars . com have still not provided me with a voucher number , so i have to instruct my bank to reverse their charges as nbo service was provided .
M	now to put this into context , only one person can drive the car at a time and my wife driving is no more likely to have an accident than me so why were we charged a rate equivalent to 0 , 000_euros a year .
M	don_'_t try and leave any negative_feedback on p0g facebook or website as it is immediately deleted .
M	on top of that , i '_ve recently made a claim for an item sent with insurance that has_been damaged in transit .
F	the batteries don_'_t last that long and the flavours aren_'_t the best .
F	but we was lazy and caught the little train , that runs from old town to new town every twenty mins .
F	i bought some fig and some apple_trees .
F	the glass was clean so i know this wasnt the cause .
F	totally_disgusted and would strongly_recommend avoiding this company at all costs .
M	ii ' d give them a miss !
F	the prices are high as at all sources of american food in france , but that is to be expected .
F	i will use you again and recommend to my running mates too .
F	no one from customer_services informed me my order would be late - in the mean time the money has_been debited from my account .
M	was an initial communications problem with my order for flight_simulator software , however to their credit once the problem was realised they sorted without_delay in a most helpful , apologetic and courteous_manner .
M	not the car i booked but similar .
F	when i called back , the hotels had been sourced , as well as an excursion to alcatraz with open top bus travel included for the entire three_days duration of our stay in san_fran , all keeping under our budget and something that we wanted to do but i hadn_'_t thought to ask :)
F	definitely don_'_t forget to pay your bill on time or they will cut your service off for a full 00hrs after you '_ve paid it !
F	don_'_t understand_why itv_player can play useless adverts but not the program me i am trying to watch useless useless useless sort it out !!!
M	the execution of the booking system is excellent , but i '_m missing a few essential features , such as the ability to split journeys or choose longer stop - overs .
F	on one occasion i had cause to contact the company and received instant feedback from them - very impressive
M	arrived decently_packaged and ready for distribution to 00 gliding club_members
F	ordering online was easy and i was emailed all of the information that i needed , such as a reminder to unplug my old_appliance and clear a pathway to the kitchen .
F	hi , just to say your service was brilliant , sandals arrived next_day as promised , can '_t fault at all !
M	i replied to you the next_day with a pdf of my order confirmation and a week and a bit later my review is still not live and i have heard_nothing from you .
M	0 days before departure , i called as i had not received these , to be told they needed my passport number before allocating tickets .
M	i feel much_better buying from these_guys rather_than am * z * n too .
F	next_day delivery was great , no_problems , so easy .
M	00000000000
M	i won_'_t buy anything adidas again after this , they don_'_t seem to be_bothered about losing long_term loyal_customers !
F	what did impress me was the care taken to pack the order , every item was carefully hand wrapped and very fresh too .
F	started buying my environ and jane_iredale products from beauty time_therapies about 0_months_ago and am very happy with the service i receive .
M	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent
F	delivery is good , and as far i know from relatives , returns are straight_forward .
M	when we ordered our ladders online , there was no notice saying that they only had one set in stock .
M	a refreshing_change compared with some companies .

M	delivery has always been prompt and the goods of good quality at reasonable prices .
M	i don_'_t know about your car , but mine needs four tires to run , so i had no choice but to pay for it !
F	i usually order over the phone but this time went online .
M	not the cheapest on the market but you generally pay for what you get and i '_m pleased with the price / quality ratio of these .
M	not a very big and that was medium_size and the colours wasnt very bright :( not worth the money at all
F	really disappointing .
M	if you don_'_t believe me , just google them and read other horror_stories for yourself .
M	the flowers on your website looked luscious and full , the flowers received were crushed and about 0 " in diameter .
F	i got plenty of emails and texts_letting_me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up . getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
F	there were 0 more styles in this shop and they were all cheaper_than online = and i got to try on styles and several sizes in each ,
M	i ended_up getting the part from somewhere_else .
M	and yes - it '_s exactly as poor as before !

F	my boyfriend is a big_fan of the superset clothing range so as a gift i bought him a jumper on - line which he_loves !!
F	i was very happy with the prices of the a0 sleeves i was buying and next_day delivery was also a bonus .
F	also i agree with nicola that its amazing how many similar reviews are posted with 0_stars here on trustpilot just after a poor review .
F	was delighted how quick they arrived , i had only just ordered them !
F	perfect – no_reservations , i would recommend this company to anyone .
M	there is nothing not to like about them .
M	audiobahn are generally good , what is not disclosed is that audiobahn stopped producing these 0 - 0 years_ago , so do not expect any manufacturer support .
M	do not use this website .
F	the website for prestige looked very enticing , with the promise of international flowers being delivered and so i ordered with a date for delivery of the 0 / 0 / 00 , which i confirmed twice with them .
F	thank_you
F	after writing my review , infurn have contacted trustpilot claiming they can '_t verify the sale : they are now going after their customers !
M	that morning i phoned the 00000000000 and had to wait 00 minuets , i was told the delivery would be with me between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
M	quick and efficient delivery .
F	when he arrived he was really friendly and polite and carried the box into the front room for me .
M	no issues
M	having read previous_comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
F	needed a 00s costume for my son for a school dance routine .
F	we have been negotiating mazes , building walls and the whole family has_been taking part in the fabulous ' fits ' game .
F	staff always friendly and helpful with a second to none service .
F	on changeover at marble_arch , we got a guide who clearly did not want to be there , constantly told us that everything was closing for the day and gave no extra interesting information !
M	vi skal_bruge en faktura med pris_og antal på for at få pengene refunderet .
F	they were not able to phone my dad , even_though the number was given to them , so this caused more difficulties on the morning .
F	spoke with live_chat - promised christmas delivery didn_'_t need to pay extra .
M	it seams to be downloading the whole of the 0nd part before it will play it ?
F	that '_s why i only give them three stars .
M	they came back to me very quickly - the lens problem was solved ( they arrived with complimentary fingerprints on the lenses !)
F	i '_ve_used this company several_times and they have been brilliant .
M	good communications from dv000 , always keeping you advised of what is happening with your order .
F	the equipment supplied by villaplus - the table_tennis , pool_table were very good .
F	they didnt do and havent done .
M	the item didn_'_t arrive in the specified time and also some excuse about their couriers however what is misleading is that they don_'_t have it in stock in their warehouse , the times are at the manufactures . a slight misdescription .
F	my order hadn_'_t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
M	this product is great . had massive problems with my arm - couldn_'_t even hold a cup of tea without pain . recieved the strap within a couple of days . used it straight_away and pain eased . 0 days_later played in a golf comp again kept the strap on and it worked a treat . would def reccomend
F	the lenstore website was so easy to use and i was pleasantly_surprised by the cheap prices of my contact_lenses .
F	thank_you .
F	!.
F	they are great value for money too !
F	item was processed quickly from payment stage .
M	the drivers for this company don_'_t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
F	product dispacted from gibraltar and not mainland_uk .
F	turned_up really quickly
F	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole_experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
F	booked this parking online it was cheap . not far away from the airport . secure parking with speedy pickup service and helpful and cheerful drivers would use it again .
M	quality goods and quality service .
M	the prices can '_t be beat and i love the free mixers that come with your order .
M	great selection and very competitively_priced but the delivery service left something to be desired .
F	the tv in one of the bedrooms wasn_'_t working nor could we get the cd_player to play a cd .
M	they included poor quality workmanship , bad service , poor products , zero communication .
F	so wont use again thank tou
F	this website is great , you can see all the takeaway restaurants in your area and order online by viewing the menus and it '_s quick and easy to use .
M	i will look_elsewhere in the future .
F	not had time to use the magnets for my project yet but i '_m_sure they '_ll do the job .
M	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn_'_t bother to give customers their phone number .
M	i returned your printer because it isn_'_t producing the acceptable print quality , and asked for a full_refund .
F	feeling cheated .
F	although the acknowledgement said it was out of stock ( no mention of this on the website or i would have ordered elsewhere ).
F	instead of enduring the call queue again , i emailed .
F	no delivery received .
F	over a month later i have no refund !
F	i notice the website for this company is ' under maintenance '.
M	the reply was “ i can talk over you and customer is not always right ”!
F	i will definitely use you again
M	i have cheaper watches costing far less that keep better time
F	the speed and courtesy shown at shoetique is second to none and it is tremendous in this day and age to obtain personal treatment .
F	but there was a bit too much " filler " as_opposed to flowers .
F	i decided to have a live_chat with a representative with regards to booking an_appointment to visit their showroom in hatton_garden and managed to book an_appointment for later that day !
F	however i got home to find that the box it came in was left_outside my house , where anyone who passed could have taken it . i find this unacceptable and has made me doubt whether i will purchase from them again , which is a shame considering that the rest of my experience was good .
F	easy to find the batteries for even my watch , i just typed it in the search button .
F	we would order from you again .
M	got upset when i refused to sign that the car was left undamaged .
M	my ' gripe ' is that when we started the booking , the ' fee ' was £_00 approximately . partway through the booking , the fee escalated , with no
M	it all started so well !
F	i had an excelent servcie when teplephoned but no - one replied to my original email 00 days earlier
F	it got to 00 : 00 and the items had still not been delivered i then rang up customer_services again were i was informed that the delivery would not be arriving that day as fedex had an issue with staff driving over their legal hours , having a next_day delivery would have been out of the question as i needed the items for wednesday .
M	on the day of delivery , when what you purchased and paid for and it does not happen - driver had no paperwork for delivery and install but that was paid for !
M	still_waiting .
F	super co to deal with . order arrives quickly and website is easy to use .
F	asda house ,
F	deliver the bed on 00 jan_0000 . up till now the bed has not been delivered .
M	this suppler provides a fast and ost effecitive serives .
M	i look to the likes of chemist_direct to stock the products that high_street chemists no_longer stock - so it '_s a pity that chemist_direct can '_t seem to get hold of proper selsun shampoo .
F	so a tainted first experience .
F	but your delivery service worked a brilliant way .
F	amazing service , and quick delivery .
F	can '_t ask for more that that .
M	it was the best experience i have ever had and fastest in hiring and collecting and returning a hire vehicle , i cannot_praise allamo enough , the receptionist on arrival was outstanding , quick and efficient , and on returning the young_man was the same .
M	i would thoroughly_recommend them .
M	clean .
F	these are steam gift codes for my two sons , as it '_s easter_holidays here .
F	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
M	no issues .
M	i was very please with he products an he service , will recommend .
F	the problems could only be partially resolved as the villa_itself was in need of attention - poor insulation , leaky windows , cockroach repellent in every cupboard - all of which we were told were acceptable to villa_plus staff and was what we could expect in a majorcan home .
M	i have since recommended affordable_supplements to 0 of my friends and will_continue to use the website .
F	i recently_purchased the superdry cagoule in large and it came up too small and am a size 00 top .
F	on my return i have tried to contact the company to get our fee back ; as yet , the phone remains unanswered !
M	however , though the fare was reduced by 00_% there were no extras .
F	i wouldn_'_t use this firm again because of the substitutions .
F	that is rare today .
F	wouldnt give any stars but i have had to unfortunately
F	richmond thick sausages they sent richmond ’_s skinless thin .
F	an_email was sent straight_away confirming details and expected delivery day / time .
M	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
M	no apology was offered with the agent basically saying it wasn_'_t your fault as it was coming from a different warehouse ?
F	the following_day got an_email from marc saying one of the rugs was no_longer available as it was sold out and did i still want the rest of the order and a refund and could i please let them know my decision .
F	there was no need to do this as the house nextdoor where delivery was being made had a empty driveway and plenty of space .
F	fast delivery , genuine products at great prices - one very happy customer :)
F	i have had 0 deliveries in less_than one month and both were delivered to the wrong_address .
M	the product ordered is okay i guess for £_000 .
M	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
F	within a few_days i had my dream car it was so easy !
F	when the shoes arrived , one pair looked worn with the elastic side strap already lose and stretched and the boots were designed so badly the angle at the ankle made it impossible to fit the foot into the boot .
F	our ferry journey from ijmuiden to north_shields was delayed by 0 hours due to an electrical fault , so we left at 00pm and arrived at 0pm the next_day rather_than the expected 0am .
F	i decided to call the team .
F	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
M	also i was told that i would be given a 0 hour_window , again i was not .
M	stating lack of proof of purchase .
M	to their credit , however , there is absolutely no_quibble when you contact them about the error / s , and if these gliches can be ironed_out i would definetly buy from them again .
M	i sent an email and was given a response , they took the extra i had to pay but i '_ve still not received my updated travel_insurance documents !!
F	only 0 arrived .
F	i have had issues with ear phones fitting properly but after the information received i think i have purchased the right pair .
F	i cannot recommend you to anyone for such lousy service .
M	when i unfortunately had to make a claim it couldn_'_t have been easier .
F	they demanded photographs and could not have been more unhelpful on the phone - even shouting at me to listen .
F	i '_ve_used hotel_direct at_least twice .
M	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
F	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
F	perfect !
F	great service they were out of stock of the colour i wanted emailed immediately to see if wanted to change the colour or wait for them to come in .
M	i clicked to buy and at the checkout applied the discount_code from the voucher they sent me and progressed sale in the normal way .
M	i then ordered ultra_thin premium lenses against my second choice of now full frame glasses .
F	thank_you very much
F	no_hesitation to recommend printerland to anyone .
F	i would recommend their products , i wouldn_'_t recommend their online store !
F	cannot recommend highly_enough .
F	i have used this company several_times and would highly_recommend for ordering flowers online
M	rude , abrupt customer service when i have spoke to them on the phone , treat you like an_idiot , talk over you and play dumb .
M	great produce , at a great price !
F	no_complaints .
F	i bought them and am certainly not disappointed .
F	a lot of the cds i sent were brand_new but ziffit said they failed a qc check , were ' refurbished ' then passed , there was never anything wrong with any of the cds .
F	you should just be honest and keep the prices fixed .
F	this has left me with no choice but to conclude that the manchester bead_shop does not value their customers or want to keep them .
M	when i arrived home i checked the internet still after a macbook and found the price of the same laptop in the same store had been lowered 0 hours after my visit by £_000 !
M	i have had 0 or 0 different items and they are all up to expectation .
M	there was also a ' choose free_gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it '_s just a pay monthly item .
F	transport to and from airport was fine .
M	excellent customer service will use again and recommend to anyone .
M	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
M	ebay takes such a huge cut , it '_s almost not worth selling on it .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending reidy_'_s if you want to buy musical_instruments and accessories .
M	everything was easy & very straightforward , but the payment system needs serious improvements .
M	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
M	dear_sirs ,
M	the driver asked me how long i was going to take to get home and said 00mins .
M	plan on babying the entire ordering_process all the way up until it ships .
M	they are reliable and have a cracking range of rum ( among other things , but it is always rum i buy ).
F	no returns information is available on the invoice , and their website looks like they are an it company ??
M	appointments easy to make .
F	very easy booking process
M	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
M	it has ruined the present for my mums_birthday .
F	i will not be using them ever again .
F	polite letter to explain the reason for my refund
M	must be a catch - money back for nothing - even if the items bought were in a sale and had a discount_code .
F	i paid £ 0 . 00 for express delivery ( clue is in the title ) rather_than go with free standard delivery .
F	getting independent advice as i am sure they are in breach of the sale of goods_act .
F	trying to complain to this lot is almost_impossible .
F	i will now tell them before they order to read the small_print .
M	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
F	i checked on the website via live_chat that they would be able to still do next_day delivery in time for an office bbq for 000 people , they said yes .
M	no contact phone number on webisite .
F	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn_'_t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
F	we decided to hand out purple glow_sticks at our candle of hope cermony that is all about remember those that have been taken from us through cancer and also to celebrate those that have survived .
M	only_slight_downside is that the bowl bought to hold the flowers was not robust enough .
M	i recently tried to use a promo_code that was emailed to me and it didn_'_t work on the website .
M	order was done in just a few_clicks .
M	always receive delivery in excellent time without_any_problems or issues .
M	completely_unacceptable in my opinion .
M	so will make do for now and when money permits will buy a variable speed one .
M	for the first order , the poles had been despatched but the website tracking page had not been updated .
F	the boots are fabulous .
M	by taking this step i have ended_up with a cv which i am confident in the knowledge that it is first_class .
M	what a difference_between the pictures on the website and the packet !
F	i shall not weigh myself until after week 0 , but i think i am slowly melting away .
M	they were a present for my girlfriend who was turning 00 yesterday .
M	delivery excellent .
F	no_doubt it will be another 0_weeks to get the right ones and i will have to take a half day off work to be in for pick_up and another half day for delivery , and beyond pathetic apologies there will be no recompense .
M	!
M	moreover their on screen form is a real_pain in the **** insisting that you chose from alternatives in a drop down list that offers no alternatives .- seriously unfriendly .
F	very good quality and superb price plus quick delivery .
F	first phone_call wasn_'_t very helpful .
F	will re review when whole order arrives .
M	and i have requested a full_refund , i will get my work trousers from krowmark embroidery .
F	when i was sent cewe book to review i could not edit it in any way i then just went a head and ordered it not being entirely_satisfied .
M	if you need an mot you cant do better_than to use autotyres .
F	mon : pretty disapointed that the flowers i ordered were not delivered ?
M	it also got caught as spam because of this , and i only just noticed it !
F	well , yeah , that '_s because i only really shop online for birthday and xmas_pressies and they all fall around the same time of year so it will be in - active until then !
M	good very good
M	even_though they have been added to my account .
F	after ordering , i received the above - mentioned email immediately , confirming my order with handy_tips , as well as a confirmation text .
M	there was a very big selection for me to chose from and the site made it easy to view the different_styles and colours .
M	did they forgot my order ?
M	so i spoke to the lady below , who said she would ' investigate ' it , then just got an email_saying they have refunded the charges for the services they didn_'_t provide .
M	would highly_recommend offtek .
M	they came quicker_than i expected so it was a nice_surprise .
M	friday of last_week he pulled up , rummaged around in the back of his_van for a while , moved a few parcels around before getting back in and driving off , making no attempt to make a delivery but no doubt the online tracking would say different .
M	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
M	i had an abrupt conversation with someone at ballicom hq who fobbed me off to the factory .
M	the sketch i had sent them was pretty clear ( i ' d spent a couple of hours drawing it to scale on graph paper ).
M	make of that what you will ; but what really_annoys_me is the customer serive team fob me off with a " thank_you for your email , your feedback is important to us " response , with no substance .
F	( almost 0_months ) i '_m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
F	i would use company again was very good value for money really helpful when i phoned to place order as the site was playing up
F	bigdug was recommended by a friend for shelving in a new garage and a workshop .
F	bagsdirect delivered promptly .
F	would buy again
M	( did that mean the scooter we had returned was not even the dirty , damaged one they had previously referred to ?!)
F	it was really easy and quick to search and find my phone and it was clear on the price and details .
M	this was roughly three_times the cost of the shared shuttle on the basis that we would be dropped_off quicker after what was a long day with a 00 year_old child in tow .
F	it doesn_'_t take at_least 0 hours to get it to the next city over
F	i emailed straight back but received no reply .
F	viagogo refs :( ref_:_00000000 ); ( ref_:_00000000 )
M	i was also told that bookings can take up to 00_hours to come up on the manage my bookings bit .
F	there is no point even looking elsewhere !
F	would definately recommend this company to others for excellent customer service - a rare_thing these days !
M	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
F	brilliant service with bagdirect . com . will_defo be shopping with them again . well chuffed !!
F	i made a purchase and in less_than few hours got an_email_saying that this item is not available .
F	little_concerned i couldn_'_t get a sample made up but liked the functionality of the website and the ability to adjust change most things on the card .
M	0x dunlop_sport maxx rt 000 / 00zr00
F	i then got a further call 0 hours_later asking if l had chosen an_alternative and explained further l want a refund now l am waiting on my refund so this should be fun not !!!!
M	!
M	if you buy from this company - i prey they have the goods in stock for you , cause if they dont - your in for a very , very long wait and do not expect a refund from simpy .
F	so its back to the drawing_board for me as i need the costume for friday !
M	i needn_'_t have been concerned .
F	it is now thursday and flowers have not been delivered .
M	initial review see below
F	!
F	i am happy with the machine and the communication for the delivery ( eventually ) and it arrived within the time_scale once the date was set .
M	happy to recommend .
F	highly_recommended !
F	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
F	it seemed to take quite a while for my item to arrive so i went to my email to track the package but this link didn_'_t work the several_times i tried .
F	why didn_'_t it say that to start with ?
F	i love just eat but will choose a different take away outlet next time .
M	i rang him back after an_hour to report that nothing had arrived .
M	regards steven h .
F	i can '_t_believe these people , i ordered two game codes that stated available . at 0 am friday it '_s now 0 pm and they still_haven_'_t arrived despite_being told 0 - 0 hours .
M	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
M	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
F	have been ordering in store from a big supermarket chain but now i '_ll be using this service all the time .
F	it is just an extra way of making money .
F	however it did the job of showing we were thinking of her .
F	i ordered some plastic_boxes with removeable organisation drawers online at lunchtime one day and received this order before_midday the next_day . a great service
F	these cartridges are not recognised by the printer and it won_'_t work .
F	from watching the videos on line to reading the reviews , i found this service very good .
F	iflorist i would have a word with the people you use as apart_from that my experience was great .
F	i now have an item i don_'_t want and have to go through returns procedures and pay postage .
F	we were able to buy exactly the number of pills we needed .
F	please bring back the telephone_operators as just sometimes a human is required to assist with technical problems .
F	i '_ve_used clare_florist twice for birthday_presents and both bouquets were beautiful .
F	my picture arrived promptly and perfectly .
M	i then got a call to say the guitar could be there by the beginning of august .
F	i looked at all the recycling_companies online orange offered the most flashback so i went with it .
M	easy to pay and i got my e ticket straight_away .
M	the competitors did not respond to my complaints via_email !
M	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
F	items delivered within time specified and and packaged extremely well - informed by email about each_stage of the process .
F	!
M	professional yet friendly service delivered at a value - for - money price
F	brilliant result , i would have been happy with delivery the following working day .
F	we were delighted with the medals we ordered for a netball tournament .
F	i was told it must be my fault and she constantly interrupted me .
M	andy hughes
M	he kept telling_me that i had made my mind up any way and what was the point of talking to any body else .
M	i also tried to contact them via telephone but could not get through .
M	great service and equally good products .
M	by now we were keen to get going and were not going to argue about that .
F	cost me over_£ 0 to return them so not a happy_bunny .
M	i upgraded to the " deluxe " version and also added a " romantic cake ".
F	the ' shop ' that delivered the flowers ' scentiments of wibsey ' were not available to take a phone_call .
F	we caught an earlier flight back by some 0 hours and again we were met within a few_minutes of our call .
M	i have tried to call them , but the customer service is shut ( perhaps due to the time difference_between uk and spain , although it is a uk support number ).
M	both arrived exactly on time .
F	we bought a washing_machine from this company after_reading the product description and believing it would fit into our new_kitchen .
F	!
M	not knowing the company you are always a bit_suspicious if you order your tickets and hotel you could not end up with what you expected .
F	wrong . it took over 00_mins and then we had to ask the staff to hurry as my husband was heading to a meeting in the city .
F	to an extent it is true , you can sell some items for free , but others to get any real exposure you need to upgrade to some of their paid enhanced listings .
F	i really had no need to worry , regular_emails and texts updated me with the progress of the order and delivery .
M	excellent prices but had issues with original order not being available even_though i specifically_asked .
M	i went to a nut and bolt manufacturer as well as a plumb centre and they advised that the fitting from the body of the tap and the connecting nut was not a recognised plumbing fitting and advised that he got a lot of ' mugs ' like me that had bought cheap from the internet .
M	when i complained i was offered a replacement straight_away and received it 0 days_later - we '_ll see how this one goes .
F	the price was perfect too as we didn_'_t want the project to cost a huge_amount .
F	we were greeted_by a bus load of unhappy passengers who had also been waiting an_hour to be picked_up .
F	however , no email and i eventually emailed them to ask if there was a problem .
F	i wasn_'_t pleased with the way the surgeon spoke to me when he was trying to get the plastic mould in place to hold my eye still - this part really hurt .
F	sent items 00st_september and received cheque 00th_october .
M	easy and simple to navigate through the web_site and easy to purchase with a speedy delivery , would definitely recommend
F	there are so many great things on their site that i will be a regular_shopper and if i am ever looking for things to buy for my daughter this is now the 0st place i look .
F	overall i was dissapointed and wouldn_'_t use them again
M	i can '_t ' praise them enough . many_thanks
F	looked around for a reasonably_priced oven , this site had a wide_choice st the best prices and were able to deliver quickly .
M	!
M	i signed_up to save some money on car insurance renewal .
M	this caused me some difficulties .
M	please also be advised that i am the last point of contact and i am unable to offer compensation .
M	i ordered on line on a monday had a telephone_call on tuesday to inform_me that one item was not in stock but would be in on thursday .
F	so i wrote to phansord @ thompson - morgan . com managing_director , mr paul hansord direct email
M	product was exactly as_described and was at a fantastic price .
M	you don_'_t get big_bucks for most items but for guaranteed cash for unwanted stuff i wouldn_'_t expect to .
M	i thought we would give it a go .
F	the first delivery guy so in a rush , literally drew the items by the door , as a results some items where broken .
M	of sending phones off .
F	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre . we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
M	i thought sites like this were for people with near perfect eyesight !
F	making the problem more unbearable was the very unhelpful response from the technical_support crew .
F	extremely disappointed with the service and will never be shopping online with menkind again .
M	if go_electrical are serious about improving the shopping_experience for their customers ( as they say they are ) they could do the following :
M	offtek always has the memory products i required at an excellent price .
F	to ring the iflorist people
F	my cousin was delighted with the flower_arrangement as he had a large number of guests staying at christmas and every time he looked at the arrangement , he remembered me so i will definitely use you again .
M	in the sale they were £_000 each .
M	asked_him if he could contact their distribution warehouse to confirm delivery but said they were a different company and he could only check on the computer .
M	after 0_weeks , suddenly they were found !
M	same happens again .
M	il be back . used you for a few_years_now .
F	really great choice of products .
M	not very pleased about that !
F	the first time i traded with zapper they picked_up the parcels from my home so i had thought it would be the same .
M	customer_services were apologetic and have asked me to send a photo of the bunch that arrived which i have done , at the same time requesting a full_refund . we will see !
M	the name chosen had a conflict with a similar name already registered but that wasn_'_t evident until i sent an email enquiring why registration was taking so long .
M	excellent shopping_experience
M	they gave the best rate of all the companies i checked and delivered on time
M	great quick service .
M	0 .

M	simon came straight back to say they had and also how many as well .
F	0_days_later my friend told me that the flowers had been delivered - no message of apology , explanation or acknowledgement that the surprise had been spoilt and missed the birthday by 0_days .

M	unfortunately , they have had to lose 0 marks .
M	!
M	definately_use again , reliable , competively price & honest .
M	!
F	really really bad , i have dealt_with 0 people so far ( in last 0_days ) and no solution so far , only promises that all will work out for me .

M	fyi - i '_ve checked my " junk " incase the email answered got automatically moved ,
F	you have to call an 0000 number which costs you more money on top of what you are going to borrow , not very good .

F	update_: phoned wed 0 may to chase .

M	on 00 / 0 / 00 , i got another email , this time saying it would now be delivered to their warehouse on 00 / 0 / 00 , again with no information about when i would receive it .
M	oh i did get my first and only apology , but only after i pointed_out that no - one had the common decency to apologise for this joke of a situation .
F	customer_services were very helpful and excellent delivery .
M	background :
F	i would have expected a screw in type of plug that was tricky
M	i found that the service was slow , after_posting my phone on a friday i had to call to confirm that you had received my phone .

M	so if they try this on you , be sure to phone them up .

M	daughter delighted with present .
F	even more annoyed as these are rant to be for my dad '_s birthday and one of the items still_hasn_'_t arrived .
F	simple and quick to use and come in a nice envelope that will be easy to find !
M	despite spending £_000 + and getting ' free ' delivery i '_m not prepared to accept
M	tyre - shopper were the cheapest and i especially_liked the simplicity of the website - no_hidden extra '_s etc .
M	use them at your own_risk .
F	i order from here but often find i am waiting for items and not notified if they are out of stock , you only find out later after items that are in stock are delivered .
F	super_fast reliable service
M	i have been using the whisky_exchange for a few_years to send bottles to various customers , however , the web_site is cumbersome when trying to do this .
F	i hope service remains at this level
F	i have placed my order and got the delivery the next_day !
M	excellent !
M	quality of product now is rather poor .
M	ordered a new bog seat from trading_depot after mine developed a crack .
M	i called them up after 0 days and was told i would be called back later .
F	was a little disappointed with the service , i bought a phil and ted vibe and wanted some help but unfortunately no one could answer any_questions and didn_'_t have a clue re the product .
M	i would definitely recommend buying from cyberpower .
M	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn_'_t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
M	if so , please get more staff , or if staff need training then please book that in , and have a workable stock_availability system that is accurate , and a system by which each order is dealt_with promptly / accordingly - no matter what !!!
F	she eventually found this out after repeated e_mails to the company for this information and several standard replies which clearly indicates that her e_mails were not even read properly .
M	still no response .
M	surely as a bundle offer it should all come together .
M	items always arrive in good order , well packages and in double quick time .
M	the rugs are well illustrated on the website and are just as good if not better when laid on the floor .
F	as my daughters_birthday has passed and i have sent a bank_transfer so she can get her own i no_longer require your services .

M	on wednesday_morning at 0000 i received an email_saying my order wouldnt reach me on time , with no explanation as to why .
M	please_note that they seem to be a subsidiary of cricket direct in st_albans , which has very similar reviews to mine .
M	" mais vale cair em graça do que ser engraçado "
F	i will certainly consider_using this company again .
M	very good service .
M	this is a great site and easy to use but the amount of time from purchasing goods to receiving the cash_back into your account is much too slow to be of any real value .
F	i ordered the flowers to be sent to my son & his partner in celebration of the birth of my first_grandchild , i ordered them friday_lunchtime and asked for them to be delivered saturday_morning as they had not come home from the hospital .
M	took_ages for delivery to arrive and the product was not much good
M	so , for those reasons - which is either a lack of attention to detail or an intention to mislead - leads me to think that it would be quite dangerous to put my faith in their products when - as an athlete - you need to be sure exactly_what you are ingesting .
F	could be worth_paying with another website with acceptable delivery times .
F	i just want my phones back repaired or not .
M	to install new machine £_00 . 00
F	luckily after unpacking the furniture , nothing was broken .
M	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .

M	i complained and was given the usual , they will do it next line .
M	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
F	delivery instructions : - do not leave outside of property . i have never given this instruction - had i known - instruction would have been do not leave at no 00 !
F	that is it
F	i got a thermostat shower and solid panels they arrived in time all there and in one piece too exactly as was discribed too would shop again
M	the print was not the cheapest on the market but as with most things in life , you get what you pay for .
F	the quality of the costume was very good and comfortable , although one minor annoyance was the size of the white fur cape - on the picture it looks like it falls slightly_lower down on the decolletage than it seems to in real_life , but this is only a small issue .
M	good service online and over the telephone .
M	since then they have ceased communicating with me , they simply do not respond to anything , presumably to push me past the 00 month_warranty_period ?
M	it looks_like this is not the priority of dfds , but trying to squeeze more money out of the passenger pockets in terms of coffee , gambling , or shopping areas .
F	the goods i purchased are exactly as_described , good quality at the right price .
F	here are but 0 of those incidents that have happened in the past 00_hours :
F	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
F	would use again .
M	i needed to upgrade a server & was looking for additional_ram , found mr_memory , had a query_regarding the total capacity for my server , e_- mailed customer service , had a response within an_hour , rang though & ordered from zoe at 00am friday goods arrived 0am on saturday !!
M	it was easy to complete with clear_instructions .
M	on one occasion i tore my trousers climbing over the gate at 0am – what else can i do ?
F	today ( 0th_march ) i received a response and the offer to reduce my payments as they hadn_'_t raised a bill since september .
F	from choosing washing_machine to prompt delivery and installation cannot be_faulted .
M	they looked ok when they arrived , except most flowers were closed & 0 days_later they still closed and dead .
M	white bed came packaged in red plastic , which stained the bed .
F	the product was unpacked for a quick check on contents but during assembly & attachment of the metal base , we later found that one of the 0 washers required was missing from the sealed package ( needed to find a substitute )
F	i was disappointed with the whole_experience but was resolved in the end .
M	well , he is wrong , i have switched to simply_supplements and if the quality was poor it would reflect in my symptoms .
M	took insurance for hire car excess , saved huge_amount of money and the process was as easy as it can get - nice one .
M	was told that was not possible , and they would only send the correct ones if they receive the wrong ones , asked what would happen if they did not arrive in time , i was told i could buy replacements locally to me !!!!
F	i bought these casual shoes to wear on shore excursions while on holiday on a cruise_ship .
F	slate_tiles were rather tatty and scratched etc .
F	i '_ve had four sets of curtains made now over the last couple of months and they have all been finished to the highest_standard and i am extremely happy with them all
M	none of the lines answer and all go to a dead tone .
M	have ordered a couple of items on this site .
M	speedy response .
F	when i initially placed the order online i was given dates when deliveries would be in my area .
M	i ordered it on thursday and it came on friday .
M	they never came back and let_me know at all !
M	i found this a little strange as there is no access to the back of the house from outside .
F	i received an e_- mail back telling_me that i couldn_'_t cancel the order but that i could return it as soon as it arrived and that it would take 0_weeks for the money to go back into my account .
M	laptopsdirect . co . uk then informed me that there was a payment problem and that i had to contact their team .
F	almost every other shopping site in the uk offers free delivery , regardless of where in the uk you live .
M	can '_t be_faulted
M	amazon have obviously refunded my payment .
F	items still hadn_'_t arrived in over a week so had to chase_up , they hadn_'_t been sent but the query was dealt_with promptly and items sent out same day , although i had to go to the vets and buy expensive wormers due to the non - arrival .
M	will go_elsewhere next time .
M	best online service ever , i '_ve never known a company so efficient .
F	in fact the small packet of pills that i order comes in a box three_times larger which seems to justify the postal_costs ; and then it won_'_t go through the letterbox , causing inconvenience .
M	message in window saying where to leave if i was out was not followed .
M	price and future discounts , i can '_t fault them .
F	in their favour , the name labels are clearer and easier to read than others i have bought .
M	this company provided the absolute worst customer experience which i have seen .
M	very pleased with the speed of delivery but disappointed that the delivery driver just left the heavy box in the porch for my wife to lift inside .
M	ordering records easy , a few_clicks and your order is at home .
M	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
F	tried to cancel greeting_card the day after l put my order in , but was not allowed .
F	superb customer service and i would have no_hesitation in using this company again .
F	would be nice to know what the problem is and when it will be sorted .
F	would be better if could tell you am or pm as hours were between 0 - 0 . 00 and they arrived at 0 . 00pm so spend the whole day waiting for it to be collected .
M	the reduced isle is great bargain find on a friday_night .
F	what kind of excuse is that ?
F	that said , i would probably use them again as the service was excellent & there was loads to chose from , i was probably expecting too much !
M	delivery was so quick i '_m_sure it was delivered before i finished ordering it .
F	was a bit disappointed to place my order on the friday and have to wait for the delivery until monday .
M	they are a little more_expensive than my usual suppliers , but it '_s not the price that puts me off .
M	the velcro fastener causes tearing problem when trying to fill bag with sacs .
F	but having said all that the three funeral arrangements were stunning and we were very pleased so if you can do it for them i am sure you can do a good job every time
F	we had high_hopes for the service from internet_gardener and have unfortunately been let_down on this occasion .
F	when ordering the flowers i was asked if there were delivery stipulations .
M	i therefore ordered it by phone from a third firm , mojo spares ltd , who did everything it said on the tin .
F	he has not treated me fairly or honestly .
M	ok hotel , but breakfast cost left out with no obvious means of including it .
M	mattress seems ok so_far .
M	the tyres were delivered a day late causing a great deal of frustration .
M	no saving over local_dealer and you don_'_t have to wait for the delivery .
F	the ordering process was brilliant and chosing when i wanted them fitted was i thought great .
F	the price of the glasses was also excellent .
F	delivery was on time and garden_furniture was great .
F	really efficient and a competitive price .
F	well , overall cosmetic reasons , this would be a good option .
F	after ordering our new kub madera cot_bed we were disappointed to discover 0 faulty parts ( manufacturing errors ).
M	superb service ,
M	next time i am not even gonna shop around for flowers just come straight to this website as couldn_'_t have been improved .
M	a good website and the prices are right .
F	with a kit it is usual to get at_least some directions .
M	easy to find way round website .
F	i was surprised , therefore , to receive an_email from scottish_power telling_me i owe almost £_000 from my december bill , which i paid on the date of receipt .
M	purchased on line without hassle , subsequent telephone_call from aol to confirm delivery details .
M	good and easy search_engine , good prices and quick turn_round of order .
F	loads of outfits to choose from .
F	cost_effective and yummy , the hampers are well received !
M	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
M	their cowardly attitude means there is only one recourse . to tell the sellers who use hermes /_herpes that they will lose sales unless they can offer delivery using a professional courier , anyone other than hermes /_herpes !
M	and it will always be the main website i use for all my supplement purchasing .
F	i still buy from inkstation as the prices are so good but a bit dissapointed that now i have to wait 0 to 0_weeks for delivery .
M	on returning to the avis office , we found it had opened and so were able to complete the paperwork quickly .
F	i chose a picture and text for the ' cover '
M	quick delivery .
F	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven_'_t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
M	these bags are great fun for lounging around the garden .
F	their communication is first_rate and delivery is very quick .
F	first one in november , when the delivery was changed on a few occasions then when delivery went to end of jan , i had no choice but to cancel the order - after all was meant for a xmas_present !.
M	it was so easy to arrange my tickets for rod_stewart .
F	the website was very clear and easy to use , with good information on all products .
M	no delivery so we asked for a refund .
M	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn_'_t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
F	the item arrived very quickly after i ordered it and was exactly as i ordered .
F	i took a screen grab as proof and emailed customer_services .
M	all in , a thoroughly decent bunch of people to deal with .
F	i checked back on the website to see if they made any mention of illustations being inaccurate but could find none and also found that the description of the item had been changed to read tape and cord . i have now returned the lead which cost me £ 0 . 00 with nothing to show for it .
F	the deals are good but once you have purchased them they often end very shortly_after purchase .
M	after starting reviewing then on the t ' interent and was not good .
M	will_definitely re - order .
M	very impressed that they can get a courier that texts you with time it '_ll be delivered and a pretty small window so you don_'_t have to wait in .
F	we badly needed it at the time so we couldn_'_t send it back .
M	a cautionary tale :
M	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
F	i will instead take my custom elsewhere and am very dissatisfied with the service .
F	they got all this badly trained youngsters to cook pizza . wel sometimes you better of not to eat that !
M	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
M	simple process with a good website to guide you through and very quick to pay .
M	that is service .
F	such a waste of time !
F	i added names to appear on card but they did not appear on card .
F	excuse me ???
M	a plastic membrane !
F	website is easy to use , however i feel the delivery was expensive and the parcel took a while to be delivered .
M	they are quick and easy to contact , more than happy to help with problems and they deliver extremely fast too .
F	i had hoped my experience may have been a one off with the original driver but unfortunately this was not to be the case .
M	tiles are a different shade altogether from the catalogue , so much so that my wife is considering having me tiling the 0 m0 again .
F	complete incompetent staff from the call_centre to the engineers , they have no clue what they are doing and pass the buck on to their customers !!!
F	thank_you for a fun three hours .
F	but they were dispatched at 0 . 00 am and didn_'_t get to the destination until just before 0 so tje recipient didn_'_t get them on the day intended
M	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
M	all in all a mixed experience .
M	they answered my call once ( after 0_weeks ) and promised delivery within the next 0 days , i am still_waiting on 0th_september .
F	it '_s great !
M	i thought my tank was empty when in fact the sighting tube and fuel line were blocked , ordered a tank full but obviously when the delivery happened only half a tank could be delivered .
F	called them up with my prescription and hey_presto all sorted .
F	i ordered at lunchtime so really feel this was wrong , they did however offer me to cancel my order and get a full_refund , which i did not do as i needed the bits i ordered .
M	the system was down so the order could not be taken .
F	the perfume is great .
F	no problem with the product s ordered just what i wanted great on price , saying that the delivery time for a bread_bin and three cannister s took four_weeks if the products was not in stock when the order was placed this should have been made aware of .
M	if you get it , fine .
M	pro : value for money , delivery tracking_system .
M	i cancelled the order but was still charged .
F	the best price around and free_postage was the ultimate reason for ordering from pet_supermarket , hopefully nothing will go_wrong the next time .
M	nada es seguro por internet .
M	called better_bathrooms to arrange replacement and this is where the customer service is nothing more than average .
F	i emailed regarding my experience and still have no reply .
F	so come 00th when my delivery hasn_'_t been i called the customer service .
M	this as you can_imagine put a dampener on the evening .
M	first_class product and certainly value for money .
M	should have returned it . but was on holiday and too_busy
M	", yet another assumption that is incorrect , i run a very successful company thats built up a reputation based on 000_% customer_satisfaction , not that its any of your business or that you would know anything about that .
F	as the two orders were for presents this was even more dissapointing . im aware the postal servicw may take some responsibility but the inside packaging was poor aswell .
M	you can understand how a supermarket will suddenly go out of stock on some items but sometimes the substitutions are a little_confusing eg ; a tin of cat_food instead of 0 tins of dog_food !
F	!
M	top work .
M	?, the code relates to private houses !
M	first time i have used serenata_flowers , had problems with the website from the start when trying to select the delivery address , interflora much_easier .
F	the specification for my machine was quite high for running xphe , but the performance is very poor .
F	was told my outfit had been delivered but as i wasn_'_t in it went to the royal_mail sorting_office .
M	am still_waiting because i want this item but am close to saying enough is enough , which is a shame as i need 0 other frames before_xmas which wont be bought from here , i would rather pay more and get the item .
F	the customer ' service ' is appalling .
F	they are taking £_000 cancelation fee for the three nights he didn_'_t stop in a hotel that wasn_'_t booked in the first place .
F	they where nothing like the picture on the website .
F	i knew it would be delivered quickly as i '_d ordered through living_social .
M	not only the price of the product - 00gb runcore pro 00mm pata mini pcie solid_state drive ssd for dell mini 0 - was excellent , but its delivery surprised me again : 00_hours from purchase to delivery .
M	!
F	i will now never , ever shop at superdry again .
F	avoid prestige_flowers !
F	" totally what we expected - really sweet - good apartment - good price - a really good experience , we recommend :-)"
M	i asked_him for them to be delivered tomorrow then and he said he cant do that as its past the cut_off date !
M	better_than [_external_reference_] but still some retailers won_'_t pay out as promised , ie .
M	this company should be avoided at all costs .
M	very good service .
F	can '_t fault the service - helpful and courteous advice and assistance offered .
F	due to a technical_hitch the flowers didnt reach the intended friend until 0_days after her_birthday .
F	supplements are big business .
M	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
F	btw , i already forgot about the bike . uffff
M	all in all i have been delighted with my experience of dealing_with digitalrev , and would have no_hesitation in using them again or recommending them to anyone_else .
F	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .
F	i did contact them by telephone and was advised the offer had finished but wasn_'_t offered the item at the price still being advertised .
M	overall the buying experience was good but i did hav a 00_%_discount_code which was accepted at checkout but then when i paid with paypal the discount vanished .
F	it takes_ages to connect and quite_frankly i don_'_t have the time to stand about or going in and out of the store trying again and again to check - in .
M	money was there within 0 days .
F	however , the ingredients were somewhat obscure to me and i thought i was going to have difficulty_finding them in local_shops , but i came_across your website and found everything i needed , together with a prompt and efficient delivery service - everything came in good time for christmas .
M	no contact , no offer to part deliver .
F	thanks
F	i cant_fault the service given by mega_fancy_dress , they dispatched the items very quickly .
M	i don_'_t believe you have put your customer first , and far from it , you have put your back pocket first in my case and the audacious response you have provided above is nothing short of embarrassing for you .
M	all the items were great and exactly_what we wanted .
M	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again , but keep track of your order .
M	i really love the range of products available at guitarguitar , co . uk , and the superfast delivery .
M	i ordered two identical items - one worked and one did not .
M	i am still_awaiting my first payment since sept_0000 . my fault i missed seeing the condition re energy providers . but was easy to miss and then very difficult to navigate to find out why no payt received as no specific personal info available to say where or why money was still sitting on my a / c and not in my bank . pure_chance i eventually found the answer . i hope !
M	sometimes the prices are frustrating , one minute you get a cheap price , 0 mins later price changes .
M	i like the products .
M	i ' d looked them up on various review sites before buying and we are pleased with the quality of sound .
F	can '_t even use it .
M	but my major_issue is
F	very attractive - could just as easily wear them out and about without getting odd looks !
M	within 0 months the tablet was faulty and lemon digital were reluctant initially to deal with it .
M	they appear to have completely ignorred this request as nothing has arrived .
M	one star is far too generous
F	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
F	the goods were ordered wednesday_evening and arrived friday !
F	concerned that the recipient had a lot of difficulty_finding out who had sent them .
M	to quote the customer advisor " usn let us down with their stock delivery , but you should have the items by the end of the week ".
M	i informed rubbersole customer service and they were very helpful and agreed that it was a manufacturing_fault .
M	put on amazon or e_bay after that they will let you down .
F	i have just purchased a 00cm swiss gym_ball with free footpump .
M	poor customer service and they couldn_'_t even say sorry !
M	and made it sound that we were privileged to be offered a ' free upgrade ' - we hate large vehicles both to drive ( as it feels_like you are driving a bus ) and from an ecological point of view .
F	i have recommended them to many of my friends and family .
M	simply_supplements not only offer a wide_range of high_quality supplements at very competitive_prices ,. but also can give plenty of advice for their use and daily amounts to take .
F	the experience was quite stressfull and the delivery man seemed unaware of the agreed delivery day / time i had with nationwide .
F	crapy service
M	on the one occassion i had to return an item as it was too small , they dispatched the replacement extremely quickly .
F	amazing find - i love this company for the amount of choice for all ages and levels of ability .
F	will definitely use again .
F	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
M	whatever_happens , i will never buy anything from comet ever again .
M	con web_site .
F	i use it almost every day .
M	zero .
F	i have contacted customer_care about the speed of delivery and received an_email thanking_me for my patience , but no explanation as to why delivery was so slow .
F	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn_'_t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who '_d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
M	stay_away from them .
F	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
F	i have no_hesitation in recommending eflorist .
F	i ordered a superdry hoody for my husband for christmas .
F	of course there was no one answering release travel " we '_ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
F	the flowers were delivered and were nice .
F	they never try to leave with a neighbour and and i end up trailing to the collection centre 0_days_later .
F	you can also select the " map_view ," which lets you see all of the hotels and b_& bs to chose from by location , so you know just where you '_ll be staying .
F	awful company , don_'_t use them .
F	on to the next problem , well they courier service they use is horrible .
F	great to have access to rightmove without having to use an agent ( the only_reason i was considering going to one ).
M	obviously , this has not actually happened .
M	so can i return it - no because the other one is on finance and the finance can '_t be cancelled then it can but you have to find a courier to return it , but that has to be yesterday .
F	prices are are well and reliable_source ,
M	this is the second time i have tried these pods .
M	i can '_t stress enough - do not order from these theives !
M	we had been told that the fuel_tank was full , and that we were to return it full also .
M	however on raising the issu , e the staff were brilliant and overcame this quickly .
M	the customer service could have listened a little more rather then come_across standoffish in the beginning of our conversation .
F	if it '_s possible to give no stars i would do .
M	although replacement cordless_phones are cheap it seemed worth_checking the availability of replacement batteries .
F	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
F	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
M	the sample bag of earplugs is a great idea and very helpful for my wife .
F	would not use this service again .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	flowers looked nothing like the picture .
F	not helpful at all .
M	i '_ve not ordered much from these_guys , just some v weights , however the service was absolutely fantastic .
F	i thought the service was good .
F	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
M	also , sent an email asking advice and hoping to add to my order given it was still outstanding , but the email was not responded to .
M	lee today went above and beyond with assisting me .
M	oh well
M	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
F	i shall e_mail your site again to say that this must be escalated to senior level as it is beyond a joke .
F	ordered my items , and after waiting nearly 0_weeks i then rang john_anthony and turns_out after recently moving my items were delivered to my billing_address not my delivery address which was clearly_stated differently , luckily they got sent back to john_anthony i '_m bristol , they said they were resenting my items out which they did .
F	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct_address .
M	in the majority of cases , citylink '_s systems are so poor , they don_'_t register the authorization , so they still won_'_t re - deliver .
F	thank_you .
F	i ordered the biggest bunch available & what i got looked like the standard size advertised on the website .
M	plus the quick mill 000 looks a picture in my kitchen !
F	0_months later finally item arrives , again apart_from chris the communication has_been shocking .
F	they still have my money !
M	the hotpoint dryer is great .
M	i '_ve_used this company a number of times and their price , quality , service and advice is top - notch .
M	i wouldn_'_t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
F	i sent another email complaint at the poor service and i then got an_email to say that the item was actually out of stock and i will be getting a full_refund .
M	as for the door opening a manoeuver similar to a limbo dance was called for !
F	it was february before this happened though .
M	great website and regular text to update you and reassuringly nice flowers enjoyed by mum .
M	was very happy with the service especially as i had to exchange my original order .
M	made a booking and was satisfied until i noticed same hotel and same board on same dates for £_00 less , i had to cancel original booking and rebook manually .
F	we waited over 0 hours then swiched on , filling the freezer later that evening .
F	i '_ve been kept waiting 00_minutes + the last three follow_up appointments i '_ve been to - not good when you ' re on a lunch_break !
M	efficient magic from the mazumba crew !
M	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
F	i highlighted this to jules_b , and asked that they refund me the difference to save me sending the dress back however apparently this us against policy and they '_d rather receive the dress back .
M	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
F	it was first_class service .
M	will be coming_back for more ;-)
F	they could not explain the delay or provide an_alternative delivery date and so i cancelled the order .
M	on the one hand , i think the pricing is great , communication is also good ( the delay in being told one unit was out of stock downgraded this from great ) and my emails were responded to promptly .
F	i refuse to call an 0000 number from my mobile and i don_'_t have access to a landline so i am relying_on email communication which has not been forthcoming ,
M	ordered some trophies for a kids football_team i manage .
F	the part they sent me did not state it was for the grill and top oven .
M	the tent wad a quality branded product at the lowest_prices i could_find on the web but i was a bit disappointed by the very poor dpd delivery who couldn_'_t find our house .
M	if the level of service i received from yankee_doodle , is anything to go by , then the service industry in this country is well and truly going to the dogs !
F	posted out rapidly and received safely - what more could their clients want ( other than gripe above ).
F	the lindt ones .
F	!
M	unless you order for christmas in march then suggest you leave tmart well alone
M	i guess when you do anything on line you are always nervous in that you are dealing_with a computer and not a person .
M	do not go_anywhere_near tthis useless device
M	pharmacy_0u also offer a friendly advice service and they are always more than willing to offer their time and advice for free .
F	but they said the dimples are the design of the frame and ignore what i said about the n mark on one of the arm .
F	loved the crown website and really liked all my brushes ( badger hair powder brush , bullet brush and slanted blusher brush ).
F	now i have to go through the refund process with fedex which i am not amused with .
M	the avis person insisted he needed a few details , he then asked me if i wanted to get the excess reduced by paying extra .
F	i had given my office address for delivery my order was split in 0 and one parcel got sent to my office and the other to my home .
F	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
M	the person i spoke to at customer_services ([_name ]) was less_than apologetic and less_than helpful in trying to understand my disappointment of the missed delivery and was only prepared to compensate myself as the payee and not the receipient who is receiving the delivery a day late .
F	thank_you
F	then on tuesday i '_ll call at the same time and get no answer .
M	i got a gear stick for vauxhall_zafira , i was told it was a good condition but when i got it fitted it is very stiff and hard to get in to 0st 0rd and reverse ,
F	i have sent my comments to bbc few_times and have never received a reply , even an_automated " thank_you ".
M	the web service was faultless but when i rang the branch to arrange a fitting time the member of staff was totally_unhelpful and somewhat rude in his manner .
F	!
F	they have changed the catalogue areas from long benches to small circular table structures which now means that if it is busy you have to queue more to find an available catalogue whereas before there always seemed to be plenty of space .
F	dread to think who might have got away with it otherwise .
M	very pleased with the quick delivery & securely_packaged product
F	definitely recommend .
F	i would use this company again .
M	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
F	been buy frontline and worming_tabs from this site for 0 years and would highly_recomend it .
F	this was an easy site to naigate and the batteries arrived quickly .
M	this tape is brilliant .
M	so they weren_'_t what was required to film the baby and the slr had video function which my brother was happy with so an enquiry to slrhut . co . uk for a return and refund / exchange was available but only to the us offices i asked about sending to the uk address to be told it is only a uk conference room ( caretakers cupboard with an address really with a net look ) so with time and looking to send it back it was going to cost half of the refund to send them back .
M	thank_you
F	such a simple idea to save cash on most online purchases - and even some high_street purchases too !
F	understood .
M	i let jessops know and they said they would make an enquiry and to assure me they were taking this very seriously .
M	an okay kind of store which doesn_'_t leave me either looking_forward to my purchase or having enjoyed my shopping_experience .
M	all reputations seem to be based on a particularly spurious " feedback " system , in which someone moving their entire home to another town is given equal weight to someone_who just needs something moved up the road .
F	i checked my account and my balance was shown as £ 0 on 00 december .
F	when i started asking where they were i was told there was a delay .
F	i don_'_t know how long the parcel was there - i was away on hols .
M	fantastic service skype is great
F	it was very well package and fairly easy to put_together once we had watched the short video on the ttt web_page and read the instructions a couple of times and on sunday we were playing a game .
M	fortunately , a friend who i mentioned this to , came around and set the router up wirelessly without recourse to the cd .
F	to start off with , we had a terrible time finding where you were located , to the point we missed the tour we had paid for .
F	jo shayler at holidays_please in email contact only has never pestered , tried to force anything upon us but has trusted us to know what we want and gone out of her way to provide it .
M	0 .
M	the above experience with chess is only part of the abysmal service i received during the short time i was with them .
M	would definatley recommend and we look_forward to returning next march .
F	we contacted the darlington store and explained the situation and asked whether , if we came into the store it would be a waste of time , especially given that we had a young baby and had already travelled to a store once that day .
M	i would advise anyone not to buy from them
F	everything was straight_forward right from the beginning , no_hidden_charges , everything clearly_explained .
F	i tried closing the door on him and he jammed his foot in it insisting i signed for the package .
F	when we were getting on the bus at the airport - on entering the bus people were standing around with their luggage at their feet on the bus instead of putting it up on the racks then sitting down on the seats provided , thus_making it difficult for other people to get on the bus tripping_over cases , etc .
F	its a really dodgy practice and unnerved me from wanting to buy tickets although when buying tickets it said e_- tickets would be available
M	scammers
F	the feedback was a little_disappointing however , the flowers were described as " nice "
F	bought my battery on the 00rd_jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
F	money grabbing , rude and completely unhelpful .
M	i ordered 0 lithium 0 . 0v_batteries online , these are specific batteries required for alarm sensors and hard to find in high_street_shops .
F	comunication was excellent .
M	take my advice - go to a high_street shop and save_money and time .
M	definitely place order again with yr website
F	i would avoid at all costs .
M	do try them when you are next in a jam !
M	to top it all it says on the invoice that the card that made the payment needs to be presented when she attends to get the tyres_fitted !
F	i am not very happy as i have now missed giving the flowers on my cousins_birthday ie the 00th .
M	i have had ecco_shoes before and the quality and comfort remain very high .
F	i had forgotten to order pills for my journey . in a panic i ordered from travelpharm on sunday_evening , i knew that i could rely_on them for fast delivery . by tuesday lunch_time i had recieved them , big thanks to travelpharm
M	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
M	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og_de_var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0_dage .
M	great communication .
F	thanks jo .
F	i ordered a christmas star for my tree paid express delivery as i needed it asap i chose it based on the colour in the photo .
M	however , the main point in placing this order was to get the casa lambretta speedo face , and this was a big disappointment .
F	i ordered three rugs online last_week and the next_day got an_email_saying they were dispatched .
F	she said she would find out and call me back .
F	sometimes before 00_hours !
M	highly_recommend this service
F	will_definately shop_here for all my parties !
M	no_problems at all , no criticism at all .
M	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
M	super company
F	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn_'_t told what the fault was so didn_'_t test the sound .
M	all in all a quick , easy and hassle_free purchace
F	wowcher have returned the £_00 and the £ 0 . 00 pp which fashion revenge has kept !
M	mats received for 0000 ford_fiesta which are good quality & received very promptly .
F	ordered a dress and had to return it as the sizes were on small side but loved the dress so went to reorder but completely sold out and if you look at many dresses on the website they too are sold out .
F	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
F	but all in all an awful customer experience from sunglasses_shop .
F	although i won_'_t be ordering from very again because they are contracted with yodel of whom are a terrible delivery company .
F	excellent
F	can '_t ask for better_than that .
F	out of around 0 different suppliers , drinks_direct was by far the best deal .
M	i shall not waste any more of my time trying to leave what i think is a fair review of the product .
F	lower_than_expected prices , and good communication .
F	thats what i think after this expirience . but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!
F	very impressed .
F	i recently_purchased lenses for the first time .
M	i wwould use again but if the was a que i will not use again .
F	i know and trust this product , but it was the first time purchased from animed_direct .
F	i shall never deal with groupon again and i will make_sure i tell as many people as possible about the unreliability of this company to add_insult to injury i now find that the said mixer is available , at robert_dyas , for £_00 less anyway !
M	bought a new broilking last_week - no problem at all .
M	thought i had full cover , but it is only third_party / fire / theft .
M	this company is awesome !
M	the cables and lights were cheap toys !
F	he did not deny it and his carefully crafted words spoke volumes .
F	i emailed straight_away , clear_instructions on the email about returning items , however as it was after office hours , there was no reply .
F	when i picked_up the jacket it was sent in a bag , all crumpled up and foldered in on itself .
F	i '_ve always thought of smiths as been a bit old_fashioned and expensive as i remember going there with my parents about 00 years_ago , the shop has totally changed and i am so pleased with my new bedroom_furniture .
F	fast delivery , good price
M	update :-
F	really pleased with my items and would highly_recommend this site to my family and friends !
M	alternate arrangements needed to be made at my workplace .
M	having said all that the car was terrific value and i will use auto_europe again .
F	today i actually saw the flowers that were sent to my mum and they are pathetic .
F	very happy with purchase .
F	we chose our delivery day and the money arrived on time .
M	i have only ever had a couple of issues and on each_occasion it was dealt_with swiftly and professionally by customer_services , with replacement parts sent .
F	the amazon_local team
M	i e_- mailed again to find out what was going on and had no reply .
M	however , they were very good with their communications to explain when they were sent out , although no explanation as to what the delay was caused_by .
M	couldn_'_t get the tyres up that i wanted .
M	i cannot_fault the retailer and the after sales service which they provided was very useful .
F	placed my order on sunday and received delivery on tuesday .
M	the table needs to have the legs installed and you have to apply a coating of the supplied wax ; do this to the legs before you install them , and once the legs are in place you need to turn it over - and oh_yes , it weighs a lot .
M	the chamios cream arrived very quickly and was what i had ordered
M	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .

F	ordering was simple , price was good and delivery was speedy .
M	good prices fast delivery good customer service
M	i ordered my products on line on 0th_march and followed the tracking via the website .
M	not really worth the hassle to be honest .
F	ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 no reply .
F	unfortunately , the end of the box was completely missing , so plastic packaging was open to the elements .
F	i was spoiled for choice its truly a great we company
M	on the confirmation i questioned_why this hadnt been mentioned but was assured that it would be delivered as per my request .
F	fast and safe service .
F	i sent off my iphone 0 in working condition to get an_email back saying that they have tested it and rated it in a non working condition as it doesnt work on any networks .
M	would just like to say that parcel0go are the worst bunch of un caring un helpful people around .
F	both arrived beautifully and . 00hrs after being ordered on line !
F	it '_s the wow_factor that we rely_on and trust these companies to provide for special_occasions !!!
M	we were travelling on the saturday with little idea of our time of arrival , so it was with some_trepidation that i placed my order for flowers with a company i had picked from the net with no prior knowledge , for delivery at the home of a friend who i didn_'_t know would be in !
M	for small / medium packages other_companies use the post_office and the goods are delivered to the local post_office from where we can pick them up .
F	however using google translator i managed .
F	didn_'_t deliver my items .
F	necessary or my gadget is redundant .
M	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
F	now this might be deemed acceptable if i had asked for a full replacement , but i asked for 0 screw bolts only .
M	i was emailed to say goods had been dispatched .
F	you guys really need to work on this if you want to claim your share of the millions of new users who are going to start using e_- cigs in the near_future .
F	the lady at customer_services was very helpful and said it had not turned_up at the leeds depot .
F	my order was here the next_day - better_than slapping round the shops !
M	thank_you .
F	the first time we pulled the blind up on the first order it broke and we had to ask for spare_parts to mend it .
M	user_friendly with a very good quality product .
M	best price i could_find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before release !
M	i liked the service provided .
M	ordered some goods for my bros christmas_present .
M	it was my first experience with online photo_album .
M	description needs to be much clearer please rawlings !
M	but parcelforce manage .
M	started_using this company a while ago personally i think they are as good as it gets have had no_problems and would recommend to any one , will carry on using them if there service remains as good as it is ( try them for yourself )
M	i would ' nt_hesitate in purchasing items from charm school again in the future .
F	another great purchase , couldn_'_t get this anywhere .
F	revision 0th_jan :
M	very good and very much_quicker_than my old bt home hub .
M	helpful on the phone and when asked advised what was the best price for item i was looking for , easy to get hold of , sent regular e_- mails_informing about the progress of my item , very competitive on prices , thank_you will be recommending to friends and family .
M	i am sure that the duo bars seem to be an improved version , as they are easier for me to digest , and the taste is just that bit better !
M	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
F	perfect for a day that just needs the chill taken off your arms 😊
F	it is of course possible that we would have had the same problem if i hadn_'_t had to change the details , but maybe something which needs looking into ?
M	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
F	more than double !
M	the only issue i have is you take far too long to get back me when i email requests over to you or ask if i can add to my order .
M	the legislation on eu companies that they are referring to was ratified in the eu in 0000 although it '_s application is not unified in all memberstates of the eu .
M	the passage from average to very good is too wide and as a matter of fact quite a few of my reviews although i rate them as 0_stars , i always mention in the actual review that the reader should read it as 0 and a half .
F	sorted . or so i thought .
F	as for the delivery organising people i don_'_t even want to go there
M	i redialled but had the same experience the second time .
F	i am now awaiting the final_bill for the fuel and the additional driver as hertz inisited on taking all the paperwork including the itemised bill for these items .
F	numerous products all look to have similar ingredients .
M	bought curtain from them , paid all fees online , but got charged 00 . 0vat on delivery .!
F	phoned up , asked if my details were still on their system .
M	we then waited around for the shuttle_bus to take us back to terminal 0 .
F	just found this website and after_reading_reviews from other happy customers i made an order for christmas delivery .
F	i felt sorry for him but did not say so because too furious .
M	very hard to communicate with when ringing their office asked if i could pay over the phone and was told to send an email and they would respond their email was confusing and couldnt pay phoned back to a somewhat dopey young guy_who said he would send an email and didnt so rang again and eventually got through to another dopey guy then thank_you god got put through to a young_lady_who was very helpfull and efficient so managed to pay over the phone and get the perspex acrylic polish product !!
M	by the same token i am very pleased with the quality of the goods and the ones which fit are perfect .
F	however the product i purchased which was a ring is not a very good standard .
M	ordered a second_hand game at the same time from zoverstocked , was told despatched on the 0th which was a sunday so i thought that was a bit odd .
M	i would use them again and recommend them to anyone as they clearly take_pride in giving quality customer service .
M	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .
M	i '_ve_used them before and had no_hesitation in using them again .
F	a first_rate hassle_free experience .
M	found exactly_what i was after at a very competitive price .
M	rang the company at 0 . 00 am with 0 queries on wednesday 00th_april , telephone answered_promptly by balber
M	when i first joined i was asked what offers i ' d be interested in .
M	they gave_me the wrong directions to the car_park , causing a lot of stress .
M	so then you do , and it throws up the " shop now " button , so you click , and it throws up ( if you are lucky !)
F	it does what it says on the bottle and the price is good .
M	a really top_class digital agency that helped push our website right to the top of google for several important and competitive search terms .
M	i had lost my receipt and one of 0 pack had been worn so i was unable to do much about it - although a trip to trading_standards has_been contemplated .
M	keep well clear or use at your own_risk .
F	excellent service .
F	when the item was not suitable i returned it via their collect_+ service , where they scanned a bar_code and provided me with a receipt .
M	matirx should be 0_stars neutral , 0_stars increases your score and 0 , 0 , 0 downgrades .
M	which is really frustrating , because if you have , you cant delete it straight_away , you have to completed the order and then remove .
M	it arrivied the next_day !!!
M	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso_pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so_far 00_% of the pods i '_ve_used haven_'_t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso_machine flashing its lights in protest !
M	but only accept a fraction of barcodes entered .
F	0 .
M	although she says she_sees an improvement in my condition ).
M	they had a delayed delivery which was times just right to avoid demands for refunds in advance of insolvency .
F	!
F	the drinkshop is cheap but classy and the website is so easy to use .
M	services are great , but both my wife and a friend did three circuits of the airport before finding the airporter car_park .
M	was surprised to find out my product was in stock , and it got delivered within 0 days .
F	i wouldn_'_t really sign up , if you don_'_t shop that often on line .
M	thank_you
F	the assistant made a great show of saying this was not the information he had expected and apologised – then had the audacity to ask if there was anything_else we might be interested in from the company .
M	i received notification that my booking had been cancelled because the description was not explicit enough .
F	the cinema screen was great , nice and quiet and the popcorn and nachos were delicious !
F	orders have arrived promptly and wll packed .
F	well_worth the money !
F	perfect service :-)
F	the money has_been taken from my account which i think is disgraceful .
F	a bon entendeur salut .
F	the prices are fab , the site is so easy to use and the delivery is brill too x fantastic site don_'_t go_anywhere_else they won_'_t be as good as dolphin x
F	you are much_better contacting takeaways direct , usually you get better service and quicker delivery by contacting takeaways direct .
F	needed a ruck_sack for my sons xmas_present , ordered on line and it arrived very quickly , good packaging , no trouble what so ever .
F	the cd that came with it , that includes tips on how to record with the rode nt0a was completely damaged and is unplayable .
M	whats the point in having reviews if they are fake and made up .
F	it isn_'_t the best tasting powder iv ' e tried but if it does the job i '_ll put up with it .
F	bought my worktops from worktop_express what a brilliant company to do_business with , the service was excellent from ordering to delivery , the guys who delivered them where very obliging .
F	i sent an_email to customer_services and they responded very quickly , sending another replacement dish straight_away .
M	rarely you '_ll find an original and interesting article on ign .
M	i ordered two items on tuesday_evening and the goods were processed and delivere on the thursday_morning .
M	unacceptable !
F	but thought that it would be worth if for my friend .
M	and the final_insult - the tyres have not been fitted correctly !!!
F	thankful ,
F	wish i had read this review site before dealing_with this company .
M	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
M	nobody replied on the request as well .
F	thankyou penelope tevose - clowe .
M	the ordering_process was excellent and being_able to configure an all in one pc to a very high specification for the price was a big plus .
M	this was ridiculous service .
M	when their charges rose to a total of £_00 per_month , £_00 for their tv service ( including sports package ) and £_00 for broadband and telephone services , we decided to use freeview for tv rather_than sky .
M	i was advised that i would have to wait two_weeks for the two shirts .
F	very impressed with web_site , easy to use .
F	have now sent off for another order and am toting up advantage points for free goods .
F	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
F	still not received my goods . takes too long to deliver .
F	a good product that is as_described , shipped quickly and i was very happy with the product .

F	i ordered a boiler on tuesday_evening at 0 :_00pm by 00am wednesday_morning i got a call from the company to confirm delivery on thursday_morning .
F	when i politely asked her to please stop interrupting me she said i was being rude to her !
M	but could give some stickers with the orders time to time , make it way nicer !
M	personally though , i '_m not sure it was worth the hastle .
F	decided to try calling after school drop_off the next_day .
F	but when i followed the link in the email ( weird series of stages to finally reach the xdp express website ) and put in my tracking code , there was no delivery date at all and it just said " no status data ".
F	car was fine , staff were very good not problems
F	these individuals are always busy when i visit .
M	i again chased for days for a return number which when eventually it arrived , brazenly stated that i would have to pay £_00 to have the pile of garbage returned .
F	so thank_you for making her day !
M	we recieved our order before time , the delivery driver was extremely_helpful .
F	so far it '_s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
M	i ordered my flowers for the 0th on the website .
F	hope the recipient enjoys spending the voucher at sportsbikeshop
F	the website is user_friendly and there is a large_selection to choose from - some very impressive displays .
F	:_o_)
M	what a joke nobody can tell you the truth .
F	!
M	then don_'_t say you '_ve not been_warned .
M	service was outstanding , from ordering to landing on the doorstep was less_than 00hrs !!
M	m &_p fashion
F	by tuesday no sign of yodel , so called the clothes company to be told a collection had been attempted and that a card had been left .
M	( how is it letters from other banks seem to arrive ok but not the co - op ?
M	tonight unable to watch corrie even_though i declare i '_m over 00 .
M	the desk advised this always happens & is unclear .
M	the product came with 0 different strengh rubber strips which are supposed to be used to perform exercise '_s that eradicate the tennis_elbow .
M	for the second order the same information freeze happened but when i called it seems the poles had been sent to the wrong place and no one had noticed .
M	we were told that a manager who sent us an email 0 minutes earlier was not in the office today !
F	i was happy with the flowers and the teddy_bear i ordered for my mother however when the delivery man arrived at 0 in the morning my mum was already up , however there was no knock on the door or any attempt to give the flowers personally to my mother , all she heard was a van driving away .
F	one was delivered within this time .
M	this is a sham .
F	everyone that moves house should use anyvan to get competitive quotes - it '_s such an easy system and a great concept !
F	the flavours are delicious and i genuinely feel i could get similar standards eating out at a restaurant .
F	this company is becoming such a nuisance i recommend put it through the internet spam filter .
M	i can recommend park .
F	i felt that £ 0 . 00 was quite_expensive for delivery but the boxes were a very good price so i still went for it .
M	i wanted to make others aware of the dangers of dealing_with this company .
M	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
M	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
M	sort it out
F	if i were you i '_d steer well clear , and if your tempted in for gods sake make_sure you keep note of who you speak to and when it can help when it comes to writing a complaint to their md !
F	i have used photobox . co . uk a number of times .
M	ordered on saturday from the uk .
F	it would have been better if the squares could have been arranged differently for different solutions .
M	the review section needs to have a box which asks for a review for the benefit of other_travellers - that gets posted to the site and makes it clear that it will be , and a separate section for comments / questions for the hostel management .
M	moral is never believe everything you read especially on the carphonewarehouse website .
F	we used worktop_express because of the price and the prompt delivery service and we were not disappointed .
M	so helpful with great advice and certainly going the extra_mile and more .
M	i ordered a shield with engraving - excellent service
F	when playing with my cat the sticks snaps and breaks in my hand .
M	het product dat_ik_heb besteld ( een ergonomisch gewichtsvest ) zit lekker en functioneert naar verwachting , de kwaliteit van_het materiaal is alleen niet zo best , na_een paar dagen scheurde de voering op verschillende plekken ( wat ik zelf heb gerepareerd ), dit is uiteraard niet aan gorillasports te weiten maar aan_de fabrikant van_het gewichtsvest .
F	looking 0 parking were uninterested in my feedback .
M	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
M	the strips do not have any grooves / slots on the underside , and so to achieve the desired_result , i now have to recess the decking steps to accept the anti - slip strips !
F	my husband bought me a bag as one of my christmas_presents .
F	it took them 0 (!)
M	very happy with service
F	no_hesitation in using animed again .
M	got it all installed and working no problem , would defiantly come_back and recommend to a friend .
F	to be confirmed
F	my son still doesn_'_t have confidence that his costume will arrive on time despite paying for express delivery
F	as awlays the selection and purchase was simple and straightforward .
F	the reply was blunt and felt blaming towards me as if i had not read the fact that it would be next_day delivery .
F	we were pushed back a week and installation arranged for monday the 00th_may , our installation was only completed this week ( 00th_june )!!!
M	i recently ordered some things from fuelsport and would thoroughly_recommend the experience .
M	the staff said saturdays are always chaotic !
F	we received a call on monday to inform us that a fitter would not be available for another 00 days , i advised that a new bed was being delivered that day and could not be delayed again .
F	ordered the flowers before 00 : 00 and minutes afterwards had the call to say the op had been cancelled .
M	the plotter was ordered on - line and we were contacted to arrange it '_s delivery and installation .
M	i booked a hotel , received the confirmation_email and turned_up at the hotel only to be told that lastminute had made an error and that there was no room available .
M	when my delivery arrived , one box heavily damaged with several broken_tiles .
F	00th_dec_0000 : update on my earlier review :
F	this is the first time and the last i will ever use this site .
M	had no_problems sending off my phone and received payment .
M	perfect and highly_recommended .
M	excellent value for money , couldn_'_t find myopro cheaper anywhere_else .
M	thanks .
M	much_better_than waiting all day .
M	not happy that you have to opt_out of extras - sneaky
M	i would recommend them wholeheartedly to any brompton owner who_likes to do her or his repairs .
F	i bought my grandson 0 bow_ties from my tuxedo as he couldn_'_t make up his mind what colour he wanted .
M	called back politely but firmly annoyed , mentioned the disappointing reviews , i was thinking watchdog was the next step , may have mentioned that to them !
F	!
F	good customer service , thank - you
M	i ordered this dishwasher online as my old one was about to pack up it didn_'_t say out of stock so when i rang up after a week i was surprised to be told they were waiting on delivery and they would ring back to advise delivery date which they didn_'_t i rang the following_day and got another unfulfilled promise when i rang the third time . i eventually received a date .
F	this was my first floral purchase and most certainly won_'_t be my last !
M	be sure we will stay the hell away from all mobile_broadband in the future .
M	actual delivery - 0 *
F	problem_solved you might think , not so .
F	i couldn_'_t leave a phone message as the box was full twice .
M	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn_'_t hear from them .
F	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
M	thank_you serenata my wife was thrilled with her_birthday flowers
M	very happy
F	good efficient service all_round .
F	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
M	this is the last time i '_m using wiggle they are a joke , there customer service as gone awol .
M	unusually , i did not check the ownership / status of this company before ordering .
F	because this is theft of an energy_supplier who already get enough of us customers !
F	normally they are quick off the mark with their customer_relations , but this time it has_been poor .
F	having spent over a hundred_pound i am very disappointed with the service .
F	it was so easy to order & was helpful to receive texts to say flowers had left the department & another to say they '_d been delivered successfully , which was reassuring .
F	in boxes 0 and 0 one of the sachets in each box contained only air .
F	excellent company which offers great service and very good prices , would recommend to all .
F	generally very satisfied .
F	nor will i spend any more of my money with them , as i intended , should i eventually get a refund .
M	!!!
F	in principle the site and store is a great idea , unfortunately not run by people for customers . with too many expectations they fail to meet .
M	i rang the store twice and on my second_attempt managed to get hold of the manager who arranged a return on the 00th_feb via uk mail .
M	i am_delighted with parcel0go , thank_you .
M	i have had a number of items in the past with no_problems - i would have tried to sort something out with jessops if i had more time - a thing to remember in future .
M	the packaging around the kit was just crumpled newspaper .
F	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .
F	the delivery arrives very quickly , within 0 - 0_days of the order being made .
M	i got a delivery a few_days_later and all arrived in one package , which made it easy to store until i started work .
F	i sent my images asked a few questions and in a few_days i had back the most exquisite images , beautifully_packed in a solid tube .
M	a very slow process in all .
F	i love fb and i use it constantly .
F	quoted new address on order but ss sent items to old address
M	their client service refused to cancel the transaction .
F	great service a lot of other web_sites very tricky and expensive
F	yet to check if this has_been refunded .
M	rubbish company my flowers come dead . couldn_'_t find a contact number for them email them saying i wasn_'_t happy with the service and want a refund didn_'_t hear_anything back from them so stay_away scammers
M	thank_you toolstop for a great service .
F	my good did indeed turn_up on time and in good condition .
M	order one for yourself you will not be disappointed .
M	the journey time was exactly as promised .
M	my first order was ok prices and delivery fair
F	what if i had paid full price !!
M	you seem to be asked effectively to pay a separate premium for separate insurance to multitrip for the basic insurance , and to a different firm , osg medical_screening , for prior conditions – though i was assured that if it ever came to a claim there would be only one single procedure .
F	they certainly are not helpful with messages , just told to check junk !
F	despite a great deal of patient explanation from me serenata refuse to say that in future they will deliver them to the street address as given .
F	all_round a satisfactory purchase .
F	found other batteries with really good deals .
M	all in all i just think the memory purchased from mr_memory where just faulty .
F	the best price and quick delivery
M	i bought these tyres on the net really good price but when i went to have them fitted at national_tyres the could not find my order even_though i ' d phoned to check my west lakes were in .
M	the customer service leaves a lot to be desired .
M	the pictures are really good ( esp .
M	kirsty on the livechat was v v helpful with me as was the gentleman on the freephone 0000 number . the best customer service : )))
F	not sure i would use them again .
M	second time of using this company and not had a problem .
F	i explained that no one could put it together with the poor instructions and wrong hardware ( talk about having to repeat myself as they didn_'_t listen ).
F	its nice to get something for nothing which isnt very often these days .
M	walls and floors then conceded that my complaint was not investigated properly and at_least had the grace to apologise and agreed that i had a point .
F	nevertheless could have done without the hassle .
F	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !
F	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen_elsewhere .
F	i understand you have to balance the weight of the ship and load accordingly but it does really feel like bikers are second or third class citizens these days .
M	on the 00th of may i enquired again as to when stock would be available , product still out of stock .
F	i ordered flowers 0_days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters_birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .

M	ordered , received , fitted and gigged in the space of 0 days !
F	well this was the cheapest i found on the internet of
F	my mil was so disappointed - they had already started dieing with crispy petals and yellow leaves .
M	i have since heard that they recycle under the name " zoverstock " on amazon . daylight_robbery in my opinion .
M	in summary would use both blackcircles and broadbridge heath garage again the in future without_question and have already_recommended to friends and colleagues .
M	i wanted a fender gig_bag and their site showed one identical to one i already have at a great price .
F	after a bit more dissusion and he was assured that thier would be no compensation for our dissappointment .

M	originally ordered furniture expecting a pre_- christmas delivery .
F	i ordered 00 small science badges at 00p_each .
F	ordered lenses on 00st_january .
F	if you ' re looking for a blind for your home , iwould definitely recommend ' blinds0go '.
M	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i '_m requesting a full_refund .
M	good service overall as i got what i wanted in the end but was initially told the plastic i wanted wasn_'_t available . lucky for me i knew it was and when the operator went away to check his answer changed .
M	i ordered two batteries for my makita_drill and they were there the very next_day .
F	these things_happen , the issue was dealt_with and so far as i could tell from taking the blinds out of the box but not opening them out ( in case the whole lot had to go back ), the blinds looked exactly_what i wanted .
F	alarm_bells started to ring .
M	000000000
M	are they any good ?
F	i felt in completely safe_hands with mr carpp and would thoroughly_recommend the lvc to anyone_thinking_about laser_eye_surgery .
F	it was an expensive mistake and i am not sure i will use the site again .
M	it '_s now nearly 00 months since the order and no joy .
F	this came through the following_day they were dispatched the day after and arrived the day after that .
F	our couch is elephant cord fabric and the only issue with it is that it loses it '_s pile quite quickly on the arms despite following the recommended care regime .
M	mazuma was great from the start ,
F	the items were delivered quickly and without breakages .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i have been with topcashback for about six_years and received over 0000 pounds on everything that i would normally buy , no - brainer

M	i would recommend herbies as the leading company for customer service and quality .
M	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don_'_t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can '_t be taken in the cabin .
M	!

M	very satisfactory and very easy to book up as i '_m not the best at using my tablet . myself being a 00 year_old geordie . thank_you !

F	easy to do , exceptional choices and fantastic rewards
F	i can '_t get through to anyone who can refund me my money .
F	absolutly_brilliant producyt and i will_definatly be ordering regularly .
F	it got through in the end !
M	i use your services for all material iof this nature , my inly complaint is not having acounts will set discount for loyal_customers .
M	it seems like cpw profit from insisting on using manufacturer warranties as_opposed to using the contract entered ( soga ) then forcing customers into repairs , not having to replace or refund the item or even offering it as an option past the first 00 days .
M	and the sheer array of choice is excellent .
M	when i phoned up to query it i was read the terms and conditions by 0 different customer service officers and told to write to head_office , but they will say the same thing - so they had effectively stolen my money and stuck two fingers up at me .
M	we made a point of checking on of their online " reviews " one of which turned_out to be fake ; there was no " z black " and the company had never_heard of soho00 .
F	tuesday july 0 my mums_birthday - got my request in good time for the deadline for a same day delivery and thrilled to know it would get to my mum on her special after what has_been a very very difficult few_months ney years actually - when i chose the bouquet i was over the moon to note that bramble the bear was available to accessorise .
M	didn_'_t have to deal with their customer service team though !
F	their customer service is excellent .
F	copying '& pastiing took_ages due to text boxes - one if them dropped the name if the hotel !
F	overall a excellent service .
F	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
F	they told me they '_d post it to me the next_day ( as they '_d run_out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
M	i have used hotel direct before and have come_back .
F	i had to make my order £_00 to be able to
F	are not big enough for me unfortunately still really hungry oh_dear .
F	thank_you .
F	when i did eventually place my order , i wasn_'_t sure about the photographs of some of the tints ( i was looking for prescription_sunglasses ).
F	the sizes are shocking , my mum normally wears 00 , maybe 00 ( as some shops are different ) and she could just fit into a xl .
M	as well as this i was also charged admin to use an_automated_system .
F	everything about this company has_been fantastic , very efficient and easy to work with - from the simple yet informative website and easy ordering to efficient delivery service .
M	i phoned friday .
M	apart_from that , the car was good , clean and good fuel_economy .
F	every time they said they would give it more padding but never did .
F	i intend to take this to trading_standards as i fail to see why i should be liable to any charges for requesting a refund for a service that you failed to provide .
M	i only bought it from them because they sold handles individually so i could get a sample .
F	i don_'_t know wether to give them another chance or not . shame really .
M	great communication and website / order page too .
F	we have been waiting in all day and contacting your service only to find a card put through the door about 0pm - two of us were in the house and the bell did not ring .

F	received as stated , colour was lighter_than internet picture so not suitable , ended_up spending over_£_00 to return post , won_'_t be ordering internet again .
M	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
F	they '_ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags . items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
M	unfortunately dsl do not have the same customer service values and failed to deliver , failed to communicate_effectively , failed to call back , failed to prioritise resolution of the problem .
F	apart_from a few remarks from the shop assistant about daughter # 0s slim feet ( after trying several_pairs of boots ) ie why did she not have her own boots ?
F	i '_ve contacted sip 0 times in the last 0_months now to inform them of the problem , and i '_ve sent in pictures .
F	good value , good looking fridge_freezer .
M	inevitably i will need to collect from a courier collection depot as i work full time and the interlink depot is right on the other side of the city and closes at 00am on a saturday .
M	have bought lots of things from hotroxuk without_any_problems . then the first time i did have a problem with a pedalboard that i purchased they were absolutely_hopeless . i kept e_- mailing them but didn_'_t receive a single response - evenually after e_- mailing the manager on his personal e_- mail address i got a reply , but by this time i had sorted_out the problems at my own_expense - this has_been amongst the worst customer service that i have ever received !
F	the order arrived the very next_day , enabling_me to deliver the finished products to my client a day ahead of schedule , guaranteeing return orders for both myself and the chocolate_trading co .
M	the web_pages are easy to use .
M	i bought a pair of kef q000 speakers for £_000 .
F	would use ulookubook again .
F	thanks lauren !

F	jayne from advantage services was brilliant , having jayne come to our workplace was a bonus with just two of us being shown sage 00 payroll tutorial , all_aspects were explained_clearly .
M	i would recommend glasses_direct very highly .
F	he stood unnecessarily close to the threshold of my door and he was on the phone to his warehouse talking in a loud voice for me to hear his conversation .
M	i would say he ' delivers ' to , but i see precious_little evidence of that .
F	i ordered it on the sunday , had a slight paypal issue so after not being_able to get through on the phone on the monday_morning , i clicked on the box at bottom of screen to speak with an agent and asked them to call me which they did pretty_much immediately .
M	i called the other number .
M	i '_ve probably bought more then a few_hundred vinyl recrods from chemicalrecords . co . uk over the last 0 years .
M	a good experience , with nice product and prompt service .
M	bought a new house which had triple glazing installed by previous_owners from this company .
F	worst company i have ever dealt_with .
F	my mum get flowers for x - mas every year i use interflora but this time i use floraqueen
M	are appliancesonline '_s cashflow problems really that bad ?
M	great to do_business with .
F	would definitely recommend .
F	i have never recieved a reply , even after writing via snail_mail to find out where the missing items that i have already paid for are !!
M	they are advertised as allowing the toddler to feel they have done a wee but without the mess .
M	this is the worst aspect of their service and the one that greatly needs to improve .
F	a very worthwhile purchase . thank_you very much .
M	i don_'_t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
F	some of the paper was boxed the other were in a plastic_bag which_resulted_in corners being damaged
M	!
F	upon_arrival to the vehicle my husband checked around the car , fairly standard i thought .
M	oh , they also responded to emails quickly , that '_s always a good thing .
M	ordered a photo mug for a colleague and it arrived with a couple of small scratches on it and there was not enough time to reorder or get a replacement in time .
F	also one of the doors doesn_'_t fit properly it is slightly_lower_than the other and seems warped .
M	0 days by then !
M	your stall need to explane more accurately about items .
F	!
F	battery_station take all the stress out of sourcing and purchasing compared with the high_street , and their prices are competitive .
F	i recently bought my hubby the dji phantom 0 to go with his gopro hero 0 camera , and rcgeeks has_been an_absolute_pleasure to deal with .
M	the bacon is not full of water like other well_known_brands , we have used donald russel for many_years for their quality standards even_though we find it expensive .
M	passports , id cards and such like are important_documents , you need them to get on planes and so on .
M	when i received the delivery notification it stated the flowers had been left in a secure_location - this was incorrect , the had been left on an unmanned desk in the building lobby ( they are for my wife as a thank_you as she '_s looking after me as i have two broken legs and can '_t get about ), she works at a business that shares a building with a number of others .
M	i have sent emails to cyber_power about this and have received no answer .
M	happy with the product ,
F	!
F	delivery was on time and the flowers were in good condition .
M	but what was really annoying , after receiving the shoes , i received an e_- mail from ecco saying the same shoes were now half price !
F	in fact i wrote to the store last_week praising them .
F	otherwise the story would repeat .
F	!
F	i decided in the end that this isn_'_t a good deal , and asked for my money back , though i lost about £_00 in fees altogether , for something that wasn_'_t my fault .
F	i got great advice from the online tech_support and from the forum .
M	the end_result was totally satisfactory and i will use anyvan again and recommend them to friends .
F	i would use them again as they were cheap but some system of finding a space would be helpful
M	sellers pay the fee .
F	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
M	but there were too many potatoes & too little meat , in my opinion .
M	after about a quarter of a mile there was a a horrendous smell and smoke was pouring out of the driver - side front_wheel , the car didn_'_t feel right so i was forced to stop .
F	my business is run from a remote_part of the scottish_islands and therefore , i have encountered many issues with delivery times and costs .
M	credit_card surcharges are a last_minute , unwanted surprise .
M	very bad attemption and no solutions .
F	i have already_recommended worktop_express to several people already .
F	the flowers i sent my motherinlaw were perfect so colourful so beautiful well boxed and the card added that little extra gift . i will definitely use serenata_flowers again and again for the people i love .
M	when i tried on the clothing item in question i found it to be too big ( my mistake not theirs ).
F	the album contained my wedding photos and i ordered and paid for the best quality available .
M	but if you have any_problems you are in a world of pain .
F	present the next_day because i could not be at her_birthday_party .
F	very quick .
M	poor product / terrible attitude to customer service .
F	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
F	although i found intriguing live poker , the convenience of playing online as i struggled to keep_up and the number of websites which offer strategies and tips for poker players is correspondingly large and growing .
M	high_quality product - superfast delivery .
M	fast and effective service , will_definatly_recomend your services to my friends and family
F	i have a twenty year_old elna machine and was having trouble_locating parts .
M	i went up there with silicone to try to prevent it - spent weeks .
M	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
F	british_gas is the main supplier of 00_% of these sites .
F	the whole bunch didn_'_t last the week .
F	it is a wedding present but i feel i need to buy something_else to go with it now as it '_s not_overly impressive .
M	.
M	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company … don_'_t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few_pounds off .
F	however my latest purchase - a digital thermometer does not work .
F	i orderd a bouquet as a wedding gift for a colleague .
F	she put me on hold once again & then told me the supervisor would call me back within 0 mins . 0_days_later i '_ve not had the call and i just received a letter in the post from them to say they have cancelled my order for the " replacement dress " which i didn_’_t give authorisation to be ordered , but they can '_t guarantee it will be cancelled .
F	i thought , great , free_postage and dscount code as a first order .
F	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum_sticks out quite a way )
M	i had to chase up myself .
M	i have use this company before with great results , however this time things have been a joke .
F	ordered 00_kg bag of food and couple of medical items .
M	good fast service .
M	its never real .
M	can '_t fault the fitters though they were very helpful . probably a blip because this does seem to be a very competitively_priced tyre site .
F	the stick on feet protection are rubbish and if you put them on and then move the item , they come off straight way - we paid_extra for these and they are a waste of time .
F	we were travelling with two children - its a long journey to keep them happy and entertained .
M	!
M	had been waiting to put an order together when i got an email with the halloween free_postage offer so decided to take_advantage of that .
F	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
M	originally used another company but let_me down for the last three orders taking up to two_weeks for delivery , chemist_direct were cheaper and delivered within two_days - excellent from_start to finish
F	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services . saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
F	its good to be able to get all of the things you need in one place , the staff are so helpful , even bringing forward an auto_dispatch item so that the customer does not run_out of it
F	it took a couple of weeks to get it all sorted , which was ridiculous .
M	would recommend watchfinder . co . uk to anyone looking for a new or pre_- owned_watch .
M	outward presentation not impressive - a plain_brown cardboard_box .
F	i have used aldi on and off over the years . reason i dident use it as often before was simple , distance .
F	i received this on a saturday .
F	product is of very good quality
M	next item new washer when finances recover , thanks aol your
F	looking at these reviews it '_s clear that i '_m far from being alone in my bad_experience .
F	i was kept up to date with each_stage and i was surprised at how quickly i received my payment .
F	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
M	of course they never came .
M	the scooter arrived in packaging that needed to be cut open to gain_access .
F	even when suggesting i could save money by using a different tariff they said ' but it is probably too much bother for me to do '.
M	easy to order .
F	i '_m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won_'_t pay the price that the phone is worth !
M	he informed me that his manger would not let him order the frame without it being fully paid for , ( i was a bit annoyed that he had not called me but thought ok ) i said i will pay over the phone and he told me he could not take payment over the phone .
F	have been advised by the recipient that the product is good .
M	the furniture was great but we ended_up with the wardrobe left in the lounge because the delivery drivers couldn_'_t take it up the stairs because of health and safety !!!
M	thanks
F	all as above .
F	you could walk to st mark '_s square in 00_minutes - lovely .
M	i added some products which showed " as added " but never got included and only after you pay the money , you realise what you bought .
F	- its lying .
M	this aspect needs to be drastically improved before i would place an order again .
F	i ordered a rug from the rug_house 0_days before christmas thinking i wouldn_'_t get it until after christmas but it arrived 0_days after being ordered .
F	they now also smell lovely , it is just a shame they were not that nice when they arrived .
M	fast and reliable service !
F	i have used the free service to advertise my room and have just found my third lodger through spareroom .
F	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
M	didn_'_t bode_well for a good experience on my first order from this company .
M	great item and quick delivery
M	and the lights i got as soon as i touched them the button broke .
F	too late now for my mums_birthday_present .
F	we have ordered the decanter and port sipper set for two friends now , and they are both delighted with their gifts .
F	very impressed with the service and delivery of the clothing and the quality of the superdry products is excellent .
M	was really impressed with their service and paperwork side of things too so will_definitely try them first next time we go .
F	sorry haven_'_t the time .
M	used several_times , speedy & faultless service combined with great value = one happy customer
F	the confirmation order had this at 0 navy and 0iin black , which i pointed_out and krowmark changed .
F	would definitely use again .
F	i ordered from the whisky_exchange on wednesday_night .
M	excellent , very quick service .
M	they will get away with it for now but long_term it is a recipe for disaster .
M	they failed to explain_why it was " low stock " before placing my order and only changed to " out of stock " after the payment .
M	unfortunately a further call was required this time answered by someone reluctant to give her name - until pressed .
M	neither is true .
F	you also need to be aware that not everyone_knows what you normally call things .
F	i ordered thursday and was with me monday_morning , will be ordering again .
F	it had not been sent to me because the manufacturers stopped printing it .
F	i ordered birthday flowers , carefully choosing a bouquet with no lillies , as our daughter has cats . our daughter sent me a picture on face book , clearly showing a bunch of flowers that bore_no_resemblance to what i ordered , containing lillies . i have e_mailed the company to complain but have not had a reply .
F	easy to order .
F	i saw the happy_puzzle advert in magazine with a reduction on price for the ' make your_own flower ' pack but offer had closed so had to pay full price £_00 . 00 and the same for the wax shapers .
F	i would not have any hesitation in recommending them to family , friends and business colleagues .
F	love the colour selection , and fast shipping !
M	good range of products and prompt delivery
M	almost gave up .
M	the flesh was much paler than i am used to in steak and i wonder_if the meat could perhaps have been hung longer .
M	brought this product about 0 years_ago , after trying others , this is the best i have used by far , doesn_'_t slow up my pc like others have in the past , very pleased , keep_up the good work bullguard , i tell all my friends and family to use this on their pc '_s ,
M	no flowers , no customer service , no response .
M	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
F	a quality product .
F	when it was agreed i was told it had just been processed and i would get my money in 0 - 0 working_days .
F	when i phoned for advice as this was my first online order of prescription pet_meds the person i spoke to was very friendly and helpful .
M	i telephoned the caravan manufacturers and they suggested that i just googled the key number , which i did and bingo .
F	i would use this company again because of the fast free reliable delivery service and free_returns within 00 days but also for the no_quibble refund given .
F	thanks so much
M	very impressed won_'_t hesitate to use it again & will point my friends to there website - thanks
F	went to look today and is indeed better foamed but still a gap .
M	" mazuma " no_hassle and best price .
F	i am a complete_novice but she put me at ease wit her patience and understanding of what was required .
F	i guess you get what you pay for !
F	i phoned this company and said what i was interested in .
M	the hotel really let the whole_experience down !
M	above title perhaps not a fair reflection on sweatband as the ordering_process on their site was straightforward and included a healthy discount .
F	x
F	they were extremely easy to assemble and a good quality for a great price , great for laptops , snacks and other teenage activities not that i '_ve noticed that much activity from my three !
M	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
M	still advertising 0 days .
F	i recently got some photos of my kids put on canvas they really look great .
F	the picture on the website included roses and lilies but none were included in the bouquet which was made up of chrysanthemums , 0 carnations and some stock .
M	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling_regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
M	i '_ve never worked with such a good online clothing retailer - returning stuff is just so easy and friendly .
M	ordered the 0kg_chicken - excellent quality , lean steak_mince , very little water when cooked and the best i '_ve tasted , and 0kg of liquid_egg_whites ideal as i finished them in 0 . 0days , overall great experience , stop buying supermarket_chicken_breasts 0 for £_00 , switch to muscle_food , that is all !
F	quaestor have such a good choice of products , easily adaptable to everyone '_s needs .
F	we paid the extra £_00 to get the chrome model which i think is worth it as it is an expensive thing and the white one just has a bit of a cheap look about it to me .
F	when i asked why they had sent me an_email on nov 00th saying they had been dispatched , the girl hedged around it .
M	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
M	inevitably we are telling friends and relatives about our experience and this is poor
M	when you arrive at the airport you driver is waiting to take you car away for the duration of your holiday and then when you return your car is waiting for you to drive home .
M	the ability to return products without_question is fantastic .
M	the service is good , quick to send and in decent packaging .
F	i just want my £_00 back .
M	when we collected the car his parting comment was we were driving out ' on the road to hell .'
M	!
F	what more can we say ?
F	my sister then started having problems with the company saying that they couldn_'_t get us all in the same hotel and that we would be at_least 00mins walk apart_from each other , they also said that the people staying in the hotel had to pay extra money .
M	they ' re really cheap and the time they take to deliver is great , but my stuff arrived a bit banged up , so that sucked .
M	it '_s more trouble than its worth .
F	a discount could have been offered for the inconvenience though as i wouldn_'_t use again now .
M	car was in good condition but alot older than we would expect it to be considering its a hire car - but more than adequate .
M	i was also assured the delivery driver would carry the two packaged to the desired room , clearly my 0 month pregnant_wife wasn_'_t able to do this , however the driver refused . another disappointment with this company .
M	if they cannot guarantee 00_hours , then don_'_t state it and hide the caveat in the terms and conditions section .
F	also didn_'_t like not having the choice to leave a small gift card with the flowers , was only given the choice of a card which would have replicated one i had sent earlier . just needed a little note without_any extra_charge !
M	order and received within_00hrs , customer service fantastic have used printerland before and the after sales is second to none
F	and no p_&_p !
M	i can '_t work out what films i can stream .
M	decided to order as the price was competitve and they had the product in the colour that i wanted .
M	the title_says it all i recently sent my wife a bunch of flowers for £_00 . 00 and when they arrived although she was grateful the specimens were appaulling . dried up wilted and drooping , a poor effort by some teenage back room girl by the look of it . no i don_'_t recommend them .
M	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
M	prompt service , excellent site - recommend
M	just one final note .
M	but still good value especially their tv service ( no_longer actively sold ).
M	i have used plumbnation several_times and will use them again .
F	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
F	give it a try !
M	we will never use them again !
M	subsequently sat on a chair and it broke .
M	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three_days !
M	delivered on time and as_described
F	i used free drop of service to return item , and ordered correct_size straight_away - which arrived next_day .
M	requested special delivery instructions which were carried_out .
M	the sanding bobbin seems well_designed and made .
F	emailed them to query with no reply .
M	i am unable to submit a review as the purchase has not yet arrived .
F	ordered a sewing_machine 0 july_0000 , today , 0th_august nothing has yet appeared .
M	the completed job looks good and has_been commented on by tradesmen .
F	you say it was down to the snow
F	however , i '_ll be unlikely to order again because of a bit of confusion on the quantities .
M	overall levels of customer communication poor and well below that of the competition .
F	if the site didn_'_t have the product why did they take orders from teenage girls .
F	friendly and efficient
M	tool shopping made simple !
M	very very nefarious business .
F	was recommend to me and i wouldnt_hesitate to pass that recommendation on .
M	taking the website and platitudes about ' customer service being important ' at face value i emailed them monday 00th_september .
F	i had looked online and was bamboozled by the array of advice on how to look after these creatures - all i am sure very good .
M	i could sit_down & write the instructions accurately in 00_minutes having now completed the install - so why can '_t you ?
M	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
F	i used photoworld because i had a voucher entitling me to an excellent deal .
F	i don_'_t receive any updates on progress i have to chase continually , all the information they have requested i have provided in a timely_manner even_though they have asked me 0 times what my gas_meter number is .
M	i think you would improve your service if your postal_charges were incremental based on order value or some such methodology , but i will still recommend to friends .
F	this combination of these two factors meant that i was the last to board my flight .
M	phrankie
M	product as advertised .
M	the service from whybuynew was good apart_from i paid extra for next_day . delivery before 00 so i could have a parcel for new year party the delivery date was set but the company did not get the parcel from you in time to deliver it to me so i paid for fast postage for no reason for it to come in 0 days instead of 0 - this resulted_in me having to go to my local dj store and buy the things i orderd so i could have them - it '_s a minor moan but it just annoyed me but other than that i have always had super quick amazing service from the website
M	got one .
F	!
F	the only down_side is the scissors are rubber and floppy so i coted these in silver foil tape ( my husband does air_conditioning and uses this however you can get it at b_& q ), after that they were stiff and really looked the part !.
M	i ordered at around 00am , and it was in my hands by noon the next_day ( free delivery too )!
M	since then i '_ve contacted a local domestic_appliance repair man who came round to assess the dishwasher on a saturday and will be able to do the repair on a tuesday_evening when he '_s received the part .
F	the case is great for carrying it around and the product perfect for what we use it for ( exhibitions and smaller scale events ).
M	mixed feeling here .
M	phone has now run out of batteries .
F	this is not the way to run an on - line business successfully .
M	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
F	expensive , and some poor quality .
M	i '_ve not used them since .
F	this product especially my cat just loves it .
M	this was not what we expected from the smartest and best hire company on the island
M	bestilte_en dyr buket til udbringelse på_en arbejdsplads før kl 00 .
M	one order , an item was seriously damaged in transport ( not their fault ) and was promptly replaced without_any cost to me .
F	thank_you , hello_canvas !
M	fortunately had steam account so knew procedure
M	i made that mistake … twice .
F	good with delivery except for wrong items sent .
M	ordered an invisibleshield for my ipod 0g .
M	on day 00 the kennel was finally collected .
F	items were received very quickly but as i ordered over_£_00 worth of goods they said on the website they would need a signature on delivery but when i arrived home from work £_00 worth of goods had been left in a box on my doorstep !
F	the flowers were delivered one day late , today noon .
M	funny that .
F	would definitely use them again .
M	well_done jk and interlink_express .
M	the staff i have met have been good and helpful and i value the insurance part of the deal .
F	it also said they had tried to deliver it at 0am on the day it did arrive - this was not correct .
M	i need ultra_thin_lenses , which are about £_00 at glasses_direct compared to £_000 + (!!)
M	great experience doing_business with the cyclestore .
M	great , efficient and speedy service from this supplements site .
M	the staff were very helpful but i would have expected the delivery charge to have been wavered once they realised they had taken almost a month to deliver the worktop .
M	we have booked for next march - thbooking experience was fine but i did then mail to add bed_linen and towels to our order but hvehad no response .
F	fortunately they didn_'_t but hey . shame on you royal_mail !
F	in the end i opened a paypal_dispute to get my money back , and although i did eventually get a refund , they deducted money for restocking .
M	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something else .
F	waited_until monday still not recieved called back on monday to be told the money would be in my account by 0pm that night it wasnt called tuesday again told i was the next in the que to be paid and it will be in my account by 0pm still not recieved called today and demanded i speak to the manager , at 00 . 00 i was advised he will call back within 00mins - called back at 00 . 00 to be advised the manager was on his lunch and will call me at 0 ; 00 , he still hadnt called me back at 0 . 00pm so i called again id been left a message on my phone whilst i was waiting for them to call me and it was a rather blazay " sorry for the confusion " the money will be in your account by the 00th_july for 0 what confusion ?
M	it wasn_'_t ready , in fact it was still up on a lift with both front_wheels off .
M	also the drains backed_up most days and so you had to run the taps on all wash basins for 0 minutes to clear the smell for an_hour or two .
F	but i had the bed now phew i was not letting go .
F	i had posted a review for a company i '_ve been using for quite some time .
F	great !
F	really clever_idea to supply quotes quickly and simply .
F	and i would prefer to receive payment via bank_transfer .
F	however on my secound purchase i was charged 0 . 00 delivery charge and had to wait nearly a week for it to arrive which i thought was really poor as i could have bought it somewhere_else for cheaper .
F	items arrived staff very helpful great site thanks :_o_)
M	however a new one was posted asap , and i would definitely recomment the company to other people
F	the package provided is a good safety_net to keep an eye on clients and potential_clients .
M	i received the item 0 days_later .
F	we also heard the details of the electrical problem ( a fire the previous evening due to water leaking onto a circuit board , lots of smoke , passengers sleeping in the cinema !)
M	i am happy that quality control spotted the mistake but i should have been informed not left_wondering where my order was .
M	the person_who delivers them , puts them on the door_step .
F	i purchased a pair of bogs ranchers as a present for my boyfriend .
F	very happy with the products although the free t - shirt looks like it is for a woman rather_than a man .
M	thanks !
F	no_problems at all !
M	i wont get the item ?
F	would deffo use again .
F	disgusting .
F	i ordered it for next_day delivery then got a phone_call to say it would be 0_days , instead it took several phone_calls and a further 0_weeks to get the product .
F	and thank_you for being so nice in resolving confusion_over my order duplication .
M	to sum it up , pt offer a budget service , competent prices and uk_based customer_care , but lack of attention to detail and difficulties of logistics may leave you with a sigh of dissatisfaction .
M	always great prices , cheaper_than other services that i could use for my sales .
M	the next_day i put them on and within two hours i began to have headache .
M	worst customer service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
F	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening .
F	the service from the rental_car company was fine .
M	they are thieves ( of time ) and grubby to deal with .
M	my wife_loved them and it was so easy
F	that '_s the least they could do as i only got 00_% !!!!!
M	as its been the longest i have to ever wait for an order , and in which the seller has made no effort to contact , call , email , etc regarding why the order has not been delivered or why there is a such a big delay !!
F	i '_ve ordered from the chocolate_trading co . twice_now and am impressed with the quality of service i have received .
M	the glasses i received were terrible , the lens popped out after a week , they never fitted in the frame properly and the screw fell out a week_later .
M	?
F	overall an amazing result , i will be using the service again .
M	great interface for sending prescription over the net , paypal and fast deivery all add up to a brilliant service .
F	i would highly_recommend hamonds .
F	delivery was fast .
F	the website was easy to use but would not accept the addition of a message when i went back to add it and so the recipient hadn_'_t a clue who had sent them !
F	we ordered several pieces of the bevel range and did not pay for express delivery but the items came within a couple of days .
M	first_class service .
M	their isa pays less_than my savings account .
M	the review system is useless - will not let you give a bad review for those that deserve it - what is the point if all you can do is give a good one ?.
F	really happy and will definitely use again and recommend to a friend .
M	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
F	very unhappy
M	the service i have received from printerland has_been first_class , the sales staff are very helpful and very well informed .
F	paperwork should be clear about this including reminders of what to bring .
M	as quick as i wanted it , it was here and in use - what more can any musician want - thank_you reidy_'_s .
M	***************************************************************************
M	as per tel con this item is nothing like the photo !
F	i do think this is a great service but it is frustrating when so many books are not accepted .
F	can '_t complain_about the price of the arran jumper i bought for my husband , but the website said that it was 000_% wool and the label in the jumper says 00_% wool 00_% nylon .
M	it '_s a shame that the reception experience is not more friendly and welcoming .
F	i love happy_puzzle products but their communication about delays in despatch needs to be improved .
M	kept in the loop , delivered promptly and flowers were perfect !
M	very happy !
F	thank_you :)
F	brought several items from agrento online .
F	excellent !
F	when i returned less_than 00_hrs_later , all prices had been changed and my basket selection price also increased from £_000 to £_000 !
M	tradeinn customer service
F	thank_you for a hassle and stress_free experience .
F	within two_days i received a small box to place my used phone in with a postage paid bag to post it onto orange , it took two_days for them to email me with their final offer , once i accepted their offer it then only took two_days for payment to reach me .
M	go into store and you are faced with lazy children .
M	at the airport i was charged for the seats & advised i had only submitted a request for seats & had not actually paid for / booked .
F	my only , tiny , complaint is that i do wonder_if it really needed quite so much packaging ?
F	very efficient service , flowers beautiful
F	the chocolates were not delivered and i '_m being told by customer_services that they were free and subject to availability .
M	however some of the packaging has_been loose and caused damage to some of the products .
M	a pleasure to deal with .
M	thank_you for all your help !
F	i gave them to them on his_birthday and yes , you guessed it . they were absolutely massive !!
M	definitely bookmarked for my future needs - well_done exceptional - av !
F	no customer service number available to call .
M	so i had to drive the 0 . 0 hours to there delivery ware_house to collect it .
M	was we '_ll informed right from placing the order .
F	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
F	however returns mean an unacceptably_long wait and no immediate_confirmation of receipt so only 0_* because of that .
M	such a small thing betrayed my experience , especially when it feels_like one ear should be an inch lower and when i wear them i spend half of my time trying to bend them back .
F	hate hate hate it player , a complete_waste of time .
F	i spoke to the main driver who was so apologetic and he wrote on the delivery slip that the other person had dropped the item .
F	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
M	the product was perfect and as_described , what you would expect from north_face , however the delivery from parcelforce was poor , as the company sent it on a 00 hour delivery , i ordered on a wednesday and it arrived on monday !
F	most notably this particular consultant scheduled to call and check i was still happy with the service after i had purchased the product .
M	griptape had been worn or scraped in some places and i could tell was old or not stored properly as the glue did not stick very well at all .
M	luckily the table eventually arrived at 00 : 00 , 0 hours late .
F	at_least hold us at the bottom and let us go all the way up to the flat deck in one movement , then at the other end , we had to wait over an_hour after the boat docked to get disembarked .
M	emma was mostly polite - and said they were too_busy to answer the phone .
M	super quick delivery well_packed no need to iron and luckily
F	i was texted ( and emailed ) with a delivery date , which i was able to change very simply by text , and was then given an_hour_slot on the day itself via_text and email .
M	cue anticipation on her_face .
F	my oh dropped me off at a course in london and had to speed home on the friday because i received a text stating delivery would be friday between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 .
M	about a week_later my father got a partial_refund of £_000 . 00 .
F	very disappointing
M	we bought a camera from pixmania .
F	i believe it was delivered on 0th .
M	the process was superb .
F	ordered variety of diy products as have mobility_problems on line .
M	too many competitors for you to do what you have done .
M	do i have to go out side the uk to get this sorted come on evans_cycles what are you doing ?
M	0 .
F	newer have any similar experence with extra other tranfection for postage .
F	i would deffinetly recommend this company to others and will certainly be using it again .
F	i am not very techy and found the package easy to use with lots of choice .
F	very good would recommend to all .
M	having received notification today from dpd the tyres have been delivered i contacted **** to arrange fitting but they confirmed they have not received the tyres .
F	they didn_'_t respond to any of my emails , and it took several_attempts to get to speak to someone_who would do anything .
M	drink_shop certainly has an_enormous_range of products but i wouldn_'_t know if the aquavit i bought via amazon was particularly cheap .
F	i love the selection of clothes offered by little_sunflowers , especially the bob and blossom age t - shirts which are very high_quality and make a wonderful birthday_gift !!
F	when i said this the lady said but £_00 is cheap for delivery and you would get a quicker delivery within a 0 hour_slot , which is what happened anyway without paying and on the day she said .
M	i contacted customer_services who were really unfriendly about the whole situation .
F	i have been using viovet for several months now and cannot_fault the service at all .
F	all worked smoothly .
M	mazuma don_'_t always come top for big payouts , but they are one of only a handful of companies i ' d trust .
F	the service was the best we have had in years from any company .
F	thankfully there was no hurry to get this item but i am surprised i was not kept_informed about the long wait and given an opportunity to cancel the order .
M	product as_descibed and excellent quality , delivered very quickly .
M	i strongly_recommend not to touch evans website with a barge_pole for any high value purchases .
F	consistently making me change a password ( don_'_t know why ) but think it is because whoever reads my emails can '_t actually be bothered to get past the first line .
M	these places have nearly made me lose the will to live !
M	i want 00_euros refunding for the ¼ tank of fuel i was unable to use .
F	on the monday at 00am nothing had arrived so i called citylink and was on hold for 00_minutes before being told that the package would definitely be delivered to me that day and that the driver would call me 00_minutes before delivery .
M	luckily it was send as tracked item .
M	the selection available is excellent .
F	if you have any domain that is of any value to you ( i . e .
F	so i had to call and hold the line for a while which cost me money .
M	when you order a sink then you expect the sales_person would ensure that all items to produce a fully_functional sink are included .
M	i found a fantastic deals on grohe taps , saving a lot of money , and i was very pleasantly_surprised by the free next_day delivery .
M	- ordered 0 june
M	on a plus note , when i spoke to wineware they sent replacements .
F	would recommend .
F	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they don_’_t want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
F	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty '_s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
F	the flowers arrived at almost 0 . 0pm and were disgusting .
F	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’_t have happened .
F	they arrived in perfect_condition .
F	still no acknowledgment .
F	i don_'_t think i would use dfds for a mini_cruise again .
M	could recomend them as a first_class company to do_business with very quick and efficient .
M	fa ntastic service and quick delivery .
M	in retrospect it was not even to be necessary to disconnect the keyboard ( thankyou , whoever posted that video ).
F	i actively avoid suppliers now who use hermes which is a shame as this includes companies such as house of fraser
F	unfortunately , the delivery was a bit of a trauma .
M	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
F	fantastic !
F	as i had not received a dispatch_notice , as stated in the invoice i sent an_email requesting an update i emailed the company .
F	the product i ordered unfortunately didn_'_t arrive next_day deliver as i paid_extra 0_* i will be requiring a refund 0_*.
F	i asked for some samples , payed the 00 hr delivery . it '_s been a week . i still don_'_t have anything .
F	surfdome always has great stock at good prices , the website is easy to use and with only a phone_call away you have access to their great customer service team who can help you out if needed !
M	thanks for telling_me .
M	this is a good service , much_better_than butler fuels who could not be_bothered to call me back so lost the business .
M	the prices are competitive , in fact excellent .
F	have just called again to be told that they dispute it '_s flat_pack and that i need to supply photographic proof !!
F	i called their expensive telephone_number and was on hold for around 00_minutes .
F	not so hot .
F	ordered , paid and received an invoice receipt .
M	could of done with a little more padding , in my opinion .
F	the items are looking great .
M	after losing more than 000 . 000_pounds over the last 0 years ( including my home ) with william_hill , which ruined my whole life , i had my account closed under the responsible gambling act , william_hill assuring me they would do there upmost to prevent me gambling with them again ( 0 months_ago ) .
M	the whole image on reflection is of a " flash " marketing operation buying in volume from india and china !
F	don_'_t shop there anymore
F	brilliant in store , knowledgeable but un - pushy .
M	i told them to stick the order as i was so irate .
M	i must_admit to have been worried_about not hearing_anything about the dispatch of my order and it took them 00_hours to respond ( which they do state as being their target ).
M	it was suggested by the ccl tech that i try a new power_lead , keyboard and mouse to rule out any other cause of fault .
F	the site was user_friendly and extremely easy to complete with step by step instructions .
M	in essence their statement is accept the defects or shop somewhere_else .
F	now i have has my voucher reactivated but to be honest the stuff looks rubbish and i am struggling to spend it .
F	guys who came were quick as it was their last job of the day and they only lived down the road .
F	i will_definately use this company again .
M	did what it says on the tin !
M	i liked the idea that a single_rose would be presented in a nice red gift box , however when delivered it didn_'_t arrive in the gift box that had originally caught my eye .
F	i had to call the recipient to check she actually received them , and she said they were accepted at the door by her son .
M	i was put on hold for 00_minutes , then she came back and told me she was escalating the problem and would phone me back within 0 hour .
M	the speed of processing my sale and delivery of the payment into my account was first_class
M	very simply , yes .
M	this company sucks - as most of the reviews on here imply .
F	the flowers are lovely and good value but information given to aid tracking of delivery was hopeless and could only email to get information - please make_sure the tracking_reference is very clear for people as waiting for an answer to emails is pointless .
M	these_people had to re - enter the building , but were only told this after queueing for 00_minutes .
M	by far the cheapest cable company i can find .
F	it was not clear when ordering that i had to specify this .
M	so would highly_recommend .
F	avoid this company at all costs !!!
M	when you get there usually quick , on occasion checking in can take over 00mins .
F	i have the reference_number , what do you think , would that be enough .
F	will_definately use again .
F	customer service is not what i would expect from an internet company , nor is it like others that i have dealt_with .
M	i have ordered sets of radiator_valves on two_seperate_occasions and have been highly delighted with both the quality and price of the items .
F	there '_s a bit of velcro used on the costume which unavoidably catches the sleeves so has ruined the material and i '_ve not even worn it to my party yet .
F	excellent efficacy service , highly_recommend
F	i have since sent about 0 or 0 emails to customer service and not had one reply .
M	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
M	i often send drinks as birthday_presents and the drink_shop is always where i go .
F	i phoned the company and they said they would email a claim_form but i need the tiles to put on the wall .
F	i booked it for 0 nights !
F	i '_d be more than happy to use mazuma again .
M	i was then informed they were waiting for a delivery .
M	a judgement was made against them by the judge for the full_amount and now after the period for reasonable payment expires tomorrow i am forced to go and get the judgement enforced and the courts will recover the money on my behalf from them .
M	the floor is looking really good and will look even better when the job is complete .
M	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won_'_t be back not to be trusted !
F	we would definitely recommend formal_tailor to you .
M	vive le juno .
F	stay away from lambda - tek .
F	i purchased the gift_vouchers and they firstly arrived late but this was the fault of royal_mail .
M	this is faulty from new .
M	secondly before entering a claim they expect to see a proof of purchase receipt with vat number and imei_number ( neither are quoted on my final details for order ).
M	june_00th : " we promise you '_ll be paid ."
F	reliable ( based on several orders ).
F	i have spent £_00 and got nothing for it - really knocked my trust in this company .
F	i write this so others are careful when ordering from wowcher that delivery charges may apply from the vendors they use .
M	very good value for money .
F	it '_s the 00th_dec and i still_haven_'_t received my order and the online tracking_system says they still don_'_t have it in their stock yet .
F	after phoning bank three_times and travelup twice , the bank eventually said an_hour later that it hadn_'_t gone_through so had to to do it again and this time it went through .
F	good products and prices , just a shame about the service .
F	i have dealt_with natures_best for many_years and will_continue to do so as they provide an excellent service at a good price .
M	ordered pedro '_s bike cleaner one day the next_day it was here , great service , what more can you ask .
F	!
F	?
F	good and clear website .
M	we received his medication within days and we now have a very happy doberman .
M	that to me is not acceptable in today '_s online world .
F	after i ordered ( over_£_000 order with free delivery ) i was told that if i wanted my order delivered to northern_ireland i had to pay an extra £_00 or else cancel order .
M	however it left us with a frustrating start to our holiday , and it was only as we had stayed at the hotel many_times before that we were able to still partake of half board dinner after the restaurant had closed .
M	mini speaker and usb 0 card not fitted to one motherboard just left in the packaging .
M	then i found mail order trees .
F	took payment and order on tuesday , called them on the wednesday to explain that i needed the gift to be delivered before the friday of that week as this was a business address and there would be no one to sign for it after .
F	easy website to use and great same day service .
M	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
M	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
M	surely they can '_t be that cheap as to warrant loosing business . you are as good as your weakest point .
F	there were no sharp objects to cause this hole in the box as i checked it myself .
F	an on - line chat the following_day identified a failure tof the florist o correcly deliver the order .
F	couldn_'_t ask for more -- would definitely use again and recommend highly to others .
F	would highly_recommend this company and will absolutely be using again !
M	i would definitely recommend
F	many_thanks ,
M	what do you do ??
M	on returnto our vehicle after our holiday we discovered an extra seventy four miles on the clock . we will not use this company again .
F	but i am a size 00 and they are incredibly difficult to get on and off - i '_m a woman and basically there '_s no room for boobs at all !
F	i tried the website again and the delivery was changed for week 0 without informing_me !
M	this is an ok cashback site but payout and customer service can be slow sometimes .
M	do i want to insure the product for £_00 / year for ever ?
F	it simply would not charge .
F	i ordered two canvas bags and a mug .
M	they weren_'_t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
F	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0_days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
M	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
F	the three zips are very annoying , it '_s very time_consuming to get coat on and off .
F	he had however started up two more companies mk exhibition and movey ( a video - making business ) and he also runs a company called salesmanaged in milton_keynes .
M	had to buy a new valve stem and reassemble the sensor myself .
F	however , the young_lady i spoke to couldn_'_t have been more helpful , even phoning the courier to try and halt the delivery .
M	item arrived inside of 00_hours , and is a quality bit of kit .
M	i will not hsitate to recommend you to friends and family .
M	you kindly gave_me the tracking_number of the package ; i checked on parcelforce '_s site ; it said they tried to deliver seven_days previously and ' advised ' us to pick_up at a depot .
F	emails_confirming every_stage of the order regarding delivery was clear and smooth .
M	i do not think this gave adequate_protection , considering that two of the kit components are liquids .
F	delivery was free to me as i spent more than £_00 and delivery service used was fast and efficient .
F	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
F	with overnight delivery , they could have got another watch to me and in time . they chose not to so .
F	ordered on the tuesday_evening and delivered on the thursday by a very helpful driver .
F	the box it came in was also too deep and with so little packaging it '_s a wonder it arrived intact .
M	i will_certainly use them again .
M	the key had not been cut so was of no use to me .
M	the slate_house name received this week was as good as we had hoped , the white word depth was better and deeper than_expected .
M	you live and learn !
M	the cost of postage was excessive for a light product
M	no goods , no response from the company after 0 email .
F	my order arrived compleat and with a quick delivery .
M	there was a lack of urgency by the desk staff ' processing the paperwork , the main_priority was obviously to sell upgrades , not to reduce the ever_increasing queue .
M	there i find out the model is discontinued and i '_ll get a refund , wtf ?
F	spread the word , these companies should not be allowed to get away with it .
F	need to change your post services rather_than let your customers down .
F	i treated_myself to the bird box camera having found spycamera to be the cheapest .
F	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
F	they should really alter the collar so it has a piece of stiff plastic or wire inside as this helps make the outfit .
M	i am a regular customer on bulkpowders .
F	thank_you !
M	on top of all that , the flowers arrived perfectly on time and looked wonderful .
F	when i contacted customer_services , they were great , apologised and assured me that they would contact the manufacturer , who would send the ' missing ' item directly .
F	bathrooms in need of modernisation , a lot of mould and lime scale could do with a good clean !
M	tyres were fitted quickly and no_problems .
F	but dissapointed that order was not right .
M	the only time i have had them seem eager to communicate is whrn they want to sell more product at which point they are very persistent .
M	i would rate the products that this compay offers as " excellent ".
F	i trust this site and i have never been disappointed .
F	i was called by every company who wanted me to detail my items before giving me a quote .
M	was promised delivery within 0 days but the helmet arrived in 0 .
F	it worked_fine with the kodaks .
M	there is no out of hours support_team which means after 00 : 00 you just can '_t get any help .
F	easy to place order online .
M	very nice lady rang and apologised for lack of stock , was given options for stock items but decided to wait for the order placed .
F	i was worried once i purchased my item that i hadn_'_t ordered from a secure site as my confirmation_email didn_'_t arrive straight_away .
M	so i called orange ( 00p_each call to customer service !
F	couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	other than that , it is a solid social_networking site .
M	they did not have any in stock that my son liked so gave_me a full_refund .
F	great service really pleasently_surprised !!
F	after several phone_calls and emails asking to change the address , the flowers ended_up arriving where i didnt want them to go .
F	have a dog with a squeaky tummy , this is brilliant stuff and delivered super_fast by vetimed - what would i do without it and them !
F	couldn_'_t buy this mattress in the shops as it was i available to order so was so relieved to find it here !
F	in the meantime the male assistant next to her processed two customers .
M	i ordered the latest item , a slimline dishwasher late evening & it was delivered [ by ao . com '_s own drivers / vehicle ] the following afternoon , free of charge .
M	been meaning to get in touch as i was distraught at having to wait so long for my supplements due to the incompetence of your delivery service .
M	delivery badly_let them , down i had to wait three_days for delivery after been told it would be with me before 0pm on each day
M	recommend
M	they do not respond to emails , letter , text , calls , etc .
M	i have almost 0 , 000 , so i ’ ve got a head start !
M	i have had so many issues , and have found their support to be absolutely_terrible .
F	they said same thing !
F	.' in this case i personally phoned the florist to get an exact stem price breakdown and the value is in fact correct , the large lilies are an expensive stem and she advises that the bouquet will look more impressive once they have opened .'
M	other items had to be sourced from their shops rather_than from central stock , so there was a delay before those were sent .
M	their emails automatically go into spam - a problem , i subsequently found out , they are aware of .
M	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
M	the damage was slight and they ststed they would crdit my account with £_00 . 00 which was geatly received and they said they would send a £_00 polish kit to polish the indent / scratch - i received a repair kit : now looking for a craftmans !
F	i placed an order for several items in one delivery .
F	!
M	very good service i have use envirofone before very quick send your cheque .
F	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
F	but im_sorry to say i am not very happy .
M	i have been useing this company for the past 0 years , i have not had 0 problem , took a parcel to the post_office , the other day , and they wanted £_00 0st_class , came back home booked a courier on here , and it cost £ 0 . 00 will use these all the time .
M	i had originaly entered the wrong details in the online order form but an email quickly had the problem resolved .
M	i booked for the next_day first ferry and secured the normal price .
M	the flight was very good once i managed to get on it .
F	particularly impressed by how up to date we were kept in status of order and delivery details .
F	my outfit came within a matter if days and is of a really good quality
M	):
F	would recommend the website to anyone .
F	she promised me faithfully that she would deal with my order personally and would be in touch today to give me a delivery date .
F	however when looking on the website i was still able to add the same pair of shoes to my basket and given the option to pay for them when they were apparently out of stock .
M	i found the service easy , straight_forward and very professional and at the fraction of the cost of a high_street agent .
M	however , given the advancements of technology , it '_s hard to be aware of all the changes happening in cars .
F	our booking indicated arriving on the 00th of may to pick_up car at 00 . 00_hours .
M	for information , i used to work for this company and they have their good points but i left of my own_accord for a reason .
M	it was not delivered on first request .
F	i ordered a furry covered night light for my grandson .
F	response from michelle in customer_care team advising that she would check with dispatch team and get back to me .
M	so i went to the shop on 0nd_april_0000 and asked for my refund , he called westfield security and had me removed from the shop .
M	i probably_won_'_t stop until i '_m dead !
F	i do expect to pay for return postage , but this amount is excessive .
F	there is no phone contact listed !
M	very disappointing .
F	now if only i could change a tyre .
M	by the time we got to desk , they had to upgraded us from ka to focus , as had run out of cars .
M	eco tire disposal =£ 0 . 00
M	leaving us £_00 out of pocket .
F	pleased with product i bought and the delivery experience was excellent .
M	is .
F	it was exposed at the front of the house .
M	the tracker number doesn_'_t work though and according to some none royal_mail link on the wiggle dispatch email , my item should have arrived today .
M	i would certainly recommend simply_scuba to any one
M	why why , we all need free money but don_'_t buy what you don_'_t need
F	order is always correct and would recommend the site to a friend .
F	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible .
F	in the end i had to have a refund .
F	these have eventually arrived !
M	after about 00_minutes he finally but reluctantly apologised and gave_me a 00_%_discount off the further work .
M	so_far so good .
F	i explained that this should be available to the customer if requested so she then stated she would ask her manager .
F	i called customer service to amend my order five_minutes after_placing it .
M	we feel that the service was excellent and the policy provides us with all our requirements at a very good price .
M	i use tyre_shopper regularly because we have four cars in the family .
M	what more could anyone want ?
M	when i asked to check again as the replacement hadn_'_t been received i was told that in fact the item hadn_'_t been shipped , will not be shipped as it '_s out of stock and i will be receiving a refund for this item .
F	then transferred from one department to another .
M	know of several people who had to change companies due to the lack of signal
F	worst customer service ever , they say they have no idea or a system regarding their back orders , but they are quick enough to debit my card shocking !!!!
M	only able to comment on clarity of website , ease of use to set_up policy and speed and efficiency of response from questor .
F	i sent the company detailed emails of what i was looking for , spreadsheets with the individual names and sizes on the personalised t - shirts etc etc .
M	expected the delivery in about five working_days and it turned - up the next_day !
M	please bring back the old downloadable_software .
F	easy shopping_experience .
F	you should give directions from venice and a local map with suggested transport connections .
M	the package arrived alot quicker_than expect .
M	i highly_recommend this company .
F	both packages posted at the same time , but mm acknowledged_receipt almost a week after the other site .
M	everything was rushed and they seemed as though they couldn_'_t wait to get out .
M	both the o0 store and o0 online have very good deals with extremely competitive_prices .
F	i have two jobs to try and make ends_meet .
F	do not use this site !
F	they look nothing like the picture displayed on the website , my mum has a keen interest in flowers and was upset on how they looked when they were delivered .
M	excellent service online , fast delivery ; would highly_recommend juno to anyone looking to purchase vinyl and dj_equipment .
M	i would much prefer to do_business with a company like this than a giant global entity that you cannot talk to - yes , i '_m looking at you , amazon !
F	curt with no sign of respect .
M	as simple as that !
F	it was not .
F	not sure whose fault this was but after switching to npower through_topcashback at the beginning of nov_0000 , i '_ve only just received my cash !
F	i have been using pet_prescription for just over a year as l have a dog who has diabetes they are a lot_cheaper_than the vet l use , l place an order every_month for about £_000 recently they decided that they were going to change the delivery system .
M	my wife is overjoyed that i picked the right size , along with loving the black dress too .
F	loved the products but difficult to sort returns , not easy to exchange when required this lets the company down would not suggest you buy from procook if you are not fully sure what you want !
F	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
F	after trying other_sites with selling my mobile to be very disappointed and given excuses for various made up reasons for offering me less money than offered in the first place , i nearly gave up .
F	i was so surprised when i received my parcel only 00days later , better_than some uk delivery services !
F	0000_euro is a lot of money to block off on ones credit_card ( especially before a holiday !).
M	in leaving only one star in no way reflects on the delivery drivers .
M	on the good side they have just about everything you would require in stock .
M	brilliant , well_done go_electrical
M	part of the order came promptly .
F	fabulous food , sharon '_s caribbean deliver straight to my desk at work , if i close my eyes and take a bite i '_m immediately transported to the sunshine !
F	!
F	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
M	the local fitting service was fast .
M	i chose to have a blank pc with no os as i had some spare windows 0 pro licenses .
F	the goods arrived promptly with no_problems with delivery .
F	an update to the review i left last_week .
M	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia_airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
F	i have no idea where but i do know it doesn_'_t have a " secure " area .
F	other than that the items were correct and a good price .
M	0st time user - hopeless
F	however i don_'_t feel that i was very well informed and had i known it would have taken so long i think i may have just paid for postage !
F	i loved that they had an amazing range of styles to choose from .
F	i saved a good amount of money due to the lower prices , no tax , and free shipping .
M	lastly , we think it '_s a bit unfair to wait_until checkout to tell us that there is a charge for using a credit_card - maybe that could be made clear earlier on .
M	when i went to login , the website kept bouncing me out .
F	will be definitely ordering again from this company .
F	without going into too much detail i had a pretty bad_experience with an individual who worked at this company , however , the owner who is a very understanding and pleasant lady got in touch with me and put things right thankfully .
F	come possano lavorare in queste condizioni ?
F	however looking at other_sites . mine was overpriced .
M	the delivery was late that '_s all .
F	do not go to orange !
F	been here since sun and tombola was joined but stayed with tombola .
M	again thank_you '.
F	some make you post your prescription resulting in a significant time delay .
F	good quality goods always exceeds_expectations
M	wondering_if i will see my canvas at all now .
F	having used appliances_online before , i knew_exactly where to go for what i wanted .
M	since i would soon be travelling_abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest mistake .
F	i wanted to purchase a barbour_jacket for my husband but was unsure of sizing & style .
M	first and last time i will go there only sent me part order a gift for a friend who was leaving for canada so no time to return > went on facebook to complain and they said they would look in to it and thats the last i heard they never even offered to send the belt which was short on the order .
F	i felt they were more intrested in the money they could make .
M	thanks
M	what world are some of these_people living in ?
M	stopped using them for food - only prescriptions now .
F	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
F	i am very happy with the new sign that we have on the house .
F	the products i ordered - pagan bodywash , pagan perfume and perfume bodyspray arrived in good time , but the perfume bottle was not full .
F	despite paying for next_day delivery
F	thanks
F	let_down by mobile tyre_fitting unit and the follow on customer service was totally_unacceptable .
F	the osmo wash and care was brilliant , cleaned and brightened my floor in no time .
F	our sofa was in the country living range and the salesman assured us that this sofa would not be in the sale as sales only applied to the regular ranges .
M	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
M	!.
M	first time i '_ve_used them , but i won_'_t hesitate to use them again .
M	overall , good product and buying but not good at sorting_out issues and after sales service .
M	the laptops might look the same as you buy elsewhere but inside they are built with substandard parts .
M	no idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn_'_t that long to wait . had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
F	i ordered 000 cotton bags for our elm sapling giveaway and they are terrific - value and quality .
F	good web_site and range of products ( not just pine furniture ) - shame no capability to ammend orders on website as customer serivce is terrible .
F	there was no element of hard selling .
M	bought the new makita dk00000 impact / drill driver kit .
M	the room - everything in it was cheap - reasonable condition but furnished from the pound shop , net_curtains on a wire - the old thick grey looking type and only just covered the width - no gather so it looked like an old factory window .
M	well what can i say apart_from thank_you .
M	would not recommend this company to a friend . they sent faulty goods to me after i had paid up front in advance . express delivery through royal_mail special delivery has now waisted my money as the goods received were faulty and could not be used when i wanted to use them . felt as if i was not believed when i said the goods were faulty to customer_services . i want a refund and compensation , very poor 0_star_rating is too good .
F	i had the full works including varifocals and transitions for an exceptional price .
F	no proof that this is indeed the case .
F	the chap that came was a bit gruff but other than that .
F	i would definitely recommend philip and his services to family and friends .
M	i ordered the pro0go duo bars , and the new pro0go cookies !
M	anyway , tried to arrange delivery but they failed to deliver on agreed day .
M	goods were of a high_quality , delivered fast and packaged well .
M	lots of calls still not sorted .
M	absolutely discussing .
M	when i am looking for dental products i know i can easily check out dentocare '_s website , navigate to what products i am looking for , place the order quickly and expectr it with a few_days .
F	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
F	they should only take your money after order has_been processed and confirmed .
M	i ended_up ringing them 0 days_later and they rectified the problem while i was on the phone .
M	when i eventually contacted the live support after several hours messing_around they were pretty rude and tried to insist that i changed every_single email password on every device i had .
F	i didn_'_t have to do anything_else myself except fill in part of a form & sign a couple of things .
F	my father - in - law drove the 00 miles dutifully to make the collection on my specified date to be met with some rather unhelpful staff .

F	good quality and design .
M	there '_s many contributing factors why this just doesn_'_t work for puspose of home delivery .
F	i called back first thing monday and again i was told there was no one that could help me and to call back the following_day .
F	the following_day , the dilivery i '_d had confirmed was not delivered to my friend and the friend who '_s order couldn_'_t be processed received two bouquets !
F	other than that , they send you all the paperwork and the rest was easy
M	i called the restaurant and they had no idea i had made an order .
M	i should add that they apologised , were polite and did not ignore my emails .
M	at 0 . 00pm i phoned to ask what was happening as no one had telephoned me .
M	good service and order was well_packed .
F	as a service you delivered exactly_what u promised with no_hassle . so thank_you .
F	why couldn_'_t she action it from my phone_call ?
F	!
M	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
M	we were made to queue outside the check - in portacabin in the rain with no cover over us .

M	i followed up with a second e_- mail saying i wasn_'_t happy with their response .
F	i ordered a t shirt , which was exactly the same as i bought previously from yourselves in the cheshire_oaks outlet centre , the quality was great , however even_though reference and sizes on both t shirts were the same , the one i ordered from you was far smaller , and did not fit .

F	they made me feel_valued as a customer and communication is spot_on .
F	items were in stock , dispatched immediately and arrived the next_day .

M	0 you could have damaged it .
M	on hold for over 00_minutes , with some additional waiting while the operator attempted to find out what was happening .
F	very please with the product and service .
F	didn_'_t know you could get personalised_wrapping_paper and from google_search dom and geri looked the most fun and professional .
M	it arrived on time and was exactly as i had expected and the perfect size .
M	i bought perfum for part of my wifes christmas . was ordered and paid for on the net in the comfort of my own home . it arrived within four days and was surprised the delivery was so quick being so close to christmas . would definately_use cheap_smells again .
F	my order arrived incredibly quickly and i was delighted with the product .
M	guess watch , was available in stock which wasn_'_t available widely .
F	total disappointment .
M	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
M	- you pay in advance rather once they '_ve been fitted , which means you can '_t change your mind .
F	and my customer has no evidence that i '_ve even tried to send it .
M	i am soooooooo angry and frustrated with this entire situation and that it is still not resolved .
M	if you want a deluxe_bouquet that is worth the money , go to marks &_spencer !
F	i have used p0u on and off for several_years and have always been impressed by the wide_range of products and fast delivery .
F	).
F	it was the first time i had hired a car and was a bit_nervous but rachel made everything so easy and answered all our questions .
M	i ordered product that took over a monthy to arrive , had it said out of stock in the first place i wouldn_'_t have ordered it .
F	they claimed they ask to note things like birthdays but this is not signalled during the order process , its buried in the fine print somewhere .
M	i telephoned again after they put me on anti - biotics for 0 months .
F	i wouldn_'_t of know normally but i was there when they were delivered .
F	very satisfied with both the products and the service received .
M	they sorted_out my * problem * quickly and politely and therefore , professionally .
M	is this correct ?
M	the money hasn_'_t arrived today so i '_m guessing it will be monday at the earliest now .
F	it '_s exactly_what you read on the tin !
M	i explained the situation to the manager and she blatantly refused to refund my money citing a refund from another store would affect their store figures and for me to travel all the way back to the brixton branch to get my money back .
M	i found dealing_with your company and the supplying of the tyre '_s great .
F	this item is very small in size and weight .
F	the manufacturer confirmed there was no water_damage at all .
M	!
F	so much so i plan to order more .
M	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0_weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
M	i needed a us itunes voucher to purchase a documentary for a university project that isn_'_t available in my country yet .
F	i cannot_believe_how terrible their service is , i really can '_t .
F	and i always dress to impress
M	having said that cho seem to be taking over the rm williams space ( i am a fan ).
M	we are now planning our next trip and intend to use tickettree .
F	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i sent an_email to see when my purchase would turn_up and did get a prompt response to say would be early next week .
F	please make these changes to your fees .
M	at the test they readjusted the frame and i was told to wear them for two_weeks and then go back .
M	no problem we thought ., we submitted the review for evaluation and explained that we do not sell that product and suggested the above scenario .
F	the book has the potential to be lovely but the quality of the images was very poor for some reason .
F	the ordering process was easy on - line , but there was no after care service via_e_- mail .
F	i shall wait a bit longer to see if they break any more , before_deciding_whether i should have chosen stainless_steel instead .
M	the customer service agent assured my wife on the day that she " would remain in the office until the package was collected ."
M	sadly since last_year the depot equipment has_been changed so you could no_longer fit the lwb van in as they did last_year .
M	when i attempted to cancel they first offered my a different bike which was of slightly_higher retail price but worse spec .
F	envirophone was a fast , efficient and easy service to use .
M	having read the reviews it was obvious that it would need a little patience and two of us to assemble them .
M	you '_ll find prices are very hard to beat & delivery is quick .
F	i did not realise i was actually buying a secondhand part .
M	they were not touched as job after job was done before mine .
F	tesco was a lot_cheaper !
M	contacted aquatics_online who advised some items out of stock but would be in the day after then would be shipped .
M	never known anything like it in 00 years of online shopping !
F	it was delivered broken .
F	!
F	all as promised with good service and communication
F	when ordering the flowers i was given the opportunity to select the delivery day so as the person i was sending the flowers to works part time i chose a day hat i knew she would be home , however they were sent 0 working day before this .
F	i can '_t be certain that i didnt key it in wrongly when ordering but i '_m fairly sure i didnt so it was a bit embarrassing for me with the recipient .
M	i used to make a diary entry to make a call at_least once every 0 months so i could keep the number active .
F	excellent service - lights exactly as_described and delivered quickly .
F	east to use web_site .
F	even_though i am covered i bet again i don_'_t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member . if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
M	i booked with alpharooms , made payment successfully through their website and received an invoice and voucher from them by email .
M	i shall_certainly be back for more goods in the future !
F	late to meet and late to greet !
F	we would certainly use it again if we needed .
M	to much hassle to send back and ask for replacement .
F	i didn_'_t pay for delivery but even if i had delivery would still be a week .
M	i wanted good advice on running_shoes and i got it + great prices .
M	great website and cool costumes .
M	which is a big_improvement from 00 meg by default .
M	its not so good
M	it '_s just a shame that how it is packaged means that it '_s completely creased when you open it out .
F	will be recommending to anyone and everyone .
F	since then , i have emailed at_least 0 times a day to try and find out how i can receive it .
F	there were very little flowers in the bunch
F	i recommend this company to all my friends .
F	i rang them after receipt of the invoice showing a telephone_number .
M	other times you get a quick and easy service .
M	i find that slightly over - eager .
F	all details including a schedule of our 0 flights , two hotels , excusion and bus pass were emailed through within the hour .
F	this company cost me time and money and i would not recommend their services to anyone .
M	when i phoned back the obstreperous customer service woman wasn_'_t remotely interested despite my being a regular customer .
F	very good service and competitive price .
F	otherwise , i would look for another , more friendly alternative .
F	i would definitely buy furniture from them again and be able to recommend them .
F	i thought i had ordered a footstool to go with but seems i didn_'_t .
M	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her_face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
F	got my postage package on friday .
F	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
F	that was exactly_what mazuma had promised .
F	dispatched the same day as ordered .
M	inept incompetent and edging on highway robbery .
F	good product , resonable price .
F	we employed a cleaner for about six_weeks and everything seemed to be going well .
M	well a tale of two properties here .
F	i booked through this site before viewing others and sadly i paid more but transaction went_smoothly .
F	i don_'_t understand_why a book with professional photos and not our own came out not as well .
M	difficulty with administration .
M	i called on friday and was told that it would be sent out immediately .
F	doesn_'_t bode well if you are listed on page 00 !
F	so beware , they only seem to publish good reviews .
M	my wife was given an unwanted upgrade by orange .
F	however , i then realised i had to pay to insure my phone in the post , which cost me £ 0 . 00 .
F	very cross customer !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	so i am left , after nearly 0_weeks , with no product , no idea when ( or even if ) i will get it , and no response from the company to my request for a refund .
M	no need to go_anywhere_else mate . top quality , low_prices and , they even sent 0 blokes to unload it . oh , and it couldn_'_t be simpler to order . what more can you ask for ?
M	surely it should not be that difficult ?
F	utter_rubbish , on my credit_card statement
M	ouch !
F	i have returned the jacket to you because it was not the kind of material or style i desired .
M	?
M	paid with paypal so i didn_'_t even need to look at my card and the part arrived the following_morning .
M	instead , a clear statement that " all you could do was send out a new one ".
M	why pay for over the top subscriptions at your local_store when you can have cheap top quality lenses delivered to your door .
M	full_marks .
M	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
F	i would recommend to anyone and everyone best straighteners around :) very happy customer
M	note : this is an edited review based on recent contact with glasses_direct .
M	does anyone have any help they can give me , what to do next .
M	would certainly recommend and use again .
F	smooth_transaction very fast despite_being new year thanq
M	great service nice product
F	order and delivery process was good , the only down_side was having to pay for delivery and returns and the upfront £ 0 . 00 discounted returns_label .
F	new keys received promptly , well_packaged .
F	great service and recipient was delighted with the bouquet of flowers .
F	why would this need to be done ?
M	solution - find a company that gives across border tracking
M	it proved so_far as we could see the best deal , so we went with them ( though i still resented having to pay premium rates for four long calls to an 0000 and an 0000 telephone_number : nothing prevents them from using an 00 or 00 number , after all – there '_s a whiff of ryanair about it ).
M	easy website to navigate to where you need to be and simple to order . goods received next_day .
F	only company that replied to origional search for car in nz .
F	they stole our money .
F	to say i am pissed_off would be an understantment .
M	i calmly explained to the call operator the history of my enquiry as she said that the £_000 . 00 included discount !
M	used the mobile service .
M	my boy has_gone to college in usa and has tried to notify talkmobile that he wished to cancel monthly_contract on numerous_occasions through their internal web email .
F	just waiting for discount wednesday !
M	this back and forth , plus the time they took to respond to a couple of questions i had , added nearly a week to the lead time on my order .
M	they may not turn out to be what you expect .
F	the majority were lovely but for the price i paid , i would expect all of the flowers to at_least be alive !
M	fast dispatch , good communication in different formats plus great variety of products
M	the website is simple to follow and the delivery times are super quick .
F	it '_s not good enough to say ' we don_'_t have directions ' - quote from your sales_team .
M	unfortunately the boots when they were arrived were scratched , and the leather on one boot wrinkled , as if someone had worn it and walked about in it .
F	i used that at work only , so it was not a constant use thing .
M	i saw a pair of raybans whilst on holiday in canada , and wanted to but them , but they were very expensive so i thought i would wait and see if i could_find them on the internet .
F	liked the price so ordered .
M	only got two replies for a list of common parts for a common vehicle .
M	i even got failed delivery messages to some emails .
M	my ' next_day delivery ' order still has not arrived ( 0 week_later ).
F	but within 0 minutes of my purchase was playing the game .
F	its ended_up costing me more to get them fixed .
M	will order from here again .
M	and the doorstep is approx 0 metres away from the road and anybody could have taken them .
F	hi
M	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
M	my first and last order with animed .
M	booked in for mot and service , attracted_by competitive price .
M	i was emailed after delivery to ensure there were no_problems .
M	would definitely use chameleons again and would recommend to anyone .
M	the constant aim to use the fuel one has already paid for is neither very relaxing nor is it environmentally_friendly ( one ends up driving around just to burn fuel ).
M	la verdad contento , ya que estuve buscando dicha correa por un buen tiempo hasta que llegue a bablas .
F	when i complained the company made an excuse that the flowers had been damage in transit and also stated that there was only minimal signs of any damage .
M	thank_you again
F	got it ordered to my work as i wouldnt be at home .
F	ordered a gerbera bouquet on 0th_feb for delivery on 0th_feb .
F	just a shame with the delivery letting it down .
M	we now ask every online seller we buy from who they use for deliveries .
M	they had a good range of costumes , all reasonably_priced .
M	i received very good email communication and the watch was delivered exactly as promised / described .
M	0_weeks_later and after a number of telephone and e_mail chasers i still had not received my new specs and so cancelled the order and requested a refund .
F	i was told when they were sent and when they were delivered , which was good .
M	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
M	best price on the internet , also included a free_gift of some gardening gloves and delivered promptly .
F	i would rather pay a delivery charge and get good service than get free delivery , you really do get what you pay for !
M	i definitely reccomend buying from cartridge_shop , they are far cheaper_than anywhere_else i could_find but the quality of the ink is great .
M	will_definitely use them again .
F	don_'_t expect to speak to a manager or anyone in authority it won_'_t happen !
M	marinestores mooring ring plate was thicker ( chunky ) and the other was thin and had defects from the casting mould !
M	however , there is still no sign of my glasses .
F	!
M	it was marked ' despatched ' so that '_s how i knew that it was on the way .
M	she won_'_t for much longer as she was silly enough to take their lower level wallet card so she could top up on the run .
F	i checked , no email had ever been received , not even in my junk email folder .
F	for £_000 . 00 in total , the service was not great .
M	got email from shipping agent on wednesday saying they were out for delivery then !!!
F	they did refund the postage but looks like i might need a full_refund as prom is in a couple of days :(
M	if we had to collect the wax from the store you should have given it to us when we paid for the furniture .
M	and 0 item has missing parts ,
M	really good service .
M	the trouble is you get a card from the hermes collector with a tracking_number which is never ever valid i then have to go to interparcel usualy by phone to get info very very annoying !!!!!!
M	we have to travel 00 miles to get here but well_worth it .
M	delivery was scheduled for friday 00th_march as agreed .
F	it was returned to them and received on 00st_july and since then nothing .
F	i hate to be guilt tripped into the extra £_00 needed for courier .
F	!
M	i got my screen within a few_days of ordering and the quality is really good , i am very pleased with the overall product and will order more from ballicom in the future .
M	if you ' re thinking of shopping here i fully recommend it , one of the best online services you '_ll get .
F	very quick and very good service would recommend to others to use
F	they were needed for a school_play , i needed them for a jellyfish costume .
F	the checking in at the palace
M	my partner wanted to take ( adult ) tap lessons with this ' studio '.
F	poor service
M	their communication is absolutely atrocious . the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact_numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up .
F	i used to use them every time but not any more . so very disappointed with the after sales service levels
F	i tried to contact the office but as it was a friday and gone 00 : 00 the office was closed .
M	no apology for the poor service
M	this resulted_in me filling the car instead ot returning it half full .
F	good products , and good service .
M	i am unsure if this company / site is a scam or just really rubbish , either way i would suggest all to avoid from my own experience .
M	was horrified to see on the website rrp £_000 down to £_000 saving of £_00 .
M	! a lie .
F	very reliable speedy service , would defiantly use them again , live my specs
M	!
M	i paid the additional_cost for a before 0pm delivery .
F	it did feel a little as they had the money so my purchase will arrive when it arrives .
M	great service next_day delivery as promised .
F	she told me not to accept the goods even if they did arrive , then i would be reimbursed as soon as they received the shipment back at the depot .
M	the furniture was offloaded , the bill paid and kevin duly parted on his long journey to essex .
F	he stood very close to me in my front_door way , despite lots of room for him to stand back , and he made it perfectly clear to me he would not listen to a single thing i had to say .
F	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
F	i sent an_email to customer_services , who responded that day with an_apology and explanation that they had been out of stock ( perhaps their stock control system could do with some attention ?).
F	i would definately recommend them to anyone .
M	they also lost my original prescription .
F	this very one defeats the entire purpose of customers paying extra for flowers and extra for delivery cost on special_occasions such as mother '_s day when the flowers you order for your special ones do not get delivered till past that date .
F	the instructions suggest that i should have also received some fitments to hold the cover for the top of the blind and i was certainly going to need to fit the cover to hide the worn looking brackets .
M	great service , fast payment .
F	we were disappointed absence of possibility to reduce the payment sum in case of return the car earlier per one day , and we paid already for two_weeks of rent .
F	! maybe bank_holiday delay ?
M	i found them on the internet and the web_sight was very easy to use .
M	despite eventually giving in to the pressure and paying an additional £_00 for what i thought was adequate cover , i had to provide a card upon_arrival against which they froze £ 0000 which they would have used in the event of an accident on thr basis that i could claim back any monies taken from the £_00 policy minus fees and expenses , etc .
F	within a few hours we had a response from plo and within 00_hours had been contaced directly by the manufacturer who apologised_profusely for the faults and asked that we supply our address and contact details so replacement_parts could be sent to us asap .
M	rang amazon , they were very apologetic , rang dpd as i waited on the line , turns_out they '_ve lost the parcel : i mean how does this happen !
M	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !
M	i ended_up ordering a new pair with a partial_refund for the frames and paying the cost of the lenses again .
M	first_class service and would use them again without_hesitation .
M	very reliable and efficient service on - line and over the ' phone .
F	i would recommend this company and would use them again .
F	he is fourteen so ordered the adult size so he will be able to use it again and again if he wants too .
F	the info on the costumes was helpful and i got exactly_what i thought i was getting .
F	quick payout .
M	i am about to make a complaint to paypal .
F	the service was really great and the communication on the day was fantastic .
M	when i set_up my broadband account at my new address 00 months_ago , i told bt that i would use my old netgear_router so there was no for them to send one to me .
M	still no contact from betterbathrooms still_waiting for items .
F	i ordered on line and was given the collect in store option .
F	ordered tickets in februaruy to see pink in hannover on the 0th_may .
F	!
F	they keep saying they don_'_t have stock and will be in touch when they do .
M	ordered washing_machine which looked a good deal was given delivery date all was fine partner had day of work to wait for delivery loosing a days pay but our washing_machine was broken so had to be done .
F	the service was great and concept brilliant .
M	but then it all went down_hill .
M	good thing is that the customer service are polite and looks_like trying to help but the servers are too slow with many outages and especially when i need to login to domain control_panel the cloudnext system is not working .
F	face to face discussions are far easier to handle than telephone_conversations . when i did get the paperwork it was quite difficult to understand and after_reading through it i did not think that it had been explained to me in sufficient detail . as stated previously i am satisfied with the outcome but i just hope that harrington_brooks staff remember that they are communicating with a real_person not just a phone number
M	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
M	00 days_later they now do no answer their phone and do not respond to emails .
M	i had already decided to purchase the guitar and the only thing that would have put me off was damage or poor playability - neither of which this guitar had .
M	i was fed_up with the usual spring type mattresses that you can buy as , after a very short time , they would end up with hollows where you laid and become quite uncomfortable .
M	additionally the technical_information with each item describes exactly_what it is capable of .
F	i created a photobook with cewe_photoworld .
F	a real_gem of a site , with such helpful advice .
M	overall very pleased .
M	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
F	despite_emailing customer_services several_times to query it - i received only automated_replies saying id be contacted within 0_days .
M	that was on 00th_april .
M	they charged me £_000 + to cancel .
M	it would have been much more efficient and cheaper for a very small item to be sent by post .
F	update - thanks valerie for speedy reply to trust_pilot review - pink bean_bag has now arrived , still_awaiting one red beanbag if you can give me any further info on that one it would be much_appreciated .
F	not good enough !
F	did their managers not come into work ?
F	the manager came to sort_out and said she had to back up her staff ??
M	so this is for the assistant_manager at wythenshawe post_office :
M	mike oneill
F	i bought redken anti snap from this website , the product wasn_'_t genuine and did nothing for my hair in fact made made hair so frizzy as though i '_ve_used no leave in condition .
M	the customer_support line were very helpful and arranged for the order to be cancelled and a refund to our account .
M	product choice and quality is excellent and i can recommend bestbathrooms without_hesitation to all looking for good quality at a good price .
F	so now thanks to just eat i '_ve got money i can '_t spend until the bank release it maybe 00 working_days_later and no food , but i guess that '_s ok because " on behalf of just - eat we apologies for the inconvenience that this has caused you ."
F	good size and manufacture but the wheels make a terrible noise when being pulled along a pavement
M	communication with natural ground was more than excellent .
F	add an extra £ 0 . 00 to deliver to inverness , which is mainland_scotland , no need !
F	i saw this jacket before christmas but it was just too pricey .
F	i regret to say i wasn_'_t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
F	!
M	open late so can get in to get tyres done
M	can '_t fault that for service .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending this service .
M	that was a no - no so the booking was cancelled again .
M	i have been using maximuscle for a while now , it '_s a good product but will be looking elsewhere for a similar product at a better price .
F	they just got the job_done and were gone .
M	i ordered a pair of reading_specs and sent in an old pair for repair .
F	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
F	it was only by_chance that someone was at home that day otherwise i would have had to drive 00 miles to my nearest sorting_office to pick it up .
M	i do not think good value for money consideing i paid extra for delivery on top .
F	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
M	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
F	delivery excellent , friendly and helpful , great service , definitely will be ordering again ,
F	customer service provided me with the tracking_number for royal_mail so apparently the goods have been sent , but neither rm nor my country '_s postal service has any record of it .
F	?
F	the online service is great , very efficient .
M	a little_bit disappointed in quality to be honest but it is acceptable as a gift .
M	this is the first place i look when i need to get a battery , and can '_t remember ever having to look_elsewhere ( except to confirm that i couldn_'_t get it cheaper !
M	brilliant service - cannot_fault it
M	trash staff that know nothing but seem to think they do .
M	we saw a bargain for a pair of black boots .
M	they swapped the guitar with a perfect one and collected the dog within 0 days .
F	the card itself is a let_down , bigger on the front than the back and the colours are wishy_washy , its not as nice as on the website .
M	could tell the item wasn_'_t looked after or cared for .
M	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
M	i got my costume in time !
F	to be fair to animed i have to say that the support_team have been helpful and in the end i know it will be sorted_out and therefore just for the support_team i am still happy to give three stars .
F	one product i purchased did not arrive in a good state and not as advertised on the site , so i had a refund .
F	they had my product sent out promptly and buybox was a great alternative to shipping to my house , especially as i work all day so wouldn_'_t be home to answer the door .
M	if you ' re looking for these products , then parmacy0u is pharmacy0u .
M	sometimes the room selections in hotels offer meals etc .
F	i had to phone the office yesterday as wanted to cancel the insurance due to the non response to my emails and non receipt of my insurance_policy that had been paid for .
F	also very very quick delivery !
M	i cannot_believe these blinds didn_'_t come with screws or raw_plugs !!!
F	this company is " perfect " for anything you need to know about any holidays that are of interest to you . it gives you the rating of all hotels available & places to go .
M	inflexible attitude
F	very poor 00 hour express delivery service from parcelforce though - rugs were ordered & collected from rug_house on tuesday 00nd_april & finally arrived on monday 00th_april .
M	always helpful always there when you need them but charge a bit too much to advertise products
F	!
M	i was greeted_by a very polite and knowledgeable individual and my order went through and was delivered in perfect_condition in double quick time .
F	so rather_than use their 00p a minute number , i used a uk number ( 00000_000000 ) supplied by their customer_services department .
F	nu har_jeg sendt det retur med deres egen returlabel , men har intet hørt fra der , det_er 0 dage side .
F	so not a bad firm , but please use a different delivery system !
F	would be better if it offered a courier service - or just royal_mail - as its competitors do .
M	we are very pleased with the noise_cancelling headphone .
M	the biggest choice of tyres that i '_ve seen anywhere and at cheaper prices than my local_dealers .
M	the service is excellent ,. thank_you
M	customer service and delivery on par with this .
M	got 0 canvases made up , gave them to my sister who had no wall space , and the next_day they were on her wall .
F	a small neat pram , very well
F	after the first booking didnt work , i tried again this time paying a €_00 deposit and this was acccepted and confirmed .
M	although we weren_'_t happy about it we understood the reasons_why they have that clause .
M	beware .
F	copy & paste not possible , which is a pain
M	we trust those who collate the order to be expert st ensuring the order is complete as such items do not register on the non - professional .
M	it arrived 0 days_later but the package_containing the screws was missing .
M	guess who i will be sending my next phone to ?
F	obtuse and repetitive , bordering on the rude .
F	i was unlucky and had a problem with the phone so went to the store and encountered a very rude customer assistant who didn_'_t want to do anything .
M	set_up fairly easy but wanted to pay by debit_card which was refused as was the first credit_card i tried to pay with the second credit_card was accepted .
M	i received my item as soon as the post would allow .
F	and they look and feel very christmassy .
F	couldn_'_t compain at the service .
M	can definitely recommend though for great product selection .
M	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
F	they didn_'_t sparkle , was just like a coloured glow on the end of the stick !
F	i came off the phone after 00_mins of my time feeling i had inconvenienced them . i hope they sort this to my satisfaction quickly so they can redeem_themselves .
F	i went to pay and found that i could use paypal which is very convenient .
F	wanted to refund instead of supplying the goods which does not help me as a customer when i required the goods i ordered .
F	linda
M	i only went to halfords out of a sense of brand loyalty having previously bought a full set of tyres , discs and pads .
M	today i have received a further letter from the debt_agency advising they have been instructed by o0 to continue to pursue the debt - this in simple terms is harassment , as i owe them nothing and don_'_t even have a contract with them anymore .
M	the frames are trendy and the lenses made to prescription .
M	the range of products available is excellent and the price is really competitive .
F	normally jessops is very reliable .
F	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
F	secondly - to advertise a free product - then stick two fingers up at customers and laugh at them - for believing a product is free .?
F	the invites were good quality , although a couple did have slight marks on them , and i also thought they came with a boarder on them ( not sure if that was my mistake or theirs ).
M	i shall order elsewhere in future , get the game early and save the £ 0 - 0 difference .
F	and at that rate it didn_'_t look like that would happen , so i cancelled my order after finding the same kit at argos ( for £_00 more ) but i trusted them and they delivered it in 0_days so i had it for my holiday .
M	i ordered shy under £_000 of items during the winter sale , some multiple items in a range of sizes for my girlfriend to try on .
F	i did that & couldn_'_t_believe the range available .
M	every time !
M	i will be returning for a refund and taking my business elsewhere in future .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending this service to any of my family and friends .
F	this cost less_than i '_d seen it anywhere_else so although i expected the quality to be alright i didn_'_t expect it to be as good as it is .
M	just a quick search on forums shows many unhappy people in my situation being ignored .
M	i have definitely been duped out of my £_00 and have contacted trading_standards / consumer direct to look into this shady group .
F	they emailed me when the flowers were dispatched and again when they had arrived .
F	we had to ring trading_standards to get advice and confirmation that we were in our rights , which we were , there was a website error .
M	when i got there the man on the back desk was extremely unhelpful and disinterested i asked to take a look at the laptop he got it out and then processed a buy back leaving me stood there for around 00_minutes .
M	i would not use watchfinder again as i have a feeling that they sold me a dud .
M	my purchase was made during the afternoon and my batteries arrived first thing the following_day , excellent .
F	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
M	unfortunately the £ 0 voucher , which expired on the 00st_october , arrived with the parcel on the 0th_november .
F	i can_honestly_say that i did not think i would be able to afford a new computer after losing my late beloved partner , but gimmitech and paybreak made this all possible for me for which i am truly_grateful .
M	the real problem is that tyreshopper don_'_t manage the whole_process .
M	would use again .
M	arrived at the centre and as if by incompetant magic , they said they didn_'_t have an appointment for me .
M	after all this , they should be paying us as compensation for all the time wasted and stress caused due to one person on november 0rd 0000 inputting our meter_reading wrong .
F	she said i would be contacted by the payment team and they would need bank details to set_up a direct_debit .
F	prices not too bad , website easy enough to use and follow .
F	just a few sticks disappointment !
F	well_done it makes a refreshing_change to receive excellent service .
F	i was told that i should have contacted them before ringing for a lock smith .
M	i informed rodger that if he was unable to assist me then customer_services would , ( at that moment i noticed that the shiny badge was beginning to lose some its shine )
M	however , i was slightly dismayed to find that they were not as i perceived the strips to be !
F	it also took npower from november to february this year to switch so i suspect the fault lies with them .
M	my ring still didn_'_t arrive , and when i went to the store few_days ago to check upon it '_s status again , the lady told me she cannot help me as the ring wasn_'_t dispatched by supplier and she didn_'_t know when will it be delivered .
M	third lie .
M	0_weeks since the blade broke .
M	i cancelled it within 0 mins of placing it , then ordered the correct items on a seperate order only later to be told the order had already been processed and could not be cancelled ( why not ?
M	i did come_back put my card in and away i went but i was worried
F	it took almost 0 whole hour to finalize the changes and extra_charges !!!!
M	i '_ve been to the isle of man many a time before and thought if this is ferrying then you can keep it , but this crossing was super smooth and peaceful .
M	my partner will not be doing adult tap with the south_london dance studios
M	having had the morning off work , driving 0 miles to derby and waiting around for some time while national_tyres sorted_out what had happened to my order i felt that to cut my losses i ' d have the alternative tyres_fitted but felt conned and unhappy .
M	i am already searching watchfinder for my next watch , and hope to be in contact with cherise shortly .
F	the duvet_cover which i have purchased was excellent .
F	i also found that the second strap on the leg comes off ( if you want it to - not recommended ).
M	its not always the case to expect quality service from a supplier , although we should expect it , these_guys simply do without_question , order , delivery and follow_up , would reccoment them to anyone !
F	on monday 0th_december i received conflicting emails from parcel0go , one asking me to submit a claim because the dolls_house may be lost / damaged ( didnt say which ) and one saying the dolls_house should be on its way !
M	kept up to date with order and when being delivered .
F	scam !!!
M	the sales_person was very pushy to the point of rudeness which i did not like and has put me off this company .
F	i would certainly highly_recommend using this company .
M	do you not think lots of your items are brought as presents , there go all the xmas_present surprises in our house .
M	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
M	car possibly about 0 years old and no instruction book which would have been of use .
M	the branch claimed it was nothing to do with them , the only ' fit what is on the shelf ' and don_'_t think to check that they have what they need .
M	i love looking around poundland but sometimes wonder about the sources of their merchandice .
F	the goods arrived quickly and were well_packaged .
M	my first pair ordered some 0 - 0 years_ago have been excellent vallue and reliable .
M	love this site . get all my golf_equipment there :) golfbase . co . uk rocks :)
F	would highly_recommend both the product and dottyhippo to everyone .
M	shelby :
F	i ordered a nest of tables and was called within a couple of days of ordering to ask if i wanted an earlier date which was brilliant .
F	i traveled back from france to dover in october .
M	i guess there is always a trade - off between simplicity of the user_interface and flexibility allowed , and i '_ll watch the development of ( and continue to use ) this site in the future .
M	good quality for price you pay .
F	on return we were 00_minutes late being collected from hotel .
F	ordered 0 items from the company .
M	very happy with overall experience
F	i was on hold for 00_min and then they hung_up on me .
M	it did take a while to flatten the packaging and to dispose of it !
M	having_spoken to talk_talk about the fact that the resetting of the broadband line had not solved a connection problem we had with the modem provided by talk_talk some two years previously and which now was not able to be reset by the manufacturer but had to be reset by talk_talk as per the manufacturers instructions broadband , it was evident that the only solution was to leave talk_talk and try another_provider .
M	nearly everything arrived when they said it would but the very small error with a couple of items was resolved by very helpful customer service staff and missing items were received the next_day .
F	so i took it to another garage and had the shock absorbers replaced this other garage informed me that i had a bent back axle ( which national had not found on their mot ) i then took it back to national to have the retest .
F	one of the few suppliers i could find that would offer this removal / recycling service albeit for an additional small_fee but well_worth it to someone without their own transport !
M	she was very happy
M	not the best of service , and nervous when sending money .
M	on the front should have been the rear .
M	no_complaints at all , the goods are excellent , the price was and the delivery made as_described !!
M	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three_times with no answer .
M	if only all internet_shopping was this easy !
F	the delivery was very good especially_considering the distance it had to come .
M	one small problem quickly dealt witth .
M	this meant i had to wait for another 00 days before i could get the piece of equipment for which i had paid .
M	great online buying experience
M	however , i was soon put at ease by the professionalism of the customer service and attention to detail .
F	the problem was not just that he didn_'_t want to give me the money back for the error but also that he was so very rude .
F	my first order with inkstation was a dream not only were the prices the best i '_d seen but what really sold me was the express delivery as i live in remote australia i got my first order within 0 - 0_days .
F	0 +++++!
F	so overall lovely product and i would use the company again but i '_ll be moving the furniture myself thanks !
M	the climbing shoe_size matching tool worked_perfectly .
M	they ignore emails , do not answer phones .
M	i would recommend mega_fancy_dress to anybody .
F	never ever again .
M	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude . to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
F	this is not customer service only exhibited by large retailers , and it is worth_investing in if you want return custom .
F	told only bed mattress had arrived at delivery depot and base was still at distribution depot .
M	internet is shait keeps going off it takes them 0 f_** king weeks to send an engineer over avoid this rubbish company also the phone does work bad work no one should use this company
M	i didn_'_t order an on switch either but it came with one anyway .
M	very happy with service , would highly_recommend
M	this is very easy to do , with items from amazon themselves looking aesthetically identical to their affiliate counterparts .
F	we finally got to speak to someone on wednesday 00st_july after holding for another 00_mins .
F	the order number in the text didn_'_t match anything i had .
M	a very quick service .
M	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
M	absolutely recommended .
F	i agreed to this .
F	the sales_person was brilliant .
M	i complained to resorthoppa '_s customer_services a couple of weeks ' ago , however , i am waiting for their response - i won_'_t hold my breath .!
F	very disappointing .
M	as we fly from stansted fairly regularly we will_continue to use looking0parking and would have no_hesitation in recommending to a friend .
M	now have to waste a days holiday from work to accept delivery next week , providing of course they notify_me when they intend to deliver .
M	i chased mid week as i hadn_'_t received a despatch email confirmation , lady on the phone was reasonably helpful .
F	when it did arrive the dog_biscuits were broken and the bag of dog_food had been opened and resealed with tape and the food scoop was missing out of the bag .
F	i know i only paid for standard delivery , but i was hoping they would get there a bit quicker .
F	i got there in the end but it was a bit of a hassle , customer service were reasonable good although if i hadn_'_t have rung to check the first time i may have wasted a day '_s holiday sitting at home for a parcel that was never going to arrive .
M	firstly i found the website difficult to understand .
F	i '_ve_used serenata before and was impressed with the quality and speed of delivery , this order was just as good .
F	their service was excellent , their prices good and i would have no_hesitation in recommending them .
M	was told someone would be in touch but nobody contacted me and i had to call their 0000 phone number after 0_weeks of silence to be told nobody would even come out to look at sofa for 0_weeks .
M	the first time i have is err d the service , the webdite is easy to use , the wishlist works great and payment is very easy .
F	a fantastic night !!.
M	they have always been great until my last purchase .
F	they expected further stock but weren_'_t able to advise an exact date .
M	sunglasses - shop . co . uk sends regular_emails about fabulous deals - that i usually ignore .
M	did we receive this call ?
M	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
M	i am so shocked at how bad this company is .
M	this product is the best on the market .
M	customer_services , based abroad , are absolutely_shocking .
M	i knew what i wanted and found it quickly .
M	very fast service , 0nd time i '_ve sold a phone to them , second time they have beaten anyones prices , ( including vodafone ).
M	!
F	thank_you
M	i will always go to your site first and the last deliveries i have been happy with but please be aware of those bothersome enquiries .
M	scam site !
F	i placed an order total value £_000 . 00on 0 september , received 0 of 0 products on 00 september - all good ; but still_awaiting rest of order and receive random email advice of delay for just one of the items only ?!

F	thank_you for providing a good quality package including all what i asked for .
F	outstanding company .
M	be honest and state it on the front page by the clock , which is the bit everyone sees .

F	i had great difficulty_finding a particular light_bulb , and even tough i took the old bulb with me was miss - advised in two high_street diy_stores .
F	i ordered 0 port sipper glasses from the site for a christmas_present for my partner .
M	the reviews are then submitted for " moderation ".
M	they owe me !
F	we were kept_informed of order progress by email and space heater arrived several days earlier_than we thought when we ordered .
M	i also noted that prints are definitely not given any prominence on their site , which begs the question of why they are the only printer accessible direct from pe00 ?
M	the worktop recieved was once a nice piece of timber , but the delivery company must have been idiots .
M	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
F	no printable e_- tickets for the gig i am going to and my name put on a list of attendees .
M	the price was exceptionally reasonable and i was kept regularly_updated on the progress of the delivery by text and e_mail .
F	can i have my perfume please !!!!!!
F	they offered a refund which did not materialise .
M	one improvement would be to have a login account service that remembered your details so that the next time you book you can use default details that saves time and effort .
F	do not purchase from this company .
M	first_class service , orders posted same day and nver any muck ups .
M	my victoria_plumb shower_door was there without rollers .
F	i have been using simply_supplements for a few_years_now and have always been treated well and my last order was just the same it arrived just a few_days after i placed my order and received another free gift .

F	doubt if i '_ll use pet_supermarket again .
M	third year with multitrip .

M	i emailled mega_fancy_dress who asked me to phone them .
M	i found a place online where i could buy a quality mattress , at a very good price !
M	when your package will arrive i take my hat off to these_guys five_star the best

F	i ordered a basket of freesias for my brother in laws funeral flowers .
M	please see attached refund receipt to show refund has_been processed :
M	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
M	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn_'_t even been collected yet , it '_s been a tracking error ".
M	the flowers you delivers were not only tatty but some were actually missing !
M	so i was forced to call the 00000000000 number .
M	they turned_up to install a yale system which turned_out to be inappropiate to fit and their advice was to add more which would cost me another £_000 approx .
M	same as above
M	got the prices quoted .
M	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
F	fast , efficient , friendly service .
F	the upshot of this round of them talk talking at me was that i would have to cancel the contract & set_up a new one .

M	i '_ve been shopping at aria . co . uk for about 0 or 0 years_now , buying various parts for my computers , and those of my family and friends .
F	at this point , i realised that i was getting no - where , and that the excellent service i received from parcelhero last_week was obviously a blip !
M	the costumes were ok . quality a left a bit to be desired as did the actual manufacture quality .
M	completely_satisfied with the service i '_ve received .
M	there was little wow_factor .
M	it seems to me at_least that 0 , 0 and 0_star reviews are never published , if this were true they would be deceiving the customer who believes their review will be published but will not .
F	i '_ve_used offtek for years , and they '_ve always delivered ( literally ).
F	however failed to follow the instructions and the item ended_up being sent to billing_address .
M	i could not order by eur size , and after looking at this and other_sites which compared uk and eur sizes , decided it was 00 . 0 / 00 .
M	i now have gone to consumer direct , will take to court next if need be .
M	we all make_mistakes and i made a mistake by sending an unedited print to pixum for printing .
M	then when my guitar was meant to come all the accessories came but no one told me i would have to wait another day for my guitar and when i called i felt the person was clueless to where and when my guitar was actually coming .
F	but i was very disappointed with the product i bought .
F	!
M	that '_s all i want .
M	excellent service in locating parts and then providing cost comparison !
F	when my order was delivered more than 0_weeks_later ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ), only 0 items were inside the parcel with no invoice or a note or anything suggesting a split delivery .
F	i was told not to worry , they would sort it for me .
F	wont_be using you again !
M	i sent golf_support an email regarding the free delivery that was offered on their website if you purchased adidas adizero 00 golf_shoes which was never answered !

F	i contacted eflorist who told me they would get back to me and yet i have not received a call .

F	basic info !
F	the company would not agree to a full_refund and payment for the return postage .
F	no sales_pitch , no security questions , just straight_forward service .
M	i previously recommended this site to friends , but on this evidence base , perhaps i should be telling them to avoid instead .
F	the flowers were fresh and managed to fulfill their purpose to allow the receipiant to know they were being thought of .

M	arrived within 0 mins on drop - off and about 00_mins at pick - up so could hardly have been better - - many_thanks
M	they came back to me very quickly saying the hotel had no rooms for the date i require , although on - line it showed rooms available , jack at tickettree said they could offer another hotel , whilst a little more exspensive , tickettree would cover the difference .
M	thank_you .
F	goods delivered between times stated .
F	very easy to put_together and very comfortable .
M	i will never use this company again , i am not sure why they think anyone would still be at work at 0pm on a friday .
M	well , what can i do to make it work ?
F	i would also have been grateful for some information on the tickets before the actual week of the show as , at one point i doubted whether or not we would receive them .
F	have now done another switch through energy helpline but anticipate that scottish_power will miraculously find my switch request , attempt to switch me and then charge me an exit_fee as cheapest deal for me is now with a different provider .
M	this time i spoke to someone_who was very helpful , she didn_'_t make it seem like i was asking for too much and explained that i could even turn_up at the port with the booking_reference written on the back of my hand and i get on the boat .
F	recently lost all connection to my dedicated server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
M	we got a message from the customer_services team a couple of days_later to say that they were going to give me a full_refund and that has_been done so i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars
F	i went on the internet to sell my mobile because i was getting an upgrade , i entered my mobile details in to a few sites but the envirofone web_site was the best price .
M	the customer service team at avis / budget were still too_busy dealing_with post rental enquiries so i was passed off to the admin team who did not contact me for another week and then did not know what my original enquiry was about so they guessed and gave_me a telephone_number to call and also suggested i ask for a discount !
M	he told me i would be better off cancelling my order as he was not sure when they would be able to dispatch the canon_lens i ordered .
F	when we finalised our booking we found out that meals are " not required " though the price was advertised as including meals ???
F	i ordered this voucher for my daughter '_s birthday .
M	i will_certainly be using them again !!!!!

M	i received both_pairs within 0 days and happy with the purchases .
M	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife '_s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
M	i have ordered from cultpens many_times now and the website is very good , never out of stock and orders arrive very quickly , usually with a free pen of some kind !
F	i was very pleased with how quickly a query was answered and the prompt delivery time .
F	i will be keeping an eye on the site though for anymore off the like that appear , as i just love the idea of having longer hair that i can tie up for my holidays .
M	i placed an order on the 00th_nov with fitting for 00th , i was called on the 00th to say that the tyres where not available and they couldn_'_t fit on 00th .
M	frost

F	disagreed with underwriting decision , extra premium for trivial , inactive medical_condition .
M	i will_continue to shop with eb however i am confident i will use other for online purchases .
F	i '_m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn_'_t possible to change the contract that easily .
M	item as_described , not the cheapest i found the product but in stock with next_day delivery .
F	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
M	far too long .
M	i said it will come in the following_day and pay cash .
M	renting a car through ' rentalcars . com ' was easy and convenient , as any internet transactions are , and as this was the first time i ' d done this personally in my own capacity , i was surprised by the following events :
M	the online price was also the best i found on the internet .
M	i applaud the service here because she stayed on the phone until she saw this email arrive and was then able to action it .
F	i am so pleased i can get them on line .
F	website was easy to use and my order arrived very quickly , there was no postage to pay which is a massive_bonus , i '_ll definitely use this site again :-)
M	i have to say from_start to finish this company excels in its service and timing
M	normally i would send back and exchange but i desperately need the clippers for work so do not have the choice to swap as not enough time .
F	they did this again with the replacement tiles and was only pure_luck some one was in .
M	steve barnes

M	return trip not so good , king seaways .
F	i paid the postage .
F	the room was very clean but the general areas were shabby .
M	!
M	flowers were perfect . flowers were left our side as no one was home sad but not their fault .
M	advised when delivery would take place to within_00mins and smiling delivery driver arrived on time .
F	i didn_'_t even need to speak to anyone , everything could be done online .
F	use this service last 0 year and my item got stolen .
M	let_me tell you if you read this beforehand - do not give your phone to them , hopefully they will get shut_down soon as they are a shambles and not honest in any sense of the word .
F	absolutely as promised .
F	nothing was too much_trouble and they were always pleasant .
M	the man i spoke to said he could only look into this if i had my consignment_number ( i find this hard to believe that a delivery company can '_t find you from an address ) but fair_enough , i thought i ' d take number with me to work the next_day .
M	this is not the case , prompt confirmations and fast delivery .
M	i dealt_with sam_beer who who told been he had the ideal watch for me .
M	new packaging but same great results and taste .
M	did not like the idea of pay up front before you receive the goods .

M	the glasses were good value for money and i couldn_'_t find them for the same price elsehwere .
M	no response from the supplier and after two_weeks i decided to chase the order .
M	ordered on 00th_october , now 0rd november .
M	i have used this company on numerous_occasions and they have always given great service and fast delivery ,
M	we had a free upgrade from a fiat_panda to a merc b class which was great , albeit it took a few mins to work out how to start the thing ( no manual in car ).
F	i have to post back to you that trying to find where i leave from in venice for the greek ferry ( anek ) has_been totally problematic .
M	a great product - just what i '_ve been wanting for ages .
M	whilst in barcelona , i had no issues using the card to pay for goods and also to withdraw money from an atm using it .
M	staff a friendly but not very helpfull
M	!
F	then i was told it would be a couple of weeks because the larger_size was out of stock .
F	serenata replaced them as soon as i got in touch with them though , sending a fresh bunch on a day of my choosing .
F	i thought the company was really nice all advisors were nice and well_mannered and very helpful .
M	after about a week one of the two screws which hold the arms in place fell out and disappeared which meant i now had a one - armed pair of specs .
M	i would recommend sticking to your local_florist
F	i needn_'_t have worried - the tickets came ( recorded ) delivery within a few_days and they are genuine tickets .
M	this is a legal_requirement .
F	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard_copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
M	very disappointing .
M	that leaves £_000 for deep_sea_fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
F	parcel_force had left no note in our door but left the boots at the local post_office .
F	i found myself hoovering a lot as i was concerned .
M	all done correctly .
M	i mean , the ordering was easy .
F	does anyone know how to get through to them ?
F	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
M	i spent 00_minutes on the phone for what i considered to be a simple transaction .
F	i placed an order for father '_s day which was advertised all over the website .
F	they have refused to answer my query about a non - delivery of flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday , and when i received one call on 00 / 00 / 00 claiming i would be fully refunded , they have ignored all of my email messages requesting feedback .
M	they could do well by listening to feedback .
M	- i never use any supplier if i know the delivery is by citylink .
M	with no warning , even in the small_print , i found my £_000 voucher was rejected .
F	found this site .
F	it '_s really lovely , but the postage_charges are rather high so it will sadly be a one off purchase .
M	the meat was still really well chilled .
F	i was told that it was the cookies on my computer and i had to redo everything again , including the personalised free card with picture of my aunt .
M	think_twice before buying .
F	about an_hour and a half after they should have left .
F	love the site , prefer it now to shopping on the high_street .
M	ordered a bag which was in stck .
F	i called on monday , 00 june to complain and i was told that this would be chased up immediately .
F	it was £ 0 . 00 and turned_up 0 working_days after the date of purchase .
M	eye_catching too .
M	it is a good place however to meet strange smelly locals if your that way inclind .
F	i found using the website difficult with some fields not working until other parts of information were completed and the order placement did not flow smoothly .
M	the cost was very reasonable compared to competition .
M	without_hesitation we placed an order for 00 and they were delivered ahead of schedule the following week .
F	i wish i had done that before i had any dealings with them .
F	this was a one off occasion and i was pleased to see the show , however the mark - up price made it a very expensive night out especially with all additional_charges and postage .
F	the finished_product looked exactly as it did on the internet and i was really pleased with the quality .
F	well satisfied & will recommend .
M	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
F	i bought a couple of pairs of glasses from glasses_direct , but found that i couldn_'_t see very clearly through them ; while some parts of the lenses gave clear vision , other parts weren_'_t so good , and my vision was a blurry when i moved my head .
F	overall i '_m delighted with the service , and wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them to anyone .
F	great value product and good service happy to recommend .
F	finally got through in the afternoon .
F	tyres were reasonably_priced .
M	it was disappointing that at no stage in this process did i - flower provide any feedback except when chased by us .
M	needed to send flowers internationally for a birthday ; three clicks and done ; excellent service , very please
M	their website was informational and easy to use .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	the instructions for building could be more clear .
F	i have had a few good deals including non surgical face lift and a spray_tan .
F	beware when changing to this company haven_'_t had a bill for 0_months and they want to put my payments up think they bit off more than they can chew
F	found this website via_google , it was quick and easy to use .
M	a delivery card pops through the door ; my wife picks it up , it says that nobody is home , despite both of us being home .
F	i love this shop and buy a lot in - store however , the last three_times i have tried to order online , i have had confirmation of my order and then nothing - no email , no delivery !
F	this guy even played on his own phone under the desk when i was sitting right in front of him and didn_'_t stop until i asked what he thought he was doing .
M	sent a brief email_explaining .
F	well i failed the test after wasting hours of my life , almost every call ending in the talktalk operator saying they will put you through to someone_else and putting you through to the ' customer service ' survey from which there is no escape except to ring back and start the process all over again . so now i '_ve reverted to bt , the price is the same and the service a squillion times better .
F	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
F	did what they say they would .
F	i purchased 0 x 0 hour quad trek with universal paintball and to cut a long_story_short , when we arrived to enjoy our booking , we were told that one of their quad bikes were broken and that they had to cancel our booking .
F	brilliant well envirofone .
F	simply not good enough !
M	( i ' d been burned by another company saying they had it in stock on their website when in fact they didn_'_t ).
M	i got next_day delivery .
M	i needed some body solder bars recently and sent my order into frost in the u . k ., however i was shocked to find the cost of shipping a small package which weighed a few_pounds was so expensive .
F	the two slim boxes would have fitted very easily into a padded_envelope .
F	two text_message no delivery . where is my ottaman bed and memory mattress i ordered from groupon .
F	when we wanted to return something , there were so many penalty / restocking fees it countered the cost of the items strangely .
F	bought the star pendant and chain for my brother , s grand_daughter , she is delighted with it . staff were very helpful when i called for some advice .
M	don_'_t think i '_ll buy glasses from any where else from now on .
F	no card was left in the door to tell me what had happened to my goods .
F	when i explained this i was sent a missing parcel form to send off along with a copy of my id witch i explained i wasn_'_t comfortable sending a copy of my id as my signature had obviously been forged once , after this i heard_nothing back from the company , did not receive my shoes and have lost just over 00 pounds .
M	the product ( bamboo_worktop and accessories ) are excellent , the price unbeatable and their customer service is first_rate !
M	i went off the website and got one that said suitable for a pulse adrenaline .
F	when i prepped my room to hang the blinds they were a massive 0cm out .
F	the service and speed with which the order was handled was second to none , and i won_'_t_hesitate to use them again when the need_arises .
M	but very quick delivery
F	they came the same day to quote and after accepting the quote the work was completed within 00_hours .
M	the cable on the bottom pully on the leg extention slips off if not monitored .
F	on the odd time it has_been answered by a lady_who has told me they have been delayed because of waiting for a hub to come in so the drivers can get out , also they have a backlog and have taken on extra drivers also that the drivers dont answer their phones also promised the items would be delivered .
F	we took_advantage of a brilliant cheap 00 hour return deal to see some of the countryside and beaches near calais .
M	it '_s my first time to send remittance thru you and i would say . will_definitely do it again .
M	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
M	no one contacted me so i contacted ds by phone on 00th_march when a new order was generated with a brief apology .
F	they just didn_'_t want to know .
M	we queued up in the lorry / caravan queue , only to be redirected to the car deck .
M	however , i had a call from tyre_shopper the day before saying that my tyres would delivered to the fitter by 00pm on tuesday .
M	i was disappointed with the engraving carried_out , it looked the actual engraving was fine but the finish looked smeared
F	hen_heaven were easy to use and really good value for the money .
F	clicked on special_offer flower £_00 . 00 did not see the £ 0 . 00 delivery charge also did not
F	i rang swansea on the 00 july was told sorry it will be 0_weeks and yet car_reg told me at_least 0 to 00 days .
F	efficient , professional service offering well priced products .
M	i could have one now and another whenever stock was received but there was no_indication when that might be .
M	i recomend jennings to my friends and family
F	i orered the items i required on tuesday_evening and they arrived on thursday .
F	their strap - line " outstanding service " my recommendations , don_’_t bother with this firm or any of the other names they also trade under on the internet .
M	glad i '_m going with croatia airlines next time as their flights are consistently good .
F	item arrived next_day .
F	the whole order will have to be re ordered from today the 00th of june .
F	go on evrything0pounds make a statement and start a trend :) i dare and challenge you !!
M	00_mins from newbury .
F	i was furious as one day i had the phone and it was completely switched off with the sim removed so there was no way it was used .
M	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .
M	excellent quality of service from this company - i emailed them to give my thanks before i received your request for feedback - i have copied my email below :-
F	they are great and fast when they don_'_t tell u to wait 0_weeks .
F	still no contact so changed my rating , because i am happy with one order does not mean that you can ignore the first order , the vase was delivered broken and your bouquet was appalling
M	they still did not tell me when i can expect delivery .
F	this elicited a swift response , apology and replacement of the faulty part .
M	item ordered was spot on , the price was right .
F	i have written to imperialprice informing them of this , but have had no response .
M	i live very far from my mum , so i ordered flowers to be delivered on sunday .
M	took two_days for it to be dispatched and then 0 days to actually arrive .
F	thank_you
M	better_bathrooms replaced the drawer without_fuss .
F	in future i would go elsewhere and pay more to get a better quality product .
M	got what i wanted at a cheap price , quickly , and wasn_'_t stung with any postage_costs .
F	not happy at all , hoping it will be here tomorrow but i only got an_email yesterday saying it had been dispatched that day on 0nd_class postage im not holding my breath .
M	dont use them if you can help it .
F	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house . ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look into what the hell was going on ) we went 0_months without a phone line but this wasn_'_t the issue .
F	this should have been signalled upfront particularly as i was considering paying more for next_day delivery ( i '_m_glad i didn_'_t as that would have been money wasted ).
F	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .
M	fast email_exchanges from steve , it was done within the hour .
M	the free standard delivery on a £_00 order arrived in 0 days with a 0 hour delivery slot , spot on .
M	in my opinion their deceit is in their advertising which states it gives genuine ratings and reviews , they cover themselves by using carefully chosen statements such as trust ,. a reliable service . safe and transparent .
F	during this time i was unable to even log_into my account .
F	ordered rawandan coffee as had some ground beans rawandan coffee at a small coffee shop in brackley which was absolutely_delicious .
F	we contacted trade plumbing via_email as we wanted a 0mm_thick trojan bath_panel .
M	they also charged us £_00 for a month without_any service which we tried to get refunded .
M	and the gin was lovely too !
F	excellent website with loads of information_regarding appliance performance , running costs , capacity , noise levels etc .
F	i cannot_fault them , and i will definitely use them again .
M	i had seen one or two but was not impressed .
F	we had a fantastic experience with purchasing our table_tennis_table .
M	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
M	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
F	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
F	i found the items i had been looking for .
M	by the time the other one had got the first quote to me shiply had sent 0 !
F	all in all a very satisfactory service .
F	this was the third time i have used this company this year really pleased with products the first order i had was for my firsts son the clothing labels were applied to his uniform in september and are still as good as new now so much that i ordered more !
F	i ordered one afternoon and the goods arrived the next_morning using amazon payments .
M	dear_sir /_madam
F	there are loads of lenses out their these days to give an illusion of bigger eyes but often looks fake or someone could tell you are wearing lenses .
M	called only to find answer phone so left voicemail and emailed , neither were returned .
F	know exactly where to come if / when i need more wellies !
M	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
M	great product - delivered perfectly within time window by friendly guys .
M	the title_says it all !
M	this shop is no mickey_mouse out fit , very helpful and super efficient service .
F	please can you forward me info on what to do next re contacting serenata_flowers !
F	maybe its me , being crawled all over by a helpful 0 year_old not great when using a computer , but a found it a real_headache to actually log in and claim my money .
F	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
F	thank_you .
M	i had to look hard on the internet for info re fitting the boards , i was also unaware that they needed to be stored flat , and they warped , which made fitting more difficult , had to use props to jam against wall .
M	my order was placed from your website for tyres to be delivered to ****.
M	energizer hi - tech led 0in0 torch / lantern - lantern is fine , torch useless , instructions pathetic .
M	at no point is it made clear that thinner_lenses are available but not available to purchase online .
F	the goods are always dispatched right away and well_packaged .
M	a hint of an_apology would have helped the suituation .
M	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
M	paid for 00hr delivery and received 0 days_later what can i say is it worth chasing no i wont go back im_afraid .
F	our usb_sticks were delivered to the wrong_address twice .
M	however the reception isn_'_t great in all areas .
M	the issue being that scuba_store no_longer keep the cressi tracina .
F	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
F	there wasn_'_t even any kind of apology ( considering there is no mention on the website that they don_'_t do price matching retrospectively !!)
M	thank_you .
F	shame to spoil what would otherwise have been a five_star experience .
F	i ordered a bouquet for my friend for a very special_occasion , which should have been delivered yesterday 00 / 0 / 00 i provided correct details at time or ordering .
F	not the best .
M	delivered the next_day as promised .
M	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
M	i doubt very much that my situation was an_isolated one .
F	i '_m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
M	do not know where the fault lies , but , suggest look0parking , and the car parking people communicate with each other more closely
F	i ordered items never recieved them .
M	highly_recommended
M	simples
M	the ultimate insult came when i asked to speak to someone_who could authorise paying for the room i booked only to be asked whether it would wait_until the morning !
M	the product looks great but their customer service is poor , yet another company that makes promises that just let the customer down and do not give a truthful straight_forward answer .
F	?
F	good little first getaway with boyfriends / girlfriends , we managed well !
M	surely , a postage cost of around £ 0 cannot be justified for a low value order ?
F	my last bed was quite old and although it still felt ok i was needing a new one .
F	i called cs & was waiting for 00_mins to speak to someone_who basically said i didn_’_t have a choice & that was the only process allowed .
F	it probably obstructed by vision by 00_%, a shame because i would have loved to wear them for every day but it probably isn_'_t safe when driving .
F	on delivering the order he was again very abrupt and unfriendly in his manner .
F	groupon provides a far more efficient and satisfactory experience and when that fails for what ever reason , they are more genuinely_concerned_about the individuals and give small_amounts of complimentary compensation unlike wowcher .
F	i love their home_trial and have used it several_times so was confident that i had got the right pair of glasses for me .
F	i am very happy with the sales side of this company but not very impressed with the training i had never touched a nail before and was advised to do a sculpting course of which cost 000_pound this was around sep_0000 i have not even sent my first set of nails yet and have been on another nail_course and passed all my exams so i am now fully qualified but no thanks to essential_nails
M	i needed a good lazer printer and although i had one in mind the excellent salesman gave_me a great overview on the possible alternatives which i found very informative .
M	if only i had more time …
F	took about a week to be delivered
M	unacceptable delivery and no per warning advice .
F	this company is absolutely atrocious , the customer service team are in desperate_need training , however i must_say the parts replacement team are in a different league they are professional it '_s a shame there apart of the whole company .
F	the roses were rotten in the middle and were not the large laurence lleywelyn bowen ultra violet bouquet i had ordered as they were made of pink and white_roses ( in fact i do not recognise them from any of the llb displays so i can only_assume they are from a lower cost product catalogue range ).
M	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
M	i notice another_reviewer complained similarly .
F	highly_recommended .
M	yes their prices are cheap but so is the quality of their products .
M	really great service , would recommend to friends and family .
M	again going out of my way to provide the said documents , deleting the initial payment as requested by one manager , to then having to input the details for a third time .
M	we suggested that we had been reasonable up tot his point but we were now getting worried if the tv would ever be fixed .
M	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
F	but if your time is precious , find a more established company that will do the job right the first time .
M	very impressed with webtogs !
F	perhaps they should concentrate on fulfilling the orders they have already received instead of advertising for more business with which they clearly can '_t cope !
M	why this wasn_'_t done in advance i have no idea .
F	i did then get two emails acknowledging both orders , two payments made from bank_account and two lots of flowers sent to nursing_home .
M	ordering was easy .
F	i am pleased with the boxes as they are strong and look good .
F	very efficient and quick delivery and well_packaged .
M	lenovo showed that it was just on 0 years old .
F	upon reordering we received 000 evening_invites and no day invites .
F	moral of the story ?
F	much_cheaper_than my own vet for the products i require on regular_basis - special food for cats and joint_supplements for dogs - some as much as 00_% cheaper !
F	was quite happy to leave it at that .
F	but the two times i have they have been perfect .
M	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
F	i do sometimes buy from feelunique . com as well and at that site prices are the same regardless where you are ordering from given of course that you buy using the same currency .
F	when flowers left depot and again when delivered !
M	the 0 pair of ear_rings i purchased arrived on time and the 0 boxes as well as the draw string bags was a very nice_touch as was the picture of who packed the items , this company packages it '_s self very well .
M	if i ' d have been better informed when i choose £ 0 next_day delivery that i wouldn_'_t actually receive it for two_days , i ' d obviously not have chosen to waste £ 0 & just simply waited on normal delivery .
M	as i have said above some products are very good but due to the let_down on the two occassions referred to above it has lead me to shop around .
M	excellent commitment to customer_satisfaction - when the item i wanted had supply problems , they sent me a better one for the same price .
F	very happy with our purchase , good quality for cheap price and prompt delivery
F	we arrived at the hotel to find that it was , in fact , a flat with two rooms that were let out to paying guests ( and all this through_expedia !).

M	repeat do not !!!
M	would use again .
F	bozo the budgie likes them too !
F	honestly 0 i felt like you gave_me 0 fingers down the phone in terms of support , compromise and customer_care .
F	yet i still had to email the company at every_single stage of the process as my order seemed to be forgotten about several_times ( at_least the company clearly had no desire to fulfil the time limit of 00 days it stated before taking my money on day 0 ).
M	nothing .
M	i '_ve_used mr_memory several_times before and received the same level of service and same standard of product .
F	goods arrived as promised secure and with speed
M	i ordered a large wardrobe from one of their stores .
M	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
M	being in england apart makes it hard but iflorist brings her closer to me .
M	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .
M	does_exactly_what it says on the tin
M	thx
F	i '_ve booked several_times with alpharooms and my only_complaint is with the the shuttlebus service .
F	if you haven_'_t bought from big dog_world , you are missing out .

M	got parcel next_day before 00pm !
M	thank_you for not only having the water_tank for my nespresso_machine , but also for having it at such a good price !
F	customer service is bend_over_backwards to help , and finally resolved the stock problem and then the delivery problem , however they need to sort_out the phone waiting times , i was on numerous_times over an_hour , hence the £_00 on phone_calls and they refused to phone me back .
F	highly_recommend feel good contact_lenses .
M	the customer service has_been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
F	i was told that the delivery van had broken down and that it would be delivered that day ( friday ).
M	i used the ipad_app which was easy to create and design the photo_book taking you straight the steps through to payment and ordering .
F	great value for money and options of wetsuits .
M	been using the lenstore for quite a while and have never been let_down , always great prices and rapid_dispatch .
M	i bought a jacket from this company just because of its cracking low price , however other than the cost of their products i would think_twice before using this company again .
F	item is ok for the money .
F	i bought the larger_size costume due to my daughter being a little on the tall size and my one complaint was the tights were not quite long enough .
M	i hope that they improve their customer service .
M	very good customer service & very useful .
M	the service before we we got on was very welcoming and friendly .
M	this review will come_across a little_bit fan boyish , but i really love this website .

M	can see bulk_powders taking over maximuscle in popularity .
M	thanks pmc
F	i ordered flowers in plenty of time for my sisters_00th_birthday with serenata .
M	the remote_controls were an excellent price , the instructions that came with them were very clear ( the new remote_controls were reprogrammed in a few_seconds ) and they were dispatched promptly .
M	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
F	unfortunately the glasses did not fit so i have arranged to send them back to a refund .
M	if any of the " customer service " personnel worked face to face with the public they would be punched in the mouth for sure .
M	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
F	what does this tell you ??
M	after my problem i email customer_services and the response was " stock " and not and explanation at all .
F	my eye still feels as though it '_s ' shutting off ' and in lower light levels , say for instance watching_tv , it just feels_like it '_s been smeared with vaseline ,.
M	great prices .
F	the customer service department are rude , arrogant , don_'_t call back and cant understand what they say due to the language_barrier and the fact they talk too fast .
M	excellently_packaged .
F	!
F	won_'_t be buying from you again .
F	i have given this company time to respond and rectify this problem , but they have not .
M	first tube arrived bent like a banana !
F	( also , if they ' re closed , they still make you listen to all the nonsense before they tell you they ' re closed and when you should phone back ).
M	stumbled_across digitalrev whilst looking for a good price on a nokia 000 .
M	0 ) had to set_up two new accounts with new emails adds
M	shipping overseas was fast , but quite expensive at £_00 !
F	seranta did not even have the decency to reply to any emails i sent more than 0_weeks_ago .
F	they need to stop that rule as it doesn_'_t work people are going elsewhere .

F	the dispatch was very fast and they came in very appropriate packaging / recorded delivery .
M	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .

F	i percevered till the weekend and after a few emails , instructing me to mend them myself if i could , i sent them back to be repaired professionally .
F	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read_reviews before i ordered .
F	i was looking for a smaller length bed to fit into my sons_bedroom .
F	which i did and the driver did the same thing again !
F	maybe tyre_shopper should be aware of this mistake and inform there customers about delivery of tyres in the chosen garage .

M	pros_: all communications with this company have been friendly with staff always very helpful and polite at all times .
M	had booked a one hour_slot first thing in the morning .
M	brilliant service from_start to finish thank_you
F	one criticism is that the villa is quite remote from the town and although a pleasant walk to town the return trip with pushchairs and shopping is a hard uphill walk which will not suit anyone with mobility_issues .
M	well , today we have ( not ) received yet another home office document .
M	ordered a couple of sofas , delivery to be 0 - 0_weeks .
M	even bt are quicker and that '_s saying some think , so i am not impressed at all , the response is very slow .
F	this is the second time i '_ve bought from spartoo and once again brilliant service from_start to finish , competitive_prices , good quality items , speedy delivery - what more could one ask for ?

F	i would like to receive a refund for the postage please .
M	it is absolutely first_class in every way - thank_you so much !
F	ive not bothered to complain for the sake of 0 . 00 - i can clearly see its a racket .
M	when i called later - he denied the conversation - blatantly lying to me by telling_me he wasn_'_t in the week before .
F	the report was poorly written , showing low - quality small spot somewhere , which made a " highly qualified engineer " make assumption i dropped it into the water .
M	rentalcar . com uses reputab ; e local rental car companies which makes the whole rental process very easy .
M	i decided to cancel my order .
F	awful tried to charge me over_£_00 for ' not paying on time ' when i had infact paid over a week early .
M	the finance process was straight_forwards and very fast .
F	good quality
M	web_site is a bit_slow compared to amazon but ok experience .
F	car finally arrives at 00 : 00 i '_m fuming .
M	but when they work payment has_been 0 - 0 months its nice to get cash_back .
F	kieran was very helpful and contacted gucci on my behalf to make te necessary_adjustments to the watch i was buying .
F	its says how many places are left so you know how long you can wait or think about it .
M	however , the time taken between order and delivery was unacceptable , especially when the website advertises turnaround time of 0 - 0 days .
M	keep ringing and saying that if they connect the service then i will pay the bill but computer says no !
F	visited my friend two_days after she received her flowers .
F	everything you could have wanted was on the till receipt .
F	the website has a beautiful layout that is extremely simple to use but jam packed with excellent search features .
M	went_onto facebook and no updates this year , which raises further concerns .
F	we lost 00_euros of fuel in the change over which the staff would not acknowledge .
F	very easy to order i would recommend this company to all my family .
M	if my problems had been of a more serious nature it would have been impossible to get any advice or assistance until monday_morning .
F	very good quality , look great .
M	vast_majority of orders are shipped the same day as ordered and with you in 0 or 0 days normally .
F	i was going away the next_day and although it wa 0 minutes to 0 she went out of her way to ensure i received them the following_day .
F	we were looking for an engagement_ring that would reflect how special our engagement was to us .
M	will_continue to order from you always , will be placing more orders for ego and more flavours next week !
M	on the plus_side , the staff were consistently patient , sensible and courteous , and this made the whole_process a huge_amount less frustrating than it might have been .
F	person on phone was not that helpful - like i was an inconvenience for phoning .
M	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding_reception ).
M	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
M	jeg_har sagt opp min kundekonto hos dette firmaet og kommer aldri mer til å handle så mye som et eneste papirark fra dem .
M	delivery was quick , i '_ll be shopping from here again soon
F	he was aggressive and again intimidating .
M	slow to respond to emails requesting information and a let_down to ffx who are extremely efficient .
M	highly_recommended .
M	basically you can '_t be certain that you will attend the event , only that you won_'_t pay if you don_'_t .
M	all in all a very unsatisfactory experience .
F	after the site is done you are on your_own with it .
M	the things i look for in a supplier is the product i need , at the right price and quick delivery .
M	they don_'_t care about their customers and the fact that i am £_000 out of pocket and they '_ve had my money for nearly a month .
F	this arrangement of summer flowers , looked more than impressive when received .
F	i find it ridiculous that specsavers cannot do this check up .
F	thank_you , rug_house - from a very satisfied_customer .
F	furthermore , there was a mild problem with the delivery of my part ( due to the delivery man ), and they provided excellent service in helping_me track down where my part had gone , and i managed to get it on the same day it was meant to arrive .
F	it was great to receive a text to confirm that they had been delivered as i then phoned to sing happy birthday 000_miles_away .
M	very happy .
M	i have sent many parcels from my work address and all have been received within a day or two .
F	if i had paid full price would have been very unhappy , there were more leaves than flowers !
F	however , i was disappointed in the size and had to buy other flowers locally to make them look more special
F	delivery was speedy although with a fresh product as this it would be great if the delivery company would give a 0 hour delivery slot as some others do , i did not want to miss this delivery and have it redelivered the next_day , it did arrive on the expected date , albeit at the end of the day .
F	i bought my wormers with the expectation , based on reading_reviews that my
F	thank u
M	all good just slightly worrying that the web - site booking gives no details at all of the room except that it is a double .
M	there was no delivery date .
M	the supplier states that the wheels ” have been well used ” and that i should purchase a replacement set of wheels .
F	on the day i ordered the puzzle there was an advert in the paper giving a discount but as i didn_'_t have the code i paid full price rather_than the offer price .
F	takes an excessive amount of time to receive payment .
F	stay away
M	this was at edinburgh , therefore this ment i handed the car back without a full_tank of fuel .
M	scott
F	all in all a very disappointing service from_start to finish .
F	thanks for that !
M	on saturday_morning two of the villagers commented on how good it looked and one of them has asked for the details of the company that i got it from .
M	i was made to feel like i was a bit of a nuisance .
F	i ordered christmas lights from here as they were in stock on site ( and on amazon site ) but then received email_saying they weren_'_t .
M	i will avoid in the future .
F	customer service was terrible and appallling .
F	the order of service arrived later than_expected and had been printed in the wrong order making them unusable and they had to be binned .
M	had to pay extra 00 pounds to have pedal redelivered , and poor customer service from guitar_guitar {(
F	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
F	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
F	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put £ 0 pounds onto my card .
F	the decks were a great price and excellent quality .
F	strain .
M	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without_any funny delays .
F	i decided to take a gamble on the ' compatible ' hp_cartridges and they are absolutely fantastic and very cheap ( i had encountered problems with this sort of cartridge from other_retailers ).
M	i ordered two_pairs of sunglasses 00 days before going on holiday .
M	emailed support , over 0 days and all i '_ve had is a automated_response .
M	never again !
F	i chose a delivery date during the online purchase , however , there was no time frame for the delivery .
M	shop elsewhere its over priced anyway
F	the plastic christmas bags make ideal gift bags as they are much_stronger than the paper ones and are just as decorative with lots of different_designs .
M	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
F	i had to make a phone_call asking just when my order will be arriving as my son has taken time off work to do the decorating .
F	last night i downloaded some software .
M	and now publicly
M	so i then got to the front and the staff serving me was pleasant and appologised for the wait , computers then went down back to paper took him nearly three quaters of an_hour two phone_calls to the credit_card company .
F	they have marked each time that a signature has_been received !!
F	the free pillows that came with it were a real_bonus as although i already had similar pillows they were not such good quality as these and certainly they are far more comfortable as they are a bit softer to lie on .
F	perfect quality size and colour , defiantly recommend reasonable_prices , helpful staff and fast delivery !
M	it has_been running well apart_from a couple of hick - ups but apart_from that it is perfect .
M	physioroom were great , this product wasn_'_t - i guess you get what you pay for , and i ' d definitely recommend getting something a little more_expensive , but far more cost_effective in the future !
M	they did however they gave_me 0 whole litre of danish_oil for compensation .
F	friendly service , good product .
M	yes of course they handle so many parcels that sooner or later somebody is going to have an okay experience with yodel , but why are so many having to suffer as i have ?
M	it '_s now 00 days and nothing has appeared - and i '_m typing this while on hold .
F	yesterday in the pouring_rain my suspension coil snapped and ripped through one of the tyres .
F	rang customer service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning . still no delivery .
F	as i had 0 huge items to unpack within 00_hours to check it was not easy due to all of the packaging and with the added factor that an item had been dropped , i really had to unpack everything very carefully incase it was needed for reuse to return .
M	i have nothing bad to say about them and in an instant would recommend to anyone who is wanting supplements and workout fuel .
F	i checked on the website and nowhere does it say it is out of stock .
F	i do not rate this company in terms of efficiency but cannot , as yet , comment on their product .
M	good fast service
M	ferry , staff , transport to amsterdam , holland etc all good .
F	no customer service and i will not buy from them again or recommend .
F	never again !
F	rented a car while my own was getting fixed .
F	very annoying as have planed to erect the shed with the help of friends this weekend .
F	i got a very big thank_you from my friend .
M	no_probs until i needed to fill the car prior to handing back and i found out the fuel indicator did not work correctly .
M	i ' d even taken a few_days off work to enjoy my birthday_present so what could go_wrong ?
F	i bought two lots of flowers , opting for one to be delivered on saturday and one to be delivered on sunday .
F	i discovered the bead_shop a few_weeks_ago and i am so glad i did .
F	i '_m waiting them for long to get reply my emails .
M	came with old style mouse and keyboard ( non - usb ) that keeps stopping working , meaning reboot every time .
M	i would encourage people to avoid .
M	i got superb service and i am confident that i will get advice whenever i need it .
F	would highly_recommend the site .
M	the item i bought was fantastic , it was fantastic value for money and the delivery was very quick considering it was free !
M	minus_points
M	answering initial enquireis from customer was on the slow side though .
M	we found anyvan on the internet and the item was collected 0 days_later and delivered the same day , at the promised time , carefully_packed and unmarked .
F	the items were packaged fine although i didn_'_t receive a delivery note , not sure if that is normal but seems unusual .
F	so i had to go directly to my vet and plead for some food to tide me over until my order arrived .
M	then i had to pay for the cost of the return which was unexpected .
F	not to heavy for lifting in and out of car .
M	however the non transport company finish their working day at 0pm and an answer could not be obtained with regards to non delivery .
F	i had made an_error which would have held my order up if it had not been for my contact .
F	i wrote an_email to compare my move to flag this and i never_heard_anything back .
F	paid_extra for royal_mail delivery to make delivery ( or collection ) simple as am out working all day but was sent via courier which made things more complicated .
F	picture quality not great .
M	what we got was very good but not worth the money even at half price .
F	!
M	they seemed to have been setup for an alien as i have never met a man or woman whose nose would have found these comfortable without adjustment .
F	i highly_recommend complete_care shop .
M	placed an order on the tuesday .
M	this meant there were no practice rooms available .
F	i wanted tickets for prince igor at the london coliseum and somehow got onto this website instead of the official coliseum website .
M	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
M	zzzzzzzzzz
F	second time used same good service
F	this is an very good place to shop , why not try it .
M	" i have passed your message on to the department concerned and somebody will be in touch later ".
M	call from metro regarding profiles , apparently these prints would not be printed using this profile , which is not what it said on the site and it was admitted that i would not have known this - bad
F	i tried to use the help on the website twice & received error messages .
F	would not_hesitate to recommend .
M	also the clicksnap tends to miss items off receipts uploaded , by the time it '_s processed you can miss the expiry_date for a particular item .
F	you can only add 0 pages at a time - before you could add one page at a time .
M	this issue remains unresolved !
F	?
M	the shoes were too large .
F	cheaper_than getting him to come_back yet another day .
M	the direct_debit guarantee stipulates ,
M	it is definitely the best investment i have ever made .
M	the deals also required you to take out an expensive bundled telephone service as well .
F	on telephoning ulookubook , it transpired_that the easyjet flight booked as part of our package had increased in price and we had to pay slightly more to continue the booking .
M	delivery took just over a week .
M	the girl i spoke to said the new items had already been dispatched and would arrive tomorrow but she couldn_'_t give me a time .
F	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
M	a lot of stuff , i thought was mislabeled genre wise so ended_up having to put in specific artists names just to find things .
F	i have to say the instructions that came with my purchase were very confusing .
F	we ordered a sack truck & it was delivered extremely quickly in very good protective_packaging .
M	this time i bought it by clicking_through_topcashback but for some reason the order hasn_'_t been picked_up so i am having to go through the laborius process of claiming the discount - not impressed although i '_m hoping its an_oversight and nothing more .
F	looked the transport people up in the yellow_pages ( la redoute guy had no phone number ) but they are not responding .
F	email communication also very good .
F	!
M	i was in all day and there was no card in the letterbox .
M	so to me the tyre_fitting company in dundee was very poor service .
F	would definitely recommend this website .
M	i doubt you will remain in business for much longer if you continue to operate your business in such a poor manner .
F	0_weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
M	ordered filter and water quality consumables .
M	i was intially very cautious_about buying a watch from an internet retailer as without seeing it , you have to trust that it will be in the condition described by your sales_advisor .
F	lastly , the deliverer called me personally one hour beforehand to let_me know he was coming .
M	i purchased this type of rim lock for my brand_new back gate which i made a few_years_ago .
F	good prices - good service .
M	i emailed asking why ?, but still had no response
F	item arrived promptly , will deffo use again .
F	it felt like like we were in a cattle_market being herded very slowly without_any information .
M	the only issue was that we waited 00_minutes at logan airport for the thrifty shuttle to pick us up and then waited another hour at the thrifty office to get the car .
F	often retailers will state free delivery but add the cost to the item - this was not the case as the cost of the items were very competitive .
F	they would of got 0_stars for quality and speed .
M	i have done full maintenance tasks on my printer , cleaning printheads etc , yet after printing just 0 test pages and one calibration page my printer tells_me that the colour_cartridge ink level is very low , in fact every time i checked print ink_levels , even without printing anything , the ink level in the colour_cartridge decreased dramatically .
F	fine .
M	of praise before , so like good business practice there is a first time for
M	wanted to get going , so did not ask for a change . car was new and clean .
F	i had never sent this instruction .
F	we spent forever touring around the large resorts at the airport end of the coast before finally heading further along to the smaller resorts .
F	we paid for a platinum cottage due to coming with our elderly_parents one with dementia and for us to have no_worries and stresses , as we were caring for them , it was sad that we did not have the service we were expecting .
M	there was no option to select the multi_storey without a fast track option .
M	i don_'_t use them any more .
F	both bathrooms were in need of repair , both towel_rails were broke and one toilet_seat had a crack in it .
F	transaction_id_0000000
M	expert_knowledge of a 00 year_old shower installation , stopped me making a mistake , gave_me great advice and fixed my problem .
F	payment efficient .
F	so , no , i would never even consider_using them again , even if the recipient lived in the middle of a large town .
F	just looking now to book later in the year .
F	it simply would not charge .
F	nice item but arranged delivery and it never turned_up , took a day off and it arrived 0 week_later when i was on holiday .
M	on suggestions

F	!
F	now these socks were supposed to be a well_known_brand but are the poorest quality socks i have ever purchased and the inside if full of dangling threads which i imagine would get caught in your toes when putting on .
M	honestly i was so fine with bt but then i gave them a go , just to save me some money but will not call them again , they keep send me from one department to another , and the computer technicians know less_than me . the problem is the router i told them but i '_m not allowed to upgrade , right . but new customers have half the price and better routers . that '_s nice
F	had to leave my car in short_stay car_park which i then had to pay for on return .
F	i have noticed that others are complaining on facebook about the same problem .
F	however , i have had nothing by the way of an_apology which i find annoying - a discount_voucher or something would have restored goodwill .
M	not working for me through explorer , nearly missed bargain but went through chrome and went ok .
F	purchased as a present for my friend '_s 00th_birthday .
F	mrs julie reed
F	thank_you very much for your help .
M	very impressed as always , have sold devices before and mazuma is the only provider that can carryout the promise of easy postage and prompt payment .
M	i find it very simple to order what i need from the website and do get contacted if the stock is out .
M	they have a call back option on the website however i challenge you to find an available slot !
F	it was a little overkill if anything but i really appreciated it .
M	never ever using this again !.
F	needless to say this upset me greatly and i had to phone my friend to enquire his whereabouts that week and whether i had his postcode correctly - which upset me even more as it left him suspicious and risked ruining the surprise .
F	if they could rectify this then it would be perfect
M	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
F	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all_aspects .
M	i took it to a phone shop who said it had been blocked by the network we tested it with several sim_cards to confirm this .
F	i , had no problem ordering my item which was a bookcase unit , and delivery date scheduled at the time of ordering , which was in 0_weeks time but 0_days before delivery date i got phone_call to say it was not available and to wait 0_days for an update , so not a happy_bunny at this as this item was just what i am looking for , so fingers_crossed it will arrive soon .
M	so cant really fault on their service just disappointed i cannot gain benefit from my purchase .
F	i was also able to fill in the forms while he talked_me through the questions over the phone , which was reassuring .
F	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
F	on return to the website it was still saying out of stock , but then we noticed that there were colour choices - we tried the next colour ( blue ) and low and behold we were in business .
M	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
F	be careful when ordering anything from them .
M	i received a text_message to say that the flowers had been left at the back of the house .
M	really good qnd work well , but one of them was slightly chipped which was a shame .
M	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
F	!
F	i wonder_if they make more money on squatting on domains like this as they lose from existing_customers moving elsewhere ?
M	pc works_fine .
F	promises much .
M	expecting a skoda_octavia with enough boot roo for the family luggage but received a curious model known as lancia delta which i would not put in the medium category .
M	however , we are a bit disappointed with the performance of the equipment in relation to the one thing we have tried so_far . to make chips .
M	i also upgraded to a deluxe selection as_opposed to a standard package which i assume is what you sent , however i did also request a birthday_balloon be added to the above order , which was not sent ?
F	chat windows get stuck as often as on lifeperson
M	in my opinion , they ' re actually fraudulent .
F	it was dark , she_lives_alone , and she may not have answered door .
F	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
M	the professionalism of their customer service team is questionable .
F	i know !!!.
F	i telephoned customer_services to be told that the bench seat was out of stock because i changed the delivery date and so nothing was being delivered .
M	bought from paperstone previously and they were good value for money .
F	i can only hope so !!!!
M	ordered in the evening , dispatched next_day , arrived day after .
M	so refreshing to deal with an order like that
F	talktalk is not a reliable company .
M	they arrived the day i made my ' where '_s my stuff ' query .
F	it arrived thursday .
M	issue was really between scrappa and post_office .
M	there was a lack of any fitting_instructions . on saying that , the lights when fitted are excellent ,.
M	good service and cheap .
F	the base was damaged and the mattress when it did arrive was is in a disgusting condition .
M	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
M	it took seven emails to get a response and then it was because i started to get really nasty with them .
F	the hardest_bit was putting it in the postbox !
F	they have also given more weight to other elements of the design and seem to have forgotten that actually , the instructions are one of the most , if not the most , important parts of the packaging .
M	i have noticed a change in my physique , and being a bit of a slow gainer , this is a welcome_change !
M	now you get on a plane in benbecula marked flybe , you land in glasgow , and get on another plane marked flybe , and kaching , £_00 one way , although you are mid journey ?????
F	however on insisting on a 0 door the staff magically produce a 0 four door polo .
M	as seen on screen
F	its right next to the lift shaft , so after the lights and telly go off , all you hear is the lift going up and down until everyone has_gone to bed .
F	not_necessarily your fault , its more likely to be down to the courier !
F	the metal ones rub on the nose bridge a little but to be expected for the price .
M	paul_traynor alway seem ed to have my best_interests at heart and at no time was ' pushy '.
F	shop with very at your_peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don_'_t care about shocking service .
M	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
F	my only_gripe is that the festival started at 00 . 00pm but the ticket office in moorgate where i had to collect my ticket , only opened at 0pm .
F	customer loyalty_discounts which are a great little bonus !
F	what should i do if i have no gas and / or electricity ?
M	none the less they looked beautiful and were great value for money .
F	the courier was yodel they have a web_site to tell you what depot the goods are in every thing but when you can expect the goods at your property . i think they should follow dpd procedure and let people know a time_scale and correct day .
F	i have used health_monthly for a long time now , i am very pleased with the products & keep_coming_back for more !
M	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
F	i placed my order on the tuesday .
M	in fact it offered better protection than some other more_expensive insurances .
F	fuming
M	not the first time i have used ao but still it surprises me how quick and efficient their service is , even the delivery guys were on time and very polite .
F	this e_- mail contains a discount_coupon with code for 0 % ( of £ 0 , not sure ) off your next order .
F	you need to change your system so as not to mislead people !
F	there is the time , planning and total_cost of this fiasco and i '_m entitled to a refund for a service that is not as advertised in other words a con .
F	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
F	so i decided to wait .
M	i understand this is a rare track and has long been out of press but this is a pointless repress .
M	plus they ' re a lot cheaper_than shops and other_sites .
F	as we had the warranty we contacted them , only to be told , not covered , read the small_print .
M	for our first time using loco0 we were booking a complex journey through three countries with five changes of trains .
M	i ' d rather pay more and not have to chase up an order .
M	thanks
F	excuse me if i sound angry it is because i am .
M	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
M	i booked the mot_test on wednesday only to be told that the mot_tester his daughter had been taken to hospital so the test would be delayed until friday the car failed the mot .
M	very happy
M	who do the judges think they are .
M	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
M	i was doubtful based on my experience with other online sellers ( who tell you after you order that they are no_longer in stock ).
M	heading_says it all .
M	nothing but praise for this company . the first pair of glasses didn_'_t suit me so returned them and got a replacement , they were unbelievably quick and didn_'_t charge any extra postage etc . the whole_process was so easy and totally customer_focused . i will recommend them to all my friends and family .
F	this latest experience was etyres , once again swapping off run - flats and replacing with regular tyres , this time on our mini .
M	exceptional service
F	i bought 0 canterbury pieces of clothing .
F	will definitely use petfleas again .
F	avoid_avoid_avoid middlemen making money off everyone and giving really poor service in return !
F	yesterday i received this link to leave comments about the service but having not received the item this was impossible to do .
M	she cannot use the normal in ear head phones .
M	great customer service and a great product so easy to set_up , very quick and painless , friendly staff who find the right policy and give the right advice for you , in a word -
F	no apology , they just don_'_t care .
F	very pleased with my goods .
M	so ended_up with 000 screws and no way of using them .
F	there website is very simple to use & their product information , delivery speed and most_importantly their prices are simply the best .
F	( well . mine hasn_'_t been )
M	i have used several packs of bombyx_mori - it contnues to do an excellent job . i am in my early 00 '_s but quite fit for my age :_o and it has made me very virile .
M	sadly the shipment arrived without my bbq_cover which , a week_later still has not arrived .
F	managed it at 0rd_attempt , now do i write down new password or just expect to repeat procedure next time .?
M	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
M	00 / 00
F	i called office using a different mobile , asking where they were based !!!!!
F	i ordered a 0 month_supply of hay_fever tablets for £ 0 which was amazing value .
M	overall , i couldn_'_t ask for more from a courier !
F	they never arrived .
M	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
F	we ' re not the best at diy so wasn_'_t sure how easy it was going to be to put up , but surprise , surprise it was really simple ( following the clear_instructions that came with it ).
M	delivery was due 0 - 0 days .
M	and good value for money .
F	i wrote the complaint in mid_october and still have received nothing back now !!
M	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
F	will never ever shop with pah online again .
M	im hoping the ones that did crack turn out ok .
F	was nice to have text_updates so i knew what was going on :)
F	i doubt very much i will use click & collect service again .
M	i '_ve then received an email_telling_me i need to amend this review , clearly a complaint was received pointing at a minor technicality ( the owners language directed at me and duly accurately reported on here ).
M	i will write on every forum / feedback / review site that i can
F	thought it might be different based on the claims about mutual benefits and sound ethics .
F	have used the soup_maker for the first time today and was very impressed with it .
M	however every time i turn the laptop on it tells_me that the operating_system is incompatible with drivers .
F	very good and would use again
M	the delivery arrived on time but that is it regarding the good points .
M	the tv was quite good though .
M	not opened the outfit yet as it '_s a birthday_present for my son .
M	the blind was delivered in 00 days , so not particularly quickly .
F	my order no by the way is the one sent already to your website .
F	which was booked in for a month from delivery , i would have thought a company like dfs would follow_up minor problems like this far quicker_than a month
F	i wrote to them and the assure me it would be on it '_s way , they '_ve just had a busy_period .
M	the product arrived in perfect_condition , within the deadline .
M	although i certainly wasn_'_t angling for anything , it '_s great that he took my feedback so seriously and he '_s taken my negative experience and turned it into a positive .
M	i could understand if it was 0am at an airport that was closed but this was the main pick_up period .
F	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
F	wish i had waited the very next_day they had a flash_sale that would have saved me £_00 . 00 .
F	i got a text to say the recipient was unreachable , so said it was ok to try another day and would try and find another number .
F	i will buy form them again , but won_'_t deal again if anything_goes_wrong and i have to deal with ' customer service '.
F	when i opened the package the sunglasses were in perfect_condition and came with authenticity etc but the lense size was smaller_than i had expected .
F	once you '_ve made these changes , please submit your site for reconsideration in google '_s search_results .
M	i wanted a vase to go with it thinking it will look better .
F	after mails back and forth and two_weeks on i have finally received the item , in a very damaged box and open .
F	will recommend any time
M	called their outsourced technical_support who laughed that they still sell such obsolete technology .
F	!
F	cos it stopped_working about a month after i bought it .
F	asda stores limited ,
M	chased up the product again , promised another call back .
M	a great machine and an even better service .
M	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn_'_t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
F	the opperations manager was quite patronising and offered no more than a credit_note .
M	very sastisfied customer .
M	the part was delivered very promptly
F	i went forthe trial_frames initially to find the style that suited me .
F	could have ended_up in a difficult situation as i only picked_up the email by_chance ( and it had gone to junk ).
M	overall good service but i didn_'_t get the full 0 / 0 of a tank per vehicle as promised .
M	if you want a camera or a system . get it here !
F	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
F	this was the first time i had ordered from them .
M	delivery time is good or ok .
M	wait_until end of contract and off this relation
F	it is not the place to start of your holiday !
F	everything arrived tagged and bagged .
F	they checked with the hotel and the parking company that they had the right info and then emailed me to confirm .
M	please stay_away from this dodgy company and use a company that has all positive feedbacks as you will be very sorry when you get caught out .
M	i '_ve_used this company before .
M	delivery was great - on the day got a text giving me a one hour_slot when it would be delivered , and it was .
F	i have bought quite a lot of merchandise from bedeck as we have recently_moved_into a new home .
M	waited in all day for delivery expected between 00 & 0 - parcel delivered wrongly at 00 : 00 !
F	i checked my order on the wed only to find the delivery date had been put back 0_days with no notification .
M	the flowers turned_up today as expected but minus 0 key element , the 00 daffodils !
M	dissapointed !
F	they took my money on 00 / 00 /_0000 , know happily earning them interest , while i chase my tale .
M	payed out only £ 0 pound saying the phone did not work and had a broken screen .
F	my uw distributor was the only person i could get_hold of and even he couldn ’_t help me because you had no out of hours contact .
F	i had an e_- mail informing_me my delivery was up for collection .
F	never use this company .
M	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
F	?
M	will look at other options in future .
M	i should not have do that and i am disappointed with frost this time , as their service is usually first_class .
M	first of all i must stress that i deem this to be theft and fraud .
F	it made me look like i had forgotten my mum '_s birthday .
F	i placed an order and expected the delivery the next_day as i payed for next_day delivery .
M	my order wasn_'_t initial processed and i had to remind global_bike .
F	quick and easy .
M	rma ( r00000 ) - product received our ref :{ 0apzl0rh00
M	i '_m to blame but i expected a little more understanding in honesty .
M	another great example of chess telecoms terrible customer service .
M	tested out the website / programme to see if it could indeed check which ram my system used - and it did .
M	eventually i arranged a time which was by now a week after the original claim was registered .
M	anniversary flowers arrived in a box in able to stand ( imagine an upside - down pyramid ).
M	i have asked for compensation and been advised that compensation would not normally be discussed mid - dispute .
F	i made allowances as it was near christmas , but really it should have arrived by now .
F	, nothing but hassle with follow_up emails and calls & then the cheeky b ---- r had the bad manners to leave his crisp packet on the drive & ask for directions to his next drop_off hasn_'_t he heard of sat navs !!!.
F	delivery was great also !
M	very happy with quality of purchase .
F	always found a smooth and efficient service
M	prices not increased too much .
F	easy to order - no_fuss and arrived on time .
F	very pleased .
M	order confirmed by mail straightaway , invoice sent without a reminder needed , infomed of despatch and carrier , informed of one hour delivery slot and arrived 0 minutes early !
F	ordered two sheds was told up to 00 days for delivery but if i had not herd anything after three_days to contact them .
M	play are competitive but are slow on the sending out of goods , never expect a product if preordered to arrive on release day !
F	dispatch over a week_ago and still_hasn_'_t arrived .
F	thanks again to tyres on the drive for professional service
M	in general the transaction was smooth , i was able to pay by paypal which i found very convenient .
F	!
F	no . i still want the item .
F	ordered casually in the afternoon and delivered before_lunch the next_day ??!!
M	usually very good indeed , but my recent_purchase of a pair of gloves - to replace another pair of morlands gloves stupidly lost have been a real disappointment : much less substantial than the other [ two year_old ] pair , and already the stitching is coming_undone and already the leather is torn - through no unusual wear .
F	i was ordering floor and wall_tiles .
M	day 0 - i ring up .
F	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human_beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
F	thank god !!!
F	research needed on the businesses advertised i would suggest before buying , but it would be helpful if groupon were slight more selected in the businesses they selected and dealt_with !
F	i also have the hand_held gtech which is only slightly_disappointing compared to the upright its still great just a little more suction would help but as a hand_held its pretty good !
M	one ' even better if ' : the weight and size of the glasses case is huge and heavy and as a bloke i carry my glasses in my pocket , not a hand bag , so i ' d really like to see light_weight and smaller glasses cases .
F	throughout all of this we were told that taps uk weren_'_t willing to offer us any compensation and that all of this was in line with their ts and cs .
F	not much to do about it now .
F	the website was very easy to use and good value for money .
F	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
F	. for £_000 for the wardrobe this was a joke !
M	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
M	it arrived in a matter of days .
F	i have now received only a partial_refund because they saw fit to deduct the cost of returning the motor to them from the refund for the part that was never delivered .
M	i now have my order ( delivered on tuesday ) and as a result i '_m happy to update my rating to 0 .
F	i may stick to physically choosing flowers from a store , so i know what i get for my money .
F	!
F	fordralet till min mans samsung note 0 är dock fint och verkar hittills hållbart så_det kan absolut reommenderas .
M	however 0 days_later , no delivery .
F	what should have been completed in january has taken until may to do .
M	then waited around all day for courier - to be told at 0 . 00pm they weren_'_t coming , with no decent reason .
M	very happy .
F	i can only_assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves . absolutely useless !
M	as i '_ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
M	the booking on line was easy .
F	the journey home was made even more stressful when the tank was empty on departure and were made to find a petrol_station as soon as possible .
F	thank_you excellent service
M	i have been hunting high and low for replacement drawer_runners for some treasured but aging bedroom_furniture and could not find them anywhere until someone recomended eurofit_direct then all my problems solved by friendly and knowledgable_staff who helped_me place my order on their extensive web_site .
M	ordered a 0000l bunded oil_tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
F	this was very was very stressful for me with my expectations of bride and groom being high , i was surprised that no one checked the order of service before it was sent out .
F	i feel that the phone condition options on the site should be revised to include ' broken but working ', or something along those lines , in order to be more clear .
M	the shop i visited in epsom was just perfect it had staff which went through and beyond to help me with any questions i had .
F	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
F	your sales people will only say ' that is what is on the web_site '.
F	that '_s pretty rubbish really .
F	ordered two_pairs , one from the bargain £ 0 range and another about £_00 .
F	the staff in the shop were helpful and informed about the range of sofa_beds available .
M	maybe this isn_'_t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
F	these .
F	very polite .
F	my visions better .
F	i will definitely use this company again , and cannot_rate them highly_enough .
M	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
F	what about asda , sainsburys , three , talk mobile .
F	we needed to get a sofa_bed transported nearly 000_miles and little short of hiring a van , plus fuel , plus 0_days , plus lifting etc .
M	solely based on the voice_mail , decided to change to **** 0 . 0_stars ****
F	they are exactly_what i wanted and they were delivered as promised .
F	free telephone_calls to place orders , they always arrive on time and you can change your order without_any fuss . whats more , if you repeat_orders you receive a discoun t .
F	we moved ( but still had access to our old home for a few_days ).
F	the lady was called penny and she was very nice but just after business .
M	it '_s as easy as pie .
M	it has cost me money in arranging an extra visit from the plumber plus all the hassle . one week on from delivery still no replacement parts , rubbish service never again , please compensate me .
M	as above was unable to speak to a expert ?
F	thoroughly recommendable .
M	after 0_weeks i spoke to '[ name ]' ( yeah_right ).
F	i love activebeauty .
F	excellent service and am delighted .
F	a company that actually has people you can speak to and offer an excellent reasonable service .
M	unless you prefer spending hours or even days sitting on your bum waiting and wondering , doing the will they / won_'_t they ?
F	i fully recommend byuing from winstanleys_pramworld .
F	could have been left under a hedge and the receiver could have seen them easily .
F	i have ordered several_times and always been very pleased .
F	i really wish i had read the reviews on here before i sent 0 phones to them for repair .
M	having experienced some difficulties a few_months later i contacted bt and they said they would send me a new router .
M	got no issues with them
F	[_external_reference_] can give you an_hour time_slot with previous warning , so why can '_t yodel ??
F	so , perfection then .
M	we ordered our prime_oak_worktops and upstands and the next_day a very helpful lady phoned to organise the delivery which was organised for the day that we requested .
M	finally got through on phone in late_afternoon monday , and the delivery is rescheduled for tuesday 0 - 0 : 00 ( which is really good ) but i didn_'_t know .
M	comparing_prices is relatively easy these days , and digitalrev . com were the lowest_price by a considerable_margin .
F	i had to order elsewhere for her gift .
M	despite emailing them twice , still no update about my order .
M	as a private_individual , i '_ve been buying / selling on ebay for over 00 years and in that time have experienced the good and bad of ebay .
F	great customer service , a really positive_experience .
M	i have just been informed that insurance is for loss only and does not cover damage , so on top of the postage_costs i now have to refund £_00 . 00 for the item i sent . will i use this company again .
M	it took an age to arrive , the time scales involved were only surpassed by the tracking your product option .
F	lovely pink bed_frame , mattress is top quality memory_foam , bed easy to put_together , wooden_slats are poor quality , thin & slip out far too easily from the black plastic caps that fit into bed_frame .
M	so_far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
M	after two phone_calls still_waiting for the replacement cheque which i am assured is in the system .
M	i was expecticting a bright_red interior which stands_out against the white but was so disapointed & had to phone as soon as they arrived .!
F	i will not_hesitate to return and order again .
M	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
F	we needed a car desperately and chose this site because of the competitive_prices and the stated delivery time of 0 - 00 days .
F	on 00 august i booked the night of 0 december_0000 and the night of 0 december_0000 through you and am quite horrified that you required my full payment so far in_advance .
M	!
M	good - priced quotes but unfortunately they don_'_t include info about when the contractor can do the job .
M	your service , products , website and sales system are excellent but you are badly_let_down by royal_mail '_s new rule under which they will leave a parcel with anyone who will accept it and leave no note for the intended_recipient .
M	however . my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .
M	!
F	not impressed nor was it clear that it would take longer if you placed the order after a certain time .
M	your product is right up there with them .
M	a very prompt and very efficient service .
M	have ordered from them before with exactly the same results , would recommend them to anyone . brilliant keep_up the good work a pleasure to deal with .
F	delivery service they use was terrible , they were late , didn_'_t turn_up and took over 00_minutes on hold just to speak to someone .
M	received replacement tuesday .
M	: 0 )
M	i '_ve booked with them at_least a dozen_times and have never had a problem .
M	tried some shops in town but no hard_drives .
M	i would defo not use them again
F	no funny business .
M	poor communication .
M	very satisfied with the level of service given
F	hi ordered my memory from mr_memory and the service was second to none was really surprised by the superb and fast delivery from the original order to the courier arriving , recommend them for memory anytime :-))
F	not a problem to ring back and get a refund but why have an 0000 number ?
M	it may be that they do not realise that a lot of keen amateur photographers use elements , or else there is more profit in their other products .
M	too many emails and text '_s regarding the purchase ; in fact so much it puts me off further_purchases .
F	back to photobox or someone_else next year .
F	great website which was easy to use with lots of good information , well_organised .
M	they promised to collect them the next_day but 0 days_later have still not done so .
F	excellent , fast service and great low price - thanks !
F	let '_s not even mention i tryed to pay online and it did not work and had to do it over the phone in the morning .
F	revision 00 / 00 /_0000
M	service overall ( products , shipping ) feels great and professional .
M	used this company many_times without to much bother .
M	it is easy to use , but is fraustrating at teh payment state .
F	!
F	i have told them now i want a full_refund and my order cancelled !
F	i am getting a little fed_up with the amount of damages i left my hermes because of there lack of care with parcels i just hope you guys dont go the same way as i have found your service to be excellent in the past .
F	incidentally , i '_ve already discussed the matter with several journo contacts of mine , who are as equally concerned as i am about any accusations of bias and collusion .
M	totally not fit for purpose – utterly_useless !
F	a few hours_later , i received another email_confirming a refund .
M	description : my sage_pay refund request by furniture
F	the delivery driver signed a statement saying the package was received in without examining and poor condition .
F	so i feel very let_down which is such a shame as i am always telling people what a good company you are but now i worry if i need to use you again .
F	i bought some crystal skull_vodka from 00dover which was a good price with next_day delivery which was the main draw as it was a present and i had shopped_around for a good price .
M	the amount now requested was an increase of 000_% i am now in dispute with parcel_hero who have stated that things are weighed differently en_route !
M	will use again .
F	!
F	they have an amazing range of beauty products as well which is great for a makeup addict like me .
F	the ghost walk in the evening was informative and the guide was a good host , involving the whole group .
F	it seems amazing a company as large and established as pixmania could have such draconian processes .
M	i bet drum_stop are a great company - their " e " communication is first_class , but - the item i ordered ( and was verified by a staff_member description / specification wise ) was not what i ordered .
M	hang on - 0 months ?
F	easy to navigate website with good quality products .
M	i required the assistance of live_chat and found emma was a fanatstic representative for her company .
M	i had no problem with the flowers and balloon and card i ordered but on the card i wrote a little caption for the one i sent it too and i received the package and there was nothing on the card but other than that everything else was good
F	send sympathy_bouquet to apologise to sister in law - they just refunded my money ( which they would have to have done anyway and said thay would discipling the florists ???
M	on reordering my item , i was then told it would wouldn_'_t be shipped for another 0_weeks which isn_'_t acceptable
F	great service .
F	my coat arrived in good time , but it isn_'_t the high_quality i would expect from superdry .
M	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
M	great product variety too !
M	by this point i was disappointed and starting to get angry , but then i started to lose my cool as there was zero hint of an_apology .
M	great , prompt service . well_done .
F	my eye_surgery has worked_brilliantly and i have not had any_problems as yet .
M	i contacted them after having only a 00_% germination_rate , and they were courteous and very quick to respond .
F	i would say 00_% of purchases go very smoothly with achica , when they do it is a fantastic idea and a fantastic range of products .
F	i received no text .
F	next time , if i find something that i really , really want , and the same items is cheaper in other netshops , i will order from those others .
M	second time i '_ve been in here since it moved and got served by the same guy .
M	easy - of - use website , great selection , and detailed_information on the glasses .
M	and don_'_t get me started on the ' one - click ' name .
M	parts in good condition as_described :)
M	order , receive the seal , fit seal , result dry floor .
F	provides a great service but it took_ages to figure_out how to put the starter_kit together ( there were no instructions ) it looked like a lethal weapon in reality and not something i want to bring out in my handbag .
F	a further tale was ' spun ' around answering phone_calls in the shop .
M	i was shocked to hear this as i hadn_'_t even tested the waterproof capabilities of the phone and it had never even been anywhere_near water .
F	would recommend paying a couple of pounds more for a local_florist .
F	on vients de me dire_que_je devais utiliser tout le plein ,
F	very helpful , jacket was superb .
M	sent e_- mail to advise
F	once again , i have been back to ultralightoutdoorgear as they simply offer the best price and the best service for what i was looking for .
M	good initial choice of glasses and try at home service , but then had to keep ringing you and when i did i had to have my prescription at hand with date of test - when i did not have it ( at work ) was told that had to have it to discuss with optician , but when insisted that it was only for a discussion about use of varifocal_lens use , the operator reluctantly put me through .
F	we purchased these items when there on special and in this case to put away for xmas .
F	i was happy with the outcome , but they rang me at work on a couple of occasions before the renewal date , which i didn_'_t need .
F	not great after long flight to have to buy all essential on day one late at night .
M	overall , not a great experience .
M	vodafone is denying my wife access to her account online and as she is signed_up for paperless billing so has no access to her account !
M	if that is all is costs , next , throw it in for free - i was spending £_000 !
F	thank_you very much .
M	the next_day , i contact serenata_flowers and receive a reply very swiftly .
M	no , we can '_t do that .
F	no tree has_been delivered and no explanation as to why not !
F	excerllent service really fast at paying .
F	the second bouquet arrived ( heaven only knows what happened to the first one !)
M	great site , would definitely recommend to anyone .
M	this site was the cheapest at £_00 . 00 delilvered , so i ordered .
M	0 out of 00
M	this was manifestly untrue and they had no time or details to back up their statement .
F	seeing as the return will cost me £_00 i '_m not going to bother and so i am stuck with a bean_bag i don_'_t want
M	the clips in the holes don_'_t clip on properly so had to use old ones as these work better .
F	the breakfast however was very good .
F	they may be slightly more_expensive on some items but overall very competitive .
F	worst delivery experience i '_ve ever had !!
F	they ensured me this would only take a few_days unlike the first ocassion that took 0_weeks .
F	a couple of years_ago we made a very clever decision to purchase an inverter heater from dry it out which runs on paraffin extra .
M	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
F	straightforward ordering , and delivery tracked to ensure convenient time and date - and , of course - competitive price .
M	iam now waiting the outcome
F	however , the staff were very friendly and helpful .
M	to their credit , i did get a sincere_apology and my payment was refunded same day .
F	i am now happy with sportpursuits response to my problems .
F	poor expensive food and duty_free area .
M	they have done all they say they do & in me have a customer for life .
F	their courier company did not collect for days , and i had to do most of the running around to try to get the correct items to site .
F	i ordered my items from kiddicare on 00 december_0000 .
M	i '_m actually quite impressed with the service .
F	i '_ve been a loyal_customer with an average contract spend of over_£_000 .
F	contacted groupon to be informed that the company had gone_bust the day before , mass email sent to all purchasers ( still to be received ) and telephone_call made to me ( an_absolute lie as no record of call being received or missed ).
M	i ordered a canon_lens in non - original_packaging .
M	easy to order , prompt delivery , product works .
M	i had to chase the refund on the returned item as within a week they hadn_'_t confirmed the return .
F	yes i got tablets for my poor cat mac , he is very nervous and eating himself and his fur , but sadly the tablets i purchased form this site just didn_'_t work in fact since taking them he has almost stopped eating ,
F	items arrived promptly , its a pity that the nicely_boxed item came in a bag which was not enough protection , and it reached me squashed flat .
M	well_packed , no_breakages .
M	good and quick turn_around on my order .
F	terrible service with no apology at any stage .
M	i emailed them on the 00th of june to be told that they don_'_t know what has happened and would need a further 00 working_days to resolve the matter .
F	i bought a kitchen from the meir department stoke on trent . after fitting the kitchen i found out i had to purchase the edging strip separately unfortunately the store did not have the strip and i had to order the strip directly from scotland . i was asked to pay in_advance as they could not send or order the strip for the store as it was regarded as a special order . i was charged a delivery charge which i felt was unfair as this item i feel should have been available in store . the item was to be delivered within five days but after three_weeks i am still_waiting despite a number of calls to the store . very poor customer service .
M	i was made to feel stupid not knowing the system .
F	how would that have helped anyone .
F	would highly_recommend this company - i ordered fire_blankets one afternoon and they arrived next_morning , very impressive .
M	will be using cyclestore again because i found the whole buying experience very good . even when they didn_'_t have the item i wanted , they quickly contacted me , suggested an_alternative , or swift refund , no_problems found them very helpful and reliable .
F	quick , easy and reliable .
M	speedy delivery of a good product well_packed and arrived in good order .
F	arrived on time but quite cheap considering what i paid
F	have used this company several_times in past and usually delivered within 0 working_days so surprised this order took so long .
F	full of apologies but as i order specialist_cat_food it is really bad if i run_out before my order arrives .
F	despite ordering over 0_weeks_ago !!
M	!
F	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
M	mike crook . 0000 000 0000 or 00000_000000 . any day , anytime after 00 . 00 am please .
F	i was then told by another mechanic at my local that i could have got the same things done for half the price , and that the work probably didn_'_t need doing that urgently in any case .
M	the software takes_ages to install - and even longer to uninstall .
M	no refund , waste of money
F	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
F	she said the flowers made an old lady very happy and she could not get over the lovely smell .
M	had to get towed to where i was staying in keswick - half a day wasted .
F	my sister said the flowers were lovely but i didnt want her to have to lots the same .
F	the deal i got i couldn_'_t better anywhere i tried , they were great to deal with , fast efficient and good value for money .
M	the quality was extremely bad and the £ 0 postage for something that was sent 0nd_class in an envelope was ridicolous .
M	for a flagship british company this is very dissappointing
M	please treat this as an_urgent matter .
M	avoid like the plague .
M	thanks broadband choices
F	they were the best priced lenses i could find for me , the extended_wear ones .
M	my order was over £_00 , but when i phoned them the following_day explaining i had under order they wanted me to pay a delivery charge .
F	tiles not received yet as rearranging delivery now i know who to contact !
M	now they have simply cancelled my order as a ' delivery failure ' and i am waiting to get my money back .
F	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
F	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
F	i recently ordered the frozen elsa dress for my daughter '_s birthday .
M	i very much suspect that if i had not paid by credit_card i would still be waiting for my refund .
F	" stuck in traffic " 00 : 00 where is my car ?
F	goods were delivered promptly
F	i ordered a barbour_jacket from country_house_outdoor .
F	plus one bathroom door had been locked and the key removed .
M	cheapest i could_find (£ 0 . 00 a day ).
F	this detail will stay on trust_pilot and other review sites until i receive my refund for goods not delivered to us .
M	very good experience .
M	but i '_m not convinced that the relentless voice overs proclaiming " up to 00_%_off high_street prices " applies to malt_whisky - so didn_'_t bother .
M	the order was sent very quickly , and was packed excellently , and securely .
F	seemed like they were offering a good deal .
M	used the site to purchase painkillers , was easy to search and find the active_ingredients etc .
M	very pleased with my experience and recommend them to you .
F	we handed out over 000 glow_sticks and then walked around a track - the effect was amazing a sea of purple . thanks to glowsticks . co . uk for the charity discount !
M	customer_services are less_than ideal though .
F	sooo gorgeous !
M	i went online to see if i could_find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
F	i '_d recommend them to anyone looking to book !
M	can highly_recommend this company , good communication and tracking from ordering to delivery , quick delivery , excellent packaging , good quality items and as_described . i wish all companies i deal with were as good as this .
M	want my advice ?
F	all previous parcels , including international ones , have been arranged online with no_problems whatsover .
M	0weeks later , rear_tyres required replacing ( wear and tear ) they charged my partner another £_00 for tracking again even_though they weren_'_t asked to check it .
M	the procedure was fine , the surgeons and opticians were the best , but i found the attitude of the people in the actual store pretty poor .
M	this was the game changer .
F	we were told that it was not currently in stock but some had been ordered and it could be up to 0_weeks for delivery .
M	once our bank in the uk was contacted , i assumed that the transfer would be made straight_away .
M	purchased a game from their online store , in the early hours of the night 0am ( couldn_'_t sleep ) got the order confirmation and charged accordingly , if you '_ve shopped with them online before you know the item is removed from their stocks once ordered , waited as the recommended delivery was 0 - 0 days no signs of item , waited to day 0 and still nothing , so i emailed the store in which it was coming from only to receive " the item you ordered we sold instore " which means they only sold it the morning after i had already ordered and paid for the item and furthermore did not receive any contact email / call / etc to tell me this was the case and the refund only came back after said date so i am very disappoint with this service .
F	the order was delayed by the manufacturer and it would have been better if you '_d kept me informed rather_than me having to enquire again .
F	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
M	on numerous_occasions , i had calls to my mobile from clients and prospective_clients saying that i hadn_'_t returned their call .
M	i am a very regular_visitor of cash_converters in salford but today i feel_cheated .
M	all - in - all , not much to complain_about .
F	i explained what had happened and she stated she would get in touch with the store and asked them to ring me back .
F	by the following_tuesday , dec 0rd , they still hadn_'_t arrived .
M	it was an easy to use website which was very efficient and good value .
F	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
F	i have shopped at a few places online , but this is my favourite .
M	attention to detail and to customer_care from the start to the finish is excellent .
F	when you spend £_00 on a little charm you expect the correct items to arrive .
M	so basically you pays your money , you takes your chance .
F	katie
F	my party was ruined and nobody cared !!!
M	0 .
M	as you wished , your order has_been deleted and the refund is in process .
M	very good . cannot_fault .
F	thank_you - in this day and age it is difficult to find companies who are so efficient .
F	great price , lovely product and the speed was brilliant !
F	the item ordered was urgent medication for my dogs ears .
F	anita pickering .
M	but the items were ver good
F	in any event , we returned the item pursuant to the distance_selling regulations ( something ebuyer need to read !)
F	definitely using this site again !
F	kept on hold so long had to hang up .
F	not sure if i will use this site again unless there are special_offers on .
F	there is no contact number on the whole website !
F	they should not take the money until they have carried_out any checks they require .
M	if you don_'_t they try to sell it to you for a varied amount but a lot more than £_00 .
F	desperate for a new swimsuit for aqua classes .
F	my only_complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
F	took our order and money gave_us a fitting time and then later phoned to say the wouldn_'_t have the tyres and we would need to book / agree to a later date . this has i '_m afraid put a black_mark on our experience .
M	i had no option but to buy from your store that i didnt like or either want .
F	i spent_ages looking for some new frames for my updated prescription - traipsed around all the local high_street shops but found nothing i liked .
M	the difference in my experience compared to some of the other reviews here is that for that i asked for a full_refund and the money was returned to my credit_card by the next_day .
M	i was able to do this easily on the website and as my wife does not use the pierced variety , laguna provided a unique option on the website for me to do this .
F	some of the pictures that had appeared perfectly crystal_clear on my computer ( and when i had printed them out at home ) came back very dark and slightly blurred .
M	i then ordered them online which took 00_mins and again they arrived within_00hrs with the lenses fitted along with nice cases and a cloth in each .
M	0 average
M	i asked for a refund and this time they took the glasses of me and told me that the refund will be in my credit account by 00 days .
F	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
F	however because of my bad_experience , i will not be using this company again .
M	coat is as expected , i had tried it on before so i knew it was quality .
M	keep it simply people !
F	service is absolute_rubbish !
M	upload did not work - bad
M	i like the booking and tracking and after a year i '_m still using the service , so generally i '_m happy
M	this has_been gogoing on for months now and it is a complete_joke .
M	the site is easy to use , the prices are better_than any other site i '_ve gone_through , and their customer service is the best i '_ve dealt_with .
M	hello
M	it was a letter saying they had canceled my reservation of the number i had ordered as they had not recived my payment or documents and the money i have payed is non_refundable ( wonder_how many time this happens ) so i phoned them up and got told that if i payed more money thay could hold the number_plate for me as the though i did not want to go threw with the sale ( why would i have payed the deposit if i did not want it ) so not only do i have to now pay for a replacement log_book and mot but have to pay the again for the number_plate think not as i have 0 plates from other_companys and never had to send them any documents off just payed for them and got the paperwork threw post then a trip to dvla and hay_presto number_plates changed so all in all it not aways the cheapest the best all i was saving was fourty pounds than a other site i have used in the past but now its cost me my deposit the cost of a replacment log_book and mot
M	i understand that it says on your website terms that a substitute would be provided , but as a customer you expect to get what you pay for and therefore would have been better if you had advised me that the item was different to what i expected to be sent so that i could have cancelled my order .
F	i used this service twice already , and from now on i will do as i am saving such amount of money .
M	email came through within minutes to confirm my order , and it was shipped quickly after that .
F	wowcher themselves i have had no_issues with , however , some of the suppliers they use , probably about half of my purchases can take up to 0 - 0_weeks to arrive and that is only after being chased , not 00 days .
F	arrived very quickly .
M	but after_reading some of the reviews here on trustpilot , i gave gcrc a go .
F	what an excellent seller !
F	neither are we - we won_'_t use them or any of their partner companies again .
M	i would have no_hesitation in using this company again and will be ordering all our dog_food from now on from here .
M	then said it will be up to 0 days before i get my refund .
F	not this one .
M	this is in breach of the distance_selling_regulations .
F	i didn ; t see this properly explained in the booking procedure
F	email to customer service . nothing .
M	good value and very speedy service .
M	0 week_later 0 pairs of specs arrived , i checked my card account to find money had been taken twice .
F	thought delivery charges rather high but pleased overall at whole_experience
F	i priced the items i wanted up with national_shower_spares with another leading company .
M	estimated despatch was 0 - 0 days .
F	some items out of stock so the whole order delayed !
M	don_'_t bother to email p0go as you won_'_t get a reply .
F	i would recommend using this site to all my friends and family as we go to at_least one fancy_dress_party every year .
F	finish dishwasher cleaner x 0
M	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
F	got to add that both my neighbours were in and were not asked to take my package .
F	order arrived super - fast and great communications !
F	- boite vocale au téléphone ,
M	they compared the market for me , came up with better quotes than i had been able to find myself , consolidated my four pension_pots into one and liaised with all the insurance companies on my behalf .
F	now on amazon its back up to £_00 . 00 but still has free delivery , so if you are seriously wanting to buy this boot , check amazon first .
F	speedy , very well_packed delivery as well as up to date text and email_updates - very impressed .
F	we had to call them in the end .
M	always easy to find what i require .
F	they refused to call us prior to delivery to get access and it was only by sheer_luck that another company let them in after 0pm when we had closed !
F	the member of staff that i spoke to was very helpful .
F	images were fuzzy and the paper was lighter .
M	fee should have remained the same as at the start of the procedure .
F	a quick search on google_search_engine and up popped service stop winners of dragon '_s den !
F	fitting_instructions poor , one a0 sheet of paper which only a fitter would be able to decipher .
M	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two_days after .
F	they came back with £_000 . 00 , claiming that there were scratches on the screen .
M	i have brought items from wineware before .
F	this is the 0rd order i have placed with firstaid0sport and every time the order has arrived extremely quickly and the products are exactly as_described .
M	the product itself is top_class and suffice to say i will be placing similiar orders for other special occasions over the next few_months .
F	i would shop non_stop it '_s not fun when you order items that you know fit through the letter_box and they are put in a massive box and you then have to wit 0_days to collect
F	you can tell the website is well - supported -- never any foul language , any_problems with the reviews .
M	the above invoice , this note is to thank_you for the speed of delivery .
M	waited in all day .
F	i love my purchases but did have to get the superglue out for my stud details on hi tops .
M	they did ring back after i complained but i can '_t be_arsed to chase it up as they only answer phone 0 - 0 mon to fri and i '_m in work then .
M	electronic ticket received with reserved seat on inter_city and eurostar service .
F	i have only purchased a power adapter for my owl meter .
M	this is very bad_practice as had i ordered the same item from different suppliers at similar times , as often is the case , i would not have known what came from whom , especially if one got lost , arrived damaged etc .
F	they were quick enough to take my money though .
M	when adult shoes cost less and you know they ' re made in bangladesh and other third world countries you can guess_what they cost to make and what the poor urchin that made them got paid . you know its child exploitation from both_ends .
M	as i still want the tyre i ' d actually ordered i had to ask whether i could not just leave my order on and be contacted once they were available .
F	i replied if i '_m returning the wrong item , who will pay for the postage , and suggested a pre_- paid envelop to be arranged , but never_heard from them since then .
F	thank_you pc_specialist .
F	i have used animed on several_occasions now and have always found them very helpful when i have phoned them - however on this occasion when speaking to someone to confirm that they had received my prescription by fax ( this been a thursday 00th_dec ) i was told yes they had but the vet hadnt looked at it yet and it would probably be monday the 00th before the vet looked at it and i would be lucky to get the order before xmas !
M	will_certainly use the service again .
F	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder_mystery event on a particular date .
F	update .
F	the website was easy to use , fast delivery service and very helpful on the telephone
M	the flowers exceeded_expectations and the service was great !
F	the only_negative_point is that the bracelet was a bit too large , especially for women so that they didn_'_t dare to wear it .
F	didn_'_t want anything too elaborate and accepted the suggested bouquet .
M	really the most_important_thing when you need medicines .
M	and very disappointed with the company that seems to boast good quality !
F	the £ 0 pair were not quite as great as the others , but only really because the fit wasn_'_t so comfortable , the quality isn_'_t poor by any means .
M	i would buy from them again .
M	the goods are well_packed .
F	i ordered insulin on sunday - i realise that this is not a working day so was expecting the product to turn_up on tuesday , because of its nature the website said it would be on " next_day delivery " by courier .
F	a big thank_you to all of the staff at age_partnership .
F	they chucked in a box of chocolates which was fair_enough .
M	i sourced the westfalia detatchable towbar from p_f jones as the garage i bought my car from quoted me a much higher price for same item .
M	then you could in theory go through it all again .
M	they offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets .
M	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else '_s incompetence .
M	, surely if this account is void then my deposits this week should be declared void and returned ??????
M	great choice probably enough to spend a whole day going through .
M	ordered seeds , got them in only 00 days_later , which is good , my order was correct , but the seeds i germinated , only 00 out of 00 cracked .
F	user_friendly web_site , very easy to book with .
M	" try without reserving seats ".
F	i ordered a lot of things before christmas and most of it arrived without_any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
F	again there was nothing from the company so i escalated the claim and paypal received no response from then so they refunded my money .
M	highly_recommend mazuma_mobile to anyone .
F	i was so happy to receive a product that seems better_than some of the £ 0000 buggys out there and all thanks to the buggybaby help i received .
M	he dumped the parcel on the doorstep and made a hasty retreat
F	delivery fast and packaging superb .
M	for me , herbies has_been spot on every time .
F	ordering is simple , the collect_+ service is an excellent part of the process for those of us who cannot be at home on a specific day , waiting for a delivery to arrive .
F	i sent the item back via_royal_mail signed for delivery , which was received and signed for the following_day by escapade .
M	bought the product easily , but nowhere did it state how long delivery was , or if it did , it was not very clear .
F	i recommend this website and will use it again .
M	the average response time for an answer is currently : 0 hrs for the ticket to be resolved .
M	the fitting_centre contacted tyre_shopper who apparently said that the chosen tyres were not available after all and that they ' d tried to phone me .
F	again my advice to anyone is to shop elsewhere .
F	i am not hard to please , when i get what i ask for i am usually fine .
F	we have ordered several_times from wineware in the past and always had good service .
M	oliver 0 day
F	fab
F	quoted price seemed fair but always subject to re valuation upon_receipt which i just thought meant i '_d get less but true to word got price quoted so definitely not scammers !
M	( nike )
M	everything was great until i upgraded and right now i '_m reserving judgement because something has changed .?
F	it came in 0 working_days and is beautiful !
M	the flowers in the bouquet i received were not worth the money paid i '_m afaid . half of them were chrysanthemums which are very cheap flowers anyway & on day 0 i have thrown several dead flowers away . not what you expect for the price paid so will not be using this company again .
F	the flowers were delivered and now my english family is happy .
F	the surprise of receiving the flowers was spoilt entirely .
F	when i asked to speak to a manager the sales girl [_name_] said she was busy and would call me back which of course she didn_'_t then wouldn_'_t answer any of my calls after .
F	the concert was amazing .
M	the page freezes the internet .
M	order reached me within 0 days , and item works_perfectly .
M	the man at the top of the organisation always gives a damn .
M	well it is isn_'_t it
M	at this point they had not contacted me in any way to say my camera was going to be late .
F	shame they didn_'_t get it right first time
M	bought 0 mugs .
M	very misleading and very disappointing .
M	easy to put on and comfortable .
M	but the items i did order arrived very quickly indeed - the usual brilliant service .
M	it is now weds . 00th .
M	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
M	just ordered a down vest from these_guys .
M	when i was buying a house i was appauled at some estate_agents inability to conduct a reasonable viewing .
M	from my own experience in online retail , royal_mail have never struggled as early as 0st week in december & there is nothing on the royal_mail service updates on their site to suggest they are experiencing any_problems south of scotland .
M	when i did eventually receive my old reading_specs with new lenses and nose_pieces the lenses scratched very quickly , although i ordered scratch_resistant covering .
F	got an_email me asking to review mynpurchase , when i called the phone number on the email , it stated that the number was incorrect and that i would have to dial another number , very poor customer service .
F	got exchange days_later and the same thing happened again so i am returning the second_pair but this time i will get a refund , shame as i liked the boots .
M	i would recommend anyone that thinks about using this company goes elsewhere - i suspect they are a scam company to be honest .
M	only had it a few_months but it is brilliant - very quiet and very quick compared to the old one .
F	that was fine so i did .
M	call again over 0 hour - asked to speak to same guy - he wouldn_'_t take call .
F	they have a fluorescent pink accent to them which is not pictured on the site , and is not mentioned at any point in the description .
M	a reall god company to do_business with .
M	at last we agreed with an other price for the whole car , but i '_m not sure at all why i had to pay more then at the moment of the booking , and why that was needed .
F	i placed an order customer number 0000000000 order delivery enquiry 000000000 and i received a confirmation for my order but did not receive my items and my order disappeared from the site !
M	would definitely use flashbay again , should the need_arise .
M	purchase and selection was simple .
M	eventually plumbworld sent out a second delivery with my stuff via a different delivery partner , seems that the first set had got lost by yodel .

F	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
F	i am completely_satisfied with his answers and his response .
F	we were completely at a loss as to what to do , especially with the time difference , we could not phone argus up and explain the situation .
M	and not delivered .
M	even received text_message giving me drivers_name and phone number along with 0 hour delivery slot .
F	now my seat is comfortable and safe .
M	ordered a pair of glasses from the site which was easy to use .
F	excellent service .
F	however , they came with free chocolates which i didn_'_t want ,.
M	i could have gone to the sender and collected it instead of using these jokers and it would have cost me less_than using this lot .
M	i '_ve ordered twice from urban_industry and both_times have been an_absolute_pleasure .
M	the yodel depot is a 00 min drive each way from where i live , and i do not live out in the sticks , i live near birmingham .
F	pig in a poke guess whether the standard or better or the best made any , if what degree , of difference .
F	shame the envelopes were blue inside , couldn_'_t see from picture or description , was hoping they were white inside .
F	very please with the process , i have used mazuma several rime and would definitely use it again
F	cash for things i was buying anyway .
M	the service from buybrandtools . com can not be_faulted .
M	we were asked to take photographs of the problem and email them on to prove the chair was faulty which we duly did .
M	i - flower were chased on 00th_december and we were assured of delivery before 0pm on christmas_eve .
M	we were not after material gain , just a good old_fashioned apology .
M	if you want divorce - online to handle the whole divorce for you , it gets very expensive .
M	this had been printed on the paperwork inside the package but not on the envelope .
M	the quality of the manufacture finishing also leaves something to be desired , specifically tacking threads left in , buttonholes not well finished .
F	received an_email in german on friday 00th_april and couldn_'_t get to speak to anyone untill the monday when i was told that this email was telling_me that the seller couldn_'_t supply the tickets and that they were offering me tickets for the o0 - she asked me if this was acceptable at which point i made her aware that the o0 concerts had indeed already happened !
M	thank_you for all your help - bike is fabulous .
F	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0_months .
M	the only thing that i could do was to pay the £_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
F	i placed an order on 00th_oct which was due to be delivered 0nd nov .
M	i '_ve found the staff very helpful when inquiring via_email and would be happy to recommend them to family / friends .
M	sent away for goods . did not arrive . no contact phone number to ring , no answer to numerous e_- mails , non - existent customer service , and worse . no refund !
M	super service .
F	from a youth centre point of view - our centre has sessions for young people 00 - 00_yrs and we have found over the past few_years that items ordered from the happy_puzzle_company are great for getting young people to socialise and learn with each other .
M	found the staff i spoke to v helpful and professional when discussing the different brands and what factors count for the right size and fit .
M	latest order was sent in two parcels , one parcel went_astray but that was citylink '_s fault and arrived the next_day [ website showed 0 parcels but they only delivered 0 ].
M	i would start by saying that the company has_been going for many_years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
M	things are shipped quickly , arrive very quickly , and are in good condition
F	the alternative was ok but certainly not worth the £_00 + it cost - more like £_00 .
M	many_thanks anyway for you assistance .
F	i bought a vampire costume that had a collar standing up although the actual product was not entirely like this .
F	i was buying a jigsaw as a gift and wanted to include a message - who the parcel was from .
M	rp00ray
F	so happy with the price an speed of the proses , it all happened just as i was told that is very rear i would recommend them to everyone !
F	trying to get a refund from these is like trying to get water out of a stone , only the stone would probably be a lot more helpful and courteous .
M	oh why i did not use google before ordering !
M	really ?
M	so long_story_short , very friendly and fast responses , but the web_site order process needs a revamp to make such things much clearer , we would probably use again , but would cancel if we ended_up in the same situation again .
M	the electronic handbrake system is very dangerous as you can start the car and rev the engine and it disengages by itself .
M	however i made the mistake of also trying a top secret hotel deal .
M	i only wanted to check the balance of an isa , but alas , with m & s money you cannot do this online .
F	the text therefore did not make_sense .
F	delivery was on time and i was kept_informed by the carrier of where my parcel was at all times down to the hour which it was delivered .
F	they do not care about their customers at all .
F	i have now had 0 expensive items smashed by them and these were not fragile items but they still managed to smash them and of course the scam comes into place and no compensation .
M	!
F	was unsure if this was legit to start with .
M	did finally receive the discount in the form of a partial_refund but only after i sent a message and got deferred to somebody_else .
F	will give more detail when i have more time .
F	i decided that these were the tiles for me , phoned tons of tiles and ordered and the arrived the following_day .
M	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
M	i was peased with the product which was easy to assemle as advertised .
F	worth ever penny .
F	very , very poor service , for which i have paid .
F	it '_s a shame the shower_screen pole was too short and i have to order a longer one and pay extra postage .
F	the first contact i made was on 00th_feb , the day of the gig , this was confirmed as having been received , with an assurance that events happening within 00_hours would be treated as urgent .
M	nmt service
F	i always knew tesco was never great for quality of product but i overlooked that because it was cheap .
F	it was easy t order , they arrived when they said they would and mum in law was delighted . will def use again , thank_you x
M	surely he must have realised that i '_ve just had a new avon on the same axle and that as it '_s also the drive axle , it '_s even more important that it shouldn_'_t have two different tyre manufacturers on it !
F	very efficient company who kept me informed from the moment i placed the order .
M	there was little else to do , very likely because it was mid - week so we weren_'_t too bothered , but will just be prepared with some dvds next time : d
M	great service & best price i found
F	i got the message on time friday_night , the courier was open on saturday am , i had transport to collect them etc .
F	the mothers_day flowers i have just bought for my mother have made my day , stunning and free chocolates and card thrown in - couldn_'_t ask for more !
M	my first experience with watchfinder was excellent with an immaculate rolex daydate sold to me as quoted , no_complaints and a lovely new model .
M	very disappointed my goods were supposed to be here last_week not very satisfactory !
M	don_'_t buy anything from wayfair . co . uk !
M	oops i ordered the wrong cartridges !
M	disgraceful service but only just less_than average for the uk .
M	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an email every 0 - 0 days ).
M	found a fault with water leaking in , rang the company , send them the guarantee to transfer into our names .
M	than you .
F	thank_you both for a wonderful and reliable service .
F	the costume i brought for myself is perfect and it was a really good price .
M	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there '_s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
F	also shipping was 0 week to france , and reaaonably priced .
F	they kept me informed when i could expect them .
F	i placed this order on 00 april , which was despatched on 00 april and not received until 00th_april .
F	on 00 march i paid by paypal hoping it might be done soon .
F	will be using drumstop again .
F	we were notified in_advance of the delivery date & time which was very helpful .
M	a couple of days_later i was £_00 richer for a pretty_much write off htc_sensation ( offer on three website gave_me a bonus £_00 )
M	panicked until it swore in english .
F	my neighbor finally gave them to me and explained that the man working on her garden had signed and taken them in .
M	not sure why but i thought i had put the correct detail in .
M	i said no thanks .
M	clearly it can '_t be used for the first book as i emailed to ask it i could use it on my first book and was turned down .
M	i should also add that a message has_been left on the answering_machine asking me to call them up on a premium_rate number !
M	great value , particularly considering the weight capacity .
F	i bought an item for them in november_0000 as a christmas_present which never arrived .
M	i had to return the item for a larger_size , and even the new xl product feels smaller than my size l windcheater bought three years_ago .
M	this is obviously nonsense and a lie , why describe them as 00x00 ?
M	do i need anything more .
F	0 .
M	edit_: completely understand about your terms and conditions , after all i accepted them when i sent my goods to you .
M	many record shops pack records separate to take account of this .
M	despite_being relatively new to the technical side of recording , i knew i needed a certain spec of equipment for my projects and i also knew that i was on a budget .
M	i have been left unsatisfied in every possible way with workwear_express ' initial service , customer service and after sales .
M	my order took much longer to arrive than all other products i order via the web .
F	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
M	new aldi in westbury wiltshire , good value for money , difficult to find items , my pet_hate is children with goodness_knows what on their shoes allowed to stand in trolleys , only been open a week and the empty trolleys full of empty packaging .
F	i cannot make contact with our daughter , to warn her of the danger to her_beloved_pets .
M	not learning my lesson ordered a hells kitchen knife_block & knives rrp £_00 . 00 wowcher offer £_00 . 00 got voucher ordered knives early september . still_waiting despite mailing complaint to wowcher who passed complaint to ' gadgets & gifts ' who i think are asociated with wowcher though i have no proof but the garden games were from g & g .
F	james_wellbeloved dog_food , and other items
F	the chicken_fillets are first_rate and such good value for money .
M	( dark mad hatter ).
F	there was no communication between the company and the delivery company whatsoever .
F	free delivery is fantastic and the shoes were delivered only two_days after ordering at the weekend .
F	cost to us was the repair of the track .
M	makes no difference i was told !
M	despite a few_teething troubles the company provided a consistently good service .
M	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an immediate_refund and confirm .
M	delivered on time but you forgot to send me the tracking good which i had spend some time getting out of you .
F	i am happy to book with sky_park , but i think that the booking charge is excessive
F	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
F	i purchased the bust of diana as a christmas gift for my mother , they called and instead of speaking to me they spoke to her to let her know my order had been shipped , unbelievable !
F	apparently a phone_call was attempted to let_me know it had not been possible the day after they were due which was a sunday_afternoon and i was out .
M	very disappointed as flowers were ordered for my partner for her_birthday but did not arrive_till 0 . 00 in the evening , but will say bouquet was lovely
M	very satisfied customer .
M	i used evo . com in the end , they were the polar opposite and would definitely recomend .
F	good layout and design and visually classy looking .
M	so come on teakwarehouse , get someone to answer the phone and reply to emails .
M	the fitter came to my house on a day and time that suited me and did an excellent and fast job .
M	i protested persistently and made reference to my statutory_rights but got nowhere .
M	tickets have always arrived in plenty of time and any_queries have been dealt_with promptly & professionally .
M	next was the message that goes on the flowers card we thought it was originally , we were told it could be added at the end of the order process , we saw no such option , we did see an option to edit the " card " we originally mistook for this , but that was all , if it was there it needs to be made clearer , so we contacted them asking for this message to be added , as we were not able during the order process , they were quick to reply and happy to forward our message to be added .
M	fortunately it only lasted 00_minutes .
F	no_hesitation in leaving nothing but highest recommendation !
M	i can understand that they may not want to buy dvd '_s that are not watched by many people , but informing_me of them not getting this ever / an eta for this would be a better way of managing expectations .
M	i called it to see whether i could get the car breaker name - there was a lengthly recorded_message which i put down again after a minute or so .
F	i can '_t fault this company .
F	they then tried to organise someone_else for 0pm the same day , so i had to return to apartment . i arrived early but by 0 . 00pm there was no show , so i called the agency .
M	saturday_morning finally had a call back , but as it was weekend they could not help !!
F	i was pleasantly_surprised and amazed to receive an_email the next_day , saturday_afternoon , confirming the boots had been received back and my refund processed .
F	unfortunately there was only 0 option for delivery which was £ 0 . 00 !!!
F	villa very average compared to previous villas we have stayed in .
M	what has not been mentioned as far as i know , is that for some strange reason when i changed to talk_talk , i was suddenly receiving calls from indian_call_centres trying to sell me things , when i managed to wriggle_out of their misleading contract and changed supplier they stopped .
F	this was done but there is some problem with the funds and i am still_waiting for them to clear into my account
M	asked for a replacement told i had to return the faulty trolley for examination by ' engineers ' - not an acceptable solution i wanted a ' new ' fully working trolley and in time for a golf match !
M	there was a bit of a delay in receiving the refund but after a reminder from me i received the refund via_paypal .
F	?
F	the ordering process was very easy and quick .
M	for example it '_s hard to find details on excess and how to include loss cover ( i don_'_t think it '_s possible with an ipad but i still can '_t be sure ).
M	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football_team .
F	van harte bedankt
F	sure enough a yodel van came up and the man got out from the drivers seat and got into the back of the van and was in there for about 0mins .
M	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
F	however , all the staff i spoke to seemed most efficient and courteous , and even the late delivery driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful . just unfortunate that by the second delivery date ( after waiting for the item to be in stock ) time was crucial and so particularly marred my opinion - shame this is the first of 00 radiators needed !
F	i '_m a recent recruit but i love bureaudirect .
M	however hermes tracking tells_me that on several_occasions they have failed to deliver because of access problems .
M	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
M	another good feature is updates by text from royal_mail on the delivery progress .
F	would i buy from them again . no .
F	the previous tenant moved out and the new_tenant moved in the day after .
M	i contacted them by phone and was told that this was an error and not to worry .
M	i kept saying no but they constantly pester and try to force you to buy something .
F	if their customer service is this bad , i don_'_t even want to imagine the final product !
M	!
M	unfortunately the item was damaged ( probably due to being loaded and unloaded 0 times from the previous delivery attempts ).
F	she said that while i did that she would prepare everything , but i was finished in a couple of minutes and had to wait quite a while for the assistant to have everything done .
F	customer service is very friendly and willing but a bit amateurish .
M	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false_sense of security .
F	great service , a good price and an excellent sparkly ring that am very very happy with .
F	i am utterly disapointed , they definitely don_'_t look the way they do in the picture , it was for my mums_birthday , thought it would be nice to get flowers delivered , i would have been better going to asda and picking_up a bunch for £ 0 & paying someone £_00 to deliver , would have looked far_superior , £_00 down the drain lesson definatley learned
F	saying that , the item is of good quality and the delivery time was quicker_than i expected .
F	they simply didn_'_t deliver the flowers and blamed their courier .
M	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can '_t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort_out their diabolical mistakes .
F	måtte købe en ting i butikken for at få lov at_bestille en lampe der kun kunne købes i butikken men som ikek var hjemme .
M	rang to say i would be 00_minutes early and was basically told to forget it by some rude man on a mobile .
F	agent has promised to ring back in 00mins with maybe correction , i do hope so .
M	it '_s just not good business all_round .
M	top_class service highly_recommended .
M	checked the tracking_number to find that the parcel had arrived in the local parcelfarce depot at 0 : 00 in the morning but they couldn_'_t manage to get it into a van for delivery .
M	no offer of any deal they can do on another similar model , simply go away and get another one ….
M	then came back and said another 00 days ( splutter had let them down .
M	great easy to use website , shows the monthly price of the car immediately even if you fiddle with the deposit and optional_extras , whereas usually other_companies ask for your contact details or ask you to contact them before they even show you any kind of price .
F	however the situation was rectified and a new product was sent the following_day .
M	0_weeks_later i haven_'_t heard a word from them and no call to check if all is ok .
M	really pleased with the car it '_s just such a shame that promises were continually broken and that i had to do all the chasing continually .
F	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
M	!
M	i always use viovet it '_s quick and easy and you save_money
M	i do regularly purchase items of clothing or music from chemical_records and i have yet to be disappointed by their service .
M	perhaps it would have been better to wrap it in tissue_paper ,
F	delivery was on time and the two delivery men were very professional .
M	and after fitting it for me .
F	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has_been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
F	if you '_ve never done it then you must go . you '_ll never forget it !!
F	i bought a length of ball chain to replace a broken on a window blind .
F	looked online , ordered and they were with my by lunch_time following_day .
F	however the photo reproduction quality is poor , colours are darker_than they should be and images are flat .
F	can '_t fault them !
M	ordering was ok but , site is a little cumbersome .
M	i contacted pedalon by email to find out that i had to order 0 spoke because of the postal_costs .
M	read the other reviews and be warned !!!!
M	plumbworld was easy to deal with so i '_m looking at them for a forthcoming bathroom refurb .
M	placed my order on the weekend , it was a good price and dispatched the first working day , for delivery on the tuesday - which was excellent , or so i thought .
F	the voucher is showing as reddemed so i presume the compnay are claimin he have done the job .
M	the lesson here is to shop around however much you trust someone .
M	i only kept going because i had already spent a lot of time on it .
M	excellent service , good quality , quick and efficient .
F	it took another few_days and a day off work to finally get the camera .
M	nothing delivered .
M	i wasn_'_t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0_weeks , so not too long a wait .
F	able to pick_up purchases really easily , so the shopping_experience is fine .
F	hopefully this has now all be rectified .
M	i don_'_t need cover from midnight to midnight , i need cover when i pick_up the car !
M	somebody_else already was aware of the problem which made me think why they hadn_'_t fixed it before !
M	the banner arrived in 0 days .
F	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
F	the 0 nonstick oven trays have all been used and were actually non - stick hooray .
M	order was immediately cancelled , but then i was told it would take up to 00 days for my credit_card to be refunded .
M	i can_honestly_say every order has_been swiftly delivered , and when a parcel did go missing , the customer_services team where fast to respond and arrange a replacement order , which arrived within 0 days .
M	i had to wait_until i got home to be able to get it sorted .
F	i would use them again .
F	there are only 0 photos in our book with photos that we are not happy with and that is why i '_ve rated it a 0 .
M	te flowered looked a little too green with few flowers .
M	even better , when the jacket was returned because it was the wrong_size a replacement arrived 00hrs_later .
F	it was really quick , the product was great value for money and of excellent quality .
M	matt form oldham
F	their prices are competitive .
F	a week_later i had the bag and even_though was thrilled with product i couldn_'_t feeling alet down by the customer service .
M	i came_across cittech via quantum by luck really - got a quote and almost thought whats the catch ?!
F	trying to deal with talk_talk customer service is like some hideous test on a tv game show , can you keep your cool ?
M	having tried my first few pods now i '_ve got mixed views on them as a long_term viable_alternative to genuine nespresso .
M	for headlight re alignment and bulb replacement cost £_00 quid including mot .
M	bathrooms and showers_direct came up with the best price , and delivery was received within 00_hours .
F	0 .
F	fast delivery good deals
F	this part of the service really put me off and if it wasn_'_t for another company not being_able to match the deal i wanted i would have gone_elsewhere !
M	we are both speaking the same language .
F	crazy .
F	then they delivered it a day early when she wasn_'_t even checked in the hospital yet .
M	parts did not fit like oem - easily and after wairing so long to get them i had to go buy oem hoses from dealership because the fit was so poor .
M	i first telephoned about a product was given very good advice , i then ordered online and it was delivered the next_day with text from courier with 0_hr delivery window
F	so gave_me a number to call .
M	if only all retaillers were as friendly to deal with as these .
M	if you don_'_t know what is best for your goals just ask them and they will make some recommendations for you .
F	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
M	- it '_ll be sent on latter !
F	it was agreed that the landline only should be entered - and that brittany_ferries would like to know the mobile number nearer the time .
F	not a chip of glass out of place due to brilliant packaging !
F	packaging very practical and all plants arrived in excellent condition .
F	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
F	i found this item by searching the web and found this company .
F	i hope so as would expect a bit more from the money i spent .
F	so why this 0_star_review of 000 - reg then ?
F	eventually , the manager picked_up , who was initially aggressive and extremely defensive .
M	they refused .
F	had no problem finding the product i wanted as their website is well_organised .
M	sent my spare_parts order out very quickly and thankfully it fixed my issue , will use again
F	remarkably quick .
M	this resulted_in threats by 0 of the directors of supaglazing , where they both stated they would remove all the newly fitted windows and threatened the 0 nice / competent fitters with the sack .
M	i don_'_t even have to worry_about that part of the transaction , because animed keep me informed of how much " credit " is left on the prescription .
F	the lack of respect in answering potential customer '_s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won_'_t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
M	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling_regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
M	not worned of avis being off airport , so not sure what was happening , finally picked_up by transport and taken off to their new office but late at night not too sure where we where taken , so the return of the car was a little dificult to find , but once there we where then transported back to the airport quite quickly ,
F	00 days after despatch and i '_m still_waiting in anticipation .
M	having 0 teenagers makes this store a must . the prices are just right .
M	haven_'_t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven_'_t run into any_problems ( yet ).
M	their recorded_message didn_'_t even have the courtesy to claim they were experiencing " higher_than usual call volumes " like many companies do to hide the fact they have laid off a large number of staff .
M	after a lot of telephone_conversations with very courteous people i was given a ' troubleshooting ' check list ( good job i have an engineering background !)
F	but as frustrating as the financial side was , the disgraceful comments on the phone sealed maid0clean as the worst company experience i '_ve ever had .
F	i '_ve told evans i won_'_t be shopping with them again and if i see a delivery service that offers hermes as the courier , then i won_'_t bother .
M	got email in morning stating a 00 minute time window for delivery and arrived on time .
F	very happy customer .
F	its ridiculous .
M	plus you get lifetime_warranty .
M	i am not happy .
F	i was kept_fully up to date as to when my order would be arriving and was given a one hour time_slot , which_meant i didnt have to wait in all day .
F	morale of the story is " don_'_t take the rubbish they come up with when they are at fault . they '_ll have you believe it '_s you that '_s in the wrong and try to fob you off with a credit_note so they don_'_t loss the money ."
M	kr jones
F	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
M	never buying from there again .
F	this really works - love the site and the products .
F	overall , good service .
F	this is one reason_why sometimes i go off shopping at tesco for a long time .
F	loving the special_offers !
M	with friendly and professional service highly_recommend this site and will be using it again !!!
M	had an awful 0 month saga with this company .
M	the guy was very helpful and didn_'_t talk to like the proverbial cave man which is always a bonus .
M	i saved a fortune on a larger_size of metacam even_though my vet charged me a tenner for issuing the prescription .
F	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no idea if my order went through or not .
F	quick and easy
M	i am absolutely appalled with prestige_flowers .
M	im going to have to do what i should have all along , drive to a local tyre shop , pay a few_quid more than grippy for the tyres that i want , fitted in front of my eyes , done !
M	this company provides a very poor service and lacks proper control of customer service
F	the flowers were for my best friend of 00 years birthday and they failed to arrive on the date requested .
M	would recommend
F	the memory_module arrived quickly and worked as_described .
F	if i wanted to go_ahead with the loan i would need to contact the office myself and arrange it all as he didn_'_t have time to do this .
F	even_though clearly on the arrival screen it confirmed this .
M	i very satisfied with this merchant
F	after an extremely long and painful call with scottish_power i determined that they are stating that the £ 0 i did not pay in respect of my december bill is outstanding and this has_been added to my new bill ( yet all being show as an outstanding bill from december ?).
F	i got the product quickly but when i received it the product was a bit scuffed and had a dark stain on it .
M	because they will ring you telling you about the delivery and before you know it you are being sold an ongoing warranty , which will double the price of the product over time .
F	they were sent to the complex in which she lived to be on the table in the communal lounge .
M	never got a better delivery ever .
F	excellent service , would highly_recommend
F	then , checking my email box , a message from carshop : " we notice you haven_'_t submitted a review yet .
M	all in all this is my 0nd order ( 0st went fine ) which was very disappointing , customer service was good but felt more could have been done / offered to replace my missing item .
F	if it had rained , any attempt to lift the goods would have meant the cardboard_packaging was too sodden to retain the 00kg it contained .
F	thry have competitive_pricing and are very fast with delivery .
F	would i get my money back ?
M	they will not ship the item in stock so i now have to wait 0 . 0 months to receive my order , which has already been paid for and for which i had been mis_- informed twice .
F	not heard_anything back from this company since the order was placed 0_days ago .
F	etc .
F	learn your sizes please !
M	offered delivery refrund which didnt show .
M	item still not received despite the agreement saying it would be delivered in 0 working_days .

M	as above .
F	when we returned to our car which was quite far away from the meet and greet office we found the door was not properly shut and car was unlocked !
M	they then charged e000 for fuel ( full_tank , return empty ) plus e00 for comprehensive insurance , all plus 0 % currency_conversion_rate to £'_s .
F	avoid_avoid_avoid .
M	this property itself was much much_better and very clean but the area was totally different - ' bungalow land '.
F	excellent service would recommend .
M	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
F	will definitly use them again .
M	i am defiantly purchasing again from this company .
F	very friendly and helpful .
F	i was disappointed .

M	well_done , we have the piece of furniture we wanted .
M	!
F	he has several others to try which i purchased for him , but he is very discerning about food , more so since he has had coeliac_disease .
F	i ordered 0 chairs and paid in full on april 00th 0000 and the delivery date has changed 0times now due for delivery in may valerie what happened to your assurance that after 0 delivery failures you said you contacted the factory and they would definitely be delivered in jan_0000 the most_recent delivery time was week_commencing 00 april i contacted infurn last_week and was told the chairs were on schedule for delivery as planned however i checked the website and see delivery has changed to may 00 this is completely_unacceptable it will be 00 months since i placed my order i have commenced legal_action now as i doubt i will ever see the chairs it is illegal under european law what is going on in this company my money should be refunded immediately
F	i know he '_ll love it , although choosing from the massive_range was a little_tricky !
M	thanks .
F	had they contacted me sooner by email or phone i could have had my item on time .
F	the jake the pirate_costume arrived quickly and when it did arrive i was pleasantly_surprised by the decent quality .
F	we ordered the flowers and got next_day delivery . great . but we ' re delivered to 00 not 00 !
M	we fly premium_economy and feel the level of service has deterioated over the last few_years
F	in all this time i have never had a problem with either collection or delivery and have also had my hermes pick_up from another address and bring it to me .
M	i again emailed and was told that as they no_longer had the phone they could not verify this .
F	had a very urgent parcel to be collected and they give a time_slot of between 0 . 00am to 00 . 00_hours .
F	below is the text of an_email received from [_name_removed_] of fireplaces0life today ( 00th_december ) a full 00 days after he was notified of the non - delivery of my order .
F	when we received the assembled shed it was packaged terribly , wrapped in shrink_wrap with huge gaps and tears in it .
F	my aunt used to be a florist so i worry_about sending flowers to her but she is always impressed when i use clare_florist .
M	i '_m having to resort to talking to my bank now to cancel payment .
F	very pleased will be back in fact just sent another order just before i received this email .

M	so i asked them again . ' i also notice you have still not published my review yet .
M	one of the outfits was the wrong_size
F	i purchased a dualit_toaster and i can '_t grumble at the price which was very competitive and i was kept up to date on delivery times .

F	we got on to the phone to new look and they told us we had missed the courier , but how could we ?
M	!

M	though we don_'_t use a lot of the functionality in the site as manage this end though our own management software the process of buying texts is very straightforward
F	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
F	as it was the school_holidays ( we run a pre_- school ) i glanced over the description briefly and double_checked the sizing , and gave the go_ahead .
M	arrived in perfect_condition .
F	i still do not know when to expect delivery as i now cannot enter a delivery day .
M	. very poor service because if i pay straight_away i expect it to be processed straight_away not to be given options to pay more if i want it posted tomorrow .
M	i returned it in due time in september and i am still_waiting for a refund .
M	hopefully this will have made g0music more aware of the importance of their delivery options and courier company - as important to the customer as the product .
F	!
M	why did i get charged for grams and not 0 . 0kg !
M	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
M	i was much imporessed by the whole_operation at simply_paving .
F	i have used simply_supplements for many_years but after their shoddy treatment of me in the last 0_weeks i shall never use them again .
F	the freeview wasn_'_t working in the living_room which to me wasn_'_t really a problem but my boys wanted it on occasion , someone turned_up on our first night to install a washing line , then the rep came out the next_day to see if we were ok and let us know she was arranging for an engineer to come out and fix the freeview , she came back to say he would come out the next_day which he did , the day after the cleaners turned_up , we then had 0 day '_s of peaceful bliss but couldn_'_t properly relax as we felt someone_else may turn_up unannounced again , the cleaners were back again on the friday , we then had a free undisturbed weekend and monday then the cleaners turned_up again , the day after a man and woman just turned_up to go in the owners garage .
F	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for £_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
M	i have now had the time to form an opinion of the vw_transporter sportline .
F	couldn_'_t wish for better service and product is great plent of room for all the washing and still space
M	and if that is not possible , they should not take the money until they have checked !!
M	the process of selection , adding messages and purchasing could not be more straightforward .
M	when purchasing on - line however , the customer service is non_existent .
F	once enquired_about advertising and now they won_'_t leave me alone
M	another email was sent next_day with tracking_information and the day after they where delivered
M	the packaging was more than adequate and print quality was fantastic .
F	the problem was resolved but until i received the replacement tiles i had no idea what was happening with my claim .
F	i thought it was about time i contacted the company to enquire as to the whereabouts of my order .
F	do yourself a massive favour do not use this company .

F	i should get back every_penny i paid !
F	unfortunately they then went and sent exactly the same thing back to me .
F	luckily there was one inside so i stuck this on the box myself .

M	then recently i upgraded to fibre_optic broadband and have taken our telephone services from bt and talk_talk to zen - i have so_far been disappointed .
F	you could not of been more helpful to myself and my grantor and very fast service .
F	however , out of the pack of balloons that i bought i had to throw half of them away as they had holes in before even starting to blow them up .
F	quick & easy to use .
F	no - one takes any ownership of complaints or problems , and no - one ever admits that the royal_mail is in the wrong , or offers an_apology .
M	the total_cost was €_000 . 00 but to make_matters_worse centauro converted the payment to sterling without asking me at a shocking rate of exchange and i ended_up paying £_000 instead of the £_000 that it would have cost me if my own credit_card company had converted the euros to sterling
M	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking_space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
M	the design it yourself website is very easy to use .
F	i haven_'_t tried the helmet on my little_boy yet - his_birthday is in a week '_s time and it '_s to go with the new scooter he doesn_'_t know he '_s getting , but as far as service goes , i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
F	the pair of polaroid shades i got are to die for !
F	i am fuming because i ordered from what i fort was a professional florist and i paid more for their services .
M	my final issue is with them using city_link , the notoriously bad couriers .

M	typical for the town in which i live , the builders merchant where i purchased my old lock had stopped_stocking it and said that they only sell what is on show .

M	when i went to order online , the website offered me a cheaper alternative .
M	david coldwell
F	having made 0 calls to iflorist and finding out nothing in regards to the where_abouts of my flowers , i had to ring round all the florists in my town to find out who had " delivered " them ( iflorists would not tell me the name !)

M	the correspondence has_been excellent all through , delivery very quick , the package was securely_boxed and brought in by the driver , balber even followed up with what i had to do prior to my wife using the machine .
M	the damage you have caused this country while in government needs never to be forgotten , school children need to be taught about your time in office , the sad story should be told by generations so the mistake never happens again .

F	i hope that someone can contact me urgently on my mobile tomorrow to reassure_me that someone is aware of this problem and something is being done .

M	plus - delivery one item short !
F	got a camper and an awning , awning didn_'_t fit up gutter .
F	if you want a reliable service don_'_t use them .

M	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .

F	great , caring people to deal with .
F	i insisted on a refund or replacement with another model and yet none of my subsequent_emails have been acknowledged let_alone answered .

F	easy application process and set_up .
F	as i said in my opening sentence the return_journey was terrible .
F	i am def having a moan .

F	the driver was extremely rude , was difficult to find the driver in the airport , with no sign posting the pick_up service .
F	next_day delivery - i opted for first_class .
M	then when i signed it they emailed me to tell me that documents i had previously sent them was not good enough proof of no claims bonus and were going to cancel my policy .
F	no wonder they ask for a review as soon as you place your order .
M	i think its very bad that you pay a lot of money for a lovely display of flowers + chocs and people spend a lot time preparing the display for a nice_surprise for somebody to have it all wasted by a real bad delivery service . the flowers and chocs were left out side a block of flats at 0pm they did not ring the bell the person_who lived there is house bound and was in to get the door the only way she got the flowers is when i phoned at 0pm and asked her if she got them and she went out to find them .
F	thank_you !
F	got the wrong pair of sunglasses .
M	very good servis
F	amazing !
M	placed my order to trading_depot and paid via_paypal 00 / 00 / 00 , it `_s now 00 / 00 / 00 , and still i have had no return communication to my emails asking what has happened to my order !, i have even taken out a paypal_dispute , and they have not even replied to that !

F	good quality , quick shipment , great customer service
F	the goods i ordered were in stock and what i wanted , but if you want them quickly you will be disappointed !
F	pool was also not cleaned during our stay and quite mucky .
M	it was well_packaged , in good condition , and is working fine .
M	to get you to order more boxes and spend more money .
M	plus it was well_packaged .
F	, using next_day delivery .
M	both chairs are in !
F	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges . of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
F	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
M	i have been using pharmacy0u for a number of years and their service and efficiency has_been second to none .
F	- expensive delivery cost with no option to pick_up in store
M	really good delivery service and best prices on internet .
M	it was a cube amp 00 watts .
M	if you complain on this site they ban you . they are paid by and funded by casinos and all the big posters on it work for the casinos .
F	i paid a further £_00 customs and excise .
M	the fun comes when the recipient tries to pick it up particularly if its via mlhuillier !
M	as it had past 0pm i knew this meant it be the wednesday i received the goods which was fine with me .
F	i have proof of postage .
M	will_certainly use in the future .
F	i have made two orders in the last 0 years with them and have had sooo many_compliments on my glasses so the quality and standard is there !
F	then had to order 0 replacement hinges for fridge .
M	thanks for the service
M	the service from microdream who refurbish laptops is far from good i have set out the problem i have had below
F	i had been mislead on wowcher , i ordered some hair extentions under the impression that is what i was ordering , only to find out after i had paid £_00 , i had only brought the ' wowcher '.
F	the masks were sent out on the wednesday for a party on saturday .
M	will always come_back .
M	deliver perfect just 0 of the roses are doubled over and dying the next_day even_though they were put in water immediately on receipt !
M	so all fitting ' promises ' have to be taken with a pinch of salt .
M	fine .
F	and 000_euro for dropping the car to a different location .
F	feline y / d cat_food .
F	will_definately use you again & will recommend xx
F	!
F	love the name !
F	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer service via his customer service line .
F	everyone stick too next and marks and spencers they are more_expensive but have high_standards in both customer service and items .
M	first order .
M	i am still not sure where the overall price came from but i think they cost me £_00 - plus £_00 - but not sure !
F	with no customer support number , i had to rely_on emails to rectify problem .
F	maybe the packaging wasn_'_t quite right as i was expecting a box , but they shouldn_'_t be handling things bad in the first place !
M	thank_you
F	always surprised at the quality of the goods and the up to date styles .
F	even before it was used properly for the first time , the screws holding the book tray came out causing further damage .
F	not sure i '_d order again for this reason but its for a special_occasion this time .
F	my parcel was delivered very speedily , but after ringing the doorbell on our three - storey house , the delvery driver hardly gave my husband any time to get down the two flights of stairs from the top floor ( which he did immediately on hearing the doorbell ) before he had taken the parcel to a neighbour '_s house .
M	great instore service but why can '_t i take it home with me ?
M	tried three_times out on the concourse before i got an answer .
M	fonebank offer a quick and trustworthy service .
M	0 days from_start to finish .
M	brought a specialized helmet , the finish was poor at the front looked like it could have been reduce stock or seconds .
F	ordered with this company for the 0st time and have to say within the time i ordered to the time my chocolates were delivered it was like lightening .
M	cannot_fault you
M	easy to book
F	after purchase i was informed 0 out of the 0 were out of stock and therefore dispatched half an order .
F	excellent service , kept_fully_informed about delivery time and confirmation of delivery on the day .
F	i recommend them .
F	i ordered a bouquet for mothers_day using an_email advert that i received .
M	!
F	great quality t - shirts , true sizes and lovely to print on .
M	because trying to get it delivered involved me having to book a day off as the delivery department has no concept of customer service .
F	numerous_times my days out with my children has_been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
F	on opening the box , i now have washing_powder all over my hallway floor , as the box wasn_'_t sealed_properly . was i surprised , of course not !!!!!!!!
M	besides that the strimmer looks good , but i haven_'_t had a chance to try it yet until the facemask arrives .
M	by the 00st i wavering and now i am starting to get frustrated .
M	ordered at 0 :_00pm on the 00st and recieved item on the 00nd at 0 :_00pm
M	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without_penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
F	lovely people to talk to .
F	fast speedy service when i purchased , but when it came to the delivery it was a joke !!
F	debbie xxxx
F	we got to the airport , were looking_forward to the holiday and - boom .
M	damn fine service .
F	will update .
F	extremely easy website to use .
F	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
F	je rédige donc un message au service client en demandant pour quelle raison la_livraison_est différée de plus d ' un mois et pour dire_que vraiment , là , ça devient trop long .
M	but i do believe the customer service needs to improve , but the item is fantastic .
M	this was my first experience with digitalrev and i '_ve been left very impressed .
F	will use again as long as they have the best price at that time .
M	overall we have never clained on this poilcy - and the cover seems to be good - however as my wife has a pre_- existing_medical_condition ( asthma ) - we have to contact the screening to advise
M	can '_t say the same about the fitting_center fitted the the tyres
M	keep_up the good work .
F	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
F	!
F	i would highly_recommend this company for anyone_wishing top quality carpets , with a fantastic choice .
F	have been a great disappointment .
F	in the midst of this there were lots of phone_calls , emails & live_chat conversations held .
M	may not use again .
M	ordered my mats 0_weeks_ago still not arrived no one from the company will answer my calls or e_- mail pluss they debited my account for the money
F	friday 00th_may - whey hey i finally have taken delivery of my order ( over 0_weeks after ordering !)
M	my only recourse is to take this matter to the small_claims court , which could take many months , and incurs a fee of its own .
M	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
F	disappointed that after chasing 0 times nobody had the courtesy to return our call as to why we only had half our order .
M	great site .
F	this was at gatwick not at heathrow .
F	as i work during the week i would not be able to accept delivery of the second item .
M	i was told there would be a staff_member at the car_park with the 0nd seat .
M	great value for money and next_day service so no_complaints .
M	ordered a cd_key on 00th_november .
M	i contacted ofl who i now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company .
M	great quality product at a competitive price .
M	dont like the way they just act as middle_men and collect a fee but hey thats buisness .
M	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
M	requests to be called by me have been ignored and at one point i was told point_blank that nobody would be able to talk to me .
M	this was in no way the fault of complete_care shop .
M	0 days_later they say the shoe is out of stock .
M	note some website say this but will list weekends orders may take 00_hours to complete , onlycdkeys . com mean instant and 00 / 0
F	after waiting over 0_weeks for my order of net_curtains , 0 of them was the wrong_size , when phoning nets 0 go they said i would have to send it back and when they receive it they will send me another 0 out .
F	due to them over_£_00 , they should have been delivered next_day .
F	the hotel number did not work so had to call another department who messed_up my booking and i had to call back a further 0 times to sort it out .
F	aiden - my reference_number is 0000000
M	was well impressed not only did they have what i wanted , and at a good price they also kept me up to date with the whole sales and despatch process . will_definitely use them again .
M	way back in june , my wife bought some pre_- packed strawberries from sainsburys .
F	it was my first experience of ordering on line , so was quite nervous_about the order , as it was a christmas_present .
M	delivery was quick and the product is great quality .
M	ordered late tuesday was here thursday first thing top products low_prices great delivery timescales
M	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn_'_t full compatibility there yet and i have no idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
F	the payment for postage should be met by mazuma not the seller .
M	great value !
M	on closer investigation the reason for this outrage was conveyed to us by rodger , rodger is the deputy_manager i know this because pinned to rodgers chest was a big shiny badge confirming his status within the argos organisation .
F	i do not like doing this as it adds time to your journey and is not as secure .
M	the flowers arrived in a box , they had fallen over inside and so were completely squashed on one side .
F	i had appointments to keep , as well you might imagine on the eve of my departure .
M	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely_unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
F	low price , fast delivery , excellent service !
M	this was not just uneven finish of the wood .
M	ordered an item , paid for it , waited for it to arrive , it didn_'_t .
F	would definitely use travelpharm again and would recommend to anyone .
F	shopped_around for the items i wanted .
M	i was sent a shopping_basket instead of an under seat piece of luggage .
F	several weeks_later after several emails ( they never answer promptly ), they apologised for still being out of stock and asked if i wanted to cancel my order and get a refund - although they were expecting new stock within a couple of weeks .
F	having met them at ife00 we assumed they would be a good company to work with . obviously not !
M	having used this company a number of times without problem , i noticed this year when booking that cartrawler appeared in the search page .
M	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile_phone_recycler has to be either mazuma or top_dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
F	i will be contacting_trading_standards
M	don_'_t believe their tales .
F	i '_ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
F	called and spoke to a very friendly gent and would have no_issues recommending this firm .
M	not tried the speakers yet but look great .
M	have been using pharmacy0u for a number of years for both prescription and non - prescription items .
M	we always book through rentalcars because the staff are very helpful and they have a better choice of full to full cars
F	thank_you
M	after our son purchased his sign from atlantic_signs , and i had then to mount it for him !
M	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property_maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
M	wanted to try new label / invoice sheets for our internet sales and was able to get a free_sample_pack before placing an order .
F	so , trustingly sent it back .
M	the staff told us that rental_cars . com have been notified about this fee but despite_repeated_attempts from the car_rental company have not put it on their website quoting system as yet - a source of frustration to many renters .
M	three_days have passed and no apology etc .
F	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
M	thank_you !
F	maybe some testers would be good .
M	villa_plus in majorca were not contacted so it woulod be difficult to comment .
M	parts supplied were faulty , nobody would ring me back always had to make the call , second part did arrive as promised though and this one works correctly .
F	and zoey said they would do everything possible to have the ring ready in time .
M	the site is easy to use and the communication from quidco is superb .
F	i decided to take them back to the covent_garden store to replace them .
F	the cooker arrived in good time and the parts that are working are good . shame that the main oven has a thermostat fault which means that all the electrics cut out when it reaches the desired temperature !
F	i find this totally_unacceptable .
F	at_least they were cheap .
M	brilliant !
M	first and last time we will use hungry_house .
M	despite reading negative_reviews i used interparcel and found them honest and reliable
M	i would highly_recommend flashbay to anyone looking for a professional company that gets results with very cheap prices .
F	we order these canisters every year but certainly never from this company again .
M	!
F	have used mazuma in the past and would again .
F	rude and unhelpful staff
F	they offered a £_00 voucher_towards another event . i don_'_t think so .
F	lots of frustration using the website on an ipad which is where i do all my communication .
M	they also let you know when the item will be delivered so you ' re not guessing .
M	i recently_bought a number of items of garden equipment including two draper branded garden rakes - stainless_steel with ash handles .
M	i explained the problem to be told " you have ordered the wrong tyre , i acepted a cheaper tyre , no confirmation of refund .
F	looking_forward to your timely reply
M	we don_'_t own a car anymore but rent for holidays and long weekends for which we find the annual_policy good value .
M	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
M	their loss - i am now putting all my business through another company - interparcel have lost £ 0000 '_s business through me alone - if this is the way you look after customers when things go_wrong you don_'_t deserve to be in business
F	they were cheerful and efficient throughout . well_done .
F	!
F	the items weren_'_t ready to dispatch when i ordered them which wasn_'_t advertised .
F	they are good at sorting_out refunds if things are faulty , but can be slow posting things , and if i have a query i always have to email them twice to get an answer and they are very slow to reply to email enquiries for some reason .
F	thank_you .
M	at last i have found a company that treats customers like i do !
M	no clear_indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let_me pay for something i would never receive .
M	communication was also first_class advising delivery date and even time .
M	natasha had a very god understanding on what was available in the area and was able to flexibly make changes dependent on our various requests and numbers across the weekend .
M	pleased with the small order of chorizo , morcella , and cheese , delivery was crap , didn_'_t even attempt to deliver , then on there website said they had tried , found out depot was 0 miles from house popped down to pick it up , found out later that depot was undergoing changes and service has suffered , defiantly no txt alert or hour time_slot , food was great , will use again .
F	will give it until tomorrow then may well cancel and hopefully get a refund .
M	bought my now fiancée an_engagement_ring , so was a little reluctant at first to buy such an expensive item online .
F	firstly , i have bought a few things from groupon which were all fine , until i had to call them about one of the merchants .
F	the recipient had just got home from hospital and wanted them to brighten_her day , yet they arrived the flooowing day .
F	your staff were helpful , courteous and some very knowledgable .
F	it '_s unclear who was at fault ( mechanic believes that the fitters power_tools would have cauaed the break ) but i would have appreciated being made aware of the problem before having to sign for completion of the job .
M	ordered , here on day stated , no_problems
F	although we may not be ' big business ' for workwearhouse , we will not be using them again .
F	i may use the service again but i would be worried of what flowers would be received after i had ordered a certain one .
F	reasonable_prices , excellent service , easy ordering and beautiful flowers .
F	i purchased two solid_wood_worktops .
F	the mechanic who came out to fit my tyres this time was friendly , polite and efficient .
M	i ordered my tyres on thursday , £_00 cheaper_than nearest quote including fitting .
F	i think is too late , as i needed to tell my friend something was coming .
F	!
F	i booked this evening and forgot to add one of the passengers .
F	we had to wait 00_mins ( and drive around the block ) when we first
M	guess_what - no sign of the parcel .
F	so not very happy
F	beautifully_packed and fitting me wonderfully .
F	only one of the items have arrived and having tried to contact chemist - 0 - u about the outstanding one they havent responded .
M	i would like to purchase an ipad_mini from a retailer which will cost me £_000 . 00 and the best cashback deals works out at just £ 0 . 00 !!
F	regards
F	terrible 0st night last_minute didn_'_t email our hotel so when we arrived at 0pm they had no record of our booking !
M	they tried to suggest my buzzer may be on the blink , but i went right down and tested it out .
F	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
F	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont_be using again .
F	staff were very helpful when dealing_with my problem but decided to accept a partial_refund as technician could not remove mark .
M	the perfect combination .
M	i will pull out of any future transition that involves this company : unbelievably bad service .
M	emailed music_matter for a price on a new mike , received a quote almost_immediately , easily 00_%_cheaper_than elsewhere , collected an_hour later .
M	however , our_luggage came off the carousel there a good bit quicker_than it usually does at edinburgh !
F	thanks !
F	refund given , and other items good so overall , would definitely shop again .
M	ordered tyres this morning for fitting at my local centre tomorrow .
M	it all fitted so that '_s a bonus . only time i '_ll internet shop .
M	i chose to buy the makita 0000mg circular_saw from toolstop as they had it at the lowest_price i could_find , and also offered free overnight delivery .
M	this follows a similar experience with you when the greeting_card was missed from the delivery so the recipient didn_'_t know who the flowers were from !
F	the brand identity is wishy_washy and doesn_'_t stand up to the premium stock it sells .
F	replies to my e_mails were prompt and courteous from an employee daniel who did what he could to help .
F	however this time , our package ( photo_paper and ink ), took almost a week to arrive and some of the packaging of the ink was knocked about and damaged .
M	i went back the next week and purchased a second set of oakley factory lite in brushed aluminium and carbon and received the same exceptional service .
M	my fears were_unfounded .
M	i didn_'_t mind cause i though it would be easy to retire the product when i received it .
F	in fact i '_d probably fair better eating a banana dipped in chocolate sauce to be honest !
F	i ordered my products on sunday and received the items on tuesday_morning .
F	i have recently bought two_pairs of glasses from glasses_direct .
F	they haves fantastic range , everything you need and very competitively_priced .
F	i have left special instructions for both orders i have made with serenata_flowers and both_times have been ignored .
F	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
M	delivered early .
F	i had put a game in my basket and went to the checkout only to realise that the game had been removed , tried to put the game back in my basket only for game to tell me it was out of stock , this should have been noted before i tried to put it in my basket there was nothing to say out of stock , then had bought a game only for them to refund me cause ey never had it in stock , neither did they give me a reason for the refund i was confused ,
M	apologies if you ' re looking for a short , pithy review .
M	i '_m giving up on ebay because they keep ignoring me .
F	i also contacted bbc_watchdog and will place my review or experiences of this online sales site on international social_media sites .
F	however i ordered 0 boxes each containing 00 sachets .
M	wish you would use a courier firm as they are generally better .
F	delivery is great too only having to wait a couple of days
F	lovely net arrived the next_day and looks fantastic !
M	i just want these clips !!
F	i ordered a couple of containers and a trackable window cling ( and a few other things ) one of the pots was badly_cracked due to it being poorly packaged and the window cling tracking_number did not match the copy tag so i now have a useless trackable in my car .
M	helpfull staff , easy to use and follow process on line .
F	i wanted to give you some compliments about how great the staff at isleworth branch are .
F	my niece was really pleased with her flowers she said that they made hr birthday a whole lot better
M	no delivery .
F	we only found it in the nick of time .
F	the driver is throwing a sack of bird_food over the side_gate and leaving it in full sight of passers_by .
M	had to wait nearly 00_mins for the driver to arrive on arrival at airport .
M	they never replied to me after my second reply
F	fast service and pleased with item but due to bad customer service i will not order from them again !
M	initially after booking my holiday i seemed rather please that i had bagged myself a great deal to the island of st_lucia .
F	it would have been easier to order it from my doctor .
M	highly_recommended for anyone , good communications and good quality products .
M	my advice is use one of the free anti_virus , at_least you can see what going on , and you dont have to pay !!!
F	avoid_avoid_avoid
F	thursday 0th_nov
M	helpful and concise .
F	the goods arrived promptly and seem to be good quality and value for money .
F	i am waiting for my refund , which has not happened yet .
M	the tyres always arrive next_day after ordering and the price is very competitive .
F	i wish i '_d researched this company and read_reviews before i sent my phone to them .
F	great easy to find and very helpful service , we got to choose our car and the guy gave_us bottles of water and wished us on our way , those bottles of water were much needed as we had another hours travel and no change to get any , taking back the car again was super easy and the guy again very friendly , will_definately use again
F	i have recomended 0000rpm to many friends who have kids too .
M	good price .
M	i have been treating my medical_conditions with natural supplements for a while .
F	no offer of an_appology !
F	perfect !!
F	the item i bought ( olive coloured kraft_paper roll ) was only available at rajapack .
M	two further deliveries the following_day were by a more helpful driver but without_any labour on site to assist it would not have been possible for him to successfully or safely offload his cargo .
F	they have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this .
M	the video_clips in the website were not particularly helpful .
F	have phoned them 0 times and hung on and on and given up on all occasions .
M	mine was well over 0_weeks .
M	could not care less !
F	great value and service .
M	on their contract their is a monthly limit - i have proof that it does not work !
M	the girl on the customers service desk ( katie , i think ) was very pleasant and tried really hard .
M	bryton have entered the cycle gps market as underdog taking on the mighty but arrogant garmin .
M	i ordered a tumble_drier .
M	the magnets do what is expected of them , and they are robust and powerful .
M	ooooooooooooooooooooo
M	the cost of filling up @ 000_euro is a joke , but i understand that money has to made somewhere .
F	i have placed 0 separate_orders & each order received so far has_been missing at_least 0 envelopes which means i can not post the cards .
M	no sign of any cleaning .
M	highly_recommend .
F	he never spoke directly to me and never took the time to try to explain / resolve the situation in a professional way .
M	i had been disappointed that the promised savings did not materialise but i blamed myself for not seeing the information about standing charges etc .
M	seemed to go through smoothly .
F	i don_'_t know where to begin . non - existent customer service , items not collected , misinformation ( aka " lies "), fraudulent signing for delivery of items , items disappearing whilst in their ' care ' ( i use that word ironically ), items left out in full public view to be nicked , items nicked by couriers , items deliberately damaged by operatives , massive delays , no response to e_-_mails , being kept hanging for ages on a 00p - a - minute phone line . need i go on ?!
F	the first [_link_] and the second music_magpie .
F	as soon as it reached my door i had to turn it away as the furniture was broken !!!!
F	thanks for being a customer ,
M	the systems and processes aren_'_t adequate for an online business .
M	i called them to be told it was cancelled in error and they repeated the order for me .
F	had mobile broadband with t - mobile .
F	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
F	very pleased with product as it was just as advertised .
M	i do not need to know i am finally being transferred to ebay when i already know i click on the ebay shop button at the start of this clicketty , clicketty click , click , click , click process !
M	well , the resolution took far longer_than it should have done but eventually i got through to someone able to effect change and received if not full compensation for the inconvenience at_least something that wasn_'_t a slap in the face .
F	however the flowers have got to the right people anyway , so i will still use the service again .
M	customer service very slow too .
F	thank_you
M	friendly staff very helpful and great products !
F	the staff couldnt be more helpful and courious . i was confused as to what size jiffy_bag to order , i received samples the very next_day , they werent what i was looking for so rang back . as soon as i explained the problem with the samples the assistant new straight_away which i would need .
M	we ordered bathroom_suite and extras and , with the exception of one item that was out of stock , everything was delivered on - time within a few_days of the order .
M	it '_s a huge_difference and i '_m very disappointed .
M	good to know i can get everything i ever need .
M	and if i go into a high_street chemist and buy 0 small bottles of liquid paraffin i don_'_t expect to be quizzed by the pharmacist on what i intend to use it for - and i would expect the same privacy on chemist_direct .
M	the item i ordered arrived on time and in good condition but had one item within the package incorrect .
F	most couriers would leave a card asking you to contact them for another delivery date .
M	i ' d really advise anyone not to bother , you can find the gear for the same price elsewhere and the goods will actually get delievered .
F	dreadful service .
F	i found mazuma to be absolutely fantastic .
F	and sent me proof to say was cancelled .
M	?
M	paid for express delivery might as well brunt the money
F	i am looking_forward to trying some of my more unusual choices like kale chips .
F	i also thought that at 0 working_days , the delivery is too slow .
M	company failed to respond to e_mails requesting updates .
M	i then asked my husband to call them as i can no_longer trust myself verbally as i feel they have taken enough liberties with me .
F	i love my new knife_set .
M	having the facility to leave delivery instructions was great - my vw bits arrived within 0 days , left in a secure place as requested .
M	we asked at the ticket office what to do and were directed to another office which didn_'_t seem to exist .
F	ordered at 0 . 00am arrived next_day at 00 . 00am !
F	it does tend to bag and lose its shape a bit after wear , but is blissfully warm and comfortable .
F	i ordered the big_boy xxl beanbag , via_groupon , 0_weeks before christmas ; waited 0_weeks for it to arrive and it never did so i logon to the website and the delivery date was very vague : week 00 , which to me means the week before christmas .
M	we were charged 000_euros for fuel we did not want or need .
M	rating has_been downgraded to 0_star due to the proven lies and lack of trustworthiness .
M	i was informed at 0000 that the flowers i ordered for valentines was not going to arrive_till the following_day .
F	mattressman was unable to give me a delivery time - only to be available from 0am to 0pm .
M	a non stick pan that lets food stick to it is pretty_useless , what a waste of money !
F	when i realised that they were a size too small i took them immediately back for a bigger_size knowing you do not do refunds which is disappointing .
F	into the bargain the operator was downright rude .
F	ordered ilumi products after receiving a discount_code from coeliac magazine , enjoying them thoroughly as a uni student ( being ultimately lazy ) i like being_able to have a decent gluten_free ready_meal quickly and efficiently
M	good very good
M	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
M	this was my first purchase from gear for music and it has left me a bit dissapointed , as they look to be a very proffesional vendor with plenty of decent stock .
M	that didn_'_t work as the firmware on the tv was actually later than the one on the stick .
F	very disappointed .
M	00th_october . despite the promise below , no change in my account balance and no - one bothered to get in touch with me .
M	if you want to be robbed & spend a lifetime on hold talktalk is for you .
M	will use again .
F	service great and purchased items up to expectation .
M	they answered the call straight_away , changed the order on the fly and dispatched the correct goods the same day .
M	the value was much_better_than ebay sales so i registered and received my postage paid_envelope the next_morning .
F	thank_you for such a good service .
M	thank_you very much for your excellent service .
F	i sent another note of complaint and they ignored my email .
F	my order came quickly , great reliable service . thank_you
F	the heel_pad stiching was broken in a couple of areas but the pad was not seperated , it just looked unsightly .
M	good service , very efficient however i '_m not sure if this is the manufacturer or your mistake but my adam kimmel sunglasses that retail at £_000 , come with no cloth to clean the lenses .
M	i asked to speak to supervisor , told one was not available .
M	we were told they were waiting on the medium_size tops and this was due anytime and would get the order out in the next few_days .
M	i have been trying to warn_people on review centre about a company called north_west design and build ltd lowton .
M	i have asked trustpilot for the right to reply as i can support my statements with correspondance .
M	in response i got a dispatch note , which turned_out to be completely fictitious .
F	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain_relief .
F	as it was not busy i was dissappointed with this and whilst i will use the search_engine again i will not use the meet and greet service i booked again .
F	i am very happy with the usb '_s and will definitely spread the good service i had to my contacts .
M	they are conniving , horrible people .
M	it '_s only a suggestion to then make them perfect .
F	orders arrive very quickly , well_packaged .
F	overall happy . flowers were lovely but not as_described .
F	not having used before i was a little_concerned that the service would live up to my expectations , especially as they gave_me the cheapest quote .
F	yesterday , the same ; i '_ll email you a tracking_number .
F	everything was i wanted it to be - quick delivery , careful_packing , first_class product , and almost above all else , a very easy site to negogiate - all without_any real effort on my part . i hadn_'_t heard of petfleas before , but i '_ll definitely use them again . tell you what , though - the name put me off at first !!
M	happy days , my dream guitar would be with me in two months .
F	that was easy and then 0_days_later i got a call from homebase and it was automated and said to hang on the line till they put me through to an advisor , this was at teatime and i was trying to makethe dinner at the same time , the phone was on loud speaker and when i went to take it off loudspeaker i was disconnected .
F	sent arrangement to the usa .
F	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
F	it had so a search was initiated .
M	very impressed with your product descriptions .
F	very good service have everything you need and more .
F	ordered some great looking shoes from ecco - they took_ages to arrive and when they did were too_big - a simple returns system - but from the initial order to the final delivery it took about three_weeks .
F	they were a gift for my daughter in law and son who had just had a new baby .
F	so it was a trip out to burford .
F	just eat '_s phone lines and live_chat were down , and it took 0 hours after i '_d placed the order for them to reply to the email i sent saying that they had preauthorised it and cancelled it , so " the time the funds take to appear back in your available balance is solely dependent on your bank '_s policy for cancelling the reservation , however , it usually takes about 0 working_days , but is entirely dependent on your bank '_s policy .
M	parcel delivered by a surly , scruffy driver from a rusty , dirty van .
M	the size of costume and belt attachment were spot on , no_complaints , the actual costume decoration however was poor and basically starting falling_off from the moment i opened the packaging , over the course of the evening which involved nothing more strenuous than a little dancing to a few classics i would estimate that 00_% of the costume decoration came away , nothing drastic admittedly but not great .
M	however have tried_phoning their medical_screening ( 0000 number ) held on for 0 mins then they offer ringback ' without losing place in queue '.
F	was just disappointed with where were left as they were put at the front_door rather_than in a secluded space as anyone could '_ve taken them .
F	this is the first time i have used pharmacy @ u , but i was very pleased with the service .
M	perfect .
M	the plus point is that i have an acceptable mobile case at an acceptable price .
F	!
F	contacted them on the same day , however their rude and arrogant customer service even refused for the refund .
F	thankyou dfd :-)
F	ordered a bouquet of flowers , a box of fudge and a vase totalling over_£_00 - delivered on time but the vase was missing !
F	i bought a voucher for my web master course from groupon site .
M	other passengers we spoke to told us this was a better service and the car decks are not nearly so cramped .
M	received email_advising items had been fully shipped / dispatched , then received a further email over 00_hours_later saying one item was out of stock and not being sent !
F	i was unable to contact anyone until the monday , when i contacted the office on the monday another appointment was made for that afternoon but no apology was made for the lack of customer service received previously .
M	i ordered 0 of the same unit , at time of ordering , the website seemed to indicate that both units were indeed available .
F	continually told to re - photograph the images is impossible as any of the works i have on the site are either sold or have been discarded due to damage .
M	looks good , nice materials but slightly wrong shape
M	however , we then received an email_saying that we now owed a further £_000 . 00 .
M	i ordered a couple of bottles of torres 00 , my favourite brandy , and the experience was satisfactory , more or less as i would have expected .
M	so i reluctantly used the telephone and the hire cost as of 00 mar 00 is now £_000 . 00 this is with discount .
F	der stress ist es nicht wert .
M	not sure if i would purchase this again will see how it goes using this car polish as there are cheaper polishes that do the same job on the paintwork .
M	after confirming my details and parcel '_s tracking_number , she just kept asking what was in the parcel ?
M	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can '_t .
M	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
M	i put our trust on logo_depot and i am so pleased with the results .
F	would thoroughly_recommend this company .
F	i just love it , a bedroom to be proud of .
M	i did not like the way payment was taken immediately and not on despatch .
M	no communication to confirm order will be delayed
F	ordered from the whiskey_exchange , nice gift package and the service was really good , kept_informed every_step of the way .
M	i really like the home_trial but when i finally placed an order my glasses took several weeks to arrive .
F	your rep that phoned about the incorrect delivery did not know i had already e_- mailed the alex e_- mail address , likewise i wanted written confirmation that i was to give the delivery man back the incorrect rad but did not receive a response to my e_- mail .
M	was delivered later than the one hour time_slot_allocated . no apologies received or notification he would be late .
M	also charged me £_000 for early withdrawal of the saving account ( by their decision ).
F	there was no double_bed , only a day bed with a pull out bed .
M	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
M	a few weeks_later , got cold - called in the evening by thomas sanderson ( the blind company ), trying to sell us their blinds .
M	prompt delivery good service
F	on friday , 00 june my sister - in - law received a telephone message to ask where the wine should be delivered to but no telephone_number was left for her to call back , i . e .
F	they are the best price , they are always on time , the mini_bus is lovely , they know where they are going !
F	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won_'_t see them alive !
F	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly_annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
F	very pleased with speed of order - only_thing that service lacks is confirmation_email .
M	no problem with reliability but not what we expected
F	don_'_t know why .
F	one customer representative was even argumentative and refused to transfer us to a supervisor .
F	should have delivered a parcel in january , claimed that they '_d turned_up on several_occasions according to their ' tracker ' but no one on site .
F	i have never_experienced this level of efficiency before , and i '_m really pleased
M	unless holiday_autos start indicating which cars are from a fuel scam provider before i book , then i won_’_t be using them again .
F	the response was a curteous reply & the medication for our elderly labrador was delivered within a few_days .
F	when i tried to set_up the account to pay , i kept getting a mesage that my email address already exists !
M	like most airlines that don_'_t ' get it '.
M	i purchased from prc via amazon because of the good reviews .
F	have recommended them to many friends .
F	sold an ipod in november , they said the money would be in the account by christmas_eve and still have not received the money yet .
F	told this was reason for non delivery .
F	called maxine and she sorted it all straight_away .
F	there is specification box close to each item . one of them refers to delivery but none of the wording used refers this return charge !
M	what is the point of my giving you and a phone number if nobody uses it ?
F	potential_customers of yodel - please think very carefully before using yodel as your delivery source as it could have a damaging effect on customers future_purchases with you .
M	good price , very fast delivery - will use again for all medical_equipment needs !
F	!
M	looking on the net came_across speedyreg and found a number_plate we liked and could not belive_how cheap it was ( to good to be true ) so we sent the deposit off stright_away the paperwork came like with in two_days wow but as i work away did not get it sorted_out till the weekend when i got home sent the cheques off and all the paperwork and though no more about it
M	i ordered flowers for my girlfriend in the uk .
F	we have since received messages addressed to mr rather_than mrs , the mrs who has this web address , and the mrs who paid the deposit .
M	my last order didn_'_t come this way which was a little disappointing .
F	staff are not proactive and are too quick to repeatedly say ' i do apologize ' if do apologize then apologize !
M	rates are always good and delivery on a chosen day had arrived by royal_mail before 00 . 00 .
M	atlantic were very easy to deal with and the delivery was on the date they said it would be , so we are very please with them and would recommend them to anyone .
M	the reason for this is that i have a very busy life and i have bigger things to worry_about and better ways to spend my time than making complaints about a sub - standard bunch of flowers .
F	i was told it would be delivered by 00th_march , which it was .
M	they were meant to text / email us on the day with a time of delivery .
F	delivery men have always been friendly too
F	i '_m very glad i took the offer up !
M	i have upgraded it with wwan , and more memory , upgraded to 00 bit ( using the same license ) and off we go , a great performer for not much money .
F	they took my money instantly and now told me it was out of stock .
F	well_done , fantastic and the items were all as_described and fitted !
F	i say apparently because i had no phonecalls to say the delivery was coming out to me .
M	no contact email of the seller provided .
M	dont understand_why the staff are so dismissive and unhelpful !!!
F	alpharooms passed only selected information_regarding my special request to my hotel ( i . e .
M	which i did .
M	wheelchair friendly both inside and out , but check out door measurements before booking someone reliant on a wheelchair .
F	& was done in about 00_mins .
F	also it was the best price i could find for my humax youview_box on the net .
M	by this point they owed me money but i am still getting daily texts and weekly letters demanding a sum of £_00 i dont owe and never have .
F	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
F	the website was easy to use and i found what i needed quickly
F	not at all happy .
M	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
F	i noticed later on the website that orders over_£_00 . 00 are delivered free .
M	will_definately buy again .
F	very unhappy with my purchase .
M	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
M	i '_ll be back , next tiome i '_m letting my flat
M	see what i mean !
F	generally nothing to fault about the service .
F	the order was delivered on friday and i would have expected some response now .
F	i have seen the same quality blinds in the shops for a lot more money , very please with the way they look , giving good light and privacy .
M	after the wasted_journey i then called parcelforce who said that the item was out for delivery but didn_'_t know where .
F	i cannot_rate highly_enough the quality of the kitchen , great value for money and i am really pleased with the overall result .
M	the chocolates were ok but the message on the card was small writting on the back of a peace of paper !
M	with superb slick marketing , this seemed like a fantastic opportunity to save_money to overseas clients .
F	makes giving these items much more affordable , and with 0 dogs and 0 cats every little helps !
F	also there was no gift card included in the box despite the fact that i had written the message i wanted included when making the order .
M	fees paid to viagogo for buying and reselling e_- tickets without received the tickets at all !
F	i have no concerns about using diet_chef and the subsequent weight_loss from using diet_chef .
F	a poor show in my opinion .
F	also quality of garden torches is very poor - i would prefer to pay more in b_& q for better quality ( would have done but they had sold out !)
F	great choice and variety from all around the world .
M	no more to say .
F	all in all , i would definitely use them again and highly_recommend them !
F	the bust arrived and it is beautiful , however it states 00cm on the website , the one i received is 00cm , i also expected to receive the stand she is placed on as it didn_'_t state the stand wasn_'_t supplied , no stand arrived .
M	this sunday i dropped in on a whim to get a bad contact in the jack_socket of my 0000 tele sorted_out .
F	then on the 00th_december i received a email to tell me my order was due to be delivered on 00th !
M	you did offer to deliver to a different address .
F	i can highly_recommend this company
F	i '_m so disappointed .
F	i would recommend this website to everyone .
F	it was delivered on wednesday of the same week by two very helpful and curtious deliverymen who rang early in the morning to let_me know roughly when it would be delivered so that we didn_'_t have to hang_around all day waiting .
M	they didn_'_t put the extra hard_drive i ordered in , so now i have to send it back to them and then wait for them to fix it then send it back .
M	poor show preciouslittleones
F	i was so pleased that a friend told me she had purchased some casserole_dishes on line from pro - cook as i wanted a good quality casserole_dish , but the ones i really liked were all so expensive .
M	please advise your couriers to " leave with a neighbour ". if that is the request that i have made .
M	we '_ve_used xln telecom for a number of years , and were always skeptical_about the very bad_reviews we read about them .
M	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
M	can '_t beat that can you ?
M	the chap stated no i wouldnt have received any emails the item is out of stock , apparently i should have checked their stock_levels before placing the order . strange !
F	so no response as to what they thought of it all , no response from senior_management by way of apology .
M	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
M	will use you again .
M	really unhappy .
F	good quality wig for price and fast delivery
M	phone_calls .
F	would definitely recommend .
F	price was the same but quantity less by 0 boxes of 0 .
F	once to say i am sorry etc , the other time to say when it comes if i do not want them to send back for refund .
F	fast service , good choice , quality instruments , next_day delivery .
F	i ordered flowers for my mother last_year , which were delivered on the date requested .
M	this stinks of a company about to fold and that is speaking from experience over the years !
M	customer service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
F	well_done lovecases !
F	very pleased with purchase
F	this company is excellent delivery is quick communication is good ,, staff are polite and friendly on the phone and even returns are easy with e . mail notification being sent as soon as your parcel arrives back with them .
M	- dispatched 0 june
M	very easy to deal with , excellent coat and swift delivery .
M	the information cards in the door of the car were not for the car that i was driving
F	i have been ordering quite a few things online lately and outdoorkit stands_out as exceptional !
F	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot_cheaper .
F	the only problem i have encountered was once when i tried to order i found their advertising offer had finished but was still being offered on site .
F	i ordered these sunglasses online , best price i could find and amazingly , they arrived the next_day .
M	then when my wife tried the jacket o when we eventually received it 0 days late , , it was to small so i returned it requesting a large , but was automatically issued a refund as i think you had no large in stock but did when i initially ordered which was frustrating .
F	they are giving away pay as you go sim cards so they can '_t be expensive to give - it '_s just that t mobile want to wring every last drop of money out of you they can .
F	also prices are very competitive .
F	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
F	i am very angry and appalled at the way we have been treated and i hope never to do_business with these couriers again once i finally receive my shoes !
M	they seem to answer peoples questions on there and have a great customer_support .
F	as i need these glasses urgently , i would actually expect some kind of indemnification as i have to place an order somewhere_else to get glasses and who_knows when i '_ll get anything from this company .
M	nicole brown however has done her best to chase the location of the missing parcel and has kept up with communication , thank_you nicole . seemingly the only person at your company who gives a ****
F	ordered some hockey trophy '_s with engraving turned_up a couple of days_later , excellent delivery service which gave a 0 hour delivery slot .
F	great for keeping in touch and finding old friends but the changes without my choice are annoying , why cant the new styles just be a choice ?
M	parcel was picked_up within_00hrs by a friendly and helpful driver who made sure the parcel was labelled correctly .
F	the service was excellent and the delivery was very speedy .
M	obviously there was certain information i had to enter for the order to be accepted , but at_least i didn_'_t have to worry myself with setting_up " more " passwords .
F	i ordered 0 small badges at a cost of £ 0 . 00 each .
F	ordered a 00 " tv around 00 am . delivery came next_day at 0pm . now that is fast . i have been buying online for a long time and tekshop000 are my preferred_supplier now .
M	a wide_range of very useful goods , but expensive compared with internet prices .
M	very slow to respond .
F	the beer glasses were strurdy and good value - but the wine_glasses were smaller_than i ordered and many of them were broken - the ones at the bottom of the stack .
M	excellent service .
M	the down_side which wasn_'_t clear is that the pods a individually_wrapped and can '_t be stored in the normal way like nespresso_capsules .
F	simply_supplements have always provided an excellent service
M	although the website listed them as in stock , they were actually shipped from europe with about a one week delay .
F	yes i did get the phone ~ eventually after 0 chase_up calls .
M	instead of delivering faulty goods to your much needed customers .
F	i received an_email at 000pm the day they were due to be delivered to say they were cancelling my order as they had no florist to fulfil the order .
F	i really could not be more pleased with the service from the shower_seal shop .
F	no real hiccups but a few gripes :
F	i have requested this information but have received an_automated email to say that i won_'_t get an answer until 00th_december at the earliest .
F	excellent service - well recommended !
F	can '_t fault teleologic on the ordering side but the royal_mail let them down .
F	i think the prices and ease of ordering are excellent , but on this occasion the delivery time was far too long and communication from feelgood about the delay took_ages to come through .
F	the coat itself is great , i was kept_informed of my parcels progress so that was all brilliant but in the process of ordering the coat i got an_error code flash up on my screen whilst trying to pay with paypal .
M	what were they going todo to install it ?
M	i '_m a regular customer to this site but was very disappointed with my last order .
F	a short_walk to the right and you were on a vaporetto ciculating the lagoon .
F	i have ordered 0 items from beauty_bay over 0_weeks_ago & it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
F	i will definitely use them next time .
F	recently for the first time for years i '_ve had need to phone their customer service over a missing item .
F	delivery fault .
F	i have reverted to my old light ones even_tho they are held together with a safety_pin and have lost their nose guard .
M	tried again and got nowhere .
M	both online and subsequent catoloque received with order state that the specific spax mdf screws ordered have pozi heads .
M	they ' re trying to take over every high_street .
F	i have sent the another email , no reply !
F	!
M	we checked and found that the hermes /_herpes driver had delivered it by throwing it over a garden_fence !
M	the tyre_fitter was engaging and ever ready to share experience .
F	i would be nice to phone a customer support number , rather_than just emails .
F	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
M	0 .
F	over 00 days_later still have item and they do not respond to the three emails i have sent , now want my money back .
M	will leave review after we receive items
F	i now agree with my hubby , we didn_'_t need a new_kitchen .
M	should be lower with a garantor but hay ho if you need the cash , so be it .
F	the process itself was made very easy , particularly helpful in indicating which forms , and sections of forms , had to be completed .
F	give the lads at purple_parking credit where credit is due - they dealt_with the whole situation while we were away - by creating a new reference .
M	0_weeks_later i am still without a tv service !
F	disgraceful .
F	the description of the products - dosage etc .
M	give them a try and you will not regret it .
M	no contact to explain_why .
F	would defiantly recommend trophy_store !
F	its the first time we used them and were scared , but perfect ontime and professional .
F	this company was very helpful in getting some very special downlighters for our victorian theatre .
F	great prices .
M	it allows you to book what day you want to have the tyres_fitted and there are no_hidden_charges .
F	the outfit did look slightly_different on than in the picture and was a tad too_big even_though i ordered a size smaller_than i usually get .
M	a waste of time .
M	the situation was private but at no point did i feel like my privacy was at stake .
F	will not be recommending isme to family , friends , colleagues - in fact quite the opposite .
M	an excellent range f of beer from a far and at home .
M	i recommend paddock_spares as a first every time for quallity land_rover spares .
M	only quibble - cost is a bit on the dear side
F	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
F	then they said it had been sent on 00 july but still no sign and now they don_'_t know when it was sent and can '_t give me a tracking order so what does that say .
M	thanks for reading
F	it is easy to navigate , yet packs in plenty of detail .
M	you have seen the snotty nosed urchin making the pizzas in the back of shop . you know they eat the pizza topping on deliveries . and spit on it . why buy from them ??
F	i had to wait over 0_weeks for their delivery .
F	don_'_t order from these people !
M	this is misleading , unclear , a rip - off and completely customer - unfriendly .
F	could never get through to customer_services on phone either . or on one occasion i did it was the overflow and the girl said she would make_sure someone rang me back ( guess_what . am still_waiting for return call ) terrible service . would never use again .
F	i am sorry as i always recommend and have been delighted in the past .
M	it seems to me to be entirely pot_luck .
F	any tips on removing stains ?
F	i just want to be able to get through to someone and discuss any_issues , is that too much to ask ?
F	return did not happen .
F	my uncle then had to call the company to ask you had sent the parcel_ i suppose 0 more puzzle than_expected , but suggest the on line facility enables gift messages in future .
M	i asked for a phone_call when they were done and to advise , after testing , whether or not i should also have the wheels tracked .
F	its a no_brainer , i love you topcashback !
F	i ordered a phone through dialaphone online .
F	great way to make cash from your old books .
M	great service and really quick , was a little disappointed in the prices , but to expected really .
F	i have only been using medic_animal to buy my dog_food for a short time but the service has_been very good .
F	i was advised i was going to get more than i received into my account .
M	i called expedia , another ( 00_minutes on the phone ) and was asked to email the attachment again and then was told there has_been a ticketing error and i had been charged_twice but that there should have been an_automated refund .
F	their email correspondence is fast and extremely_helpful !
M	it has not put me off of purchasing my next piece of furniture which will be a office desk .
F	a deposit , yes , quite understandable but the full_amount .!
M	not good enough .
M	and keyboard !
F	collected just within timeframe although i was getting nervous as i paid 00p for text to say it was close to being collected and i have not received that text !
M	ordering on wednesday and waiting till monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
F	i received confirmation of my order for good grip pop up cookbook holder ( ccs00000 ).
F	superb quality and have place an order since .
M	shame on you review centre !!!
F	i ordered from barrington_sports because their prices were the lowest i had seen in any shops or other online stores .
F	today is the 0th of january .
M	the owners were there most of our holiday and were very helpful and informative .
F	very easy to manouver , a great pram for the price , plenty of room in basket to put your shopping and other bits and bobs , overall a great little pram and the car_seat is an added_bonus .
F	unfortunately as i wasn_'_t buying them for myself i had to exchange them for bigger_size - and this is only fault of myself - nothing to do with company service .
F	i understand that you have had supply problems but the chinese new year has not lasted for three two months plus .
M	so i am giving my opinion !
F	very easy to book a room at this site .
M	an extremely efficient service .
F	my brother in law sent us a picture of the flowers they received .
M	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
F	i was out and about when i received the call from the florists so was a little difficult to have a long conversation but no refund was given for same day delivery and also the delivery on the tuesday was very late after 0pm , which i would have thought the florist would have tried to make it one of the first due to being so long after the saturday , i also paid_extra for a medium bouquet and it was not very big , my husband got me flowers for my birthday locally at £_00 and it was much larger , i was at my parents when the bouquet arrived so would have been cheaper for me to buy them locally and take them myself .
F	prompt payout but weekly fee more thsn quoted over the phone
F	ordered easily & delivered the next_day by 0 pm at no extra_cost & parcel tracking was included , couldn_'_t have been better thank_you .
F	now 00st nov & still not received it !!
M	all for 0 quid ?
F	regards
F	i would think in this day and age that returns would be foc .
F	the website was easy to use and the hotel was in a good place to access everything .
F	we called 0 mobile nos that were provided on the booking about 00_mins before we reached gatwick , but no reply on one of them .
M	as someone commented earlier avoid_avoid_avoid at all costs .
M	when booking you have no idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .
M	i live in the uk , but on a visit to the us i brought a rather expensive keyboard which on return to the uk i inspected the keybaord and found the us keyboard layout was different to the standard uk keyboard layout .
M	the bouquet has simply never looked good , overall a disappointment .
M	we had booked a gps_unit which after we had paid for the lady told us we wouldn_'_t need as queenstown was very easy to negotiate . the most irritating fact was the $_00 " desk fee " that has to be paid .
F	i had a day off work waiting for the parcel .
M	xmas came and went .
M	i bought 0 tyres but was told i really only needed to replace one .
F	because i was in aware they were going to deliver i went out and had to pick it up the following_day . tracking service was absolutely useless as it was never updated .
F	after the long set_up process it asked for an initial deposit to open it so i put in £ 0 just to open it up .
F	a phone_call to tnt in the morning confirmed the item was already out for automatic delivery again which we knew we wouldn_'_t be able to accept .
M	good price ordered quoting 0 days delivery on 00th_may , actual delivery 00th_june
M	this is a good site but at times over complicated and difficult to find what you are looking for
M	sizing is pretty accurate .
F	just the kind of supplier we all need , quick and very reliable .
M	email_telling_me the bikes will be delivered friday , i rang to ask where they were , to be told they would be with me monday , sorry we forgot to tell you .
M	very good service and quick delivery .
F	totally misled and feel let_down .
M	received emails_confirming tuesday '_s delivery and updates via_text throughout the day , only to have the driver call me at 00 . 00 , an_hour and a quarter before the last delivery slot , to say he was going to finish now so wouldn_'_t be delivering it today after all .
M	total bull but they said they would up their offer to £_00 .
M	he never called me back .
F	you would need a car but are close to great restaurants and only just over a mile from a fab beach .
F	ordered online and it said same day delivery but thought that would be locally so expected them to arrive next_day , i live in the north_east of england .
F	website stops working at important stages ( payment , terms & conditions )
F	the product chosen was just what we wanted and it arrived on the date selected during the order process .
F	really pleased with the pan when it arrived which was very promptly unforetunately was a little too small
M	i asked her , " you have all my details and tracking_number , why do you need to know what is in the package ?"
M	i do not agree that they have a policy of one having to pay over the odds for a full_tank of fuel , and you have to bring it back empty .
F	it broke within 0_weeks - complained through amazon , which took me a few_days how to work it all out as so complicated and got the response from the company after they took 0_days to reply - that as i '_d had bed for 00 days i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund !
F	. despite email_confirmation !
M	this is my review of the pyrex smok aro
F	the flowers i ordered for my mum on mother '_s day came and not even after a week they had died
F	!
M	i think if you unpacked and assembled then i would rate this as a 0_star experience .
F	needless to say the delivery arrived 0_days after ordering and the batteries were what he needed .
F	night its even worse and so distracting actually making me feel
M	i bought some audioquest four strand speaker_cable and a dozen fusal ??
F	this was despite he fact that my most expensive winter_months usage this past year was no more than £_00 . 00 for december , january and february .
F	everybody thought they looked great would definitely use this site again .
F	also missed " and " at front of invite . just wrote our names .
F	ordered my curtain_pole late on sunday_night and it was delivered on tuesday .
M	would certainly recommend this service and would use again .
F	did actually take 0_days
F	was told it was company policy and nothing could be done .
M	b0 you hit the buy it now go and cross reff here . you will be suprised !
M	service was really good , after ordering wellies arrived promptly .
F	thirty hours before our first flight was due to take off i went on the internet to manage my booking to book seats for our flybe flight only to discover that out of six separate flights we were only booked on two .
M	there were so many knots that left very little wood to act as support in fact the door end and one of the sides had spars broken through the knots .
F	nice to have abut of room for thick_socks in the winter .
F	they were friendly and tried to be helpful but were unable to solve the problem .
F	with all his order , name and contact details on .
M	i think it really is a case of you get what you pay for
M	asked explicitly for reassurance that they wouldn_'_t pass on our phone number .
F	disgusting !
M	time has yet to tell whether i '_ve been legally conned or trade_mark direct ltd are genuine .
F	the service was good , the website is easy to order from , the coat arrived quickly , but unfortunately there was a security_tag attached under the arm and trying to contact your customer service wasn_'_t easy as the phones do not get answered , this would have caused a major_issue had it not been that my son works in a clothes shop with the same style of tags and was able to take the coat into work and remove it for me .
M	i called them 00_mins before i arrived at manchester terminal 0 only to be told we are very busy as this time and you will have to wait 00 - 00_mins outise the terminal .
M	c ) ten days after returning my damaged item i rang paypal to ask where my refund was .
M	i will use them again if the price is right , which it was this time round . cheapest on the web and much_cheaper_than my local_stockists
M	a few short click throughs and i '_ve found exactly_what i '_m looking for and for the cheapest price i can find .
F	if this is the case then surely animed should only except express delivery on mondays and tuesdays .
M	after our ancient plotter finally gave up the ghost we needed a replacement model urgently .
M	i tried to arrange pick for the same day but apparently i have miss cut , which is not my faulty , the next available time is next monday which my affect my refund .
M	i will stick to it .
M	very fast service and received a good rate for my old_handset even_though it was over 0 years old
M	need more affordable binding for all riders as not everyone can_afford top end bindings .
M	all in all , not great service considering the £ 0 . 0k i spent with them .
F	will definitely be taking this further .
F	i have corresponded with prestige_flowers by email and by telephone in a futile attempt to find out what has happened to my order .
F	?
F	very polite email received regarding my address .
F	the flowers took 00_hours to arrive at my friends house , and the box was battered having been in the van all day .
M	poor quality hinges , with one side showing a 0 . 0mm gap
F	only answer was i can try for tomorrow but can '_t guarantee it another unpaid day i will have to take it is ridiculous .
M	had emails requesting info re return of camera after receiving confirmation_email that they had received it !!
F	a lovely arrangement of flowers but not very good value for money
F	sufficient packaging and happy with product .
M	they should be the first thing you see on your web_site .
F	badges fine but arrived on 0th_april , when i explicitly stated i needed them on 0th_april .
F	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
F	it was all well made , one door is slightly hard to shut but a little adjusting of the hinge and it will fine
M	looking on the website the delivery times state between_0am - 0pm , so that could mean i wait in all day monday and then possible all day tuesday as well !
F	great for us - no waiting around all day wondering when someone would turn_up , my husband was able to arrange his lunch hour to be there when the cooker arrived !
F	i kept contacting him for a month or more and each time he would say : sorry i will refund your money .
F	purchased some items and was told by the website that i would be able to book a one hour delivery slot - next_day - with dpd .
M	great company , and more legroom than monarch .
M	i have also contacted your support email address about a rather concerning matter regarding fake_reviews being added to your site for this company because nigel_o ' hara were running competitions on their facebook_page whereby the only way to enter was to leave a positive review on your site .
F	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
F	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
F	they are useless !
F	ordered 00 personalised minature whiskeys for a christmas party .
F	flowers themselves were ok - nothing particularly special , but not misrepresented or anything .
F	i will certainly contract then in the future if i require anything_else which they can provide .
F	then difficulty in uploading_photos .
M	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
M	we got a fair price , envelope for sending phone arrived next_day and the cheque followed within 0 / 0 days .
F	. they say it '_s got 0 pieces and that not flat_pack ??
F	items ordered were a bit_tricky , they sent out everything i requested ; but it dribs and drabs .
F	have not called for a refund yet so no experience on the customer service that side .
M	however , they seemed uninterested in that and intent on replacing it with a new one from the manufacturer .
F	cheap , fast delivery , genuine perfume .
M	the you complete a form , then they reload the order - all took too long .
M	have no bed now as we expected delivery on monday , they now tell me after 0 calls that the items i ordered are not all in stock , so would we accept an_alternative , when agreed to they inform_me that they cannot get the order to me until tuesday .
F	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .
F	this was not explained to me but the tech guy '_s when i asked about my sound system ?
F	everything was great until delivery .
F	quick reasonably_priced well informed of progress just flowers were not as pictures and the head of one of the spray flowers was broken off near the head and the flowers water had leaked as they were laid flat in the box and so the greetings_card was wet .
F	i would definitely recommend ao . com to my family & friends .
M	no shipping label available and it says it is deleted .
F	another email and they said it would be with me soon .
M	significantly_cheaper_than " majors " like h_& b .
M	i tried to change the arrival time , which they agreed , then i was told by the person receiving my car that i would have to pay extra as i hadn_'_t arrived at the right time .
M	excellent
F	as an adult to be let_down is had but try explaining that to a 00 year_old again .
M	the website was very easy to use and th ordering_process went_smoothly .
F	excellent service ; terrific products .
M	can they help further ?
M	customer_services phoned and left a message , and when i called back i was told that as it was less_than 00_hours before my arrival at the car_park the details couldn_'_t be changed , but i would only be charged for an extra days parking which would be £_00 .
M	following pixmanias ' reply to this review i have been in touch with emma and all is well , i would up their rating to 0_stars if i knew how .
F	can be a bit_confusing
M	with the flower , vase , chocolates and card in . not very romantic considering the money that had been paid , flowers were the wrong ones which we could live with .
M	i ordered this safe at 00 . 00_hrs and it was delivered at 0000 noon the next_day .
M	what '_s the point trustpilot ?
M	i called interparcel to let them know and rebook delivery i was told they will attempt recollection the next_day , they didnt !
M	sent email requesting re - delivery ; no answer there either .
F	until_0pm tracking was still with courier but after was showing returned to local service centre at 0 :_00pm ??
F	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch_time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
F	i have contacted you twice_now and still_haven_'_t had a response .
M	the newsletter is actually worth signing_up for as well rather_than being an annoyance like with most other_sites .
F	sadly , it turned_out to be a bit tatty and scruffy in the light of the next_morning .
M	so just composed the album with what i could access .
F	me and my friend ordered some goods from here previously , everything was stated to be instock so we paid for the quickest delivery so we got the products the next_day / day after .
F	didn_'_t get a confirmation_email so called up and to girl on the other end of the phone was so helpful and send me a confirmation_email .
M	fifteen days_later we were back in ijmuiden for our return_journey .
M	next_morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
M	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
F	i was told ' no problem ' we will refund you asap but will be charged 00_euros for admin .
F	otherwise it wold have been fine .
M	my recent auction ended with a buyer selecting the buy it now option , however , it seems the buyers account had been hacked and quite understandably ebay cancelled the listing , returned my fees and confirmed the buyers account had been re - secured .
M	fantastic service and fantastic products !
M	ive had really bad_experiences whilst ordering groceries online with asda .
M	as above .
F	anyone had the same problem and used a supplement that has worked ?
F	i contacted customer_services on several_occasions to ask if possible to collect earlier & except for a standard computer_generated reply_stating my query had been received , no one got back to me .
F	i then couldn_'_t get any response to my email and the phone number was unvavailable , still_waiting for a response so not sure if ths will be resolved leaving me a bit disappointed
M	it would appear that a refund is in process ( awaiting confirmation ) .
M	even dpd seem to have finally got their act_together .
M	!
M	wife extremely happy with the eternity_ring .
F	i requested and was given a delivery date twice , and arranged to stay home from 0am to 0pm , but the the parcel did not show up
F	bit disappointed !
F	prompt delivery .
F	jackie
F	our ruby_anniversary looks to be unforgettable .
M	much_quicker and cheaper_than an estate_agent .
M	very organised site ,
F	i have now received my supplements which were perfectly packaged and all as they should be .
M	this is serial non - answering of the phone !
M	i have used it every day for about 0_weeks now .
F	i love this site , however there are many many_times where a page doesn_'_t open and i have to use the sellers own website .
M	i was told i will get next_day delivery if you order before 0pm on a thursday i did not receive my product till the monday not happy with the service
F	bought a pre_- pay sim from vodafone . co . uk for my daughter .
M	so ive already booked and paid for these tyres which dont exist .
M	when each item was not noted to be present we ordered them and received them the next_day which was excellent however in doing so incurred two further p_&_p_charges which grated somewhat .
M	they keep you constantly informed of your progress and are on hand to help via both phone and email
F	whilst i am pleased with my purchase i would just like to say i '_m disappointed with
F	always efficient and easy to use and moreover , everyone i '_ve ever sent to has thought the displays beautiful .
F	i recommend them to everybody .
M	i had also asked for air_conditioning due to the hot_weather .
F	i think the products on this website are fake as i '_ve always bought this product from my salon and its worked_wonders for me .
F	can '_t wait to book my next event with them and also recommending them to everyone i speak to .
F	yours_faithfully
M	however for reasons of unreliability , needless hassle , and being rudely dismissed ( whether intended or not , under - staffed or not ), people will go to other_companies , good people too - from people with regular needs / regular customers , to people telling others by word of mouth etc ( every customer should be important to you - they are your bread and butter ).
F	since changing couriers the delivery has_been a nightmare , i am promised delivery but they just dont turn_up .
M	i travelled the 00 miles to mk simply to save_money and not be over charged for an mot . which pricing does seem like a lottery after ringing around .
M	yes !
M	usually next_day great service but this time it took 0 extra days which was particularly awkward as it was being delivered to a clients site and i have to keep apologising for the failure of the package to turn_up when expected .
F	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
F	it was also great to have 00_hours in which to fully inspect the goods , rather_than having to do so while the delivery man was present .
F	this is the second time i have used_resorthoppa and would definitely recommend them .
M	overall whilst i needed the products for a special application , fponline are now filed under the relevant heading and i know where to go in future
M	not recommened
F	overall not bad but wouldnt order again .
F	0 ) not being told they are hk based
F	after discussion they said they would ask their office to call me after 00 . 00 five_minutes later i then had their office on the phone .
M	after approx 00 calls a girl answered and stated that they were having computer problems and would call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
M	the service i got was top_class i shall use serenata_flowers again im very pleased and so is my wife who the flowers were for
F	!
M	giving them 0_stars just for the great price , otherwise it would '_ve been 0 .
F	face value £_00 . 00 . so basically have been charged_£_000 . 00 for £_00 . 00 tickets that are wrong .
M	i sent my galaxy s special delivery so it was insured wich was expensive .
M	item was left at thankfully honest neighbours !
M	huge_range
F	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
M	them still advertising a telephone_helpline which they no_longer answer ( to be more efficient ) didn_'_t help , and it was only because an operative ( jade - thank_you ) telephoned me that i was able to place my order after 0 very frustrating days of trying .
M	long_stay car_park charges , where the parking is often more_expensive that the flight costs , there '_s no reason for your business not to grow .
F	delivered safely and in good condition .
F	very pleased with this prompt service and the quality of the roller_blind supplied .
M	well this is a review on the company and not the products .
M	i bought 0 tyres , for the first time on line .
F	i thought i was getting a good deal , the flowers were gorgeous but sending them to nz worked out very expensive .
M	i have had to on occasion phone up and ask for my invoice , the people there are very helpful and quickly email me the invoice , but i ' d rather not have to phone in the first place .
F	was told i would be contacted when bed was back in stock but heard_nothing .
F	i ordered party boxes and table_decorations for my daughters 0th_birthday .
M	:-(
M	they are slightly_cheaper but not enough to make it worth putting up with the problems .
M	i wrote an email to get an update and i never got a reply .
F	hey carol i orderd from aimed direct fab service i would recommend them to you fast silvery too .
M	these_guys have a very bad attitude_towards customers and thoroughly deserve all the bad_press that they get
F	it arrived very quickly but i only found out when my mum called me to say that i had post .
M	they offer a daily free game which used to be good .
F	i called 00_minutes before arriving at gatwick and still waited a further 0 minutes for the driver .
M	as the standard truck was deemed too large to deliver because of width restrictions , we agreed 0 deliveries with a smaller 0 . 0 ton truck .
M	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
M	regards
M	after many hours of conversations with talk_talk it was evident that the only solution they could offer was for my company to do without broadband , wait for 00 days until the order and reconnection went through .
F	!
M	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
M	i called customer_services who basically said the app wasn_'_t designed for that so hard luck .
M	thanks for delivering my flowers though .
F	it '_s just great to be able to find out , at the press of a button , what people think , both positively and negatively about somewhere you want to go or something you want to do .
F	after being promised phone_calls back which were never received , i ended_up having to make three_separate phone_calls over the space of 0 hours .
F	age_partnership were very helpful and kept me upto_date with every move i made .
M	i bought a star costume costing around £_00 . 00 .
M	ramada .
F	impressive service .
F	can '_t wait_until viovet change their delivery service !
M	but how wrong can you be huh_?
F	thank_you !
F	i '_ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
M	can i add that the swindon_store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
M	this is a bit_steep for making changes over 0 months away . ouch !
F	the website was easy to use and locate the products i needed .
M	this site is probably the worst site i have dealt_with .
M	i will never buy from groupon again .
F	great service from this company , i have no_complaints and would recommend to others for sure
F	i purchased a beko cxfd0000w fride /_freezer online on 00 / 00 / 00 .
M	0 .
F	!
F	it '_s truly_amazing how much of a discount you get off the high_street prices .
F	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually_impossible to re sell them !
F	i contacted customer service who told me that they were going in the post the next_day - 0_days_later no envelopes !
M	friendly staff and great products .
F	i ordered my bugaboo_buffalo from pramworld on recommendations from friends as well as the fact that the buggy was in stock and i was told over the phone that it would be delivered the next_day .
M	i did buy some products for businss purpose , and no complain if they closed my account , the problem is they never return the money to me , i called them many_times , every time they said account specialist ( they called themselves specialist , funny ) will contact me in 00_hours , but i never got reply on time .
F	recommend animed , easy website , good prices and delivered promptly .
M	to my surprise it arrived here today ( tuesday ) via_recorded mail .
M	best quality of products and service is undoubtedly to be found at m & s and waitrose .
F	however it was badly packed , no return_label and the goods were incorrect .
F	many_thanks for the prompt delivery .
F	can be a bit too pricey .
F	will use service again
F	thank_you
F	delivery was great , on time the only upset was when i removed the 00kg_bag from the outer_bag the inner was cut and taped , as you can_imagine clearing up 00kg of dry_dog_food from the carpet was not wanted .
M	rgds
F	with a child , a dog and a job this was really not easy for me and not acceptable .
M	yet it is they who owe me money !
F	quick .
M	a fast efficient service made easy highly_recommended
F	i was pleasantly_surprised how simple it was to get what i wanted and each_stage of the process was acknowledged .
M	keep_up with the other_sites and deliver in 00 for no extra_cost
F	this is the second time i have used this company and i did not come_across any_issues on the first_instance , but there is obviously an issue on their website that does not allow repeat_customers to change the delivery address correctly !
F	i also found that the use by date is in three_months which for the cost of the beer is poor .
F	oh , one more thing , no apology whatsoever !
F	i alway order my ferret_food from animed_direct .
F	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
M	they ' re idiots that cant even offer you something so that you dont go bad mouthing them . well , i just did .
F	received goods in faulty condition and other item was damage too , very disappointment but had replacements .
F	email no .
F	all this nonsense about " lost in the post " " chinese ny " doesn_'_t cut it .
F	not happy at all and would not even give one star , unless they pull out all the stops to send out another delivery asap .
F	cheapest site i could find to buy drontal_tablets .
M	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only_assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
F	the bouquet was very nice and as the photo on the website .
M	the experience of parking at edinburgh is perfectly fine and i am aware of the long_stay and short_stay options .
F	thank_you for great service .
F	i am very happy with the furniture and the experience in the shop and the main delivery driver .
M	ordered 00 batteries but only 0 sent .
F	i do not recommend business phones direct to anyone - beware !
M	very helpful attitude from tooled_up staff when delivery was delayed - entirely the fault of the carriers , not tooled_up .
M	engaged .
F	it was easy to put my order through bt not impressed how long it '_s takeing for it to arrive because it '_s a birthday_present n she may not get it in time
F	costumes arrived 0_days before expected day .
F	i have no issue whatsoever with the delivery guys - they are always polite and understanding as to my frustration and i understand they have strict rules , but i do have a real issue with yodel as a company .
F	despite all of this my mum was please with it .
F	took rather longer for parcel to arrive than i expected : i had hoped they would be with me for bank_holiday , but never mind .
M	for four reasons :
M	delivery note stated that it was collected on the 00st .
F	i don_'_t know how this company is still in business .
M	i paid the amount due when i collected from the repair only for it to do exactly the same when i gave it back to her .
M	also their call_center is based in india , very rude .
F	!
F	every time i make a purchase with this company there is a problem !!!!!
F	fast , efficient , well - priced service
M	never had any_problems all ways happy to help
M	i feel_confident i can return to simplyasus in the future .
F	when i saw 000 print i thought that because of the price they would look abit cheap , but once they arrived i was really suprised at how professional they looked .
M	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
M	you ' d be mad to pay their prices .
F	variety of goods , great present ideas & great prices !
M	ja
F	i '_d only hired a cleaner because i '_d been struggling to keep_up at home because of a very demanding job , but rather_than helping , my dealings with maid0clean and the insulting nature of the calls almost reduced me to tears .
M	paulo then set about putting all of my wish_list into a suggested order and emailed me with his thoughts .
M	would recommend .
F	a very satisfied_customer !
F	however they did arrive after about 0_days and and overall i was pleased with them .
F	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
F	will_continue to buy goods from them .
F	in short , terrible network_coverage , terrible pushy rude and sometimes unintelligable customer service from call_centre and nearly_impossible to get unlock_code and pac codes from .
M	what can i say , top service & price as always , been ordering from ffx for years .
M	unfortunately the bouquet delivered was quite different from that ordered based on the picture on the website .
F	i am thrilled with the quality of the table too - everything was as stated on the site and great value too - i couldn_'_t be_happier !
M	happy to take the money , but their ' value added service ' is non_existent .
F	i was disappointed to receive a bent table plan with the covering all bumpy .
F	do not trust hpi checks !
M	told the customer ,
F	having already reviewed my experience of buying a car with car shop , and praising them highly , i would like to post my thoughts on their aftercare , which is not proving to be so good .
M	good and speedy service , competative_prices too .
M	didn_'_t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
M	i rang before i ordered a wetsuit & was re - assured i could return it if it didn_'_t fit .
F	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
F	as it was they arrived the day after and the recipient knew as i had asked if they had been a nice_surprise !
M	great price for double built under oven .
F	i '_m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
F	long_story_short , i got a new phone and unfortunately had problems with that too .
F	once i discovered this it made all the difference .
F	during communication with the company they implied there was nothing they could do , would not discuss any sort of recompense basically have very poor customer_care .
M	the do communicate too much and i don_'_t appreciate being on mail lists i didn_'_t subscribe to .
F	i went to another company and got one even_though i had not leased from them .
M	i think you can tell that i am extremely pleased with the service , i made a number of inquiries to different sites as i needed some usb_drives made quickly .
F	everything was fine with ordering carnt_fault it . my only_complaint was i would have liked an_email or phone_call to let_me know goods had been despatched then i would have known they were at_least on their way so therefor i missed the delivery and had to make other arrangements for them to try and deliver again .
M	this company is laughing all the way to the bank .
M	bit of a disappointment .
F	i paid_extra for next_day delivery so the goods should have arrived on friday but they did not arrive until monday
F	needless to say i won_'_t be trusting argos online again
M	my first order was placed but i had ordered the wrong_size , i sent it back and received the replacement by return post . the double transaction was completed in less than0 days . no ther company i have dealt_with have ever been so responsive
M	this is how an online_retailer should be run .
F	pricing wise you can definately get your dvds and cds cheaper elswhere online but pretty good pricing during their sales .
F	the new ones have a slightly_thicker end and bend much more easily .
F	item as_described , very pleased .
M	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
M	a few_days_later installed o / s etc .
F	i ordered flowers choc balloon and vase & card , on the wednesday before mothers_day , so i got a e_- mail saying we have had delivered the flowers , so i was very surprised when i called my mum on sunday saying she had nothing from me .
M	ordering from the online store is always fine but their insistence on using interlink courier causes a great deal of fricton for me .
M	the price was competitive and ordering on the website straight_forward .
M	i have used interparcel many_times and on the whole the deliveries have got where they should when they should .
F	the £ 0 . 00 charge covers the courier cost for next working day delivery
M	!
F	steamer is massive compared to old one , had to change as had new_induction_hob installed .

F	the coffee_machine_broke_down on the return_journey forcing me and my family to go to other areas to obtain drinks .
F	really happy with this company and cannot_fault their customer service .
F	however whilst placing one package in his van it ' exploded ' and nearly hit him on the head and took him by complete surprise .
F	great price so i purchased the sunglasses they took the payment then i got a message_saying they weren_'_t in stock offered me a refund but also said they could be here anything between 0 - 0_weeks i wasn_'_t left with much choice as my refund wouldn_'_t of gone back straight_away so i stuck with the order they did arrive within 0_weeks the delivery experience was great was able to track them all the way to me

F	good quality product but not quite right on the fitting side - thanks
F	what a let_down . avoid this company at all costs
F	i am very disappointed as i have many pairs of tresor earrings and they have been great , this is why i feel very let_down and disappointed by this brand .
M	j h gilroy
F	i live in the united_states and was referred to serenata by someone living in london .
M	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
F	animed did my catfood at the cheapest price .
M	they refused and waffled on about why .
M	i did , seems ok , proof of the pudding will be if all goes well when i call at their chosen branch next monday .
F	delivery of bbq being made by argos , bbq_cover sent under separate cover .
F	when i called customer_services i was informed that one of the items was out of stock and that delivery was due that day and therefore dispatch of my order would be the following_day .
F	we have bought ecco_shoes for our 0 year_old_son again and again , and we are very pleased with their quality .
F	leave in porch .
M	i have had excusses after excuss , extended dead line after extended dead line .
M	the end product was exactly_what we required and expected .
F	if my train is late and i miss the purpose of my journey , i have wasted money for nothing .
M	however , i was very surprised an disappointed to receive it without_any packaging to protect it and it wasn_'_t a surprise to the person as they saw it !!!
F	so this has_been a very costly transaction for me .
M	00 / 00 .
F	called the customer service team on friday 00 : 00 was told they had rung the store on thursday and spoke to ( name_removed ) who was to ring me .
F	there were eight , which seemed a bit skimpy , considering .
F	simple solution to finding the perfect dress .
M	still_waiting .
F	thank_you .
F	i got a bit_confused with the questions they asked about the binding settings and am still not sure_whether they have been set_up for me or not but i guess it '_s best to take them to an expert to check out anyway !
M	light - box ).
F	do not use this company
F	avoid at all costs .
M	we had a local event on boxing_day on a waterway next to my local tesco store .
F	other prestigious retailers do this as normal and good practice .
M	after dinner there was some entertainment - a cover band and a guy on piano - the guy on piano was fun but the band was a little bland and we got bored pretty quick .
M	thanks to your slow lumbering system i will be without a cooker for 00 days instead of my planned 0 day as my gas oven an hob were removed and disconnected ready for my new electric_cooker .
F	never had any reason to complain , simply the best !
F	i received notification that i had a parcel to collect at the post_office because it hadn_'_t had its postage fully paid .
M	microsoft are the leaders when it comes to software in my opinion but they rarely listen to their customers on what they would like to see or need in a program upgrade .
F	having seen a jacket in one of their shops - called both the on - line number and the store itself several_times to ensure that this was one and the same jacket - was assured it was as was the only jacket they stocked by this designer with an internal ' puffer '.
F	so normal reactions at christmastime , i suppose .
F	ordered items online .
M	no response
F	very helpful staff .
F	i believe there are ways to get authorisation from banks as_opposed to cancelling orders a day after it was placed .
M	my tuxedo came up_trumps .
M	0 .
F	well its been 0 hours and still no explanation to their request that they will look into it .
M	ease of communications and friendliness - 0 *
M	in fact there is still one payment still outstanding .
F	have purchased here before excellent service & postage , emailed with a problem was sorted_out very quickly . excellent 00 *
F	ordered one day and arrived the next . free delivery too .
F	i tried the wednesday meal and was too scare to try anymore .
M	the items i ordered arrived smashed and so the palette was refused .
M	even with the groupon this has cost around £_00 and i '_m just not happy .
M	items were very well_packaged by digitalrev ; copious_amounts of bubble_wrap around the retail boxes .
F	apart_from the that the service is good and i certainly would recommend to a friend .
F	arghhh !!
F	it '_s not really worth anyone '_s while using precious time trawling suppliers when animed is so consistently reliable and fair .
F	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don_'_t expect groupon to help !
F	i had used this company before so knew the quality would be good , and it was - always good to have that confirmed .
F	goods arrived quickly as as expected .
F	let '_s up it lives up to its name of being anti_- burst !
M	speedy service and delivery .
M	when i did they said they for some reason did not contact me as it was out of stock !!
M	now i am totally unsure as to whether i will use photoworld again , which is a shame .
F	the day after i made my order i received an_email to say my items were out of stock .
F	!
M	they missed an item in my initial delivery , but immediately sent it out once i notified them , and included free stuff as compensation - can '_t_argue with free stuff !
M	recieved my order six days after_placing it , admittedly i ordered on a saturday but expected it to arrive tuesday wednesday at the latest .
M	been using interparcel for many_years and have had no_problems with them .
F	i '_ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
F	thought it was going to cost £ 0 . 00 as advertised ( which didnt indicate a number of pages ) but with added pages ( which it added automatically as i uploaded photos ) ended_up being £_00 .
F	i would go back to tsilivi tomorrow but not in that hotel there was so many small things wrong but over all the hotel was good small things easy to put right but trasfers were poor going and they were also poor on our last holiday to tenerife
M	i '_m not a business customer , nor am i uk vat_registered .
M	three_times he didn_'_t .
M	yet to use table_saw but has caused drama with fitting of blade .
F	perhaps they are too busy working their way through the mountaim of complaints in their in - tray , or perhaps they don_'_t care .
M	it was the first time i used the site .
F	upfront about charges for shipping and delivery .
M	personally i '_m not wasting another moment with them !
F	the previous company i ordered this product through , used to state 0 - 0 day delivery slot , but it always arrived the very next_day .
F	the iflorist website was very slow and crashed frequently .
F	i spotted that the courier company '_s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother '_s day .
M	the operator didn_'_t seem able to understand my question as to whether i was booking for a specific time_slot or for the whole day .
F	i find that naturesbest has an excellent service and i trust the contents of their products .
F	the collection driver was lovely and reasured me of any concerns .
F	delivery guys text to say they were on their way and then rang to say they would be there in 00_minutes .
F	really happy with mazuma .
F	only_thing i will say is the sizing is snug .
F	lets_hope it arrives in the end !
F	i was very impressed with every_step of my purchase , from order through to delivery .
M	fortunately the slots in the mounting_brackets allowed adjustment inward but this has left a small gap_between the wall and the brackets instead of the flush mounting that i had measured , to the mm , for .
F	well_done mazuma !!!!!!!
F	the flowers ( i '_m told are pretty ) although having seen a picture they are a bit wrinkled a creased from their long day in the van .
F	you were recommended by my physio as the best and cheapest place to buy a foam_roller .
M	highly_recommended and am enjoying my beautifully speedy 0gb_ram on my laptop !
M	0nd edit_:
F	" confirmed at : 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 ( this can sometimes be quite a bit later than the actual time the flowers arrived )"
F	like other people posting here , i '_m still_waiting for my 0d_tickets for edinburgh next week .
F	:-))
M	first_class service .
F	but the delivery was good .
M	utterly_hopeless certainly describes my initial experience , but once my complaint got through to the correct people the service was good .
F	i posted on here four days ago re : gig etickets that were unavailable to print ( and the expense of a trip_abroad for 0 people wasted on the back of this - review included here ).
F	the website is easy to use , but if you can '_t find which memory it is that you need , they are extremely_helpful by email or by phone .
M	the delivery process worked ( it arrived ) but was totally different from any i '_ve_used before and seemed like a lot of trouble .
F	there was no returns_slip so i had to ring the call_centre to advise i wished to return the item and was informed returns were not free .
F	think the 0 - year_guarantee might come in useful :-(
M	the product overall is nice , although when coming to install i realise there are no wall plugs . hello screws don_'_t go in walls alone , then there was not enough screws to fit the centre brace so it is up without now .
F	we stayed at one of escalea '_s paris apartments .
F	the card hadn_'_t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
F	d . butler
M	shorts wrong_colour as ordered
M	can recommend chemist_direct easy to use site and good value products , ordering is simple and delivery is well_packaged and very prompt , thanks .
F	received order next_day .
M	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don_'_t do it from here .
M	would recommend anyone to give them a try .
F	i have recommended this website to all my colleagues and friends .
M	this has to be the most excellent service i '_ve received in a very long time .
M	delivery of 0 - 0_weeks was a bit_slow though .
M	i was , however , less_than delighted when a courtesy_call confirming order and delivery turned into a hard_sell for " extended_warranty " type thing ( never have to buy another fridge ).
M	i also ordered a card with my flowers .
M	includes arrival times and platform numbers for connections in germany and belgium .
F	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping_me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
M	at these prices you expect some corners to be cut .
M	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
F	cant_wait !
F	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
M	will submit full review when i have installed purchased item .
M	as stated above so_far so good but as everything is fresh its hard to make any kind of critique .
F	delivery is always fast and comes in descrete parcels .
M	palmed off with , voice coils not covered_under_warranty , no mention of this anywhere , underpowered provided amplifier cause of clipping and coil burn , kit never fit for purpose .
F	how nice to deal with a company that understands customer service
F	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .
M	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
F	having not recieved my parcel , ( 0st time customer ) - i had to chase pest_control the following week to be told that they could not find the house .
F	see above -- said it all ---
F	i had a quick and easy purchase .
F	fortunately for you the plumbing was delayed otherwise i would have gone_elsewhere and cancelled my odrer .
F	it arrived really well_packaged and within 0_days of being ordered ; it fits_beautifully , is obviously very well made and i can see it fast becoming a wardrobe favourite !
F	i e_mailed the company asking about the returns_procedure and got a standard e_mail by return telling_me to visit the website .
M	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full_monty sim - only deal .
F	but there is no way i '_m waiting for 0_weeks . i '_m getting very angry !!!!!!!
M	!
M	i tried_calling customer service at 0pm but after going through their call steering , i got a recording saying the offices were closed ( of course ).
F	i am now having to put in a claim through paypal and by the time i get my money back it will be about 0_weeks since placing the order and no sunlgasses !
M	however i have no_complaints about the delivery service .
F	had a not great experience last time as paid for max 0 drops to beat package tour_bus to hotel and had more than four drops and driver spent_ages looking for a location .
F	fast delivery - received within a couple of days .
F	a fast and good quote was followed_by an excellent service .
F	the booking was okay i guess , despite_being promised £_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
F	ordered replacement hinge for freezer - excellent service .
M	usual oakley quality at half the price .
M	recently had a holiday to tenerife booked through thomas_cook , it was a very good holiday , the reason i give it 0_stars though is because thomas_cook were pretty unenthusiatic , was informed that we ' d receive a discount card for restaurants , attraction etc .
M	d ' oh the mistake was my fault i should have checked the keyboard immediately on receipt , as should be done with all mail order goods .
M	good service
M	they let_me know when the flowers had left with the dispatcher , and nothing else after that .
M	all sorted !
F	plus i have 0 more pending transactions from ebookers which i don_'_t understand !
M	( same number was showing for 0 days - i ' d been watching ! )
F	when i reported this to serenata_flowers i received an_email_advising that they had spoken to the driver and confirmed they were left at the correct_address .
F	my second order was conducted wholly online a few_days ago .
M	also it won_'_t let_me not accept the terms and conditions
F	boys bow_ties ordered one day and arrived the next_day - just what i needed .
M	the scooter went down the first drop kerb ok but ground to a complete halt when trying to get up the opposite drop kerb .
F	two nice lads and they took my old machine away for £_00 .
M	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave_me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
F	what '_s that all about ?
M	sorry but no !!!!!!!!
F	i purchased a christmas outfit for 00 . 00 on the 0rd of december and payed for next_day delivery i haven_'_t received my outfit yet and have missed the event that i needed it for so i requested that i have a full_refund including postage for the inconvenience
M	highly_recommended !
F	monday comes and the driver finally rings our bell .
F	the first time an item had fallen out in transit , in fairness customer_services at hq_hair were fabulous and sent a replacement out rapidly and without issue , this time the bo '_s was again gaping open , my shampoo had leaked a little due to being bashed around and the gift box set i ordered was battered , luckily it was for me not a gift !
F	there is entertainment for young kids and adults but very little for age range 0 +
F	reciever was really pleased with the flowers .
M	bookmarked their web_page !
M	0 with rubbersoles . co . uk which tracked immediately with no_problems
F	costume arrived on time and the quality was not good but what i have come to expect of fancy_dress stuff .
F	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
F	when i heard_nothing i sent an e_- mail .
M	the ordering was easy , there was plenty of choice .
M	i work 0 days a week from 0am_till_0pm so i missed the delivery , when i called the company to re arrange delivery to either my worksite or a neighbors house they said that they could do nothing without permission from the sender , and unless i sorted it out by that day it would be returned to sender .
M	in fact stay_away full stop , not a nice store at all .
M	happy with boots , but had some_confusion with checkout .
M	good online shop , used a few_times , but last time i needed to know some information about a product , that wasn_'_t clear on the website .
F	why are you the only company left on the planet that doesn_'_t accept electron for online shopping ?
F	will definitely use again .
F	order over 0_weeks_ago .
M	0_stars to imogenstone .
F	your company made it so easy and i felt very secure in my business dealings with you , thank_you
F	i haven_'_t used this company before but i will definitely be using them again !
M	just one flaw , you must travel off peak , which is really not convenient .
F	knew others were going so needed seating in particular area .
F	so i have just brought extra of the missing size covers .
M	anyway , a man suggested a couple of alternative places but my husband couldn_'_t access a computer to look at what he meant at that time .
F	direction wasn_'_t provided and was not happy .
F	car_mats uk are prompt and efficient on the whole i '_m pleased with my product i was offered an up grade for an extra £ 0 . 00 which i '_m_glad i took up as i dread to think what the standard matts would of been like as the upgrade makes only just worth having as i don_'_t rate the quality as high as the company , however i did want mats that are a perfect_fit for my new car hence_why i opted for these , so my advise would be not to go for the cheaper option as you could gets mats of this grade for far less in your local_supermarket
F	hate it when clothes companies use this courier service is it cheap to use or something ?.
M	i was very frustrated to find that , having chosen all the possible insurance options , there was another substantial daily premium to pay at pick - up , to eliminate the thousand_pound excess .
M	however i said because i work during the day , this is why i did the collect_+ store , and can they not reimburse me with next_day evening delivery .
F	they managed to get our address wrong , contact name wrong and email address wrong even_though i placed the order on line , i emailed them regarding an account quire as no one on the phone could help me so i was asked to email accounts , its been 0_days and still no reply from accounts , i was told items would be with me with in 0 - 0 working_days , two_weeks_later still had not received items i had to chase them , still have items outstanding even_though i was told they would all be here at the same time , although the price of the items are very good , i find their customer service not on top form .
M	they advised me by email and the lenses are perfect .
F	i can not recommend this service enough .
F	despatched product quickly - kilt good quality for the price .
M	car was damaged , but they assured us this was covered by the insurance .
M	phone cover was ok , some quality issues where wrap wasn_'_t lined_up perfect leaving a white uneven line .
F	very , very poor and would urge_anyone to look elsewhere for transfers .
F	delighted to find golf_clothes of good quality and reasonably_priced .
M	having forked out for the petition to be filled in , i ran_out of money and was unable to pay divorce - online to manage the rest of the process .
M	great local company , fast service and very helpful , cant go_wrong with these_guys .
M	just booked car parking at manchester_airport with sky_park , i found the booking forms easy to complete .
M	would prefer to pay more for a bit more luxury so won_'_t hurry back
M	fantastic worktop and fast delivery , thanks
F	so , hardly a surprise i give sainsburys only one star .
F	i was pleased with the products and the quality of the packaging however i was disappointed with the delivery time and a bit_suspicious that as soon as i asked for the order to be cancelled it was finally processed !
M	eventually said they maybe noy 000_% fresh and just bit dull looking .
F	this company are relying_on the perishable goods_act to get out of refunds and need to be stopped !
F	i was told that if i did not accept this offer and let things drag on it would cost me more money ,.
M	excellent service but still very expensive for 0 day stay .
M	as it is , they are very well made and every bit as good as any you could_find in high_street_opticians at four or five times the price .
F	0 - the generic email showed nothing that the emails had actually been read
F	ordered , received email notification that it would be delivered on 00th , waited all day , not delivered , received another email would now be monday 00th , not impressed
F	feel_cheated
F	i left email after email .
F	delivered on time and by very pleasant driver .
F	the tights were perfect for my halloween_party .
F	!
M	bunch flowers look a lot bigger on webpage , came in a box by dhl they looked like they had been slung around as when i opened box it took me 00_minutes to sort them out before i gave them to my wife .
F	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don_'_t need to search for materials .
F	as i paid good money for these i expected better .
F	apart_from the initial email from the supplier confirming dispatch we did not receive any other text / email to let us know when it would be delivered .
M	i was very pleased with their service .
F	what happened to customer service where they want to look after the customers ??
M	looking over the reviews on the internet it is surprising this company is still trading .
M	thanks .
F	towels , toiletries etc .
M	that is what was said in about 0 cases and only twice did they . i felt we had to do all the chasing as are new nissan was due on a monday but made several phone_calls then found out it was delayed . ah well we got it and are pleased with the car at_least .
F	art is available on easy to use web_site
F	i even left a note to the driver to say leave it on my doorstep .
F	ordered 00kg of chicken_breasts which qualified for free delivery which was a bonus .
M	i bought an item labelled as " new " when received it was dirty and had holes in !
M	price and value of tyres is perfect but i am not happy about national_tyres and autocare in northampton they have scratched my alloys .
F	gutted :(
F	received both items next_day before lunchtime .
M	sign is much thicker than i expected and is very clear .
F	it seems to me that stephanie has completely missed the point .
M	food .
M	0 . shortly_after ordering , i was updated that the order may involve a delay as ' pick_up ' from source is delayed .
M	from selling my phone to receiving payment the full process only took around a week .
F	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i '_m_sure that is possible when he '_s based in uae ?!!!!)
F	the delivery guys noted it on the delivery invoice and assured me that replacements would be posted out to me that was on 00 march and i am still_waiting .
M	further installation problems – still not fixed despite many email – we contacted cab and trading_standards who have documented details of the issues .
M	' are you taking the piss !?'
F	the durable quality of the workmanship and the product impressive .
M	no problem at all with my order , all very easy to set - up the print process .
F	dreadful service !
F	i found the website easy to use with lots of information available .
F	( im talking to a more of an acquaintance than a friend )
M	no glitches , so very pleased there .
F	we found the products to be good value and well made , however we were assured that we would receive emails at various_stages of the despatch process and this never happened which_meant we had to ring up to find out when our order was likely to be delivered .
M	excellent service .
F	my only_gripe is that everything has to be put_together so you need to spend a couple of hours putting the chairs together .
F	my husband laid the tiles and after inspecting his work i found 0 of them were blemished .
M	i '_ve had better online service from other_retailers hence the 0_stars .
M	passport was delivered the next_day after the driver phoned , again unable to operate the doorbell
M	sales experience wasn_'_t too bad , however post purchase it all went very south !
M	cannot_fault stools and delivery
M	the saddle came very well_packed and within a few_days of my order .
F	easy to follow web_site but irritating only being_able to look at one date at a time on a chosen route to compare_prices and choose a day of travel , having to go back and re enter details each time is time_consuming .
M	will order again thanks .
F	i have replied .
M	he is a thoroughly nice_chap and resent the product out for next_day delivery .
M	they said on their website it was worth £_00 !
M	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
F	chairs were good value apart_from having no instructions .
F	i ordered the fins in early june .
M	thanks
F	!
M	had to go and find it .
M	side pieces keep wobbling about .
F	the service from eflorist was extremely fast and easy , however i believe more care should be taken into the florists selected for completing the job as the bouquet was relatively_small and plain for the price paid compared with flowers i have purchased directly from florists myself .
M	fantastic .
F	la societe a donc bien recredite notre carte bancaire avant la fin du delai de 00 jours .
F	i would probably try somewhere_else .
M	so thanks to all at nevada , i '_ll definitely use you again !
M	this suggests a lack of attention to detail on the part of the despatch dept .
M	all good !
M	great for mindless browsing , not so good for finding what you want .
F	clearly groupon '_s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
M	throughout , they were very professional given the very busy time
F	just one criticism .
M	from the start the process is easy to use .
F	very unapologetic e_- mail saying that the money would be refunded !
F	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
M	however , there is no display of any transactions made on my account , just evidence of clicks to merchants .
M	toolstop had the complex electrical test equipment i needed and delivered the next_day as promised !
F	made a complaint as the woman i spoke to was completely uncaring and blunt with me .
M	best exchange_rates , best buy back rates and best service all_round .
M	a website that is easy to understand and use , good prices and very quick delivery .
M	following all the advice on glasses_direct , i gained the info from my prescription at the high_street_optician , selected the frames i wanted and went_ahead with the transaction .
M	i felt_confident in the website , information and brand .
F	best price for food_processor that we wanted .
M	the proof of the pudding was when she asked me , towards the end of the conversation , which ankle i had broken .
M	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
F	they eventually turned_up today .
M	arrived next_day as expected too .
M	i advised the desk staff that i was going to visit canada , however a major safety factor was overlooked .
F	this not only delayed our build , but it later turned_out that taps uk had used a different supplier to the one they usually used and hadn_'_t bothered to check whether the waste_baskets would be supplied ( as they usually are by their normal_supplier ).
M	i had used a . different site to order my ski_goggles and with 0days before my trip i was advised they wouldn_'_t reach me in time .
F	i am not sure about the quality of the product - i ordered polycarbonate anti_- bird spikes in 0 sizes .
M	all day today their site has said " gatwick service centre out for delivery 0 : 00 am " and here we are , over 0 hours_later and no sign , no call , no text , nothing , zip , nada .
F	bbq area could be improved .
M	won_'_t be ordering from this company again , or recommending .
M	stick to your plan .
F	customer service is also excellent .
M	pc flaky after install advised by mrm to use lower spec ram ( my motherboard spec said it supported both ).
F	i could go on and on .
M	if you are looking for special spots that dont cost an arm and a leg , this is the site . great pic '_s of the property '_s and a good run down on the amenities and a map to let you find the way . the owners of the property '_s respond promptly and give great directions to the property if you make the reservation . would recomment them highly .
F	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .
F	her only_gripe was she had to retrieve them from a house further up the road as you had delivered them to the wrong house .
M	money taken .
M	they said " send it back and we will refund your return postage " that was over a month_ago and still no refund .
M	job_done , no_hassle , no_hidden_extras .
M	there is a difference of about 0cm .
F	i love this site .
M	they would chase it and ring me back by 0am the next_day without_fail .
F	thebrideandgroomdirect is very good .
F	in october_0000 , we found ( we thought then ) the furniture that we had been searching for ; reviews of ofl led us to feel that placing an order of £_000_+ was worth taking a chance .
M	0_weeks_later - email from tredz items will be in stock end of month !
M	once they '_ve got your business they could not care less .
M	unsubscribe now don_'_t get caught my case is going to trading_standards as we type .
F	fast deliveries , excellent service
F	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
M	the product had clearly already been opened and the taped closed , product is poor quality .
M	after trawlng the internet tyre_shopper came out as the best value .
F	i have sent a complaint to customer_services with a picture of arrangement delivered and the reply i got back was that the display met their expectations .
M	why should i have to chase this ?
F	the chap there ( wayne ) then called the repair people to be told it would take another 0_weeks for the copying which we felt was too long so we cancelled the copying part and were told the repair would be complete in a couple of days and the old hard_drive would be returned with the pc so we could have it copied over at the shop ( only takes 0 day ) and we would be contacted by the weekend .
F	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
F	can '_t comment on how it works as it hasn_'_t been put in yet .
F	the item i ordered was £_00 and a few_pence , but when i added it , i was still charged for p_&_p and was instead told free delivery only applied on orders over_£_00 .
M	found it by_accident and found to be cheaper_than more established internet company '_s
M	the prints arrived and are of very good quality .
F	dissappointed jn the vase as it was not as nice as the 0 i choose and paid for ?
F	my daughter_loves it !
M	so easy to use , this my second time using this company .
M	i made a purchase from saveonlaptops instead , and that was without an issue and cheaper .
M	thus price differentual us too big .
M	on free interpretation
M	the next_day i hadn_'_t received a call or response by email so called customer_services again .
M	i waited over 0_weeks for my case to be delivered , i had to chase the order on a number of occasions , some proactive communication would an improvement to manage the customers expectations if there is likely to be a delay .
F	my partner usually orders our products from lf but i have done so before too and have had the same reliable service .
F	by sheer_luck i have managed to log_onto the delivery company website which in almost_impossible to access to find out that the mattress was being delivered that day !
M	hotelinfos waren bislang korrekt .
F	we went for the white faux wood ( easy to keep clean ).
F	i had to battle for an_hour with the eurocar girl , she wanted to charge me again for everything .
M	!
F	so they said they would post immediately for delivery the next_day .
F	my latest purchase is the second time i have purchased my glasses from glasses_direct and it won_'_t be the last .
F	:-)
M	alpha_brain didn_'_t work on me at first but after taking it daily for a few_days i noticed a slight boost in concentration for 0 - 0 hours .
F	i had my baby registry at babies r_us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
M	with service like this , national_shower_spares deserve to amke a fortune .
F	thanks
F	please fix this .
F	i ordered a few_days ago and the hair had unexpectedly jumped up in price and they said the hair was now true remy so i paid .
F	extremely impressed .
F	i did not recieve my £_00 pound wellies as the courier left them with a " neighbour " who just happened to live 00 doors away from me . no card was put through my door to say parcel had been left at the house 00 doors away . and that is no exaggeration . when called customer service they told me there was nothing they would do as had been left with neighbour . although i did not permit them to do so .
F	however , once my order was placed , i was amazed to see on my confirmation_email , that my snack choice was completely wrong .
F	i would happily reccommend this site .
F	i have already_recommended the shop to a friend .
F	thank_you chemist_direct
M	they are happy to keep sending you sizes until you get what you need and all communication is personal and friendly .
M	prices are decent and they have cards from plenty of expansions .
M	as a personal_trainer i have used other_companies before and can_honestly_say that tpw is the nest company that i have used so_far .
F	i received no text .
M	the trouble with using royal_mail with an internet retail outfit is their inevitable inability to deliver product in a timely_manner and the customer then has to schlepp off to some remote place open from 0 . 00 am till 0 . 00 am to pick it up ( closed at the weekend ).
M	i ordered two new cards for my imac 00 , which arrived the very next_day !
M	brixton is quite a distance from me and i was there the previous day for other reasons that ended in my decision to pick_up a few items from iceland .
F	i asked if driver could just pop the items inside for me as he was simply dumping them outside .
F	the fabric is cheap and nasty .
F	i received the cricket_bat very promptly but it looked as if it had been used before - part of the sticker was missing and it was marked .
F	this is a warning to anyone_thinking of using this letting_agency .
F	it '_s just greed .
M	good layout but had a nightmare time trying to pay with debit_card tried 0 different ones and ended_up having to use credit_card at increased charge
F	just come_back from benidorm booking with alpharooms .
M	good workers friendly & helpful , let_me know how things were going .
M	on the web_site it only showed me the same estimate , which is not very useful .
F	no chance
F	all i had to do was choose my contact_lenses , enter my prescription and then add other items i might need like contact_lenses solution , enter my payment details , and you can use paypal !
M	these no way made up for ruining valentines_day and being told over and over again that i was lying , despite the the fact that the order tracking said that the order had never left the florist !
M	( also very compitetive price )
M	i had called to make_sure of an
M	talk_talk much_cheaper . and better customer service too .
M	, which have now been void .
M	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
M	first_class customer service :-)
M	also i have to say when i did call for some advice on a certain bean an compatibility with my machine it was obvious there was a lack of any real knowledge and therefore advice was not great only then to try and sell a bit more at end of call .
M	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
M	awful service , i will never use again , and i will be insisting on a refund too - such a nice thing to send 0 lovely_ladies who had an awful incident on friday , and serenata screwed it up !
M	friendly site very easy to use .
F	would recommend again and again .
F	quick and supportive responses and follow_up from staff
M	kept_informed of progress of order by email and was even given the delivery time to within one hour so didn_'_t need to stay in all day .
F	my experience was okay .
F	perfect all_round !
M	the problem now is the delivery costs to france .
M	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
M	this is just plainly poor customer focus in the business .
F	very fast delievery .
F	on their web_site it states that if you request a pick_up longer_than 00hrs notice then they will try and get their before 00 this did not happen and when speaking with a representative i was told i never seen this and i was wrong the female was very rude and abrupt and could not give me any info regarding pick_up , so i requested the number of the company being used and could not even give me there , and yet no secret i got the number from google , i spoke with a lady_who could not be more helpful and pleasant , well this was fruitless in the end as they did not even pick the parcel up , rude and abnoxious , stay away .
F	since then we have been delighted with the performance of the heater , the virtually fume - free fuel , the economical cost and the fantastic service which dry it out provide .
M	but dont use dpd again !
F	my family were sleeping and they woke_up my neighbors too .
F	best regards
F	i was spoken to in a manner bordering on aggressive .
F	i am really happy i found these products .
M	placed the order for a schuberth helmet and a blue mirror visor - the visor arrived in 0 days . the helmet was noted as coming from the chichester branch . after another 0 days there was no sign - a quick call to the customer desk and it was immediatly resolved and dispatched within an_hour .
F	i wish i could say the same about the office personnel - broken_promises and appointments that were not kept .
M	my cheque had been cashed .
M	i was unable to speak to anyone in england and was continually put through to call_centers in india and south_africa .
F	!
F	i was told that the parcel would definitely be delivered to me that night as the driver was staying on to deliver .
M	the software was very easy to use which made the creation and layout of the photobook very easy .
M	a few weeks_later we came back to buy the mazda 0 and were served by your new salesman , an older man .
F	i have complained to o0 and thankfully they are very very concerned_about this driver ’_s behaviour and the company '_s attitude_towards one of their valued_customers .
F	husband just wishes we lived_nearer to your shop !
M	i certainly feel that i have had full value for money here .
F	what we thought was a good price turned_out to be expensive .
F	after trying to contact opodo on the phone many_times ( racking up a huge phone bill ) regarding my booking , emailing them several_times , tweeting them , i have had no response from them at all .
M	i had some difficulty with card registering but they were patient with my misunderstanding !
M	il_faut faire évoluer les options du site lorsque l ' on prend l ' onglet " comparer les_prix ", que_l ' on valide un choix et que_l ' on va jusqu ' au paiement .
F	we have used the creditsafe system for anti money laundering id checks for about 0 - 0 years_now and have been generally pleased with the service , until recently .
M	at_least make an effort to make them wearable .
M	at this stage , not unreasonably , i started to get annoyed .
F	am now fed_up waiting - and am thinking i should contact my credit_card company and paypal to dispute the charges unless i get a response .
F	this website needs to advise customers if items are out of stock before items are placed !
F	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
F	i have used cash_genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
F	i have always found this service to be value for money , have a good range of product and to be user_friendly .
F	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
M	. i guess i can '_t return it now .
F	when i complained i got an_email back saying they were sorry and my account would be credited with £ 0 . 00 to cover delivery on any future order .
M	seem to be a good company , need to keep an eye on attention to detail .
M	which was a fairly easy process to be fair , i did have to ring up to cancel thou , there isn_'_t a method to cancel online ( which is odd , considering you can sign up online .) so i was expecting some sales_pitch on the phone_call but fortunately , there wasn_'_t any , and it took no_longer_than 00_mins on the phone to cancel .
M	not that important but the promotion was james_bond and the new dvd skyfall and that wasn_'_t even in the package .
F	on top of this , the tickets arrived - i had paid eu000 each and the face value was eu00 . 00 - double the price - disgusting !
M	they always last a long while as well .
M	both orders arrived complete and with no trouble from the delivery company that they used .
M	the police officers managed to convince the manager to pay the refund .
F	unfortunately my partner had already put the blind up when i realised there was a hitch of material right through the middle of it so because of this i don_'_t pull it down fully because it '_s very noticeable .
F	i am now not afraid to leave the house !
M	not even the customer service manager was able to tell me what they will be doing or how this will be investigated .
M	pay a litle more use a reputable_company .
F	and with free delivery who can complain ?
F	will_definately use again and would recommend to anyone , especially those with busy_lives .
M	great experience , great accommodation ( quirky , ancient exposed brick and timber ceilings ) and inexpensive ( a fully_kitted_out studio for 0 with courtyard for less_than a standard hotel_room ).
F	i logged on to the iflorist website on friday_afternoon , two_days before mothering_sunday about 0 . 00pm .
M	glasses were totally not as_described thick lenses instead of thin_lenses for rimless infact 00_% thicker than they should have been .
F	well when they arrived i was really disappointed because some flowers had fallen_off before they was received and if your expecting the bouquet to be big then you will be in for a shock .
F	why can '_t i puchase from you without having to sign in and have a password .
M	======
M	i selected one of them and was delighted with the service ; they even sent a photo of the wheel to ensure it was the correct one .
M	they are absolute_rubbish and robbers and all comments i agree with . the sooner i get_rid of them the better .
M	unfortunately it would seem that the reviews are correct .
M	it would have been cheaper for me if i could have filled up the tank before returning .
F	i would expect next working day delivery for a cost like this .
F	i didn_'_t realise how easy it was to sell my phone and get the money so quickly and the phone wasn_'_t even working i did it all online with mazuma_mobile , i even made the mistake of clicking on the wrong button so i would of been laud by cheque but mazuma_mobile called me to check and it was paid into my bank that afternoon .
F	shame you have to dispose of the packaging yourself .
F	this was demonstrated and communicated in a very clear and efficient way .
F	ie .
F	postage .
F	!
M	00rd_april_0000
F	i found them really disappointing .
F	the hampers are beautifully_presented and come with a great selection of fudge .
M	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home_cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
F	talk about waste of time and frustration , never mind the fact that we have no kitchen_sink or tap ( i am too scared to go and buy one elsewhere as we cannot_afford to lose this money ). i have no idea what else to do now , they really do not have a care for customers and tehy seem to get away with it .
F	i hope you have stopped_selling the batteries i purchased as the manufacturer no_longer make them
M	i queried the amount and she confirmed that i should be paying £_00 a month and pretty_much refused to believe me about the £_00 agreed with e0save .
F	where do i begin in january this year me and my husband decided wed like a change from the car we had a chevrolet kalos which we also purchased from stoneacre and said we never would again after the problems we had with the kalos anyway we thought wed try them again what a mistake they couldnt do us a deal on what we wanted so the salesman phoned us up the following_day said hed found us a nice car that he could do us a deal on so off we went to look at it it was a renault_megane it was lovely so we bought it what a mistake the car went in about 0 times first time it was just little things like heater control and a few bulbs didnt work when the car was repaired we picked it up only to find that the mechanics had damaged the centre console so it went back to have a new one fitted got the car back again had it a few_days and the gearbox started having problems so the car went back to be repaired again this continued for the next 0 month in the end finance and stoneacre decided we could change the car to a fiat_panda low and behold this has_been a nightmare in and out of stoneacres for repairs only had the car 0_months and its been in for repair 0 times already to which there saying they cant find anything wrong with it but we get it back and the following_day the problem starts again we paid for a life time guarantee on the megane only to find out we had to pay another life time guarantee when we got the panda bearing in mind we only had the megane 0_months i just dont_think this is fair why couldnt they have transferred the guarantee from the megane onto the panda for goodwill but no they wont they have ended costing us more money because the panda was less money than the megane the situation now is were so fed_up because they now want us to take the car in and let the mechanic have it a few_days to see if the problem_occurs while in his hands or they will buy the car back for a reduced price of what we paid for it we are now looking elsewhere as the problem is still persisting all we want is a car we can_rely_on dont_think weve been treated fair at all
M	the guy that came was pleasant , punctual & efficient .
M	the delivery time was well within what i hoped .
M	they stated that i could not reduce my taffif until my contract was up .
M	keep_up he good work viking_signs .
M	i had never_heard of yodel before yesterday and i am not surprised .
M	bought 0 new myson radiators but 0 of them arrived damaged , plumbnation would not accept responsability because it was not reported within 0 days .
M	table arrived in good time , however when i came to assemble it , dicovered that the football table top was ' crushed ' on one corner and that one corner of the pool_table had been badly put_together ( screws had missed holes and come out sides ).
F	!
F	service great too - they came exactly on time and i was kept in touch with when to expect them .
F	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
F	needless to say i cancelled the order and ordered my machine from 000 electrical where i had my washing_machine 00_hours_later .
F	when i opened the box the bouquet came in i knew something was wrong .
M	even_though i paid for the extra chocolate with the flower , the person did not get any chocolate .
F	it is now 0th_january and i still have not received my order ( although the money was debited from my account immediately ).
F	the way i was kept in touch with each_stage of the process was very reassuring eg .
F	i have only just received my goods so i cannot write a true review .
M	only half an_hour later i had confirmation of a delivery date from the couriers dpd .
F	saturday 0nd nov
F	eventually wrote a long and rather strongly worded letter to their md mark cheshire , they gave_me 00_%_off ( ha not using that !)
M	not an update merely a quick reply to mr . cooper - he may note i did say in aoriginal post i contacted customer_services - they never replied , i did ask in that email for an update on my order .
M	initially i received a reply full of hyped - up sales bullshit speak promising me ' special deals '.
M	so_far .
M	when i bought our caravan we only had one key for it .
F	however i am very disappointed with the overall quality as the message inside the card is very faint and hard to read - just hope people manage to attend my function .
M	i asked for the delivery date and then nothing happened .
M	tyre_shopper provided the best price on 0 x 000 00 00 and they were fitted at national_tyre_centre in cannock .
F	all in all the process took just 0_days and was entirely painless .
F	good response time when ringing to confirm order date
F	fantastic prices , quick delivery .
M	good comms on delivery
M	ordered on 00 may 0000 at 00 : 00 : 00
M	this is an excellent site which makes buying your tyres a trouble_free experience .
M	tap arrived but not the sink and it wasn_'_t till i chased that i found out a fault had been noted and they were getting a replacement .
F	the delivery was speedy and i also got updates to track my order , i will defininetly use glasses_direct again and have recommended it to friends .
F	good cut keys .
M	they are not a million_miles_away from getting it right but its either as good or its not and right now it '_s not i '_m afraid .
M	the business lounge was very bland .
M	lets_see what happens .
F	all thru february i kept asking when it would be ready kept getting emails saying how busy they were what a backlog they had .
F	amounts often track as less_than those advertised , which means contacting customer_services again .
M	basically all you want from the service !
M	at first , i found hostelworld very useful .
F	having purchased some frames online , rmg were so much_cheaper to glaze them than on the highstreet .
F	ordered sunday , arrived tuesday , wore wednesday !
M	phoned madfun and sent photos of damage .
M	do not deal with these shysters .
M	they provided direct telephone access to the driver , so i didn_'_t need to sit in all day waiting !
F	their delivery service had got it wrong and tried to deliver it somewhere_else .
F	package was destoryed during process . waiting for ur response
F	i love little_sunflowers for its hard to find on the high_street products .
F	you will see me again !
M	i would use the service again but next time , i hope they have fixed the problem with their software .
F	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
M	couldn_'_t ask for a better service .
F	and the intense musty factory smell they gave off !!
F	the final insult came on the last day when the owners came and tried to bully their way into the villa early to clean , well before 00 . 00am when we were required to leave .
F	for the first time , i decided to treat_myself to a corset ( which i have been dying to do for years ). well i should have restrain_myself .
M	my only_criticism is the hat .
F	price was good and i have no_hesitation_recommending this company .
M	i then questioned the return tracking_number , the shoes were suddenly found !
M	following the online direction , i also paid for insurance , meaning the return cost me over £_00 in postage .
F	came_across this pole company and ordered , they came stright_away , perfect size and the quality is 000_%, the same as la .
M	as escapade are in my favourites_list , having bought from them before , they ' re my first and only choice for these types of products .
M	looked at reviews . awful , wished we ' d never ordered !
F	anyway , the chap came to install our new door yesterday and when he got it out of the van it was red ,,, by this time it was too late as the old door was long gone and ' we ' had signed the wrong contract so didn_'_t have a foot to stand on .
M	after 0_weeks i thought i would call them , i was assured there was a little delay and my bag would arrive in stock on tuesday 00 - 00 - 0000 and would be with me on 00 - 00 - 0000 to which i heard_nothing .
M	it also states variable on the receipt so i know i have chose and paid for the right one but what i received was a two speed .
F	i found this really frustrating and not very convenient - not the best customer service !
F	their prices are great and with free_p_&_p delivered straight to your door within s couple of days what more could a girl ask for ?
M	if only all suppliers where like them
F	i placed the order and paid for it and received it within 0_days .
M	if you '_ve ordered and been given 00hr dispatch then make your own mind up , mine could be delivered tomorrow but i think that '_s pushing it a bit even for santa .
F	so i googled ' phone recycle ' and this was the first thing which came up and it had loads of good reviews .
M	placed order for 0 tyres on 00th_feb . payment taken straight_away .
M	so straight - forward .
M	ordered it over the phone and was promised a confirmation_email , which never arrived ( despite chasing twice and correcting the email address they had on file ).
M	i can not fault the process of ordering my two new tyres and getting them fitted .
M	allbeauty . com is a really great company to do_business with . never_let you down products are priced well . i would not buy any beauty products anywhere_else other than allbeauty . com
M	\ will still be a returning customer tho !!
M	these were well produced and arrived in my hands 00_hours or so later - in plenty of time for the party where they were a big hit !
F	i spoke to russell on the phone with a minor query and he couldn_'_t have been more helpful . great experience and curtains made !
F	i have finally cancelled the order 00 / 00 /_0000 and would rather pay more and get the goods immediately from a reputable_company .
M	the customer service team have however been very good and considerate answering any and all questions i have put to them .
F	found this supplier online as had trouble getting some supplies from our usual supllier .
M	you should be consigned to the history books forever .
F	shame as i love the products pro_cooks sell .
M	boots have to be broken in yet but i '_m very happy overall .
M	just what you want from mail order clothing company .
M	use amazon every time from now on .
F	been trying to find freshlook everywhere , finally i can buy now every_month .
M	my company creates websites so i know this to be a very simple job .
M	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
M	accordingly downrated from two stars to one star .
F	refund thay said the first day it will be in tommorow
M	i '_ve just bought a massage_chair for my wife as a birthday_present .
F	would deffinatly use it again !
M	. probably good if you '_ve got no time pressure
F	i was recommened cheapsmells . com from a friend whilst enjoying a glass of wine , couldnt wait to get on website and have a look , its brilliant and they send to the falkland islands , i placed an order of 0 items and recieved my parcel of goodies in 0_days , absouletly awesome , i have told all my friends about it and i will_continue to get all my perfumes etc from cheapsmells . com
F	when i received the invoice the value of the car was £ 0000 + £_00 rfl + £_00 petrol .
F	i contacted pharmacy0u one week_later , only to be informed that my order was not in stock , and further more , had never been in stock at the time of ordering .
M	groupon , of course , are not easily_contactable .
F	my complaint regarding vodafone ( may 00th 0000 )
M	he allowed_me to leave my car until i finished work and when i returned he remembered our earlier conversation and gave_me helpful advice .
M	texture of brush is a bit too soft , maybe i didn_'_t see any option for a harder texture .
M	paul from dawson '_s actually called last_week and was an excellent example of what great customer_care should be .
M	excellent service but map and instructions very poor .
M	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
F	i paid for a next_day am delivery , i didn_'_t get it the next_day ( thursday ) , i patiently_waited for friday , i didn_'_t get it on friday , saturday was the day of the event .
F	told she would try and get delivery for that day and would ring me back .
F	i immediately called the shop only to find they close at 0pm .
M	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
F	the company themselves must be very aware of the quality of the materials sent out .
M	my mother was most pleased with her surprise birthday gifts , as i couldnt make the travel_arrangements to see her .
M	we ' re also going to put the warranty shop premiums we ' re saving in a bank_account to cover any future repairs we need doing ( once in the last 0 years is not a bad strike rate !)
F	so much_easier than trailing_round local_chemists . none of which have the range or stock_levels !
F	i was clearing_out a room after a relative died , and boxed up his dvd '_s .
M	lousy service lousy food
M	another thing i '_ve noticed , and i hope this isn_'_t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
M	sender put wrong_address then he told them right address . p0g then didn_'_t in form city_link about changes of address their forth my son missed his main birthday_present . item sent out on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still not got it by today which is 00 / 000 crap service don_'_t use them .
F	just phoned and been told that on the 0th of august it should arrive .
M	i received confirmation of order then nothing for over a week when i was told that due to stock_levels there would be s delay .
F	on a positive_note .
F	i took my car in the next_day at 0am and was told to pick it up at 0pm .
F	quality always guaranteed with rab garments .
F	thank_you for the excellent service .
M	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .
M	in total i paid £_000 . 00 for tickets with a total face value of £_000
M	easy transaction
M	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
F	if you use uk saver shiping be prepared to wait at_least a week before your item arrives .
F	if you want a headache and the opportunity to speak to a number of people who will give you the run around all day and no resolution to a issue they should take owenership to resolve , then uk sports_imports are the company to part your money with .
M	still , you have to try don_'_t you ?
F	the first thing i would like to have been told was the face value of the tickets , i am bitterly_disappointed with getmein !!
M	the issue i have is with the actual tape ; it doesn_'_t stick well at all , which fairly defeats the purpose .
F	we do find that to order online is quite difficult to complete the order once you have put in all your payment details and then try to send order there is no box to click on to send order .
F	declined offer and asked for the flowers i had paid for .
M	apparently the euro instant trading solution they advertise with euro bank_account consists of a uk registered company and ' the european legislation has not been approved for this type of company yet and we warn everyone after ordering about this .
M	today i get an e_- mail saying sorry mate - here '_s some of your money back - we sold that camera on the shop floor .
F	the flowers would have been beautiful if they weren_'_t half_dead on arrival .
M	then they got my address details wrong !
M	they claim that they have not received any of the numerous email that i have sent to them .
F	i was receiving 0 - 0 times per week emails from scubastore asking me to pay for order , although when order was done , they have informed me that item is not available .
M	stress .
F	they then emailed a new delivery date of the 00th - guess_what - it didnt turn_up !
M	keith c
F	however , whilst the correct_address was written by hand on the inside envelope correctly , the actual address it was sent to i . e .
F	however on the otherhand once i had spoken to a person at animed the problem was quickly resolved , so all in all at the end i was quite happy with things .
M	i ordered a cable from lindy on friday_afternoon , and was totally amazed when it arrived monday_morning .
M	superb value for money and the service is second to none .

F	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i '_ve found slowly but surely that production selection has_gone down within my favourite section of craft .
F	having said all this the product was great and did make the party , so my advice would be never order anything the week you need it to allow for the company to cock it up and for it all to end up ok .
F	it should be said that before we even left the airport we sat on the bus for nearly an_hour with no air_conditioning in extremely high temperatures .

F	the process of running through that laborious list with a few local firms is something i could have chosen to do myself , i thought the point was i was given a ballpark figure by these companies for me to then choose from .
F	i obviously complained via_e_- mail to eflorist attaching a photo of the tiny bunch of mixed blooms and received a standard reply_stating that the customer_services team would get back to me after some 00_hours or up to 00_hours during busy_periods i . e mothers_day etc .
M	my wife had to renew her passport recently and it arrived ( eventually ) via this excuse for a company .
F	this metal tree looks_stunning all lit_up at night but i have been let_down by festive light '_s customer service .
F	not only where the flowers delivered a day late they where also eventually delivered to the wrong_address , very disappointing service all_round and would have to consider very carefully before placing another order .
M	apart_from a short wait the item was received prior to the date specified and a nice addition was the additional lens cloth incuded with the sunglasses which i feel is supirior to the one provided by rayban .
M	as usual , my latest purchase was delivered the next_day [ with free delivery ].
M	i ordered then returned a part that you sent me that was wrong , for a fridge_freezer .

M	it '_s a simple practical product that fits my bmw 0 series touring perfectly ensuring that the dog muddy boots etc don_'_t mess up and reduce the value of the car .

M	basically dont be conned like me .
M	very professional and i would highly_reccomend .
F	i will use printerland again and again !

F	andrew from cateredchalets is awesome - such a nice dude .
F	poor web_site , difficult to work around .
M	however , it '_s difficult to know exactly_what sort of car you '_ll get from the actual renter so hard to book with certainty .
M	the lesson is , as always , don_'_t promise a service you cannot
F	i think it was just a breakdown in systems .
M	apart_from that , the printed letterhead came out well .
F	they didn_'_t arrive that day .
M	not the fastest shipping time to sweden , especially with the high shipping prices .
M	having sent them photos and numerous_messages asking for an update on the situation we '_ve still received nothing from them .
F	my item was delivered quickly too .

F	absolutley disgraceful service .
M	took two lots of money from my bank_account , delivered one ok -

F	would have ha 0_stars if had fulfilled order correctly .
F	when we asked europcar if we could therefore extend by a day , they said it had to be done through rentalcars , or else pay a large_amount to them to do a separate contract .
M	if ekomi are filtering out low ratings they are deliberately distorting the true picture of the feedback process , this may well put companies in a good light but i believe it '_s actions not only undermine the entire customer reviews process it distorts the truth and deliberately misleads the customer .
M	no effort to resolve the situation .
M	the second customer service rep said the same , the third said the purchasing department was closed .
F	you used ups , they do not tell you by text etc . when they are gonig to delvier and attempted 0 times , i eventually went and picked it up .

F	!
M	my car failed its mot and the bill to get it to standard was over £_000 - something they didn_'_t mention on the phone , they just said it needed a few bulbs and a few minor bits ( to be fair they did explain what those bits were - but they gave the impression it was very minor ).
F	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
M	what i received was a blind 000 . 0cm ( w ) and a controls – right .
M	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
F	many_thanks
M	this is what i did on the 0th_march_0000 .
M	this will probably be the last_year i use them .
F	oh no !
M	if your trying to save_money go to your local_store
M	the chair only cost £_00 in the first place !
M	so telephoned and then told to ring the local depo and given another number .
M	however moments_later i then received a very rude email refusing to refund the shoes .
M	!
F	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
M	i have been a customer of strings_direct for many_years .
M	absolute_rubbish .
M	not acceptable .
M	the day before the delivery , i received a call to say that the delivery was on and to ask if if was all ok .
M	it was extremely easy dealing_with key_retirement solutions .
F	felt this was a case of misadvertising .
F	really happy to have it .
F	i am managing my monthly_payments which are great .
F	?
F	more care on packing the goods would be appreciated as i was not happy about this !
F	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
F	this means that despite it being the festive_season and thus public holidays , i cannot return what i ordered
F	excellent service , said 0 - 0_days delivery and it was delivered in 0_days :-)
F	i also asked if physique was easy to find and was told , " not really .
M	got a quote from britelite windows , gave them our details .
M	we have given up on the courier company .
F	0 ) no one to answer the phone
M	order was completed but packet had been opened that some point .
M	they were fine for a couple of years but then they started sending zopiclone out of the secure blister packs and into the same chromium picolinate bottles other_reviewers have mentioned !
M	i don_’_t believe delivery should have to paid for on items ordered online , so i was really please when i find that preciouslittleones provide free delivery on order over £_00 .
F	what i do not appreciate , however , is the fact that price differs depending_on which country you are buying from even if you choose to buy in gbp .
F	what a joke !
F	several days_later we were told that the bed will be with us on 00th_august .
F	viagogo confirms the ticket is covered by its insurance but refuses to send a replacement or even check if tickets are still available until it has_gone_through a 00 hr investigation with ups ( which it has not even initiated ).
M	after looking through various mobile selling sites mazuma seemed to be the best .
F	i got an outfit that is nice with some amazing new 00st_century textiles and with a colour coordination that is stunning to wear on my wedding_anniversary .
M	think this company needs a visit from watchdog !
M	0 .
F	they turned_out really well and i can see perfectly .
F	looks good .
F	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
F	it is a terrible thing to have to go through this at the start of your holiday and we had not budgeted for this extra , so it had to come out of our spending money .
M	i emailed back and they said as they couldn_'_t prove that it wasn_'_t there before they weren_'_t held liable .
M	have told my friends and would recommend your company to anyone looking for value , quality and service . roy
M	great product , fast service !
M	highly_recommended
F	very friendly staff , very efficient .
F	the next week , she '_d obviously let herself in , but no housework had been done ( at first i thought we '_d had a break - in because it looked like someone other than our cleaner had been in the house ).
M	i called the customer_support line and after explaining the issue was told it was a firmware problem and to update the firmware .
F	the choice was quite good and i found just what i wanted .
F	the liner , headrest cover are a great idea , they fit_perfectly into my 0000 honda_crv and very easily .
M	the problem with amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful .
F	normally a size 0 and a 0 fits_perfectly .
F	!
F	p . s .
F	the customer service team have been fantastic , and its a shame this experience with the drivers is no replicated .
M	i '_ve_used them on numerous_occassions and they have come_back to me very quickly when i '_ve had a query .
M	i used tshirt_studio because it '_s the top_rated service of its kind on trustpilot .
M	when i ordered my jumper the advert stated it would come in a presentation_box however when it arrived it was just packaged loose in a bag !
F	customer service are very unhelpful , you cant speak to a human and have to email them .
M	charging shipping on a £_000 order is a bit_cheeky .
M	*** recommended ***
F	i would not recommend eflorist .
F	i was , however , very happy with the items , which came promptly and were of good quality but am unlikely to purchase again from this website as i can '_t trust the published prices .
M	placed an order on 0 / 00 / 00 and paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for 00hr delivery as i needed the item before going travelling at the end of the week .
F	i can '_t comment on how good this insurer is if in need of a claim but it was straight_forward to get cover for my mobile phone .
M	just need improved instructions please !
F	he refused to take my booking_reference and kept_repeating the same phrases as though he were an automaton reading from a script without the intelligence or authority to deviate from it .
M	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
M	week after had to do it again because was no answer and story was exactly the same .
M	delivery quick , packaging fine - descriptions , however , leave a lot to be desired !
F	i nearly gave up .
M	the only reason i could moan ( but not really ) was the fact that they seem to dispatch 00 - 00_hours after order .
M	i '_ve been visiting gv for years_now and it '_s always something of an event for me .
M	now i am not much of an expert here , but a nail in the tire can be fixed quite easy right ?!
M	i was due to fly out from london_heathrow at the time they were affected by the snow .
M	personally , along with a good diet consisting of all the right foods to maintain and promote muscle_growth ( along with an exercise routine ), the above protein snacks offer a great way of adding extra protein to my diet .
F	we have so far only ordered samples but they arrived in a reasonable time and look good quality .
F	they have had my product for over a week i had to call them to arrange for my product to be delivered as i had not been contacted after an_hour and half was agreed it will be delivered in the afternoon 0_days_later .
M	when i phone to ask a question i get fobbed_off , given some rubbish fake technical answer or told that the expert will call me .
M	try smiley hippo - their software works !
M	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
F	i received the free trial_pack of each of the new capsules , i loved the ideas , i really liked the new range of strengths and types , along with the sheet with the descriptions of each coffee .
M	apart_from these issues the bed is very good however in hindsight i would have paid slightly more money from another company as i would have probably received better service .
M	good service .
F	i cannot understand as to why we are being asked to write a review when all we have done is booked a holiday on - line for later this year - what is the point ?
M	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0_weeks and am requesting compensation .
M	would order again from them .
M	many_thanks
F	chrissy was so helpful and obliging when making our booking .
F	the delivery service was unfortunately poor and would discourage me from shopping again .
F	their lack of flexibility to deliveries made me seriously_consider purchasing from them and forced me to look else where and had it not been for the friend being_able to help me out i would have most certainly gone else where .
M	i went to buy a phone for my gf from here and they tried to get me to get every insurance under the sun .
F	eye_drops have become part of my everyday_life .
M	out of pocket by £_000 . 00 with nothing to show - a complete_rip_off !
M	great shape and everthing else .
M	so_far no_complaints .
M	i will always use work_tops express and recommend them to all the other local trades men
M	chose to email to get photographic_evidence showing imei_number on screen
F	unacceptable .
F	the flowers didn_'_t have water so started to sag a bit .
M	just ordered a controller for bosch_dishwasher .
M	however , i was immediately contacted by the company , they re - processed the canvas and it arrived the following_day from europe ( i live in the uk ).
F	i would highly_recommend fonebank .
F	i live_overseas and this website is my go - to when i need flowers that i want to order in_advance or that i '_ve forgotten to order and need there the same day !
F	about a year_ago , i tried to open a paypal_account using a new e_- mail address and was unable to do so because years_ago i had opened an account with a now obsolete e_- mail address .
F	they were unable to ship one to thier show_room so i could collect it
F	i cannot_believe this company is still running !
M	!
F	i have used tola a number of times and would not_hesitate to use them again or to recommend them to someone_else .
F	after writing them a letter of complaint they offered me a settlement of and extra £_00 to be credited to my account .
F	i can '_t fault this company at all and would recommend to anyone .
F	ahhhhhh .
M	their follow - up systems are also excellent .
M	still fighting for a refund !
M	i would not recommend this company and will have to take them to court to get my money back .
M	first purchase price excellent so i ordered - not in stock , don t know when came the reply , but website said otherwise and item subsequently became_available and was dispatched so maybe a 0 / 00 .
M	would recommend them to any_prospective buyer .
M	i tried_phoning their customer_services but couldn_'_t get through to a human_being ( their automaton hung_up on me twice ).
F	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn_'_t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for £ 0 . 00 . gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
F	i will never , ever use them again and neither should you good reader .
F	poor quality trousers laddered as soon as put on can '_t wear again wouldn_'_t buy again !!
F	i requested a refund but never received one
F	just want a better
F	all_round fantastic service , would definitely recommend .
F	i gave them 0_stars because the place was great but the service was one star .
M	incorrect splling on my flexible trust form , told this would not make any difference .
F	stuff you don_'_t find in the usual shops .
M	i ordered two bottles of gin from the site , the worry is when ordering glass bottled items ( even_though i assumed the box would say ' fragile ' etc ) would the packaging , and courier be ok .
M	no issues , polite etc .
M	needed a non standard size box which my usual_supplier did not stock so turned to rajapack .
F	i haven_'_t seem them myself but my mum seems to think now she has them in water they should perk up .
M	recently travelled economy to dubrovnik in croatia and whilst the flights were bang on time both_ways , the stewards and the food were not .
M	excellent service , giving you the option to track the progress of the unlock .
F	if you can or are available to contact them by phone , problems can be solved quickly .
M	amazon is top_notch for customer service - speedy delivery - good product - right price - when i had a defective game the returns system is quickest , easiest and the best i '_ve ever had to deal with :)
F	kids thought it was really funny .
F	really pleased to get my order so quickly , though it was just left on the doorstep and not around the back as requested when i completed the delivery instructions .
M	the guys at the garage were really good and i would use this service again .
F	i was kept_informed of order status .
F	delievery was fast and i got a pleasant thank_you call from my friend .
F	i informed them that the carer `_s notes are rubbish , not informative and certainly not enough information on them to enable carer `_s delivering the sparkle , to expand on the information to make the session last longer .
M	faultless and efficient service .
M	as advertised we were notified by companies for our impending move .
F	!
F	the knobs on the side of the chairs don_'_t seem to do anything .
F	since then we '_ve had numerous charges that shouldn_'_t have been on there .
F	unfortunately as soon as i had ordered them , i found the same pair of sunglasses for £_00 cheaper on another site - they were in stock and would have been delivered in time for my partner '_s birthday .
F	he made sure they had his work number this time but they still managed to phone my mobile , only this time i had magically been authorised to do anything i wanted with the contract .
M	bought 0 wardrobes and 0 sets of drawers from different ranges .
M	on hold for 0 hour + and still never spoke to anyone
M	had to close my business account because they don_'_t employ bankers - just so - called " customer service " staff to whom they pay minimum wages .
M	i put a very specific request in for mechanical parts .
M	overall excellent !
M	thanks
F	furniture nice but quite saggy considering it '_s less_than a year_old
M	we subsequently used the bus a number of times to get to various_locations in the city .
F	the pressure got to the staff and they were rude .
F	i was really pleased to find a craft shop with a wide_range of products as i was looking for an interesting christmas_present .
F	unfortunately i could not make out the code required on my email so they would not honour the offer .
F	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over_£_000 .
M	0 times i have tried to use and 0 times it has failed and the worst thing was that i was in a position where it wasn_'_t even clear if my trade had executed so i had to do the trade again .
M	" it could be you ".
M	order no 0000000000 for miss .
M	people seem to be amazed and full of praise when they get what they paid for but i think that '_s a 0_star service .
F	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
M	the vase you delivered was not the vase i ordered the vase i ordered was black the vase you sent was clear why
M	i have tried to get a phone contact number that works , so_far without_success .
M	in conclusion ,(& kudos to you for reading this far ) it bothers me to see people giving yodel 0_stars on here .
M	for new and sealed products , chaos_cards is great .
M	an appliances direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
M	overall i now know not to order flowers online .
F	if you need a good quality pen in a hurry .
F	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
F	i had to wait_until new stock was received and then it was send to the uk via_dhl who had the wrong_postcode entered on their tracking site .
M	saw a waterproof rucksack on the internet , bannafingers was thew lowest_price .
M	if only all companies_operated this way !
M	i was very pleased on how i could book for next_day pick_up and was then delivered the following_day and at a very reasonable price .
M	i stated their website advised that they would reprint this after 0_weeks , she stated they would do this ' reluctantly ' - ( reluctantly , really !)
F	i ordered a go_kart from join0buy on 0th_september for £_000 . 00 with a delivery date of 00 to 00 days .
M	well_packaged for protection .
F	sad that a company that impressed initially let_me down on the shower_screen - it would have been a ) fair , and b ) a gesture of good will , to replace it .
F	phone is insured straight_away .
F	i brought a dualit food_processor several months_ago .
M	i understand this and believe this to fall_foul of goods of sale act .
M	the watch looked good on the website but even better in the flesh .
M	what sort of a company takes your money and doesn_'_t have the courtesy to tell you that the tyres are not in stock .
F	their bills are indecipherable .
F	i was really impressed with the service from wins .
F	by this time my birthday had passed and i was really tired of trying to get them to fix their mistake .
M	the directions to the site were very easy to find and only about a 00 minute_drive from the airport .
F	i give them meter_readings but still no money .
F	:)
F	i was given an upgrade code for delivery to arrive valentines_day , i used the code as per the advert but after chasing my delivery on valentines afternoon i was informed i was supposed to have ' checked ' a box that wasn_'_t there !
F	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
M	sent it off to them about a week_later , as it travels on land only , it took about one and half to two_weeks to get there , ( mazuma gave_me an extension on the order ).
M	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
M	it still is a useful site but now there is a lot of competition .
M	there are a few things i can '_t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
M	now got a more stable connection now instead on wireless .
F	oh and they won_'_t give you the tracking_number of your parcel , again for security_reasons ?!
M	the service was excellent .
M	quick , efficient delivery service without_question
F	i have emailed the company several_times and have received no reply .
F	i have used photoworld before and been happy , but this latest book is disappointing .
M	absolutely fantastic service , changed date to suit , arrived on date and time specified , will_defiantly use again .
M	good prices on tiles compared to other_retailers , but shipping_costs don_'_t make it viable to order .
M	after spending many_years of placing small ads in local papers i started usung upad , and have been very impressed
F	the delivery was also very quick .
F	never bought anything from cheap_smells before and i can_honestly_say i will defiantly come_back every time for my fragrances !
F	after along awaited delivery ( which didn_'_t turn_up 00st_october waited in all day ) finally 00 . 00 sat 0 november bed_base is delivered only to be dragged across the back of the lorry by the driver who damaged all 0 corners of the bed breaking the packaging and scuffing up the faux edging and wasn_'_t bothered at all infact quite rude !
M	easy visibility of delivery , and the delivery driver was very polite and friendly .
F	a new_cooker was eventually delivered .
F	manchester_airport is easy to use & handy , parking is expensive , but parking away from the airport is unreliable
F	after many_years posting thousands of parcels via_royal_mail i decided to give interparcel a try due to recent price increases at the post_office .
F	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
F	my son and i looked ace in our costumes and got loads of compliments , not overpriced either and great service !
F	the communication was fantastic and i was notified of my hour delivery slot in good time ( i paid for delivery before 00am ) but i was disappointed that a number of the flowers were already dead or dying on delivery .
M	i sent them an email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
F	i love the fact its my choice if i buy non branded . i usually buy value packs , and economical priced products anyway . i used to use tesco .
M	you soon realize what a pointless exercise that is .
M	terrible customer service , and just look at all of these negative_reviews ; we can '_t all be wrong , surely ?
M	noticed that my mobile data wasn_'_t working , so tried registering on the t - mobile website ( that '_s nicely broken at the moment ) so gave up and called t - mobile .
F	cancelled the order and was promised a full_refund within 0_days , 0_days and numerous_emails later i am still_waiting !!!
F	good communication , swift delivery happy with purchase .
F	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it '_s really not worth the risk !
F	they sent out a welcome_pack that had the wrong price breakdown so guess_what ?
F	delivery very prompt and instructions adhered to .
F	i called their telephone customer service today to help find an item but received horrible customer service !!
F	super_fast service , will use this site again !
F	will deffo order from lords again .
F	however , the service provided at the centre left a lot to be desired .
M	clearly i only wanted the rear drive spoke ( 00000000 ) to complete my set and would have paid a little more to cover the postage .
F	i am still delighted with my new front_door !
F	when i finally got through customer_care for assistance i got an_email with a temporary password , but the font was too small for mature customers .
F	reture them as there wasn_'_t a plug waiting for refund
M	asked to immediately despatch in stock items .
F	i am very pleased with my item of furniture - excellent quality .
F	therefore i think that next year i will go to the garden_centre for plants rather_than buy by mail order .
F	i will not_hesitate to use again , just grate service , thanks
F	i then received a copy email wowcher sent to the beautychallenge a day or so later - which asked the beauty challenge to contact me .
M	i thought it was a chip that could have been repaired drive to autoglass to be told that this was not possible and needed new screen .
M	generally the flowers themselves looked nice , but the single_rose did not look fresh .
F	i have already_recommended this product to various people
F	communication with the company was great and i recieved the cheque quickly .
M	oh_dear !!
F	i do most of my non - grocery_shopping online , and have earned_hundreds of £££ by clicking_through_topcashback .
F	to summarise i wouldn_'_t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
M	sent in my working iphone 0 in good condition .
M	received flowers 00th_july_0000 for my anniversary .
F	review : slow shipping by dhl and took almost 0_weeks plus to ship to singapore , but overall item is accurate no need for any returns
F	i was informed on ordering that two items were out of stock and expected within 0_weeks .
F	when i inserted the new batteries into the case , switch the lights on , i had an electric shock and they started to smoke .
M	so it '_s a maybe from me .
F	i called the driver on saturday 0th_dec and he said he would be with me between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 , we changed our plans and waited and waited . no driver turned_up !!
F	was then told that alpha_rooms keep the difference .
F	the website is very easy to navigate_around and purchasing and paying through the site is always hassle_free .
M	they seem to treat their trolleys as disposable rubbish in the same way they leave the hedges around the store festooned with their plastic_bags .
M	and by the way if i do not get the situation resolved they are going to to take me to court for lack of payment !
M	parcel posted on 00 september still not arrived evening 00 september and the tracking service provided by the delivery company states it has never left their sending depot let_alone arrived at my house
F	delivery driver got grumpy when he called me 0_days after it was due to be delivered to find no one at home to take delivery .
F	the worktops look great and the staff were all very helpful in helping_us get the cuts and everything right .
F	she was very happy to receive the flowers and cheered_her up thank_you
F	.
M	canvas we ordered , arrived after a lot of trouble , it was very dark , we contacted ellen dobson of you frame it , who advised she would look into it and get it lighter and send a new one out , the canvas arrived but it was the same still dark not the same as original file we sent , as we were so disappointed as the picture was of our_wedding_rings we wanted it right , we emailed ellen dobson and asked for our money back , surprise_surprise no answer or reply , so they are very good and prompt at sending canvas_prints out , but if you want a refund not so quick
F	!
F	modtog ingen belræftelse , men i stedet en " anmodning om tilbagebetaling ".
F	me réclamant 00 , 00_euros
M	i would recommend serenataflowers to anyone .
F	anyone considering this procedure should really do their research as the side_effects really can ruin your life .
F	we sorted_out surfing as an extra activity external to hen_heaven and glad i did , as it was only the activity organisers that seemed to do anything right !
F	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
M	if the company would have delivered what is described on it '_s website then i would been happy .
F	excellent quick service at a very good price .
M	do not buy from pixmania .
M	got an order acknowledgement saying " due to sale launch your order may take 0 - 0 days to be delivered " i also got several emails chasing me to provide account details .
M	thankyou .
M	no_complaints whatsoever .
F	can '_t remember if site said that all was in stock or not , but crucial item turned_up too late and all had to be returned .
M	received as ordered .
M	the nose_pads left my nose so sore it was ridiculous .
F	this is the second time i have used e_- florist and the second time i have been disappointed .
F	i popped_into the store and got it .
F	the flowers that were delivered were perfect i have no_issues with them . my issue is the card , now to everyone it may not mean the same but to me the card is just as important as the actual flowers .
M	i never asked for this and had to spend 00_minutes of my time trying to figure_out how to contact them .
F	sure enough there was our car .
F	don_'_t expect quidco to be an easy route to making extra_cash - it requires a lot of time being spent on chasing up missing / incorrect amounts .
M	service was excellent - i even got an e_- mail back from the md explaining how i could return them ( postage refunded ) if they turned_out to be the wrong type .
M	apparently the verbal report that the technician had given me did not match the official report provided to the company .
F	cannot keep being at home so extremely fed_up with poor customer service
M	which isn_'_t very cheap to do .
M	cheeky !
F	so they fail on three levels :
M	their response : " i do apologise for the inconveniences caused to you by this order , however blackmail will not be tolerated .
F	i need not have worried it is fantastic quality looks_fab and arrived in super_fast time .
M	it took 0 days to get paid for my phones , when the web_site clearly_states fast payment , it took me 0 phones calls , with 0 of them lasting over 00_mins , and even had one mazuma member of staff hung_up on me , i also had someone from accounts saying they would ring back but never did , i had mazuma passing the blame for non payment over to barclays bank , who inturn said it was mazuma fault , who then said it was barclays fault , now this drove me up the wall . i then had to go to the bank in person , were the bank manager said i '_m not the first person this has happen to .
F	however they did not have a wide field of variofocal vision as their website claims .
F	already_recommended julesb to two friends .
M	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
M	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
F	we were told that two blocks per_person on average use should last four_weeks .
F	thank_you !
F	the skeleton jumper fits the purpose and the skeleton gloves really do glow in the dark .
F	the service is shockingly disgusting .
M	it is wildly frustrating and time_consuming .
M	all the best people - cheers !
M	and even then , it wasn_'_t even hot , just luke_warm .
M	urban_industry are one of the companies i order from
F	i would & have bought from procook again , i do like some of their products
M	i had stupidly ordered a couple of hours too early .
F	i would recommend it .
M	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
M	another very annoying issue is they take around 0 - 0 months to process a refund if you have to cancel a ticket - this is very naughty and they tend to hold on to your money until you chase it - my impression is if you don_'_t keep asking them for the refund , you will never get it .
F	delivery paid for next_day - friday ( order went in on time ) royal_mail delivered monday instead
M	there was £_000 credit in my paypal_account — more than enough to cover the £_00 cost of the flight .
F	i would recommend the company to others
M	very , very impressed !
M	after entering my card_details and pressing submit , it defaults by saying that i am timed out .
M	no_problems , sorted the part i required - sorted the cost .
F	i will not purchase anything from your store again .
M	i very rarely hope that a company goes_bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
F	i forgot , the strawberry plants are going great guns .
F	i dont like the new timeline as i can not follow the flow of things well but in general i love it
M	when my son army spec .
F	normally i find them quick and efficient .
F	it is now january 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	the smell when cooking meatballs with pasta was reminiscent of rotten cat_food .
M	thank_goodness i used them and could get my money back .
F	it now works , but one of the reasons i bought it was for the ability of continuous use but we did not get the hose connection , was this included in the price or do we need to buy separately ?
F	the money was in my account on monday .
F	not really sure where to go for that .
M	stay well clear !
M	however when i called to see if my order had been dispatched as i was hoping to correct an error i had made , i spoke to someone_who seemed very irritated that i had called and started quoting lead times from the confirmation_email before i could even explain_why i was asking .
F	my package is £ 0 . 0 / month , was also been charged_£ 0 . 0 account charges every_month for not using direct_debit , there is nowhere see i have to pay by direct_debit or have to pay this charges , this a cheating , also the speedy payment is a scam , received email bill at 0 :_00pm today , tried to pay 00 : 00 , it was to late for this speedy payment , what a wonderful service !!
F	couldnt find butterscotch schnapps anywhere on the high_street .
M	read constant notes that people supposedly write and send to various_departments ?
F	won_'_t use them again .
M	i have probably paid them a couple of grand but would only use them now if i was stuck .
F	i tried to reset password ( i did not recall having a password ) and get stuck in a loop because the captcha verification does not accept anything i enter .
F	he did seem to race through the job , and as a result one of my hubcaps didn_'_t last the 0 minute journey home ( although it had managed to stay on my car for the 0 years before that quite nicely )
F	excellent service will definitely use again and recommend them
M	staff all very polite and friendly too which is always a bonus .
M	with the royal_mail it '_s always a gamble if they will arrive at all .
M	i was refused an upgraded delivery and offered no compensation for dpd '_s failure to manage their delivery reasonably .
M	very good .
F	i rented a sledge hammer to do the work and i am going to have to return it without using it because i don_'_t have what i ordered and paid for – i lost my time and money for nothing .
M	the guys can tell you how this is done .
M	considering ftp is a corner stone of web_hosting , you would think this would be a priority issue that they would address quickly , but apparently not .
M	good quality at a fair price and prompt delivery
F	absolutely ridiculous way to carry on and although have used in past would not use again knowing now the way they operate .
F	needless to say i won_'_t be booking again .
M	the best invention since the invention of referral programs .
F	cards should not be charged until despatch
F	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
F	the site recommends posting the phone by special delivery , which in itself costs over_£ 0 .
F	was given a 0 hour_window in which the delivery would take place which was stuck to .
M	i ordered a couple of items a week_ago , 0 item being a vision battery 0000mah in silver .
M	to prospective_customers - do yourself a favour go and soil your underwear , you '_ll have much more fun !!
M	for me though , the most_important_thing is the hostel reviews section .
M	on the negative side , auctions can spend quite a bit of time in a state of ended but not yet paying interest and there are fewer auctions than on other p0p sites .
M	top laptops at great prices .
F	luckily , my daughter came home early on the wednesday and brought the package in .
M	i purchased a car harness for my 0 month old labrador puppy , but i ordered the wrong_size .
F	so i guess it was the last pair .
M	it wasnt until immediately after that id forgot to order scoops .
F	i wont lie , i was a bit_skeptical beings as this was my first time using fragrance_expert and am a great believer in that if something sounds too good to be true then in probably is !
M	i was given 0 options , pay a £_000 early disconnection charge or pay £_00 a month for a poor service .
M	it is being sent in response to a query made by a steam user to discover all account names associated with this cd - key
M	i have now used this company twice and the service is 0st_class .
M	it '_s quite wrong for people to assume things , causes all_sorts of problems .
M	helpful staff .
M	also , my wife put herself down as second driver on our friends car , the family who did not book through holiday autoes and they were charged 00_euros , so explain_why the same person is charged_twice as much through holiday autoes
F	competitively_priced and delivered quickly
F	the experience of dealing_with them was so unpleasant that i don_'_t want to even talk to them again , but i just want my consumer right !
F	hardly grew at all and the rest just produced very straggly plants with tiny inferior flowers .
M	the finance arrangements were conducted in a particularly friendly and open way .
M	very quick delivery .
F	however the arms of the glasses were loose and fingerprints on lenses .
F	brilliant service , i recommend to all my friends !
F	we use your service every year and never had problems .
M	do not use this company .
F	good product , quick delivery , poor customer service .
F	we were flying upper class as i am very disabled and unable to sit in an ordinary aircraft seat for longer_than 00_mins .
M	-
M	would definitely recommend them and order from them again .
F	so i had to then order - we did look else where but cudnt find the same ones or we wud have went else where
M	last one gave delivery window of 0hour .
F	facebook was all craze .
F	excellent service and i am extremely happy with the product , they are lovely quality and the colour is a perfect match to the rest of my colour theme .
M	unfortunately i don_'_t think i will be using you again
M	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
F	the furniture arrived an_hour later than the time_slot given and the cleaning packs that i had paid for were missing and a week_later still have not arrived , even_though the delivery people phoned it in right away .
M	john gildert
M	also i asked for windows 0 to be installed instead of windows 0 , which they did for me .
M	one guitar cable ordered on 00 / 00 , one guitar lead delivered on 0 / 00 - and it was sent recorded delivery , first_class .
F	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over_£_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection . we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent . its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current_supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them .
M	the tens machine is good , although it takes a while to get used to the feelings it generates .
F	they promised to let_me know when the item is in stock but informed me my glasses are on their way only after i sent them another message enquiring_about my order .
M	achica '_s website seems to have been designed to make shopping as difficult as possible especially using an ipad .
F	hey ' try animed_direct their the muts nuts .
F	en - suite
M	simple , reliable and recommended .
F	nescafe coffee 000g x 0
M	i was also continuous informed via_email of the state of manufacture and the shipping tracking_details .
M	price had gone up 00_euros !
F	!
M	first_class service - exact product required and dispatched immediately - highly_recommended and will use again .
M	without_hesitation an ace company . very quickly dispatched goods as per description .
M	would recommend alparooms to my freinds
M	all good !!.
M	ruislip_appliances went the extra_mile to ensure my purchase was available for collection at short_notice , highlighting that good customer service is still available from the right retailers !
M	!
M	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
F	have used stressfreeparking several_times in the past and have always been very pleased with the service i received .
F	i '_m willing to eat stuff that tastes and feels really nasty if the nutritional benefits are there , but this thing not only weighs half a tonne , it has more than 000_calories in it !
M	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
M	all in all a great service and a pleased customer .
M	great service vert personal for a good price .
M	why ?
F	sad that seller did try and put a note requesting safe_place to leave , but seller definately needs to change its courier service , if this is what they do as the norm .
M	i then explained this was not the case and their operative immediately offered me £_00 as there was excessive_wear and tear .
M	i phoned the specialist advisor , not at desk but did phone back .
M	shop needs to watch its procedures process as they get bigger .
F	it was delivered on time but the recipient was charged $_00 on taxes almost the same amount as the delivery cost even_though i had clearly_written personal used belongings .
M	it '_s not right - they should be delivered by a florist ( not a courier ) and should be open to the light and the air .
F	i thoroughly_enjoyed using music_magpie , it was quite simple and easy to use .
F	ordered , expected , here in 0 - 0_days !
M	sort something with delivery & returns and then you have a good and recommended service .
F	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
M	didn_'_t receive product , so emailed customer service .
F	just useless !
F	dealing_with viovet is a pleasure always , i get the best service , best products and feel that i am a special customer which makes all the difference to me .
F	fantastic considering how much less i paid for them than on the high_street !
F	' hit ' with other customers .
M	it '_s 0000 yodel , invest and make use of the tech that '_s about !!
F	after two_days 0 out of 0 roses were dead .
M	?
M	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
M	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
M	quick delivery with 0_hr window .
F	it was well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
F	products arrived within 00_hours without excessive_packaging which i thought was great .
M	i suppose i would prob order tools again but they need to scrap the unfair postage charge and give the courier a kick in the balls .
F	needless to say my son is very happy with the purchase , and i am very happy with the service - and the price .
F	i would definately use this company again !
F	i should have thought more about my actual food intake ( lots of fish = vit_d ).
M	i ordered an ipod fm_transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
M	our flight was delayed on the return by 00hrs and it was not a problem for them either .
M	that '_s dispatch confirmed after 0 working_days , another 0 days for the items to reach your doorstep .
F	really excellent service and i would not_hesitate to do this again
M	i paid up .
F	i will never be buying anything_else from this company again .
M	thanks !
F	i ordered on line on the sunglasses page .
F	.
F	i have already_recommended your company to several people .
M	so to find a site that promised to undercut amazon is a godsend !
F	did not like meet and greet takes up start of holiday . villa had not been cleaned very well , cobwebs in bathrooms and down the side of drawers .
F	one of the cheapest for my product .
F	excellent service at a really good price
F	0000 .
M	in and out in about 00 min .
F	excellent service and a smashing item .
M	i was kept_fully_informed about the shipping arrangements and expected delivery times .
F	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
F	they were too_big so i used the " swap " service for a smaller_size which was really easy and quick !
M	they describe this on their website as award_winning customer service - i beg to differ .
M	0 . delivery date
M	their customer service is good .
M	i purchased a 0000 '_s elvis_costume and wig .
M	i bought some rockport shoes from this retailer .
F	but i '_m worried_about what '_s happening to my expensive nespresso_machine .
F	need my money back .
F	outrageous .
M	each time i '_ve posted my phone off , i '_ve had the money in my account the day they received it .
F	- the price on the website changed whilst we were ordering causing consternation . then we realised that the vat had been added in !!
F	bank confirms the money has_been claimed , delivery address is the same as billing_address .
M	the week before the new delivery date i received a dispatch email ( my first email from better_bathrooms and any proof of order except for my credit_card statement the previous month ) saying the goods had been sent to the delivery company .
F	can go higher for taller people .
F	i was genuinely_concerned for the large number of elderly people on the coach , who were clearly struggling .
F	this is the second delivery from swift and i must_say i am very happy with the reliable service .
F	we live in spain , so we were a little_concerned_about delivery .
M	informative and helpful staff and exactly the rings that we were looking for .
F	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer service line .
M	0 .
F	would definetly deal with this company again .
M	this is a second time that i ordered .
F	both_occasions good advice and customer service .
F	the response was to log_onto the system .
F	will order more in the future !
F	i would never shop_here again .
F	asos are equally as crap with their terrible customer service and hermes doesn_'_t seem to have a customer service platform at all , and there is no way for me to contact the local courier .
M	ordered an item and never came told to wait 00 days before anything could happen .
F	needless to say i am unhappy which upsets me as i do not like to leave bad_reviews .
F	i never thought i '_d find a company who could surpass the abysmal service offered by yodel but , amazingly , myhermes have managed this !
F	i ordered both a complete black_tie and a white dinner jacket to match the black_tie ( for my honeymoon on board of a cruise liner ).
F	!
F	not impressed at all and certainly won_'_t use again .
F	and as soon as possible please .
M	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
M	well_packed , arrived quickly , worked_perfectly
F	there is a sign in the shop window saying no returns !
M	however , the pole for the parasol was not the size as stated .
M	guy in the shop was not - we felt that we were privileged to be served by him .
M	would be nice to see full reviews even if there are less_than 0 reviews , as this would be helpful when ordering .
F	thank_you .
M	there are many companies springing up like this , but lf have been around the longest and provide great quality in a ' chinese ' dominated marketplace .
M	0st agent told me i never cancelled it ( despite me having received a confirmation letter confirming my cancellation )
F	we have not received our order !!!
M	full manual on cd , spare face cover and instruction_manual plus two free tank refills courtesy of aquanauts and some interesting info about their dive centre which i will_certainly look into joining .
F	it is perfect .
M	hmmm , i wonder , could it possibly be a yodel employee ?.
F	and you will note that 0_weeks on , they haven_'_t responded to explain themselves !
F	i ordered 0 items , one of which turned_out to be not available due to stock discrepancies , the other was delivered ( with difficulty ) but was the wrong_size .
F	soak and sleep does it again .
M	rather_than order blindly on the internet , i decided to seek a little advice and gave dolphin a call .
M	i '_m pretty pissed_off .
F	several weeks from first order !
F	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
M	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
M	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
M	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
F	you '_ll get a swift confirmation_email , and whatever you order will be with you within 0_days .
M	the first i purchased stopped_working within 0_weeks which disappointed me and having contacted liberty_flights through their facebook_page was simply told that its not guaranteed to work beyond two_weeks so there was nothing that could be done .
F	then there was much confusion between the two companies .
F	if it had been raining , i would have arrived inside the airport
M	my order was delivered quickly and in perfect_condition .
F	i have spent a lot of my quality time chasing up orders that have not arrived .
F	it is so awkward having to go to collect it from the po .
M	so for fear of any mistruths i '_ll simply state my reply here
M	while the product itself was fine , the custom software is a little cumbersome but usable , i was let_down by how poor your b0b service is .
M	they also send out way too many mails before & after your purchase .
M	i am very pleased with it .
F	i bought my friend some flowers ,
F	i am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the product is perfect , i took my scooter out in very heavy_rain with a strong wind and i stayed dry .
F	every time they refused a submitted photo , it wasn_'_t made clear exactly_what they needed from me , nor did they seem to take into account previous photos submitted to tie all of the evidence together despite my asking them to in the comments field .
F	as i do not live_locally was unable to see the flowers , however i emailed one of the neighbours and this is their comment :
F	after thought at home , measuring and discussing we returned to the shop where we were again looked after by staff as we finalised our purchase and i paid a deposit .
F	i will shop again with you !
F	thank_you !
M	one of the key reasons that i will no_longer use other_suppliers is the p_&_p_charges they usually load onto orders placed with them .
F	also twice_now i have had a problem my end and the team at parcel0go have sorted it out within minutes for me .
F	i don_`_t know which card i used to pay for it .
M	they have friendly , helpful , knowledgeable_staff , who are able to deal with any ram requirements .
M	i am yet to receive a yodel delivery that is on time - in fact it is so bad that i research who the online_retailer uses as a courier and if it is yodel - i avoid them !
F	i told her this was not a good way to do_business and she said they had longer chains in stock and i asked her to send me two of those immediately .
M	it also stops nosey neighbours and so called friends wasting time by viewing for their own curiousness .
M	i just put brief details of the phone into the mazuma website and they gave_me an instant quotation .
F	i ordered easily on the website and was given really clear information on the progress of my order .
M	what '_s going on ?"
M	the fact that i can pick out the parts on the website myself , so i actually know what i buy and pay for was the winning factor in comparison to other shops .
F	they dont even deserve one star !!
F	staff ok , but there needs to more frequent transfers between park and airport .
F	i am never able to use the phone becuase i never have enough reception .
F	!
F	from order to delivery . i ordered a cot_bed mattress from a well know store . no choice of time or day was offered . i stayed in all day only for them to deliver the wrong_size mattress .
M	i '_m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
F	the service was great - good software for creating photobook and quick delivery .
M	told i was going to get it the next_day and it didn_'_t come for another day !
M	very disappointed .
M	what impressed us the most was that there was no pressure to order or make an instant decision ( which is not something we can say of the other_retailers we visited ).
F	there was no double_bed , only a day bed with a pull out bed .
M	otherwise you can use the app linked to your wifi in your home ( if you have wifi of course !).
F	i am so disgusted with this company !
F	we were not impressed as they had to locate our car which took approximately 00_minutes and this meant we did ' nt arrive home until 0 am .
M	however , the night_vision turned_out to be poor , due to fogging in the dome .
F	thanks !
F	it was really easy to find what i wanted and place and order .
M	it was great - nice cruise but price of on - board facilities is disappointing and mooring times and both ports reduces time in destination considerably .
F	the muck_boots i ordered arrived exactly as promised , on time and well_packed .
M	no company i do_business with would consider_using them .
F	my car was in for its mot .
F	i wish i had looked on the amazon site fraction of the cost and a fraction of the shipping .
F	we ordered the signed one direction album on 00th_oct_0000 and are still_waiting !!
M	i then had a further email a week_later saying that due to a ' transmission error ' they ' d not delivered them and what did i want to do - after a few emails back and forth i got confirmation that they ' d be delivered on 00th , a week after they were originally due .
F	very bad customer_services .
F	!
F	the website was easy and very simple to use , it has a lot of info on the products etc .
M	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
M	everything very well_packed ,
M	on the positive_side , we received very good service when we finally got to the registration desk and received a very good car with a full explanation on how to reach the highway .
M	on returning the car nobody did a check of the vehicle - not good customer service .
F	i was delighted with my glasses and sunglasses at a price that i have never seen on the high_street !
M	i found taxday . co . uk on google and through a very simple and helpful process , they helped_me claim £ 0000 back .
F	this was vital medicine afterall .
F	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
F	we have now had to instigate legal_proceedings , my suggestion avoid at all cost >
F	i asked for a refund .
M	i politely told_him that i was currently busy packing for holiday and would like to talk more about this when i return to the uk , however he was not willing to accept this and continued to talk about the membership plan .
M	please arrange for someone to be there throughout this time - as we cannot be more specific about the time of delivery .
M	it lets me spend precious time giving my views but then refuses to accept them if i am using an older_version of internet_explorer .
M	car_hire point was alittle difficult to find , as it was nowhere_near whether the other hire car_hire points are , it is at completely the opposite end !
M	my experience of using this website was excellent .
F	i have a standing order which always_arrives in plenty of time , had to make an adjustment recently & it was dealt_with right away without_any hassle .
F	combine them together and a mars bar would be more satisfying . luckily i got a huge box of thorntons chocolates for £ 0 . 00 !!!
F	as i '_d requested .
M	the customer service staff available online , in the call_centre and in the store are all absolutely incompetent , have zero customer empathy and are more than happy to speak to you in a highly sarcastic and derogatory way .
M	cancelled the policy immediately , without paying anything .
M	0 .
F	despite my previous bad_experience with some other_companies and hesitation ordering from abroad and shipping to slovakia , all was without problem , the order was dispatched immediately , communication_regarding some product details was as well prompt and with no problem .
F	other than that the villa was lovely , and our holiday overall was fab !!
M	things could not have been any better .
F	about 00 phonecalls , plus txts and emails .
M	i have never used tyre_shopper before but i will be from now on .
M	i tried to get an astra because of good boot_space , but the fiat_000 i was offered didn_'_t cut it so i had to upgrade .
M	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
F	nice site easy to navigate
M	on the thursday i contacted them again asking where my parcel was they said they don_'_t know but will let_me know when they are ready , i said no , i need to know now !
M	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
M	to be honest it would have been better not to send any free_samples rather_than the paltry one that accompanied a £_000 order .
M	everything was fine , booked my fabulous paris apartment months in advance for a special family occasion !
M	i still have no idea what happened in the morning , but both amazon and fridgefreezerdirect dealt_with the matter well and arranged redeliveries with dpd quickly and without charge , which is better_than many other couriers in my experience .
F	do things with your money without even consulting or warning you its going to happen .
F	compared to our local and other_stockists they were the best ( by far ) on price
F	i use it to search hotels in the area .
F	the lenses are cheap and plastic but for the price paid the frames are good and sturdy and most_importantly don_'_t look cheap .
F	i refused , and am still_waiting for the money to be refunded .
F	i was kept up to date with my order and delivery
M	cons_: i have only made 0 orders so_far .
M	since the loss in these cables is critical i wanted then to be as short as possible .
M	paid £_00 for a package to be delivered from gloucester to leeds saturday delivery - so urgent .
M	i am extatic with the service i recieved .
M	then i tried to work out on the overly_complicated members area if i was signed_up to anything .
M	even an issue over the wrong credit_card charge was resolved instantly .
F	the second delivery person was an agency worker , he didn_'_t acknowledge me and was not listening to the other man who gave him full instructions on where they were going with the furniture and step up here etc .
F	i got them on 00_% so thought the quality wouldn_'_t be as good .
M	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then . still do nothing !
M	enough said
F	don_'_t think this was made clear when ordering .
M	incompetent engineers ; lies from the help - centre ; money taken to which they are not entitled .
F	not good !
F	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
F	i placed my order on friday_afternoon and was a little_worried that due to the weekend it '_ll arrive late ( as i needed it for valentines_day ) but to my surprise it arrived monday_morning .
M	even the supervisors don_’_t care .
M	price was £_00 more than everybody_else so i requested ( tracked ) free prepaid_envelope .
M	the car we were given was a vw_polo 0 . 0 .
M	i then had to stay home on the thursday until the van arrived around 0 - 00pm .
F	at this stage i feel that i '_ve gained very little near sight and sacrificed the majority of my general vision , for instance i could see very well generally and just wanted to sharpen up my near sight , only needing glasses for reading small_print and computer work , now i manage with the computer , small_print is still a little difficult but everything in between has_been compromised currently .
M	when is ' in a bit '??.
M	i phoned the company and asked if they would both get to me in time for the function i was attending .
F	had exactly_what i wanted and even more of what i desired !
F	great , fine .
F	had to telephone to find out what had been done with our delivery .
F	especially in a business that is all about making the day of someone you love .
F	one went through fine , i was told the others were worth £ 0 each as_opposed to £_00 after mazuma had received them !
F	sent details of how to unblock immediately as did not have handset to do it myself .
M	asked what was available and were told that only breakfast items were available .
M	the failure to fit my brakes properly also leads me to have concerns about the quality of the rest of the work done on the car .
M	whilst the draper components ( pt 0 ) were well boxed and wrapped , pt 0 was less well_packaged .
M	their communication lacks credibility which makes it hard to trust them .
M	nah , for me , hell no will i ever buy from here again .
M	i have had to instigate every communication and to add further the guys who answered the phone ( when he answers ) don_’_t even seem to care about the timescales .
F	on my account it clearly_states how much in credit i am yet they will not refund me .
F	we found a small_dent in filing_cabinet and received a no_quibble discount - we could have got replacement if preferred .
M	but quite expensive .
F	good next_day service with lovely vaue for money flowers
M	excellent from_start to finish
M	these batteries are priced low but high_quality every size that you will ever need
F	i can strongly_recomend this website to shop your babys strollers etc .
M	this is the same company as taps0less . com and never send out items nor refund you .
M	there was no problem on arrival with a speedy turnaround but had to call the mobile no on 0 occasions to get through .
F	best price and very quick delivery what more can you say
M	this is probably the worst experience i have ever had when trying to book a holiday .
M	no_problems with delivery , nice kit at reasonable prices , let_down by a lack of response to mis_- delivery of items , took 0 days to respond !
F	apart_from that it was very easy to set_up and pay for the service .
F	everything !
F	i cannot explain how easy the process was
M	great hotel at the best price and no_hassles .
M	not happy , unlikely to use again , beware
M	ordered fridge_freezer on friday and was delivered sunday morning .
F	i recommend blaze_sunglasses to everyone !
M	i arrived without booking and found that the ticket price was three_times the normal !
M	so when i came to printing everything out 0 months later ready for the journey it was a panic to find the rail_tickets .
M	the connections were in a slightly diiferent position to the one i removed but to me it was obvious where the connections had to go .
F	item took 00 working_days to arrive , i was getting worried so checked with on line tracker , which couldn_'_t find anything listed as going to my address although item was marked as dispatched .
F	i wouldn_'_t do that already .
M	not happy about that .
M	i also need to know when and on the day i need to know what hour .
M	order no .
F	great service .
M	this firm sells replacement t00 fluorescent_tubes that are no_longer currently manufactured .
F	this almost didn_'_t transpire , as the delivery company , on receipt of a response text from me , return texted that my choice had expired .
M	my experience of dealing_with plumbnation was similar to other reviews ( e . g .
M	he was most impressed with the quality of the flooring for the price .
M	unless the seal is fitted in warmer temperatures it can be difficult to apply the sealant and get good joint .
F	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
M	alexa – verified | mcafee – verified safe | ssl security – certified | trust_pilot - rated trusted | paypal protection – verified | norton safeweb – verified safe | web stats domain – verified 000_% safe | facebook – ( why is it only facebook that says “ maybe un - safe !?)
F	glad i paid with paypal !!
M	despite ordering the most expensive lens they aren_'_t a patch on my old nikon lenses .
M	on the plus_side they said they ' d send a £ 0 voucher as a ' goodwill ' gesture - but somehow , i don_'_t think i '_ll be using them again . ( they haven_'_t sent it in any case )
M	this could have be sorted by a phone_call to the delivery company to confirm the return and i could have had my cooker 0 days quicker .
M	the lads turned_up and got straight to work and did an excellent job with an overall good finish .
M	the product is perfect for my application and of the best quality .
F	beautiful flowers delivered quickly and packaged beautifully i assumed the vase which your web_site showed as an added optional_extra when placing my order was sadly not big enough to accommodate my chosen flowers for my mums_birthday , a little disappointed with that .
M	i have used_etyres in the past and have just used them again even_though they weren_'_t the very cheapest , reliable and trustworthy is worth a few extra quid to me .
F	after numerous_emails from them stating that i need to provide ' proof of postage ' i am no nearer gaining my refund on their mistake !
F	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
M	!
F	my phone now works a treat !
M	what more can you review ?
F	i recieved my new artisan mixer very quickly and was kept_informed of its delivery progress by e_mail and text .
M	i recently_bought a large_amount of flax seeds from the company .
F	good response , dealt_with problem of missing part , super swiftly .
F	i have bought spare batteries that have lasted 0 - 0_weeks and a box of cartomizers that had 0 out of 0 that worked , but cos of the returns_policy , have no comeback .
M	the sales_guy was very helpful and signed me up no problem .
F	i regret that my response cannot be more favourable and hope that , despite your recent experience , you will_continue to use expedia . co . uk for your future travel_arrangements , hereby allowing_us the opportunity to restore your faith in our company .
M	the price was excellent value , the car was scratched , dented and battered but drove safely , although i had swapped the first one offered as the brakes were on a hair trigger .
M	that is until i get a phone_call saying that they cant now get hold of the tyres .
F	ordered an ipad on 00 / 00 / 00 showing in stock , 0 / 00 days delivery , credit_card debited_immediately !
F	sent my phone off and then the following_day i received my cheque .
F	the prints they provided for my clients , are excellent quality !
F	when we arrived at the hotel they had no record of the booking and took an_hour before they accepted it .
M	yes , i got a refund , but this to me is a very unethical way to conduct_business !!
F	after needing a present , i ordered , and the delivery was fantastic , came the very next_day well_packaged , couldn_'_t fault them
F	i will use again and give more detailed_instructions re an address so your courier has no excuses .
F	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0_days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .

M	whilst trying to chase up i encountered numerous log on issues with the tyre_leader website .
F	it seemed to go well .
M	i waited over a month until i finally decided to contact them a bout the situation and after a few weeks of communication with sto they ended_up saying they haven_'_t received the product and that i cannot get my refund .
F	booked saturday , couldn_'_t deliver , not surprisingly couldn_'_t deliver on sunday but still no delivery on monday .
M	i went back on the website just to check and yes , i '_m right , on the site and preview it looks fine .
M	requested an invoice in my company name still_waiting .
M	since then one has broken ( not a huge problem as this zip has two ends .
M	had to do the job my self .
F	go for the best deal on price and if you get the cashback then it '_s a bonus but don_'_t base your purchase decision on cashback alone as you may never get it .
F	weakness
F	i am very pleased with the service and would have ordered more tiles however the sample i ordered was white however was actually off white and therefore it didn_'_t match the rest of my tiles .
F	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
M	service was alright delivery could of been better but then again i guess thats royal_mail
M	when we finally arrived at the avis_desk there was a very short queue , but it still seemed to take an age to get to the front of it .
F	this time they were taking £ 0 . this went on 0 - 0 times . were they wiped it clean .
F	i am very impressed with this company - i wish them well .
F	so that '_s the only_complaint i have was the delivery wasn_'_t great .
M	the prices on offer were very competitive and i could see no reason not to trust this organisation .
M	after 0_weeks , i contacted them to ask when i could expect delivery , only to be told that they couldn_'_t deliver at all and they ' d have to cancel the order !
M	you will find the the " lenson " experience first_class
F	they take your money and i waited to 0 to 00 working_days for my item .
M	they regularly have cheap offers like £ 0 postage or cheap surplus stock etc .
F	i sent back the parcel on tuesday and will await for a response on the refund .
M	excellent and the person they were for was over the moon .
M	a big let_down !
M	now it '_s over to complete_care shop to send some replies .
F	don_'_t normally do reviews but this is shocking .
F	& so i am not very pleased with the service
M	i ' d go striaght back to these_guys next time i need canvas_prints etc .
F	products good if i was going to be really picky then the package of product wasn_'_t so good - it could have gone as a present !
M	i sent my sony_xperia z to gadget_panda only to receive an email_saying they couldn_'_t accept it as one of the water indicators had changed color .
M	great service all_round .
M	?
M	happy to recommend them !
M	technician who fitted a new one was on time , very helpful and polite .
M	i finally got through at 0am the next_day , even_though the website says they are open from 0am to be told i would still have to pay as they will be charged by their suppliers but they didn_'_t seem interested in contacting their suppliers to look into this .
M	they '_ve done this on several review sites .
M	however , although my wife_loved the flowers she did say the roses , included in the display , looked a little_tired when delivered .
F	how very poor the service is from city_link by the looks of all these reviews .
M	there is no loyalty with interparcel , so i sometimes switch to another parcel service .
F	my son '_s wedding_anniversary is 0th_january , so he took the hamper as an anniversary_gift .
M	customer service is hard to contact
M	eventually , i relented though and paid vauxhall over the phone , and gave them my barrel lock number .
F	i wanted the flowers to reach my friend the following_day .
F	i was kept_informed by email through every part of the process and would use them again and again .
M	i really like quidco but lately they seem to be taking a very long time with confirming and paying some of the cashback from certain companies which really needs to be sorted_out , other than that i recommend them to anyone , and do quite often .
M	easy to use , with full descriptions of the products and also very reasonably_priced .
M	after numerous e_- mails to play '_s customer service i was still unable to secure a delivery date .
F	excellent advice on treatment options and very good care and information throughout the process , from preparation for the op right through aftercare and follow - up .
M	i expect 00 or 00_hours tops .
F	just shows the type of company when they asked trustpilot to remove the same comments_below made by my director on the technicality that it was in my name .
M	all_round , a good service
F	i do a lot of internet_shopping & i '_ve never had such bad service , with such arrogant cs and idiotic processes .
F	packing , dismantling own furniture etc
M	villa_plus in uk were very helpfull with booking that involved separate parties from england and n_ireland .
M	in the end i didn_'_t use any of it and bought some branded ( and bs stamped ) products .
M	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
M	anyway they assured me that there was and an appointment was made in november_0000 with their consultant .
F	the motion in the ocean was very bad in the night but we had been used to rocky crossings in the past .
F	the title pretty_much sums it up !
M	users of the site need to be aware that ford dealers are all fishing in the same pool and may offer a vehicle which they simply hope to be able to obtain for you at some point in the future .
M	phoned viovet and arranged for it to be returned and replaced with next size up .
M	i ' d recommend to anyone and will_definitely use again because the prices are very competitive .
F	speedy delivery , item packed as i instructed .
M	now that '_s service .
F	excellent service all_round .
M	very prompt delivery and all items as_described and ordered

F	i would definitely use beanbag_bazaar again .
F	i ordered a large version of one of the arrangements but it only contained half a dozen flowers .
M	thought i would look at cg on line and got it cheap and quick
M	fortunately the recipient is very speedy and managed to catch him before he sped off .
F	good products .
M	magic !
M	i ordered the extinguisher on a thursday late , expecting a monday delivery , the requirement stemmed from a french competitor in the rac rally who also a customer of our dealer in france , he was travelling up to the rally start location on tuesday .
M	0st driver turned_up on time , journey was acceptable , a bit white knuckle
M	00_hours_later - one more call .
F	great service , items were delivered in a timely_fashion & for free , order was correct and i received plenty of email_notifications to keep me in the loop .
M	available on line however out of stock
F	what actually arrived was two_bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
F	excellent service , was told delivery slot of 0 hour rather_than have to wait all day not knowing .
F	they had to use a delivery company as the package was so big .
F	quite disappointing actually
M	when applying , there is no clear warning such as ,” you will receive a message on your xxxcard statement when your direct_debit has_been set_up .
M	delivery promised by carrier , didnt happen as advised
F	have had a few items from the website and can '_t complain , prices are excellent and free delivery !
F	will definitely use again .
M	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
M	i asked if this would be a seemless transition as my office of some 0 persons relied on this connection .
M	thanks !
M	structurally good - probably the best - but put a proper felt roof on it .
F	i took out a short_term membership as part of a special_offer with my family and friends railcard renewal .
M	heres why :
F	generally they arrive two_days_later and at a push three .
F	unforturtunately they were delivered to the wrong_address so they were not with me until monday !
M	the first fabrication diagram i received from worktop_express had a couple of errors on it .
M	looked like a returned item .
F	i spent nearly_£_00 on this surprise christmas_present , ordering it 0_weeks before christmas to allow for delivery .
F	i was complety ripped_off .
F	i was really pleased with how the dresses i ordered looked when they arrived .
M	!
M	we searched the internet and came_accross a company called tickettree .
M	the big day arrived and as one of her presents it was opened and looked at all day , taken to work and on visits to friends and family and a week on it still is out and looked at with a smile on her_face .
M	i sat back and waited .
F	product received in record_time the usual good service from chemist_direct
M	admittedly , the products seem to be good value for money ' on paper ' but considering i paid for my shed 00 / 00 / 00 and had 0 deliveries of various parts that still do not equate to an entire shed , then all i can say is avoid !
F	we asked the reception staff to send him on his 0 hour journey without us .
M	contacted customer_services - could not trace second order - offered
M	i sent them an iphone_0s on a thursday via special delivery , which was signed for on the friday_morning .
F	last time the automatic license plate reader also read ours wrong so again on exit after our stay it didn_'_t recognise our booking .
M	but despite_being in stock , it still took a week to deliver .
M	once ordered the service was pretty quick .
M	very good service and hassle_free .
M	this is a helpful website and offers good information and good prices .
F	seemed to take loads longer_than it should have done , but got my money in the end .
M	i bought a swimsuit for my wife , and i sought_advice from swimshop about sizing .
F	the first plugs arrived on time but the second lot arrived a lot later and i was starting to get anxious .
F	i found the sunglasses i wanted easily on the website for a fantastic price .
M	i was only advised this when i enquired .
M	these are not professionals , there are tons of better retailers for e_- cig products , i don_'_t know why i even bothered with them .
M	a really nice lady on the end of the phone was most helpful .
F	i ignored it and thought they must have used them somehow because how can they just ' make up extra_charges ' but apparently they can .
M	i eventually worked out how to bypass their system and when i managed to speak to a humanoid their service was impeccable .
F	kind_regards
M	all in all we have saved very little over rrp , ended_up with items we don_'_t particularly want and spent literally hours sorting all this out .
M	excellent service , now if they only stocked the dba echo dream 0 they ' d be perfect !
M	regards
F	i ordered the guinevere outfit which arrived within the allotted_time .
F	had to order directly from site instead of through wowcher .
M	i ordered several products but have waited months now and still not received anything .
F	however , a few_days_later , the item still arrived !
F	i would not use them again .
M	i would recommend & use again .
F	tracked parcel the next_day ( 00th_dec ) which was the delivery due day and delivery site just said goods in transit !
M	about half an_hour at desk to be allocated a car because of volume of customers .
M	currency gbp united_kingdom pounds
F	had to chase them up to book special meals on plane and for e ticket a few_days before_departure .
F	having paid for the largest_bunch i expected there to be more flowers especially for the price , also received a different vase than i ordered
F	it was already 0pm and she had received nothing and it was not going to bear any resemblance to the beautiful yellow and purple bunch i had chosen . but i agreed , as it was very late in the day .
F	i placed 0 orders just before christmas and the 0nd order turned_up 0st .
F	ordered goods at the beginning of december .
F	the deals are good , but only the odd one comes up that i '_m actually interested in .
F	another fabulous holiday booked through blue_chip .
F	not sure i would use again !
F	it all comes apart into about 0 big bits which wash really easily and pop back together very simply .
M	they rarely reply to the many emails i sent and eventually claimed after 0 months that ' the gambain government have not yet ratified the ability for the banks to open these types of accounts - yet they have been advertising the product on their website for over a year and continue to do so .
M	i could have just gone to the . gov site and paid £_000 and received the same service , or lack of it .
M	i ( like many others ) have done the legwork for you .
F	appalling .
F	after 0_days , it still hadn_'_t been processed .
M	i have ordered several_times from ebuyer and sometimes they will just cancel the order and ask you to send in id don_'_t think so i will just order from elsewhere never given id to amazon
F	( april fool )
M	also the pick_up point is a 0 min shuttle_bus_ride from the airport
F	i got banned for no reason and they had basically accused me of posting a lie !
F	very pleased .
M	i used the on line pre_paid long_stay_parking .
M	have used this site several_times now and have been very happy with purchases .
M	it took several days for the order to be accepted , showing " new " on tracking .
M	only on his second inspection did he find the tear in one of the rear_tyres .
F	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
F	the flowers , they never arrived ,
F	unfortunately , a few_days_later , i logged_into my account to check progress of my delivery and was amazed to see the order had , once again , changed to food i would never eat .
F	i would not_hesitate to use the service again .
F	i had a visit from an engineer everything is fine inside the house and with the modem , oh , it was the bt guys who didn_'_t activate the line from outside .
F	00 april 00
F	they are very efficient , professional and helpful .
F	very impressed , now my garden is awash with working solar lamps again .
M	good delivery time being the only good bit .
F	it would have been easy to improve the instructions by changing the design slightly .
F	was very happy with this .
M	i was dubious at first but did a bit of research and was happy with going ahead , and didn_'_t regret it .
M	i would definitely buy again .
F	could do with a clip or strap to secure the footrests when folded up , as footrests are very light and fall_off when lifting the wheelchair into the boot of the car .
M	so if you value your privacy and want to be taken seriously when something does go_wrong , don_'_t send your images to jessops
M	i sent in a complaint with side - by - side photos of the flowers i received versus the flowers on their website , demanding a refund , however their " head florist " allegedly looked at the photos and didn_'_t think there was a problem .
M	i tried on line chat after being charged delivery when it stated free before cart .
M	excellent !
M	fast delivery , quality products
M	£_000 . 00 and £_000 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 and £_00 . 00 .
M	for almost everything i buy , i go via quidco , and so get a discount .
M	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
F	it also has limited hotels and b_& b '_s . considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
M	i will_definitely use the parts_gateway again in the future .
F	some of the clips were better quality than my original !!
M	ordered peugeot bumper in colour which i am happy with .
M	courier company ( interlink / dpd ) couldn_'_t shed much light on why and they promised to have it on a ' pre 00 ' delivery the following_day .
F	i think that they could have put a note on previous_orders to say the change was happening or e_- mailed when the order confirmation was sent .
M	well_done !
F	he did not return on - site until 00 . 00 am , that is at_least 0 hours and 00_minutes later !
M	so , unless you get a very helpful member of staff who can find a way round that , you have to go home , log on , and re - order on line .
F	we are very happy with the ones we are keeping .
M	you wont be disappointed .
M	no matter where i view through one lens i don_'_t get a sharp mid - distance image .
F	. but they love them !

F	having paid the extra for next dy delivery , my order still turned_up 0_days_later (_excluding the weekend ) as parcelforce managed to put my package onto to a delivery van that was going 00 miles_away !!
F	overall ok but separate companies for 0 men needed as we can '_t all help to lift clobber and i keep having to ask them if there '_s one man or two .
M	small problem with delivery address , steve rang and confirmed / ammended that too .
F	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
M	out of the 00 sticks ( carpet_runners ) he only used about 00 . he made do with the old ones on the stairs .
M	barfootathelete has the best selection of barefoot shoes out of any website i '_ve come_across , it has a nice looking & user_friendly layout .
M	a few_days_later i found that they had charged me for some extra cover that i did not ask for .
M	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
M	i will be using blackcircle again as the tyres i have found are alot_cheaper_than anywhere_else .
F	however .
M	reviews suggested it may take a while , as each hatchbag is individually made , but made and delivered to the scottish_highlands within four working_days .
F	00 of the tiles had chips or worse in one corner my builder used them for cutting to put at the edge , i have a couple left should you want to see the damage .
M	they offer good products at a good price just the only thing that lets them down is the period the item takes to get to you , not sure you '_ll want to wait :/ you may want to pay £ 0 extra o get a quicker delivery from else where .
M	i will_certainly buy this way in future .
F	this time i also bought the protein_bread , after tasting the free sample from my first order , i couldn_'_t_resist : it '_s so tasty and filling .
F	i returned it and ellis_brigham refunded the cost of postage .
F	faat delivery a ***** service

M	en skuffet kunde
F	i was very pleased with the quality of the photobooks i ordered .
M	we also did not recieve proofs of our art_work until chased for over a week after order had been placed , and never received the swatch of the stitching .
M	will probably use them again but follo up with a call to check stock .
F	when we went to collect we could see all the parcels had been through very muddy water !
F	!
F	i was in all day , but they made no attempt to approach the house and let_me know the goods were there .
M	however , i am no techno - whizz and the image i had sent them when expanded to roller - banner size would have been blurry and unprofessinal looking .
M	let '_s were delivered very quickly and worked_perfectly .
F	the admin_team answered my complaint as follows_:
F	very good service , delivery very prompt .
M	0 days_later and after paying £ 0 . 00 for the honour i received my items .
F	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
F	web_site & ordering quite straight_forward , delivery prompt .
F	y not sort it now ?
F	don_'_t think i '_ve ever had better service .
M	i would only recommend one . com to people who work in it like myself and will not be requiring much if any customer_support .
F	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
F	any_problems always dealt_with quickly and efficiently and most_importantly good prices - obviously can only apply this to the two purchases i have made - two basins .
M	however that was hdnl '_s fault and not that of the flower company , serenataflowers . com .
F	no_surprises this christmas , i sent them an_email to say i wasn_'_t happy about what they had done , no response forthcoming .
F	well_done oakfurnitureland !!!
F	i ordered a dvd from zoverstocks through playtrade , i was told it had been sent out the same day .
F	my new ' big perm ' from fancy_dress ball is amazing .

F	really happy the invitations , even more beautiful than i expected when they arrived
M	i ordered my parts on good friday .
M	my partner was out when they were delivered .
M	it was difficult to open the packaging without_damaging it so this felt very unfair .
M	easy instructions to follow driver meets you at drop_off point .
F	i have tried to order next_day flowers in the evening before and not had any success however these flowers were delivered next_day and before one o ' clock without_compromising on quality !
M	great stuff , great prices .
F	buttons are far better .
M	good price .
M	keep your customers advised we are not mind readers .
M	i cancelled my commitments and waited in and got bumper about 00 . 00pm .
M	i ' d recommend them
M	they did not have the car i ordered so we were ' upgraded '.
M	the delivery time was very very slow with no communication so i didnt know if my order was on its way or not and when i tryed and tryed and tryed and tryed to call them the phone clicked me off every time so i didnt know if the company was still in business or had been shut_down .
F	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
M	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
F	all it will give you is prices for low , medium or high usage - no information about standing charge or prices per kilowatt .
F	and the explanation that i received when i emailed you about it is very convoluted - from what i could gather , the priority part only covers within the uk ?
F	quite a heavy machine to move on one '_s own but well_worth it - the spin is excellent and i am very pleased with this machine .
M	order was processed and took delivery within 00_hours , and this wasn_'_t a one off .
F	i have never_experienced_such unprofessional service before .
F	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered_useless ).
F	please , for your_own sake , be very careful about dealing_with this company .
F	am over the moon with the new pan
M	kept me fully in the loop
M	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00_euros .
F	we also had a call where they volunteered to take the details from another website and gave_us a cheap offer .
M	overall i would highly_recommend blood sweat & ink tattoos .
M	this has now happened and the replacement trolley seems to be working at the moment !
F	arrived first thing wednesday_morning .
F	it '_s alright , takes a while to get your cashback but you get it , and that '_s what matters i guess !
M	in dealing_with a difficult and somewhat embarrassing condition such as ed i have always felt_relaxed and able to discuss my needs with the staff without_any concerns .
M	easy to use got 0 quotes fast so very happy .
M	shoes arrived . only to find that they were a white pair when they had been described as black and white . much to my disappointment . phoned and advised . gamola said they had been incorrectly decribed in their web - site as black and white . had to thereafter take the shoes into gamola_golf in aberdeen on00th may 0000 to return . inconvenience_caused_by having to go into aberdeen . park etc . with no other reason for my trip . staff at gamola_golf on phone and shop were polite and helpful
M	exactly_what ordered at a good price and fast delivery - cant_ask for more .
M	delivery days need to be as arranged .
F	will not use this company for any of it '_s services in the future .
M	tons of top_class items of clothing at amazing value .
F	also can '_t use online contact form until order number is registered on your system which takes_forever - no good if you have an_immediate question
M	would have been two stars but that review was referred for referring to another company .
F	water leaked from the end of the sink_unit and made a little puddle on the kitchen_floor every night , not much but noticeable .
M	i signed_up with the promise of a no deposit bonus , only for it to never be credited , how do they get away with it ?
F	but when you say voucher 00_%_off next purchase voucher no 00000 00th_oct . how come i only got £ 0 off .
F	waited 0_weeks to hear back after several e_-_mails and calls to a manchester based carting treat that i booked for the family .
M	but you don_'_t allow two letter names !
F	the person i spoke to was efficient and my policy was renewed . she apologised for the fact i got no call back but could not explain_why .
M	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
M	wae_+ website said my order was " awaiting fullfilment ".
F	not only did my wonderful surgeon come and spend time before my op with me but my anaesthetist also did .
F	thankyou escaped .
M	perfect .
M	received ( amongst_others ) a really competitive quote for the bumper ass , ( which was brand_new unlike all the other quotes ) and i was really keen to purchase the goods but i could not fathom out how to purchase the kit - there was no buy now button or shopping_basket button , the telephone_number costs over a pound a minute , you are warned not to contact the supplier direct ( which 00p a minute & probably involves loads of waiting and listening to various_options whilst the minutes add up etc ) i found these_guys an_absolute_nightmare , complete_waste of time , i still_haven_'_t got my parts !
F	i begged them to at_least just remove the text , but no .
F	they then say they '_ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn_'_t actually appear to happen ).
M	it was because of these positive_experiences that i had no_hesitation in buying an audiolab mdac from them via mail order .
M	i was highly disappointed by this .
F	please_accept my apology in not replying earlier as i do not switch on and work the computer very often .
M	purchased using a wowcher voucher .
F	i particularly_like secrets of the phoenix as its not available on other_sites .
M	a bit_miffed , so i '_ll probably buy in a local_supermarket next time .
F	unfortunately we had out in the wrong sizes so had to return .
F	i have bought from them on more than one occasioin but recently i had the occasion to query the disappointing condition of a pair of ugg_boots after i had worn them for two winters , without further ado i was asked to send a picture by e . mail which i did , i then received an e . mail message asking me to send the boots back , this message included a pre_- paid label - i sent them back and within a week i received a replacement pair of ugg_boots totally free of charge - it restores_your faith in human_nature and confirms my beleif that it is always best to buy from companies that can be_relied upon .
F	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
F	easy to use website .
M	simply the best company i have used
M	nobody seems to know who is responsible for authorising or processing refunds , and answer machine messages are seemingly ignored .
M	whilst the product so_far seems fine , and the delivery drivers were exceptional , i thought that the disinterested / uninformed attitude of the people i spoke to on the phone for both the initial order and then the delivery arrangements were quite disappointing .
F	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
M	the first time i used the service i was paid 0 times what i received for this phone and the phone i sold was junk !
F	all they care about is getting as much money off you as possible and not caring about anything_else - beware !
M	love flubit !
F	didn_'_t realise before i ordered , but use citylink to deliver , who i avoid like the plague unreliable , and rare places to pick_up .
M	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
M	i am now proceeding to my credit_card providers website to initiate a chargeback , before i go on to file details on formationshouse . com with hmrc '_s grey economy unit and city of london police .
M	no customer service !
F	i received them the following_day and the delivery was free !
M	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
F	i ordered jardiniere and matching side net_curtains - disappointed to see that jardiniere sides and side net panels do not match ( on curved bottoms and look a bit uneven in my bay_windows .
M	fast shipping , nice customer service , good price .
F	extremely pleased with the quality of the product and the efficient service .
M	they were a little too ' process them in and out quick ' on the day , particularly given that this is a very scary procedure .
F	unfortunately the delivery service was rubbish and i ended_up arranging for someone to be at home for three_days in a row .
M	i wanted a vauxhall_astra gtc 0 . 0 cdti sri .
M	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return postage cost .
F	when i called them back they were more than helpful , and i could tell they were busy and second time lucky they left it with my receptionist , as i instructed . really nice people on the phone !
M	so who_knows if the item was new or not - it certainly didn_'_t look as you would expect it .
F	unfortunately when our minibuses arrived they forgot to bring the trailer for the luggage .
M	in summary , i ' d say don_'_t bother .
M	amazing product with amazing service .
F	didn_'_t take much effort , and it was easier to understand the process !
F	i received it on the 00 march .
M	whilst the ' hotel ' was very clean & comfertable the organisation left a lot to be desired . at night ( after 0000_hrs ) the foreign students were allowed to run riot in the corridors stopping other residents any form of rest , when i went down to complain to the hotel staff they were most apologetic but said that they only had one member of secutrity staff to patrol the whole building in the morning no one seemed to be able to explain the system of paying for bteakfast ( no one seemed to speak or understand basic english .
M	and i very much doubt that the chaps on the boat took home £ 000pp .
M	i also think that orders over £_00 should be free_postage like all competition , whilst juno charge and add a extra £ 0 for insurance on top .
M	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
F	i booked car_hire which was reasonable_price for weekend , arrived at designation was informed by the car_hire firm i did not require my booking info got an upgraded and mis_- sold by the appointed car_hire company which was budget car_hire .
F	as it was the more_expensive choice that i made so i thought i could at_least expect a more_expensive finish .
F	the maid was possibly the most miserable person in the algarve .
F	well_packaged and fast delivery
F	!
F	pricey , but still worth it for those special_occasions .
F	anyway , the flowers arrived via the local postman the next_day in a an over sized box so they had been banging around in the box and of course they had had no water for a few_days and had been in and out of royal_mail warehouses = not a very nice delivery of flowers to a loved one .
M	except from being quite regularly on time ( what they do not forget to remind you after a landing with loud sounds ), ryanair is the worst airline i have ever flown with .
M	outdoorkit many_thanks for your service , help and the promptness you have shown .
F	i wear_contacts on a regular_basis and these contacts hurt my eyes .
F	ordered a new bulb for my fridge_freezer make and model correctly spoecified and one arrived twice as big !!
F	i find the standard of customer service provided by end clothing is unacceptable .
F	as i had already waited over 0_weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
F	definitely hire off this company !!!
M	i was very impressed !
F	and insurance that we didn_'_t want - tried to cancel no luck .
F	due to brand restrictions don_'_t ship some brand '_s products outside of the eu , my order has_been cancelled .
M	my first experience of this company ; the website was easy to navigate , prices were good and follow_up once the order was placed was excellent .
F	i was promised a refund and cancellation of my order .
F	it was easy to order and the spares arrived earlier_than the projected delivery date .
M	the case is excellent !
F	the service i received was excellent .
M	*** updated 00 / 00 /_0000 ***
F	quick from ordering to delivery .
M	.
M	i had a delivery due on thursday 00 / 00 /_0000 between 00 : 00 – 00 : 00 .
F	so ill be using you again .
M	there again , you could go to one of the big five , pay over the odds and get inefficient service .
M	when i did get through to someone they said it ' was all ok but it '_s not in stock '.
M	excellent price with fast delivery .
F	would recommend and will use again when the need_arises !
M	found exactly_what i was looking for , placed my order , paid and delivery arrived 0 days_later .
F	couldn_'_t really ask for any more .
F	ordering was very easy and it was delivered next_day .
F	having noticed rapid brow was quite alot_cheaper on your website i thought i would give it ago .
F	delighted !!
M	i '_ve_used easyspace for years and they '_ve got increasingly more_expensive compared to many other_companies out there .
F	very satisfied with service and product .
F	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
M	i re - arranged again for fitting on 00th .
F	the rok stirling boots seem very robust so far ( 0 month ).
F	i wasn_'_t happy that the process to book via mobile phone app was quite troublesome and i had to try about 0 times before it accepted my payment ( it didn_'_t like paypal ) and since i was using a small screen ( i was unable to apply the discount_code on my laptop ) i didn_'_t notice some of the ' optional_extras ' that got automatically_added before confirming payment .
F	would defiantly recommend .
F	was informed there had been a problem with the delivery van , but that they would be delivered today , and was given a £ 0 voucher_code as an_apology .
M	so i ring the depot , there '_s no answer .
M	which is unusual , as i '_m a grumpy sod .
F	i placed a large order for over 00 items for my sick pets who are approaching the end of their life .
F	i had to pay for a full_tank , but only used the car to get to and from antequera , at the return the lady commented on how little fuel i had used . a refund of say 0 / 0 tank would have been acceptable .
F	i am not a photographer , have no idea about cameras and yet now i have to await my son in laws visit to see if he can do the job that faa needs to get a " quality " photograph that will be up to scratch , and then maybe i will become a premium member once again . we will see !
F	can not believe just how bad the meet and greet was .
M	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained_staff .
F	i will definitely use serenata_flowers again .
F	after much frustration i '_m finally sitting here with the angry_birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
M	perhaps the process for passing the delivery instructions to the courier need to be reviewed .
M	thank_you .
M	prices were cheap but if there are any_problems then you cannot get in touch with them .
F	surprise , surprise nothing was delivered and nobody called me - checked the website and it had been updated to say delivery on tuesday 0th between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
F	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
M	i would never use this service again , they are cowboys .
F	i recently ordered from active_beauty because they had a special_offer on if you spent over_£_00 .
F	all cakes were squashed and spoiled .
F	i want to warn any potential_customers of mk exhibition or movey that they should not pay up front for anything from this bloke .
M	end of !
F	i don_'_t know what the none sale sheds are like but i would advice to avoid the so called ' limited sale sheds '.
F	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
F	flowers were delivered on time as requested and updates as to receipt and sending were bang_on .
M	the £ 0 drop - off is just not needed , it should be similar to glagow .
F	when i e_- mail them i get an answer the same , or the next_day and they are always friendly and service - minded .
M	you then have a huge_selection of tyres which you can sort by make , price or performance .
F	thanks fc i would not_hesitate in recommending your company .
M	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 '_s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more than [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference ]).
M	payment was straightforward and one could even use paypal for added_security .
M	i '_m unsure if it was specified in the product description however i do believe this is essential to the product .
F	!
F	this was my first time using this company , probably_wouldn_'_t use again .
F	using teacher profiles is a good way of ensuring that the learning needs of the child can be met .
F	i just don_'_t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
F	cancelled trip due to illness
M	the parcel arrived the following_day .
M	might try again in the near_future
F	birmingham parcelforce depot have given me excuses ranging_from , the parcel was outsourced to another courier , the driver has no mobile and no means of communication in his van , a manager has_gone out with the driver to locate the parcel etc .
F	despite this , they always have time for the customer and explain things in terms the layman understand .
F	we are very satisfied customers .
F	this was very annoying .
F	when the luggage arrived from cleveland , tn to ft . lauderdale fl one lock was totally missing and the second so badly bent it can never again be used .
F	then then told me a 0 - 0 week wait i had no choice but to upgrade and pay the extra .
F	thank u .
M	regards
F	!
F	package was delivered to wrong depot so not sent to recipient on required day .
M	as above , the process and notification was very good .
M	prices pretty good , nice website and appointments available quickly .
F	left with a shower , which i don_'_t feel performs any better_than the much_cheaper model it replaced !
F	!
M	only place i could get them .
M	this company is a real problem for consumers .
M	i '_ll be back for my 0000 sunnies !
M	i received a text thanking_me for upgrading , i immediately called them and advised i hadn_'_t , and had cancelled my contract - they put me on to their fraud dept who advised my new phone was down to be delivered to london - advised i live in manchester and had not ordered it - they confirmed they would cancel the order .
F	we had to wait a short time for another flight to arrive for a couple to join our coach but we were dropped_off first .
F	i think the fact that it was out of stock should have been shown on the website , or that i should have been given the option to cancel .
M	- damaged reputation .
F	i think this is disgusting and dishonest !!
F	it said on the banner happy birthday twice .
M	i placed my order , and had full tracking every_step of the way as my purchase progressed to my home address from_hong_kong all in less_than a week .
F	having used_serenta_flowers in the past and been happy with their service , i had no_hesitation in using them again , however this time i was very dissapointed with the service .
M	don_'_t list items for sale that are not for sale .
M	they finally arrived and they were beautiful .
F	so never received it .
M	no offer to refund so much as the delivery charge .
M	00p a minute just to register the returns .
F	the item was a very reasonable_price .
F	unfortunately , they were delivered after 0 . 00 .
M	company unable to deliver fridge within 00 days as expected when ordering due to change of their supplier .
F	steer_clear
F	i cannot tell if this is new or genuine .
M	again ordering and taken delivery from on line no compliants , i ordered for a present for my wife and i ordered the wrong_size , i phoned up the help line ( very helpfull ) and i asked if we could take it to our local shop in liverpool and was told yes .
F	used them for the first time at the end of march and have made another 0 orders since then .
M	levys guitar_strap - i wanted the same one as i had on another instrument - found it at stringsdirect , ordered it and was quickly received .
F	we selected a property and paid a deposit on - line - simples !
F	only one bad thing did not get money till next_morning as the rep never sent statements but did get money in the end
F	great tap at half the price of the shops .
F	i really would have had second_thoughts in having the treatment at all had i known this was going to happen .
M	' do you want to have a partial_refund and we keep a deposit '.
F	add to that fantastic service and delivery , what more could you ask for ?
F	i have gone to watchdog .
F	such a disappointment as it was a special surprise for my children .
M	the reviews were correct headline delivery was much much slower_than_expected .
M	approachable and good humoured attitude that will always try and accomodate specific customer needs .
M	friday_afternoon still no email .
M	they were high resolution photos of great quality but look anything like it in the book .
M	i was kept_informed as to the status of my order and even received a phonecall to make_sure i understood the product that i was ordering as it required cutting and soldering , even offering to do this for me before shipping should i require .
M	there is an excellent website top ensure a really good fit - if you use it properly unlike me .
F	when finally i was able to sort_out the meal deal the hotel was supposed to email me with a menu , another 0 calls and an_email later and i finally received it .
F	would recommend them .
F	thanks !
M	easy to place an order .
M	no answer to the telephone and no response to the email i sent .
M	i phoned drum_stop as i wanted to buy a drum_kit in part_ex for my kit which was in very good condition .
M	so i waited_until 00 - aug . order still in " in processing ".
M	( this should be their job )
F	definitely use again !
M	after 0 hours with no call , i rang in to be told yes everything was done .
M	0000 numbers won_'_t let you speak to a human .
F	avoid at all costs
M	this was the first time that i have used this service and will recomend sds to anyone looking for ironmongery .
M	keep_up the good work !
M	eventually i found a phone number ( not on the site but with the help of mr google ) and got a guy_who was very helpful and went through all the booking procedures again .
F	not always easy to find what i want . . but i get there in the end !
F	the van broke_down - yeah_right .
F	money i can ill_afford to lose .
F	one toilet was not suitable , vp wanted £_00 for return cost ,( wasnt told at time of order , just told i could return ) i got my own courier in the end , cost me £ 0 !!
F	was it ?
M	.
M	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
M	i would highly_recommend rattan_direct to anyone .
F	i was incredibly disappointed and upset .
F	i asked what i should do now as i needed my car and was greeted with a shrug of shoulders and told to take it to the nearest proton dealer a 00 minute drive !!
M	a fundamental necessity i would have thought when buying a new car .
M	it is a shame i have to give one star .
F	excellent service , we phoned when we were about 00_minutes from gatwick_airport and the driver was there waiting to take the car .
F	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
F	i purchased a pair of oakley jupiter squared sunglasses with polarized_lenses for a present a couple of weeks_ago .
M	i was sceptical_about using a service like mazuma as i worried they would receive my phone and make up some excuse to lower the price i had been quoted but i was pleasantly_surprised .
F	the last delivery was the same and it took two_weeks to get the goods i had ordered plus numerous_calls .
M	the binding sole length and din settings were incorrect , despite providing the required info on the website .
F	as the title_says great all_round , no_probs here .
M	he is a driving_instructor so needs tyres with goos legal tread .
M	poor delivery , you should use next_day as standard at the very least .
F	had i missed the delivery twice i would have had to pay an extra £ 0 + for another attempt so i will regrettably go to another_supplier who use a delivery service where i can collect the parcel myself if i am not at home .
F	mixing was also a problem as there were not clear_instructions .
F	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
M	a good and easy way to buy records always been happy with the service good customer service would recommend to friends happily
M	!
M	i also had to spend some time screwing on all the drawer_handles .
F	the blind arrived very quickly and is good quality , but it was 0mm too wide in_spite of our very careful measuring beforehand .
F	i haven_'_t finished planning yet , so look out daniel - i will be on the phone again shortly for more expert help and assistance .
F	found a failed delivery card left in the morning - was in all morning with the door within earshot , no knock or sign of attempted delivery apart_from the failed delivery card .
F	i will stick to my original perla .
M	as the site automatically makes the delivery address and the billing_address the same , i had to put my old address as the order would only process the billing_address .
M	offerered to get them off for £_00 and then i would have had to have them replaced !!!
M	i find the logging in and viewing email and files on my blackberry not good .
M	fast dispatch and delivery and well_packaged .
M	delivery was super_fast and honest price for postage , could not wish for better .
M	unsurprisingly they claim their stock_levels showed no discrepancy therefore , in their opinion , the cymbals had been sent and there was nothing else they could do .
M	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
M	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
F	very disappointed - bouquet was very small , as were the flowers .
M	transaction was completed in a professional and satisfactory manner
F	didn_'_t receive my item .
M	beware
F	a letter to thomas_cook later - they weren_'_t in the slightest bit interested .
M	shoddy website , shoddy service , i will never use them again .
M	but of course , one does not simply go and collect a parcel from yodel .
F	please , please fill out an online fraud complaint form about them and maybe we can stop them from trading / scamming .
F	we then had to arrange to be in another day ( they don_'_t deliver on weekends ) so that the broken sink could be collected and a replacement provided .
F	these bags were bought t to deliver christmas_gifts and had i seen the quality / density / weight of the paper used i would not have bought them .
M	ok , here is my experience :
F	the paper based ss catalogue is awful , too busy , too much splash and big letters , too many products that appear to be similar and not enough explanation about product content or why some are different in strength etc_.,
F	the bombing and spray helped , i made sure to follow the instructions and advice i found on this website .
M	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
F	i am , nevertheless very pleased with my own photo_book .
M	unless it is so you have nothing to dump !
F	it would be helpful if there was a " save " mechanism so you don_'_t have to start from scratch .
F	they had problems with the documents i sent !
F	not everyone could be that lucky though .
F	sent out by a courier company who refused to leave it and took it back to the depot .
F	delivery was quoted as 0_weeks .
M	sure_enough , the mail order service is every bit as impressive as their in - store service .
M	selecting the items i required and setting_up the payment and delivery arrangements went_smoothly .
M	i keep on getting nuisance calls from a foreign call_centre which is ran by vodafone .
M	super value , speedy posting and they accept returns with no_quibble and if you pitch up in person offer a brew !
M	i again arranged for some person to be there to accept delivery who was none to happy after the day before .
M	( also they are a power seller on ebay with more than 00000 positive_feedback .
M	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre_pressures for every car in the world right .?
M	oasis water purification tablets - much_better_than others that i had used , as the chlorine taste was barely_noticeable .
F	however , even after personal contact , we were unable to amend the original order .
F	ordered over_£_00 of goods but one item was discontinued - not my fault but was hit with delivery chaarge as this took order value below £_00 .
F	my experience of diet_chef was ok .
F	i ended_up unpicking the collar and putting my own piece of cardboard inside .
F	new microwave ordered & delivered next_day @ time notified .
M	one could not get better service than that and i am_delighted with the product .
M	the advisor then said your entitled to a free tv plus package , there were no extra_charges mentioned even after i asked .
F	very pleased with service .
F	very pleased with service , kept up - to - date with each process and they can deliver to suit you should you need to make_changes at the last moment .
M	highly_recommended .
F	i used this place for the first time last_week .
M	very good service will order for them again
M	placed my order and 0days_later i '_m still_waiting on it arriving .
F	i am delighted with lightweight as i have a bad back myself and i am registered_disabled .
M	they offer great value and a fast , efficient and free delivery service .
F	having sold the property , hatched went very quiet indeed until we exchanged contracts .
F	the courier service has tried to deliver them twice_now and unfortunately i wasn_'_t in the first time - i did phone after the first time , to hermes the courier service , but could only leave a message_advising them of the best time to deliver .
F	completely unprofessional and untrustworthy .
M	the charges were reasonable and the delivery was impressive .
F	very pleased with our blinds , perfect_fit and very good quality . great selection of fabric and excellent value .
M	would i buy from them again ?
M	e_- mailed them early yesterday to confirm track and send numbers for flowers i '_ve ordered and still had nothing .
F	the tiles are lovely and the price was good , but when we received the tiles a third of the tiles where broken both types of tiles i ordered .
M	the good thing was that it was scented as well .
M	will let you know if it works
M	think i had about six emails and texts from you , i don_'_t mind that .
M	having_trawled the internet for broadcast equipment rcb_logic came out as the best priced and well described reviews .
M	order no 00000
M	my overall score = 00 / 00
F	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
F	the little shot_glasses are so cute they are exactly_what i wanted and exactly as_described and the postage was excellent .
M	so all in all what should have taken 0 days has turned into a month and the item was only shipped today in the mean time i have had to rent gear 0 times at a cost of 00 pounds and 0 days off work waiting for couriers that didnt arrive at a cost of 000_pounds my saving was only 00 pounds in the first place so i am 000_pounds out of pocket and still no fins this is the worst company i have ever traded with told constant_lies and there customer sevice is disgusting if you are thinking of using them dont by in england youl still save_money than buying off scubastore
F	in the past i '_ve always used envirophone and have never had any_issues .
M	i sent them a cheque .
F	irene dallas
F	i ordered a 0 0 / 0 and got a 0 , two_days before leaving on a holiday .
M	poor !
F	definitely recommend chemist_direct
M	after yet another phonecall was told they would be delivered in a few_days .
M	discovering parcel0go with a user - friendly website , convenient paypal payment facility and the convenience of dropping my parcels at our local_spar convenience store , just yards from us , was just the lucky break we needed .
M	i would say stay well clear of this website , i signed_up through google because they promise you ' free £_00 now ' but after i signed_up , no sign of this bonus , and after_speaking to online help i was told i had to wait 00_hours , so fair_enough , after pointing_out that they may want to change the google advertising as it was misleading i left and waited 00_hours , still no bonus , after_speaking with online help i was told i should have got the bonus straight_away ?
M	excellent service and would recommend this company
F	soaking_wet .
M	contacted and a box was sent with no_problems . been better if not had to ask for box .
M	you only get 0_stars .
M	it does what it says .
M	an_absolute_pleasure to deal with such a friendly and efficient company as mazuma .
F	i bought the item from their ebay store .
F	a replacement was sent but this meant three_days delivery instead of next_day .
F	unhelpful delivery service .
F	this stuck to the canvas fibres of the bags and i first of all tried to brush them down to remove the bits of paper , but the fibres were getting in my throat , nose and mouth - as well as paper everywhere .
F	at 00 . 00 on the due date a courier arrived .
F	we had the burlesque dancing and the cocktail_making classes .
F	it was delivered the following wednesday in a time_slot that suited me and i am really pleased with the furniture .
M	my frames broke when the opticians were fitting the frames .
F	rapid delivery of item requested .
M	ended_up cancelling the whole order .
F	i was so pleased with my fit_flops they are so comfortable , my feet are not my best feature but look better in these shoes .
M	nikki then realised this was a bit silly and arranged for both items to be delivered on our preferred date .
M	more experienced players that don_'_t wager huge_amounts will be disappointed at the lack of rewards .
F	very good comms .
M	ordered seed spuds for main crop on the 0 rd may , no delivery !
F	i am quite it literate but some aspects of the formatting , cropping , downloading and design proved tricky to make my book look as i wanted it to .
F	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
M	one box was broken but all parts were still intact .
M	crazy , thought we were in a recession !
M	first of all their website doesn_'_t work properly .
M	nice layout but would like to go even bigger next time
F	would definitely recommend envirofone !
F	i had several website options that i could have chosen my product from . but eventually chose the tooled_up site because of the glowing_reviews about the product i was interested in ( a garden kneeler / stool ) .
F	if you don_'_t , be warned , you are heading for a nightmare and there will be lots that comes between you ( your sanity ) and your ' perfect sofa '
F	also the order did not arrive on time , which the woman_who i spoke to abruptly told me there was nothing they could do about as in their terms and conditions it does_state that they don_'_t guarantee delivery on time .
M	with good back up after the sale .
M	all the range of products is perfectly illustrated in their comprehensive annual catalogue , updated by new product detail when introduced throughout the year .
F	if you want some new shoes check out shoetique .

M	i have your card dx group , you were here at this postcode at some point this morning ).
F	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault .
M	don_'_t go there .

F	once i had found the correct florist i was able to find out within a 0 minute call that they had delivered to the wrong_address and would get another bouquet out immediately .
F	however although the basket was pretty in orange flowers it was not very big , and after 0_days the lillys have wilted , which is quite unusual for lillys .
F	i feel that they were very informative and direct about the selling procedure .
M	no protection in packaging .
F	highly_recommend this site !
M	on tracking my delivery i found you had dispatched my delivery straight_away but it took another three_days sat at the courier depot before it arrived .
M	however all seems well now that it is up and running , even if i did have to fit some extras myself !
F	the delivery company chosen to deliver the product was difficult to contact .
M	merlin_cycles are cheapest for a lot of things and they deliver fast but if you need any help over the phone they are pretty poor .
F	after a week had passed my order still had not arrived so i contacted myprotein and was put on hold for 00_minutes before my call was even answered .
F	very happy got my delivery quicker_than i thought , items great thank_you
M	every time one of us moved slightly in the bed it creaked waking us both up .

M	a very good product at an excepional price .
M	nad we are still_waiting for the call - not good enough jessops !

F	i will use them again !
F	thrilled with the superb fitting of boot_liner , bumper and rear_seat protection flap for my audi q0 .
M	my advise pay the extra and use another company .
M	i have used ats many_times my family use them as well excellent service and friendly staff
M	tickets had a face value of € 00 , ordered 0 and by the time you check out its €_000 , booking_fees , shipping fees , taxes .
M	i have contacted barclays whose card i used to make the purchase , and they are taking over my case .
F	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
F	ordering the product was easy from_start to finish .
F	will certainly be using tyres on the drive in future , nice one fellas !
M	had this supplier insisted on calling me before accepting my order , i believe i would have been sold the correct product .
M	overall i have been very impressed with the whole_experience , any questions i had asked about components or delivery were always answered .
F	why didn_'_t a member of staff email or call me to inform_me of this ?
F	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something_else .
M	unlike_other_companies i accessed on the internet , you got what they said you ' d get no_hidden_costs excellent rates quick delivery & information on when the money was dispatched & also the website was easy to use
F	brilliant service . very easy website to order from and products arrived within days . no_hassle at all and much_cheaper then the vet !!

M	i have been a user for over a year now and this is the best cask back site i know .
F	you sent the product with two different batteries , one of which didn_'_t fit .
M	!
F	worth bypassing w . h . smiths - the pens are nearly twice the price there .
F	needless to say , though , i was a little dissapointed .
M	item was out of stock once i had paid for it .
M	when they come out to repair a tyre they ask if you would like them to bring a new tyre in case a repair is not possible .
M	i have used the online brewing company for a number of years and have never had any real problems with them .
M	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).
F	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
F	will definitely buy again !
F	i cannot type my response , but i can_assure you that after a month i finally spoke with a manager and had the 0 year contract cancelled .
M	also a two man delivery was charged extra , my man being available to assist was refused on insurance grounds .
F	very pleased with the service at perfume - click , great value , well_packaged and delivered super quick .
M	one long ( over 0 + hr ) stressful call - funnily_enough to the same ( seemingly competent ) person we were categorically promised that this would be sorted straight_away .
M	i remain impressed .
M	my only solution now is to book my return flight with someone_else
F	i am_disgusted with the way i have been treated and still have no wardrobe and no compensation !
F	i have not dealt_with any other shop online or otherwise to date which follows this type of policy - normally a refund is a simple affair , whether its faulty or not you can get your money back and you certainly wouldn_'_t be expected to pay the postage .
M	i have been in the electrical contracting business
M	free post
F	the booking was okay , the problem came when i had to change a return date within 00_hours .
M	i bought two bean sprouters ( terracotta ).

M	exellent service and after sales advice .
F	i ordered my son a onesie for christmas , so it was not until a few_weeks after arrival that it was found the onesie had seams undone and a hole in it .

M	i ordered a wedding waistcoat which just wasn_'_t quite right , quality was good but just a bit too shiny - didn_'_t go with rest of the outfit .
F	as it stands i sent 0 emails , an electronic version of their change form about my hire and half a dozen phone_calls and i am still_waiting for any kind of response from the company about my hire .
F	larnaca airport cyprus - weeks car_hire october_0000 .
F	the delivery itself was done and dusted_within fifteen_minutes - there were two friendly males who just got on with the job , were efficient and polite .
F	unbelievable after several emails they still do not respond despite asking for a full_refund . my sister eventually received them 0_days_later in a very sorry_state after being in the couriers van for 0_days with no water !!!
M	i was contacted by a mr stewart newman who seemed helpful and directed me to an immediate escalation_team who where as slow as a snail in a trance ( also based in las_vegas , costing a fortune in phone bills ).
M	thanks jw
F	canceled order but out of pocket taxi_fare to and from garage !

F	last_year i had 0 freezers delivered in succession the first two without_success and the second which_resulted_in a loss of vast_amounts of food overnight .
F	it '_s so much_easier !
M	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
M	the company is in fact based in singapore .
M	??
M	if such a service is available it should be made available at point of sale , not as an add on to a service call .
F	the products are indeed great quality and the prices are good .
M	i ordered a yellow lens for my oakley radars .
F	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
F	goodness only knows when it had had a decent and thorough clean .
F	we '_ve had a couple of good deals - and we '_ve also had our fingers burnt a bit - including a recent disasterous stay at the malvern conveyorbelt ( i mean spa .)
F	again we tried to order an item from escapade and paid the extra postage .
M	excellent service - quick , reliable , with the goods carefully_packed ( no matter_how oddly shaped they are ).
F	you emailed me on a saturday at 0am telling_me i had 00_hours to collect from the locker .
F	needed a spare_key for our tow_bar . and on googling found this site . really happy with price . not so happy with postage .
F	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
M	i entered an incorrect gas_meter_reading ( my fault ) upon submitting my first readings .
M	they clearly don_'_t give a damn . we had to find a solution ourselves .
F	rubbish company .
M	i have ordered from here several_times and all has_gone ok and now one delivery was meant to be delivered and never shown try to contact them via_email and still no response . so still no order has_been delivered
M	very quick , efficient , helpful service .
M	they were delivered by yodel , and came in a box .
M	i would used them again .
M	what about compensation for us changing our calendar twice for your convenience ?
M	been ordering from ocuk for years , but recently found that when things go_wrong with deliveries - the customer service goes down with it .
F	the print_space are fantastic .
M	on 0 occasions ( a week apart ) i was informed that the item had already been dispatched , and yet it never arrived .
M	chased again yesterday by email , received a sarcastic , short unhelpful email . basically telling_me it should arrive monday or tuesday .
F	this time when i got my car home and unloaded my luggage i went to put the folded - down seats back up and was a bit upset to find that someone had decided to put the seatbelts into the locks and this caused huge ridges in my seats .
M	compared more well_known_brands a bargain ;)
M	( everything every where ) thank_god i answered the door and not my wife who i got them for
F	very fast efficient service .
M	that '_s when amy and the wonderful customer service came to the rescue .
M	i bought an ipod_touch that was described as in excellent condition with no faults except a few scratches on the back only to find that the back camera is not working and on inspection there is evidence of water_damage and dried water marks beneath the screen .
F	apart_from that , they are fab .
F	excellent service , fast delivery , loved how the package came fragile and carefully handled .
F	she could find no record of initial booking or my subsequent email .
F	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
M	the email was answered the next_day ( 0th ) stating a representative would be assigned to my case .
M	the delivery was fast so i would be tempted to use them again but the free cutting is not an option .
M	i clearly hadn_'_t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
F	not only did they take my money the company initially partnered with wowcher on the deal also took my money on delivery costs .
F	no further update received .
F	customer service is the only_thing that will ensure survival in this climate .
M	i was happy that it was a name i had heard of , and i paid for the car by debit_card over the phone and i paid a little extra to reduce the excess .
M	i have used drink_shop for a number of years , and have always been completely_satisfied with the presentation ( often gifts ) and service .

F	what can i say if you have a pet and your looking for a fantastic , service , tips , products then look no further this place is the best !
F	just hoping she '_ll maybe share some with me :-)
M	in short , you can trust the company to deliver , but their choice of items to stock may be suspect .
F	the gift was perfect and to have the pen_engraved made the gift really special .
F	00 out of 00 have already_recommended you web_site to others .
M	best yet by far
M	we be checking myprotein . com to see if i can get better deals / service
M	i contacted them over the issue thinking it must be a mistake but was told the original price was a ' mega sale ' price for 0 days .
M	at around 00 : 00hrs the delivery still had not been made , so i phoned again .
M	finally they came back and told me my parcel was missing in transit ( read ' stolen ') who could have possibly taken it from a yodel delivery office ?
F	however as soon as the company got the business they weren_'_t really interested in providing any further customer service .
M	i will_certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre '_s in the future . my friends will be receiving the same advice .
M	however , the delivery was quite slow especially as one of the items i ordered was ' in stock ' - i '_m assuming that it was held back until the other item in the order became_available which was fine but would have been good to have been advised of this .
M	they ' re cheaper on all of the websites i '_ve looked on and my purchase was delivered 00_minutes early was packed well and nothing was damaged would recommend affordable_supplements to all my friends and family .
M	shockingly_poor level of service , the worst i have had in over 00 years of online shopping .
M	my wife still uses 00 .
F	i only knew because i had bought them before from a different supplier .
M	i politely_declined their free usb pack as i didn_'_t wish to feel obligated to buy from them , though they sent one anyway with the assurance i ' d not receive any other unwanted emails or marketing .
M	i would have no_hesitation in using blackcircles again and have recommended them to several friends and relatives .
M	but just be careful when they call you to try sell you upgrades , i often get called from vodafone asking if i want to upgrade , when they really mean ' buy a 0nd line and pay for both '.
F	i cannot_fault the service i received .
F	of time due to the inefficiency of all of the above .
M	cheers
F	having made my reservation via the rentalcars website i rang to confirm that i would be able to pick_up my car using a debit_card as i don_'_t travel with a credit_card .
F	i recently_purchased two pine single_beds from firstfurniture and found the service fantastic , the delivery was swift and as stated , the beds were very easy to put_together and excellent quality . i found the beds were the cheapest on ebay and i would highly_recommend this company for any of your furniture needs ,
F	the articles are good and ballanced .
F	simplelighting had well priced products but , not only that , we also wanted warm_white low_energy illumination and that is what they had to offer .
M	ordered my costume just before 0pm and it was delivered the next_day before 00am , couldn_'_t ask for better service .
F	customer service really is 0_star , all the staff are very helpful and courteous , however i have only given it 0_star due to the problems i had with my order and it being out of stock and the amount of money i have spent on hone calls £_00 which i am very annoyed about .
M	buy from these_guys !
M	it pulls a lot stronger in second now and in - gear standing acceleration from 0k revs is a lot better - perfect for overtaking on the motorways without having to work the gearbox too much .
F	so a mixed experience but it doesn_'_t fill me with confidence if i ever have to claim .
F	friendly and efficient service with a bit of poetry thrown in .
F	thank_goodness for john_lewis they had the item at the same price and did not charge for delivery .
M	jeez !
F	would def recommend
F	!
M	they haven_'_t even removed the product from their website .
M	i have not used garden_xl before but certainly will in the future .
F	quick delivery .
F	when i emailled this to the company i was asked to send photograghs which i could not do because i had to clear the floor up straight_away i thought this was a strange request under the circumstances
M	it appears they are very poor at refunding your money , although they seem to be able to extract it from your account quickly enough .
M	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire car experience ”.
F	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
M	do yourself a favour and stay clear of this scam and rip_off website , i '_ll be cancelling my membership as soon as possible and chalk it up to a lesson_learned .
M	excellent products and service .
M	no_problems and would highly_recommend .
F	fab service and an excellent costume , thanks

F	i was very pleased with the service and payment and i would defo sell any other phones i had to ur company , the money was in my bank within_0days which i was very pleased with
M	my product arrived the morning after the next_day .
F	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
M	we wanted to visit lisbon for a short_break and as our son lives in nyc this seemed too good to miss .
M	i checked my account while still on the phone to find this was not the case .
M	the flowers arrived as promised but did not look amazing , there was no water left in the pouch they were transported in and some of the flowers looked withered already .
M	and all the rest of it .!!
F	i gave them a call to explain and was reassured that they would use the prescription to find my details so not to worry .
M	delivered on time - excellent communication , excellent service .
M	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave_me another number to call , not all bad . could have just been me !
F	as advised i checked the garden_shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
M	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
M	just took the food back to the depot and it looks as though they ' re going to attempt a pointless second delivery .
M	i decided enough was enough and wrote to the md mr simon_betts of proridermobility as this was a complete nonsense and i did not take kindly to the bullying_tactics of this md simon_betts .
M	so was i ,
F	found made . com by mistake when cruising around internet looking for trendy furniture for my home - what a find !
F	how did i finally get it through ?
M	bought an item from their hyde store online .
M	thank_you .
M	not trying to play a gilt trip here because they never really work but please could you try your best to get bakugan defenders of the core psp game in stock , if this is at all possible you will knock [_link_] my favourite online store right off its pedal - stool .
M	owners left us a transferable 00 year gurantee for them .
F	it arrived quickly so was very impressed
M	other than an offer to look into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
F	so if i '_d ordered the 00 it would '_ve definitely been too small :-)
F	please try and sort_out these problems with these shops ( ie .
F	thankyou petmeds !
M	i would recommend anyone buying from this company if you are looking for safety_signs .
F	normally i have to make a special visit to buy brushes from a dental hospital but in future i '_ll definitely be buying directly from dentocare .
F	excellent quality products and the sunglasses were probably my favourite part !
F	the quality of the frames were fantastic and one pair were better quality than a £_000_+ pair he had recently_purchased at a local_opticians .
F	tuesday '_s email said it would arrive between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00pm .
F	i ordered the flowers very close to mothers_day and was so surprised that it was free delivery on that day as most other_florists charged an extortionate_amount for delivery .
M	the worst customer service i have ever known and very misleading on prices .
F	there was a scrum then to get on the next bus in the rain .
M	now i will probably have to wait another 0 months to see if this works .
M	budget lines are always " sold out " and the comparative products are far too expensive .
M	i '_ve bought from tyre_shopper before , finding they offered the best prices .
F	the booking and confirmation system was simple and quick .
M	no christmas spirit from them .
F	have already_recommended to 0 friends for use in the future .
M	might be alright to all you geeks , but to me at 00 its all gobbledegook , it is so complicated , to make a complaint about something they havnt done , as in miss bugs , first of all you have to run a scan of some kind then download it to their site , then wait for a sarcastic reply , and after all that , absolutely nothing .
F	my advice : dont order if you need it soon .
F	the 00fit elite tennis / golf elbow strap was of high_quality , very comfortable to wear and supportive and effective in helping his condition .
M	no one picked me up at the airport , the operator at phone was very unpolite , the operator [_private_data_removed_] at the desk not very proffesional and the service with the car was an incubus . never again ok car .
M	i get the impression that this unit at sometime was a reject and certainly not to the quality of the units shown in the online pictures .
F	more companys should have this service .
F	i found it quite moving to piece it back together .
M	overall an impressive service that i am happy to recommend !
M	second ( replacement ) arrived promptly and in one piece .
M	very good site , excellent communication . its just a pity the flowers couldn_'_t live up to the expectation .
M	i was initially concerned when a day after i placed my order they telephoned me to say the 0000 model i had ordered was no_longer available but they could supply the 0000 model at an additional_cost .
M	one very happy son .
F	the service i received for a very small order was outstanding .
M	if anyone ever needed a company to recommend for this specific item then this company is the one bang on
F	i placed an order on 0st_november .
M	oh and delivery men fill in their own feedback questionnaire and then just get you to sign it and tell you it '_s part of the paperwork that needs to be signed .
M	swift , reliable and went beyond the call of duty to ensure that i was sorted .
F	service was great and shoes delivered quickly with good updates however wrong_size was delivered and the company was at fault otherwise 0_stars would have been given !
M	i would recommend him and the company 00 out of 00
M	i closed my account with talk_talk and yet they still kept billing me - despite_numerous complaints .
M	after having worked from city - link for a number or years , i understand how important it is for your delivery company to deliver the consignment on - time and if it is not on - time , there must be some way for the customer to receive information about what has happened to the consignment .
F	flowers were nice but delivery let the company down .
M	with them for just 0 months and would never ever use them again and would certainly never ever ever ever recommend them to anyone !
M	they do not have clue and i have just spent my £_000 order with jjb .
F	very disappointed !!
F	( i . e loss of speech / crossed lines , interference etc : at times the calls just cut of randomly .
F	you did exactly_what you said you would , when you said you would and at a great price .
M	i have ordered with them before , and even their free standard delivery was very quickly dispatched .
M	i was kept " on hold " for 00_minutes using an 0000 number and when i got through to an adviser was told the courier couldn_'_t find me .
M	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it ’_s only gone_wrong once .
F	this site is very user_friendly , the delivery time is very quick and the delivery team very efficient .
F	will_definately purchase more
M	in short , avoid !
M	the guy_who promised to come_back to me has also disappeared now .
M	took well over 0 days to get payment , a good service but not 00_hrs
F	had to make a special trip to kingston and pay parking and petrol to change as no time before christmas to sort_out .
M	what more can you ask for ?
M	the surgery was at manchester which was brilliant .
F	one very happy sister in law who could not wait to get on the phone to tell me how beautiful her flowers were .
F	it doesn_'_t account for 00_yr olds who are easily confused and easily led .
F	the guy_who fitted the tyre was really professional but friendly .
M	very very poor service .
F	now the only_thing that i '_ll order from them is flowers !!!!
F	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
F	i will certainly use them again and recommend to friends .
F	and i would stay away from both of them !
F	was very impressed only took a few_days and was here and the quality is fab would defiantly recommend partyrama to any one of my friends and family .
M	still_waiting for delivery ordered 00nd_march no notification that the purchases were out of stock monies taken from bank 00th phoned twice expecting call_backs to advise when order would be available if out of stock still_waiting not impressed expect will get purchases when least expect it and will have to run around chasing for delivery if delivered and i am not at home come on get your customer service in order does not take 0 mins to lift up the phone as bt says its good to talk //////////////////
F	the whole festive_lights buying experience was faultless , from ordering to delivery ( which was incredibly quick ) and i will certainly recommend this company to others and use them again myself .
M	well_done , fantastic customer service .
M	john
M	they took all of my documents and then hassled me to sign a credit agreement .
F	hassle_free service , easy to use web_page
F	please can the propper flowers be sent to my mother .
M	no chat at all , looked gutted about life in general !
F	i asked why it took so long - he said its not a priority .
F	i was reassured again they would be delivered before 0pm the following_day by royal_mail .
M	a great example of what good web - based suppliers can do .
F	these_guys were really helpful , kept me informed all way through the whole_process , quick and pleasing service and the products great !!!
F	glasses arrived quickly but didn_'_t look the same as the picture and i didn_'_t get a glasses cloth .
F	has_been a bit of a hassle trying to return it as the post_office will not accept any sprays , but once we contacted the correct people , they said they were quite happy to pick it up , although it is now over a week and we still have it ?
F	the bouquet was disappointing .
M	threshold for free delivery was quite high so if additional materials needed then these would work out quite expensive once delivery added .
F	i received it quickly and it was packaged well .
M	i am only on my second month with plus net and i '_m on my third fault .
M	sent ipad for repair to oxford - signature obtained for po receipt
M	my email enquiries were answered within 00_hours , vat refunds within 00_hours , can '_t praise them enough .
F	e . stannard
M	i don_'_t think that i could have got better service .
F	easy to place order , quick delivery and informed all the way through the process
M	it was doddle to fit ( not needing a major boiler dismantle , as the ravenheat manual said .
M	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave_me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
F	would recommend the resort if you want quiet place to recharge but not very touristy for the kids .
F	when i got the set no walnut veneer - just what looks like bog_standard wood .
F	good website , beautiful flowers at an even better price and kept_informed_throughout the whole delivery
F	get buying !
F	out of curiosity i went to see if it was still renewable , saw it in my panel still , clicked link to see all my renewable domains ( including those recently expired ) but this one wasn_'_t there .
M	will always choose southend_airport if flights are available from it .
M	i then said i wanted to cancel my account and was asked to confirm my full name and dob , i did that and then was asked for my postcode and one other piece of info .
M	one to avoid 0 / 00 .
M	i '_m mad like that .
F	after four days the order status was still at " processing ".
F	as other reviews showed huge problems getting a refund , i decided to keep it , if / when it arrived .
F	i was disgruntled to say the least .
M	i '_ve emailed and requested callbacks and no response .
M	however i did find out from a work_colleague that he brought 0 tickets from a different site and got them at half the price i paid .
M	jo harris
F	the quality of the bags is 000_% and i would not_hesitate in using them again - 000_% perfect !
F	unfortunately as time went on the opportunity to win the occasional good prize reduced and so , when i started i would occasionally get all the wilds and now it is impossible - not happened for more than three years .
F	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
M	he cannot help me and says i need to speak to manager .
F	we called saturday_morning and were told to expect to call back monday as no one could help on a weekend .
M	i am furious and insulted and will tell everyone i speak to what a dreadful service this company provides .
M	went t back to tesco for my next pair
F	i was very excited , so we both decided to stay in and wait for them .
F	would defo use this company again for future_purchases . well_done !
M	just brought a new strimmer from tooled_up , on line . special deals on , good discounts .
M	they not only have the best prices on internet but they are also backed by one of the best customer_care team .
F	be wise to take_advantage of offers .
M	great experience from beginning to end .
M	had to send them back which was fairly easy .
F	many_thanks .
F	poor service !
M	my reply > to alpharooms reply_below
M	tracking was easy online too , so i could see where my parcel was at all times .
F	i wish there was an offer of zero_stars as that '_s all this shambles of a company is worth .
M	recently ordered some ram with next_day delivery .
M	nothing yet .
M	i have attempted on seven occasions to trade books with this company .
M	not satisfied with the delivery if indeed it is going to be delivered .
F	the packaging on the sausages was damaged , but luckily the meat was ok .
M	was informed soon after my order about one item being out of stock , i was told a return date and it would be deliver soon as it was back in , maybe items should show it '_s not in stock at check out , still_waiting on items but should arrive soon , delivery was quick .
F	i needed some ink quickly , so i gave printer_basics a try and was very glad i did .
F	i would definitely use them again .
M	lovely_flowers the wife_loved them
M	for common batteries check supermarket prices and then those at battery_force .
M	!
M	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct_0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
F	on this occasion the picture on the website compared to the delivered item was disappointing .
F	in this day and age things should be despatched the next_day if not the same .
F	i found prince0 slightly difficult to maneuver especially when required to refer to manuals / learning aides etc .
M	it was a very quick service the money was in my bank with in 00 , finally a company that does what it says on the tin .
F	service was ok quick boarding and ship was fine , however the toilets were disgusting , the children '_s play_area was broke ( we had to tuck a bit up out of the way so the children didn_'_t strangle themselves ), false_advertising in the duty_free shop i thought a bottle of perfume was good value for money after_seeing the tester bottle being the larger one only to find it was for the smaller one - with no option to buy the next size up .
M	do not !!!
F	very poor service , would definitely by recommend and will not use again .
M	having posted my review at the beginning of january_0000 , my father received a telephone_call out of the blue from the general_manager at proridermobility .
M	it was frustrating as i had wrapped the item in bubblewrap , sponge foam , cardboard and covered in plastic_wrapping so thinking it would be delivered in perfect_condition but it was obviously manhandled .
F	not the cheapest , but can you put a price on paradise .
F	very pleased with all my purchases .
M	a missing cashback_claim lodged has not yielded any fruit .
M	simply_electronics will not do this and keep asking me to wait and see if the phone turns_up !!!
M	have phoned and emailed , no reply , no confirmation , no idea where i stand with this booking !!
F	i regularly send workers to my friends in zante for the stray pups they save and rehome overseas , so cost is a big consideration !
F	despite chasing them several_times it eventually turned_up , then they promised to refund the premium i paid for next_day delivery
F	delivery was good .
M	also , we ' d had emails from mattress online telling us to inspect the mattress before accepting delivery too and the delivery guy was visibly annoyed when my wife wanted to take a moment or two to inspect the mattress before signing for it .
F	it seems odd to get an_email to confirm that i have just signed for delivery , but issues reported to the help_desk do not create progress emails .
M	i then had to wait to the monday to bombard them with emails to finally get a response as i was getting very annoyed !
F	perfect .
M	when my order arrived poorly_packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn_'_t very happy !
F	i had not received notification of this so i sent an_email to customer_services as the phone line had closed .
F	eventually checked his junk_mail and there was one from a company called bookout informing him of a change to hotel as marco polo overbooked .
F	took a week for my lenses to come through the post , was too late for me by then as i had an_emergency situation to use them for .
F	after a few emails and a phone_call to do this , i got confirmation by post - of a change of address . not that my device had changed .
M	thanks
F	i will never use nombox again , and even now not sure i will see my items .
F	after such a traumatic event the last thing i needed was a saleman to tell me i didn_'_t love my only remaining family_member .
F	bad customer service , passing the buck , etc .
M	if i could be_bothered to shop around , i ' d probably get a better deal .
M	keep it up guys !
M	when i told_him we were never told this and infact his own online literature makes no reference to erp and claims self implementation is an option and only warns that it will take you longer .
M	the price looked straight_forward until i got to the end , then there were a number of add - ons which were not mentioned earlier , such as a booking_fee ?
F	as usual i left my prize giving trophy situation right till the last_minuet .
M	i have used the cartridge_shop for my advent cartridges a number of times and to date have found them excellent
M	?
F	i will be a regular customer as it makes my life so much_easier , thanks
F	i have now waited over 00_mins so far and have not got through .
F	so what about all the money i have paid weekly in debt ???
F	the fire_alarm going at at half 0 in the morning was just great .
F	mats arrived very quickly and were exactly as_described .
M	the outward_journey was fine , apart_from being initially dropped at a hotel in hurghada instead of el gouna - i needed to call the number provided on our paperwork and ask them to send the driver back to pick us up !
F	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn_'_t want people to experience the same thing .
F	i spent £_000 . 00 on two tickets which in fact cost £_00 . 00 each !
M	we booked a meet and greet service and all i can say that it was excellent service .
F	after_reading bad_reviews i am sceptical i will ever get them .
M	the flowers look average and certainly not worth £_00 .
M	at this rate it will have to be a refund shame
M	suggestion , check your facts before sending terse emails .
M	after having a good experience online with national , the online person was polite and quick with responses i went into national to have 0 tyres_fitted .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	they did however say that i could increse my tarrif .
M	no questions , no_hassle , no change to the advertised payments on their website .
F	i needed to get a new iron really quick but didn_'_t want to pay too much so i found the ne i wanted on line and ordered it .
M	it has enabled_us to connect to and help more people in the community .
F	this site is interested in what the customer wants , and as it has changed or added to its stock i have changed my regular order .
F	however , all quickly and efficiently done and the phone is now operable again .
M	good service
F	i '_d also want to speak with someone there to confirm they can deliver as suggested .
F	then she said bear with me and phone cut_off again !
M	they dont like you wating more than a few minutes .
M	never again .
M	the costumes were awesome !!
M	my order was delivered extremely quickly .
M	first_class service at very good prices .
M	also can '_t give a delivery slot until the day before delivery .
F	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer service , i finally decided to switch to another_provider .
M	it arrived in good time and was a fair price so all in all i am well pleased .
M	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
M	0 %_discount offered by steve on email did not apply to toad park which i have booked
F	sorry that you thought that the delivery would be faster .'
M	returned it that same day for a refund . decided to buy localy so that i can see the quality .
M	it all went to plan and my family could plan their life around this . perfect !
F	i may just take delivery times with a pinch of salt .
M	in my mind why do we have to pay the same for a download as they real thing .
M	fully recommended .
M	the parcel rates seem to be in line with other_companies .
M	terrible !
M	i did not recieve an email with a reply and the items were not checked properly as they state that they double_check all the products they receive and give a new pricing .
M	they don_'_t deserve to survive .
F	first they told me it was out of stock , then i was told the delivery men ' lost ' my bed , then the most hilarious excuse ever , i was told there ' wasnt enough room for it on the van '!!
F	then got an_email_saying it was out of stock .
M	rubbish service .
F	if the deal i '_ve paid for comes with champagne i expect champagne not sparkling_wine .
F	no_hidden_extras .
M	also , the price was lower_than competitors .
M	anyone looking to treat their pet should use viovet instead of getting_ripped of with some vets prices for their animals welfare .
F	i was concerned that once i '_d send my mobile off to you that the price would suddenly change and i '_d be in a clause ( like some other services have attempted with friends and family ) but there wasn_'_t .
M	they don_'_t like the fact you bring insurance but they can '_t say no when you have the documents there .
F	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
M	i will_definitely use them again .
F	no response or explaination .
F	completely_incompetent and unreliable !
M	i hate to say that as they use to be very good .
M	many_thanks
F	really good range & the service was the best i had experienced in a long time , knew_exactly when it was going to be delivered .
F	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it '_s a very low ticket item .
M	0_weeks still not received the kit , rang up and eventually got an answer and was fed some story and that the kits were going out any day .
M	delivery was quicker_than predicted for the selscted first_class post .
M	they didn_'_t .
F	i am_furious .
M	really easy , sent my ipad on thursday had the money in my bank wednesday_morning , seems much_quicker_than alternative companies and a much_better price , deffinetly recommend .
F	out of the 0 orders i have placed with them all have had bits_missing / wrong items etc
M	very happy with quality of trophies , delivery and service top rate too
M	i ' d be happy to recommend click_fragrance .
M	thank_you so much
F	super_fast delivery even_though it '_s free_postage , their prices are competitive , you would be mad not to use them !
M	so , unless they are only 0 . 0 meters long each then the specification quoted is not correct .
M	switch to someone_else while you can folks , because there won_'_t be a first_utility left by the time i '_ve finished with them .
F	next_day got an_email_saying item was not available and to choose another .
F	the product was great and there was no_problems at all .
F	they are good value for money , but it would be nice for it to be a bit cheaper .
M	regretably one of the weights were damaged .
M	but they have lost the original reason they set it up in the first place .
M	when we are building specific , theme - based layouts , flexibility in what we can purchase and combine together is important .
M	00h after_placing the order , the tracking on dpd listed my order as [ nc ] - non conveyable , so i contacted tyreleader and they told me to ignore that and the courier '_s had a weird sense of humour and they were right !
M	it '_s been a month since i '_ve contacted customer server and i '_ve still not received a code .
M	having placed the order the estimated delivery times were 0_weeks which would have been great as we were away on holiday for 0 days .
F	fortuantely i was not in a hurry to acquire these otc medicines , however i am not sure to ask you any request in case i need them with more urgency .
F	before my purchase was delivered i rang you to say i would like to purchase a more_expensive model however [_name_] informed me there was nothing she could do for me as the fire had gone to distribution surely you could have done something to stop the delivery . my telephone_call to you was on the saturday and the fire was not delivered till monday
M	it was a breeze to build my desired sign .
M	product itself is fine and 000_% as_described and expected .
M	i get information and advice when i need it , and a rapid transfer of funds .
F	i bought a sub_standard ben 00 camera for my son and when i realised how poor the quality was , i tried to return it .
F	this is very early stages , but the douglas small sofa_bed will suit our needs perfectly & we are delighted with the product design , size , colour , comfort & quality .
F	i didnt get an_email to say they had recieved the phone , or to say it had passed_testing , when i logged_into my envirofone account i did see all of this but i think as a busy person you should email these things just as peace of mind really !
F	will definitely use again !
F	driver needs a better attitude .
M	a fast and efficient service .
M	frustrated i read their reviews , which are rather saddening .
F	they were beautifully_wrapped , but fortunately i decided to open the box to check them .
F	but i do like the fact you can design your on pizzas !
F	0_days of use and the fabric split .
F	i know it is not my computer either .
M	i will be back .
M	immediate_dispatch
F	and it didnt cost a fortune - much happiness .
M	their service and delivery is excellent so i have no reservation in recommending to you .
F	i was so excited_about ordering the buggy and was really pleased that it would be delivered straight_away and now i '_m just really disappointed and frustrated and panicking that its not going to arrive in time for baby .
M	i would recommend world first travel to anybody , we have always had excellent service in the past and will_continue to use them .
M	well they ' d better .
M	good all_round and got item fast just what i wanted and quick to acknowledge that item dispatched , great service .
F	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn_'_t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
F	my biggest complaint is the packaging of an ipad_air costing_£_000 . 00 .
F	used this service for a number of years .
F	super pleased with the nets i ordered for mum , much_better value than anything i could find in the shop .
M	thanks craig
M	a very easy site to buy from .
M	tanker arrived at 0 on tuesday_morning , which for us was a surprise but perfect_timing !
M	:)
M	i would recommend to all .
F	lots of love ,
F	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
F	fast and efficient delivery
M	00_hours_later my number is transferred . but guess_what . the credit wasn_'_t !
M	i was a bit_anxious ordering currency online and having it delivered , however i needn_'_t of been .
M	although the service was friendly and very helpful , unfortunately the car was not supplied in a condition that i would consider safe .
M	a decent size for the group that we had staying .
F	it is an amazing juicer and one of the brilliant things about it is how easy to clean it is !
M	a lot of business '_s think they give good service but all to often they fall down in one or another area but with red_dog they clearly understand the meaning of alround service if
M	i have used serenata_flowers quite a few_times .
F	don_'_t use dhl
F	i had a couple of problems with my last set of glasses and they emailed me a return_label and speedily fixed the problem .
M	an excellent service all_round
F	delivery was great , " i was a bit_worried " but after_speaking to the staff i was happy and would order again and again without_delay .
F	i so wish i never started on that journey with this supplier .
F	this company is not one of them !
M	flexible to meet customer needs and if things don_'_t go to plan they put it right with a minimum amount of inconvenience to the customer .
F	the only_slight down_side was there was no update on delivery , would have been good to know when it was dispatched so i knew when to expect them .
F	i have been using parcel0go for about a year now using either my hermes or tnt depending_on the length of the item i wish to send .
M	now i '_m no logistics expert , but even i can work out that if you have a challenging access , then fewer deliveries are better .
F	i would advise anyone buying a car on finance to check this out otherwise you may be paying for 0 years interest on £_00 rfl and £_00 worth of petrol .
F	i '_ve tried_ringing once but they weren_'_t very helpful .
F	i found book to view thoigh skyscanner website havent_heard of it begore then but got the besy price for hotel and sent confirmation straight_away with directions to hotel along with other nearby attractions etc will use again !!
F	it was exactly_what i was looking for following the recommendation on their web_site regarding blinds for a kitchen .
M	however , the jacket does not give the appearance of being worth eighty odd_pounds , but i suppose everyone who now purchases nike equipment will have to make a substantial contribution to rory '_s 00 million .
F	i was told they would try and access marc '_s email and try and get the order to me by 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	i live on my own so i had to wait a few_days till someone came to visit me .
F	if it is to say thank_you there should unlimited time to use it as you don_’_t always have the money to buy something_else straight_away .
M	ha , and yodel ' chat ' online .
F	i have just had my finances sorted with the help of harrington brookes . although i am satisfied with the outcome i feel as if i have been down a fast flowing river which i could not stop . i cannot always think of questions on the spot and i cannot_afford to make too many calls as i only have a mobile phone .
M	excellent service .
M	the order arrived within 00_hours and we set to work assembling the racking .
M	they rang back .
F	no .
F	the ukelele i ordered arrived promptly , ahead of eta .
F	i was really happy with the price , i was even surprised because i got £_00 .
M	but i '_m not re - ordering from physioroom .
M	i would recomened tho .
M	could not fault speed of delivery but item was damaged .
M	this was one of the selling points on the website .
M	it was not until i emailed you that i was aware of parcelforce '_s cack - up , a cack - up still not rectified .
M	well_worth a passing on to mates .
M	sent my iphone off , within 0 day they checked the phone and paid .
F	i '_ve had a few comments about how pretty the bag is , it '_s really eye_catching .
M	if an item is not in stock they keep me updated about progress and delivery still is made within a few_days .
M	excellent service as always
F	on 00th_november i placed an order with this company , then received an e_- mail the following_day , to say the items were out of stock , and asking if i wanted to wait_until they were in stock .
F	the customer service is appalling .
M	very nice to experience superb customer service from_start to finish - goods on time - accurate - quality - thanks
M	even they can find the house !
F	i ordered online and expected to get an_email_telling_me when i could collect from store .
M	to be completely fair though , this was stated with the order and was not a surprise - but is still pps .
F	before i ordered i had spoken with the office a couple of times and felt comfortable dealing_with them .
M	poor customer service .
F	annoying now i have an odd set !!!!
F	this item was dispatched super quick very happy with my purchase would recommend this company
F	what a great customer_relations policy .
F	item arrived day after order .
F	finally my parcel arrived at 0 . 00_pm on that night but i believe that if i hadn_'_t called them it would not have arrived .
M	i have never been let_down by uw . and even_though i probably get on their nerves from time to time , i only ever get courtesy .
F	it should be delivered to my work address and i '_m now on annual_leave for a week so have had to buy another supply of dog_food .
F	but due to our lack of knowledge with this type of thing , we thought we needed an upgrade kit to get the camera to pan up and down , so we ordered the upgrade kit for it that evening .
M	beware the premium phone line .
F	good piece of equipment , free delivery , easy set_up , does the job very well !
M	other problems i '_ve had in the past include - ignoring rescheduled delivery dates after a card has_been left , arranging to collect from depot then they stick it on the van so it '_s not at the depot when i turn_up , do not answer phone , lying about leaving two cards and returning goods to sender .
F	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
M	ordered items .
F	really good value .
M	pity eh_?
M	i then ordered online , it arrived 0 days_later .
M	- poor office conditions .
M	i received confirmation when i had bought the product .
F	now lets see what_happens : (
F	in addition to the high_quality range of products , the service is fantastic .
M	so £_000 spent and i '_ve flogged it all cheap via local ad to just get_rid of it .
M	i highly_recommend them .
M	eventually spoke to someone_who seemed more competent who_apologised for the mess that had been made by someone '_s simple mistake - and he reiterated we would receive a final_bill in january , we should ignore the letters and of course our details would under no circumstances be passed to any debt_collectors as it was clearly a mistake made that they had made lots of notes on and would acknowledge every painstaking call for at_least 00 - 00_minutes a time trying to sort_out .
F	will let you know what_happens .
M	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
F	appreciated the email status_updates .
F	i paid less_than half the price that i paid the month before at the vet .
M	the order was easy to place and the follow_up contact was good .
F	very pleased with the ordering and delivery process .
F	this was the first time i have had the need to use a courier parcel collection service , and having_searched online , interparcel gave the cheapest quote .
M	i was given a tracking_number in an email but when i entered this number on the tracking page at the comet website it gave_me a 000 " page not found " error .
M	ordered online , quick to reply after order was placed .
M	we looked for a specific wine .
F	great service
F	i guess i have to write a letter to the head_office although i already have spent hours trying to sort this out with the branch .
M	i said front_doorstep will be fine ( secluded house ) they said they couldn_'_t do that .
M	high_quality matched with the lowest_prices makes shopping here enjoyable
M	i would not recommend this service to family or friends .
M	delivered very quickly and all included in the price !
M	the unit was brand_new and as we did not have a use for it we decided to send it sell it through many of the recycling_sites out there .
F	( id_0000000 )
F	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i '_ve had no repsonse back in ages !
M	first they fail to deliver , but pretend they did .
F	sometimes great but sometimes they take the cash and for some reason haven_'_t dispatched the order until i chase it a week_later .
F	im really grateful for there time and advice !
F	thank_you for an excellent service !
F	however dear friends , guess_what !
M	unbelievable , i would never deal with this company again and i advise everyone to stay well away .
F	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look into the problem and get back to you .
M	i would far prefer to pay a little_bit more for a local service .
F	i went to pay for it and it said my session had timed out and then when i searched it again , surprise it was more_expensive !
F	job was completed within the next hour but i had to race off to hair dressers .
F	i eventually dealt_with the matter over the phone and resolved the change in the order .
M	the car was not clean , " goldfish " and other food on the floor .
F	i phoned kershaws back to let them know what a poor service the delivery company were giving , the guy at kershaws was understanding and polite and said they would try to improve their service .
F	the delivery has normally been within the 0 hour_slot .
M	if you had some gadgets that you do not use anymore or you have updated something don_'_t bother with ebay and dealing_with time_wasters use cash in your gadgets , great service
F	so i '_ll get less selling_privately .
M	shipping was on time so no_complaints on that side .
M	fantastic price , fantastic product , fantastic delivery time , fantastic service - so in one word : fantastic !
F	all my orders arrive within a couple of days and the quality products available at 0 for the price of 0 is excellent value for money
F	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
M	soreee - need to change your labels .
M	ordered pedal set for a porsche 000 no mentioned when ordering that there would be a delay for 0_weeks for item .
F	will not_hesitate to recommend you .
M	confirmation was quick and the actual number given did track the parcel .
M	they are responsible for managing the estate - and it '_s allegedly managed by a ' director ' ( so he told me !
M	if items had labels facing outwards ( and packets not squashed ) when box was opened all contents would be directly on show it would have been a far better experience
F	instead i had to send them back for refitting and got them a week_later .
F	so far i have not heard or received anything .
F	kiltmakers , when i contacted them about this , tell me they use this method to be ecological and meet targets - well with electricity used at this end , not to mention time and effort , coughing and tissues used i can_assure them that there has_been no savings here !
M	although my eye_sight has_improved 000_% i still after 00 weeks require drops because of irritation , overall experience is positive though
F	sales in othr shops now passed , so will pay an extra premium to change to a more reliable company .
F	of course nobody called back and have had no refund .
F	i searched the internet and read some of the reviews and thought they are a good company to go with to sell my ipad they quoted me a good price , then i sent it via_royal_mail special delivery costing_£_00 i then received an_email_saying it had been requoted when i checked it was for half the amount of the original_quote !!
F	i then tried to arrange for me to collect from their depo - the phone number on the card was wrong , when i managed to get the right number , i was told the parcel number was also incorrect .
M	ordered 0 new tyres online
M	if i hadn_'_t contacted them , who_knows when i would have received either lenses or any contact from them .
F	i still_waiting prob never get it back
F	a very unhappy ex customer !!!!!!!!!!!
M	they also increased the cost of my contract mid term .
F	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
M	mail to their suite 00 , liberty way , sunderland address was returned as " unknown " and we '_ve had no response to mail sent to their registered address .
M	n
F	the entire_process , from visiting the website and selecting my mobile_phones to receiving payment was extremely easy .
F	i '_ve never_heard of alpharooms before i stumbled_upon it during a search on the internet but would certainly be recommending this company and use then again .
F	no card had been posted through to tell me that the delivery had been left_outside .
F	then we drove out of the airport and realised the petrol tank was empty , it had been a quarter full at drop_off and dried coffee all over the dashboard from a spillage .
M	system is already up and running , thanks for the quick delivery and helpfull advice
F	thanks
M	a day later the watch was waiting for me once i got home , and absolute love it .
F	never arrange equity_release over the phone make_sure you speak face to face .
F	i was told that someone from the warehouse would be in touch on the 00th and i '_m still_waiting .
M	if they were just for me i might not have minded so much as the knives were not damaged , but as gifts they look a bit_tatty , like i found them rather_than bought them .
F	i was also given updates advising me of the ' hour and minute ' ( between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 ) and goods arrived in perfect_condition at 00 . 00 !!!
F	even after quoting the distance_selling regulations to them , they still refuse to do anything_else !
M	but only if you have bloody good tyres !
F	having complained at such mediocrity being allowed to exist in the human race , let_alone in a company that hands out drugs , and asked them to actually bother to do their jobs , i received a very rudely worded letter informing_me that my order had been cancelled because i '_d apparently hurt the precious feelings of whoever had to read my complaint .
F	i usually buy my train_tickets from first great western , but i switched to loco0 this time because i wanted to buy a civ ticket to ' london international ' to connect with my eurostar journey and protect me from any cancellations / delays affecting my onward jouney .
M	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky_+ offers , it '_s slow and the screen often blurs .
M	i enquired as to whether we would get our excess back if the warranty shop wouldn_'_t honour our claim .
F	i would like a bit more detail on size and fit too .
F	they were the same price , only we had the voucher for £ 0 discount . is this the reason_why we had less flowers ?
M	update_: i got my refund 0_weeks after i cancelled the order .
F	shoes described as white are in fact light cream and are narrower in width than usually made by ecco .
F	i ordered a coffee_table on the saturday_morning , received an_email by the time i got home , had it delivered by wednesday .
M	we first purchased compatible_inks from you for our lexmark_printer , which was a bit of a disaster , the colour on our children , s homework was dreadful with half of the colours not being there .
M	buymobilephones of course didn_'_t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it '_s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .
M	the delivery and customer service was excellent and no_complaints .
F	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
F	they are a great team .
M	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
F	will use again .
F	so all ok , so far yes .
M	perfekt and fast !!!!!
F	emailed them 0 times in that month and recieved automated_replies telling_me to wait longer .
M	i specifically_asked that the delivery driver phone me 00_minutes before he expected to make the delivery so that i could drive to the rental_property to take the delivery .
M	bought humming tops for my greatgrandchildren , they were delivered the day after order , with free_postage , the kiddywinks love them ,, great service .
F	the web - site is fairly basic , you cannot review / track your order once it is placed .
F	sadly i have used that company for years [ trouble free shopping ] i dont want the aggravation of rewrapping and reposting so they have lost one customer
M	manufacturer not retailer who i have contract with .
M	what are doing to ensure the tea is delivered ?
M	i love superdry products ( probably own more than 00 t - shirts , three jackets , four hoodies , etc and have been a customer since my first buy in london in 0000 ) but was slightly_disappointed with my recent_purchase .
F	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews but on this occasion i feel i must .
M	two months after leaving scottish_power i am still_waiting for a refund of the credit they owe me .
F	it looks fantastic on my decking .
F	when we arrived in florida to collect our car , they said that what we had paid for was a much smaller car and would not hold the luggage we had .
F	i choose an arrangement which did not have lilies as my friend does not like them but the flowers delivered had lilies , the amount of flowers delivered were less_than half of what was in the picture and the quality of some of the roses were not fresh had bad bis on petals .
F	right .
M	what i ordered was on next_day delivery and it did not arrive next_day .
M	i ordered it yesterday , it arrived this morning and i '_ve serviced the shower and it '_s now back in use again .
M	hence only 0_stars because of their disinterested customer_support
M	i then tried the same manoeuvre taking a faster run up but the same thing happened to me – stuck with no ability to go back or forward !!
F	bought some apparel from online store , and upon_checking on the parcel for more than 00 times i really had it with the last update . ' 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt ' - reattempt to what . deliver ?
F	seriously poor service .
M	they were the cheapest for my product as well !
F	would definitely recommend and will use again ourselves .
F	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
M	we went for the grandissimo option as this was the biggest and best option for the chosen flowers and on delivery we were exceptionally under whelmed with the bouquet .
F	but i placed an order the evening before but changed my mind .
F	instead , they '_d taped up a corner or two of the very badly_damaged boxes and shipped out regardless .
F	can '_t wait to get my first order !
F	i needed some items quickly on this order and so paid for the express delivery .
M	this is the 0th phone i '_ve sent to mazumamoble and the service is just amazin ,
M	estimate provided
F	there was no transparency on who i was renting the car from .
F	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
M	it passed more than 0_weeks , but my order is still not shipped !
M	but no where was there a notice to tell me what i should do with the ticket when i returned .
M	not only a very disappointed little 00 year_old xmas day , but when i notified ukisportimports by email immediately ( as instructed ) and called 00th_dec ( as no reply to email ) i was told very unsympathetically they couldn_'_t help .
M	if i would rate your company it '_s would be 0 .
M	if you are considering moving to these fraudsters .
F	not only did the flowers arrive without the card , the delivery man never rang the bell and just left the flowers on the door_step , one week_later i '_m still_waiting for customer_services to respond to my emails regarding this .
M	needless to say the goods arrived by recorded first_class post the very next_day .
M	still hungry .
F	however the initial impact of viewing the bouquet was not what i , as the sender , had hoped for .
M	took 0 phone_calls and i ended_up doing a conference_call with the hotel and lastminute . com to get a full_refund .
F	it '_s now friday and i have them .
M	great service , price and product
M	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
F	i was left with 0 / 0 of a bag .
F	would the likes of tesco etc , be allowed to do this ?
M	in the meantime - avoid this company like the plague !
F	zero_stars
M	may be orange will promote a payment of £_00 instead of £_00
M	size 00 was what was sent , which was clearly too small as soon as i tried on .
M	the positives are that payment is quick and communication is excellent .
F	very easy , very quick and payment made to my account without_any delays .
F	so , more phone_calls , more apologies , more messing_around generally , before the tiles finally arrived on 00st_january .
F	p_&_p was reasonable and it was much_cheaper_than going to the shops .
F	i was absolutly discusted with what this company provided it was nothing like what u ordered & when i tried to contact them the emails bounced_back & the telephone_number was not conected !
F	registered a complaint with customer_services ref no cc0000000
M	i now have to wait 0 - 0 days to get my money back .
F	as i knew the make of stick i wanted and the size the choice was easy , the fact that it was £ 0 cheaper_than elsewhere made it all the sweeter !
M	said he woul keep trying .
M	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
F	thanks for good , fast , efficient service .
M	i checked all my emails including the deleted / junk ones and all phones have an answerphone and there was nothing .
M	potential_clients would need to be reasonably fit to negotiate steep stairs to upper sections of the hotel .
M	!
F	it '_s monday_afternoon and the flowers still_haven_'_t been delivered ; the tracking_information hasn_'_t been updated since friday_evening .
M	bad - some legs only appeared sporadically on web_site , no amex , no ability to choose seats , not all fares available , it wanted to charge me more for my 00month old daughter !
F	no_problems with the order except the delivery .
F	it arrived in super - quick time , and the item is great - but £ 0 . 00 is way too much for delivery .
M	good price .
F	what is there not to like ?!
F	maybe they should just have an online enquiry service instead ?
M	i spoke to a different lady a few_days_later and she was even worst .
F	it arrived on the tuesday with no apology .
F	!
M	few_days_later received a full_refund saying transaction had been cancelled .
F	even_though i paid a year in_advance , i am still being charged monthly too !
M	i '_ve always been hesitant to take protein_shakes and the supplements for workouts as every time i '_ve tried them they taste worse than licking week old gym underwear but after being recommended the protein_works i thought i ' d try them .
M	i shall use again as and when the time calls for flowers !
F	a good deal .
F	emailed my cancellation as per the instructions given by them & within the 00 day cooling_off period ( 0_days in fact ), but they seem to be ignoring me , sending me emails about opening a case for my query .
M	as we said totally needs must .
F	smashing ' dead dorothy ' outfit which_resulted_in some really lovely compliments .
F	good quality towels though so will buy things in future - am_currently looking at the memory_foam_mattress , i missed the gel memory_foam_mattress deal !
F	easy to use website and helpful staff over the phone .
M	i am pleased with the watch .
F	went the extra_mile for you also very well priced .
F	the sioftware isn_'_t as easy to use as other photobooks i '_ve done and it took a bit of time to navigate my way around the programme .
F	i would recommend , in fact that what i did , and we are both satisfied with the service we received and the prompt delivery of the goods that we ordered .
M	*************************************************************************** hello ,
F	all she need to do was apologise and assure me that it would be looked into .
F	staff was well prepared .
M	the worst thing was the delivery - the drivers would make no effort to deliver to room - all that was required to manoeuvre was to remove doors to move - other_firms delivery firms have been helpful and assisted ( indeed another delivery firm delivering another item from a different form ultimately assisted getting the wardrobe_upstairs with little major effort or difficulty - i think a better delivery contractor is required .
M	they had 0 days to get them there , it wasn_'_t as if it was tomorrow !
M	i '_ve seen the numerous tv_adverts , and advertisements in . net magazine , so naturally thought they would be a good safe solid choice .
F	and have not received a reply let_alone an exchange or refund .
F	?
F	my experience with the order and samples was very good ( 0_stars ) but when when the order arrived this morning , the man refused to help me with the boxes to the house , leaving them on the road in front of the house .
F	they are brilliant .
F	hopefully see if jessops reads this to see if they contact me to arrange delivery of a new jigsaw tin ????
F	but although i gave strict_instructions on the order about delivery , my neighbours weren_'_t contacted and the parcel was taken to my nearest post_office .
F	despite me contacting them three_times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
F	where did i get them .
F	wish i had read these reviews before i placed my order .
M	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
F	the order was placed in the thursday_night for delivery the following_tuesday .
M	really good price , fitted to my mac_mini . made a big_difference to its performance . a quality upgrade !
F	it was far too tight .
F	good pram , excellent shipment service , next_day delivery
M	would throroughly reccomend .
M	so we ' re making it up then ?
M	at this point , i must give special_mention to dpd .
F	the next_day i emailed again , still fobbed_off .
M	same as above , not received the parcel yet after a week
M	overall the service vehicle and pickup was great
F	no phone_call was received .
M	even if they didn_'_t want the kit a reply at_least would have been courteous .
F	then the employees at windsor had to ask for our passes while standing in line and for some reason , your numbers and their numbers were not matching up causing us at_least a half hour delay .
M	its free !
F	i ordered some goggles from here that said " in stock " online .
M	yes this poor customer_care will cost you in the end .
F	how can so many errors be made every time ?
M	our last order is a fused mass of unusable capsules and as yet we have had no response from the supplier .
F	i had to go elsewhere to buy as by the time it did arrive the 0nd time i '_d already run_out of food !
M	as the process is not transparent at all , how am i supposed to be sure they are recycled and not sold on ?
F	the replacement pair turned_up at the wrong_address !
F	the service from this company is first_class i received my order to discover i had ordered wrong being a cross_stitch instead of a tapestry , i made a phone_call and was advised to return the item with details of the correct item required , i returned this on tuesday and recieved my replacement on the friday , i had a note written on the paperwork to advise me that a refund for the difference was being paid back into my card account .
F	the actual hen_do itself was amazing .
M	although their initial service in supplying the wheels was good their subsequent service is extremely poor in that they do not honour any sort of guarantee .
M	item payed for surely a receipt left would suffice ?
M	my recent_purchase was so easy to identify on line all questions were contained within the product description .
M	saved_myself a bundle of money over the years .
F	i have used other_companies before but nothing can beat the service we recewived from courierpoint .
M	all items received quickly and as_described .
M	i waited in all day .
F	i am now on the phone to scottish_power again !!!
M	however they then tried to knock the price down by nearly 00_% due to very minor_damage which was perfectly in keeping with the age / mileage of the car .
M	arrived as stated , they are now in our kitchen being admired_by all who visit .
M	uploaded files with profiles -, website worked - good
M	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i '_m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
F	i have to pay for scripts from my vet ; if they make out a prescription for a years supply of medication i don_'_t want it all delivered at once .
F	item received in time !
F	you may not be so lucky if yours is linked to your bank or your debit_card !
F	i was shaking once i had the door closed .
F	it gives you security .
M	there were about 0 or 0 in all .
F	we have literally saved thousands of pounds between us on glasses and prescription_sunglasses .
M	purchased a carpet , promise to deliver / fit before easter .
M	its now monday_night and still not received the rest of my order .
F	would definitely use again and will be recommending to my friends and family !
F	!
F	site quick and easy to use , items all in stock , they were packaged well and arrived quickly .
M	i would not recommend market money based on my experience .
M	well , what can you offer me ?
F	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
F	( no thistles ) the tulips started dropping petals the day after delivery so went in the bin .
M	five weeks_ago they banked my money and i '_ve received nothing .
M	there was absolutely no need for concern !
F	payed extra fr fast delivery and didn_'_t arrive on time
F	i placed an order with precious_little_ones on the 00st_december_0000 for an east_coast cot_mattress , i rang on the 0nd_jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
M	bravofly : " just book with a different company ."
F	arrive until monday i was a bit disappointed .
M	got a phone_call the day before delivery to inform_me they were not in stock ( they did not know until they went to load the van apparently ).
F	heard_nothing regarding the despatch so after 0_days i contacted them to see why i had heard_nothing .
F	although this time we only had 0 enquiries , none of which rentify called us about the only way i found out about them was calling and chasing all three occasions they didn_'_t know why i had not been called about them .
F	gold_star .
M	we assumed that , as the blind was described as having a pelmet , all the blind stowed behind it .
M	thank_you prestige_flowers i '_ll be back !
F	best phone_recycling service i have used .
F	simple , yet informative description .
M	recently_purchased a set of 0 solar_lights and upon putting out in the garden i found only three worked .
F	ordered 0nd lot of cards which were printed to my specifications .
F	wait too long for the shipment
F	cashback regularly doesn_'_t track , and if it does , is subject to months of delays .
F	ridiculous .
M	after 0 months i still have a useless tap and no money back .
M	not good !
F	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare . talk about blowing your_own trumpet .
M	found my tyre shpper experience to purchase tyres a very easy and simple process .
F	posted next_day .
F	the staff were always very helpful and friendly .
F	however they failed to mention that next_day delivery to such a place as the oil capital of europe was not a next_day delivery .
M	as a bit of a " pen geek " cultpens is ticks_all the boxes .
F	i would like a refund as i have had to buy more from a local_store ( costing double the price ) .
F	didnt_expect that at all absoloutley love them !
M	most sme '_s know with a business card you put on the front who you are and where you can be found and on the reverse what you do
M	items are sent out very quickly and well_packaged but what makes this company really stand out is the outstanding customer_support .
M	it '_s great if we are visiting a new city or town i scroll_through and read up on the nearest quality eateries .
F	havent needed the insurance yet as i have only bought it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	will gladly use them again .
F	getting insurance for your phone is really easy with protect your bubble just a few_clicks and its done fab
F	however , i will order from rajapack again as their products are great and i will assume that this delivery mishap was just a one off .
F	the box they came in was damaged , the flowers arrived with some damage and they didn_'_t look like the ones chosen on the website , they looked like something you can get in a petrol_station , cheap and nasty !
F	will_definately use again and would recommend .
M	thats the end .
M	then i got an email_telling the story of airport and customes delay but will be despatched the same day they receive it ( friday 00th ).
M	i am not sure this practise is even legal !?
F	this company were great .
M	all they want is for you to join facebook to reply to any company '_s remarks , have complained about it but they just don_'_t seem care !!!!
F	ordered a cowgirl outfit and two six guns - it arrived very quickly and was excellent .
M	delivery and follow_up not good enough .
F	the failure to deliver on time was due to computer problems , pity as i didn_'_t get the battery_charger i could not take my camera on holiday 0_* apart_from this technical glitch i found the product as_described , did the it was designed for & was a fraction of the price of other_suppliers products . 0_*
M	avoid this site is not very good either so_far on my 0th review but it keeps_crashing anyway
M	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
F	there was no message_telling_me that the curtains i had ordered were out of stock .
F	disappointed that your system cannot automatically determine whether a prescription is held by you or not .
F	it '_s really easy to scan them with the app & i dropped them off at my local shop for collection .
M	update 00 / 00 /_0000 - in response to dx_freight replay :
M	i had no one specific contact to deal with , i had no help with reviewing product options , i was not afforded a proof copy before putting in a bulk order of 000 and found the process broken and disjointed .
M	the ordering system was good and the price was right . the goods were satisfactory and as stated . but to offer 0 day special delivery over the christmas and new year period was a bit misleading . i was charged extra for it of course but was happy to pay if it could be done .
M	to date , we are on phone_call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
F	all in all , just too slow .
F	i didn_'_t want them them left out side , as it happens they found but much later .
F	cheaper tickets often available at or near venues , especially in london .
F	hi i have recived my order from you but they were the wrong_size and no_longer required i have sent them back by post and would be greatful if you would give me a full_refund thank_you pauline crawford
F	pretty but definitely not worth the money .
M	if they can '_t deliver here , they can '_t deliver anywhere .
F	a replacement was sent and delivered to the house next door ( despite someone being home ) and with no name on .
M	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
F	i sent a second email querying this and managed to get a reply_stating that they were acting in_accordance to their t &_cs to send me such a ridiculous revised_offer , at no point did they acknowledge the fact i asked for my device back .
F	great price , very fast delivery , will use again !
F	the time did not appear on my e_- mail till late morning so unfortunately i had to stay in the house and the time of delivery was between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 p . m .
F	i have to re - charge it maybe once a week but that is only because i vacuum up to 0 times a day !
M	delivery was confirmed by royal_mail the following_day .
F	happy with the price and transaction eventually , but should have experienced better service on the way .
F	the one hour delivery slot was really helpful and arrived exactly on time .
M	went back to feel good contact_lenses , who are great .
M	i would use black_circles again and have told loads of people about them and would recommend them to any one .
M	had a problem with one & called to report the problem .
F	somehow there should be a law against that type of pricing
F	could somebody please give me a call to discuss - thanks
F	thank_you for a first_class service .
M	!
M	only problem was they had increased in price by £ 0 a tyre in 0 days and the second order would not let mr use my tesco_club card
M	but the items were delivered on time after a problem with who pays customs at gatwick !
F	excellent service staff on phone very helpfull wide_range of products pricing very competitive
M	not helpful !
F	this fault occurs in both calenders .
F	i finished the conversation without a solution and feeling frustrated .
F	i had a contract with them for 0 years and i would never ever go back to them again .
F	i ordered an infant halloween_outfit for my 0 month_old_son who is no means small for his age .
F	really disappointed and rather cross as i am paying more for the three_days in the long_stay car_park in may than i am for parking a week in june in the silver_zone car_park !
F	and so are my appliances !
M	" you '_ll have to wait , can '_t you see we ' re busy ?"
F	took it to most local_store and was informed they couldn_'_t help , it needed to be returned by post .
F	this was finally resolved by the company who supply the watches directly with me .
F	0 *****
F	i '_m not happy that you didn_'_t ring me to tell me that the seat_belt went to the wrong_address .
F	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
M	when the delivery guy turned_up he dropped the box the flowers came in and getting it wet and damaging some of the flowers .
M	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
M	many_thanks
F	they informed me that they could suply me with different one but almost same specification and price .
F	very bad no refund still from 00th_march good luck to anyone_else do not order
M	i have placed 0 orders with charterhouse & thought the service was good however on my last order i received a damaged pump due to bad packaging ( the pump was placed in a box with 00kg of gravel with no protection ).
F	despite the fact they claimed the coverage at my home was perfect .
F	parcel_force were due to deliver on wednesday , then a note from them said they would deliver the following_day , but when i called at 0pm to find out whether they were going to deliver that day , i was informed that in fact the item had gone back to their depot , so we had to collect it from there .
F	i must have been mad to pay it , but i did .
F	my only_criticism would be that the head_band was too_big and non - adjustable .
F	the flowers lasted well and were excellently_priced .
M	it '_s just not worth the couple of euros you '_ll save
M	i then visited the site and found loads of vouchers which i could have used - it may explain_why this site is more_expensive than some others .
M	great prices , fast despatch and delivery
M	will use again .
F	the phone was really old and crap so was only worth £ 0 ( i think i paid £_00 for it ) and within about 0 mins of visiting the website it was all done and i was printing off the postage slip and sending the phone off .
F	very good website , excellent prices but not very good with choice of delivery options and speed of delivery
F	have been suggested to try flax seed oil but someone_else said bilberry supplements are better .
F	i had ordered something from another store online at same time and paid £ 0 . 00 for two day delivery with other store .
F	you can '_t get better service than that .
F	on trying to reschedule delivery / pick - up from depot with the reference_number on their card as advised , was told numerous_times by their website and their phone line that the reference_number was not recognised .
M	my nan was unfortunate_enough to get through and sign up and she '_s had problem after problem and also reports the customer service is lousy .
M	yes within 0 days was there reply .
M	the lights seem very good quality , but i didn_'_t order the plugs . and i remember seeing a reminder on your order form but that felt_like it was you trying to sell me soomething ( like an extra 0 year_warranty for a tv in comet ) and i blanked over it .
M	there are lots of ecommerce stores that actually care about their customers , so use them instead
M	as an_apology for all the inconvenience i have been credited £_00 to my expedia account for future travels . :/ but i can ensure you i will never be giving this company any of my money again !
M	!
F	so much_better_than queueing for hours in the post_office !
F	delighted with my sunglasses and also with the 00_%_off offer for first time customers .
M	will use against
M	apparently we were his first clients to travel with him when he set_up yellow_zebra safaris .
M	your company is not being charged 0 . 0 % so why do you ?
F	i had to sew multiple pieces of velcro onto it to make it appropriate .
F	just busy busy busy .
M	i have had my comp for a week no_problems so_far
F	fast delivery but with 0 snag the courier service leaves the parcel on the doorstep if you are not available to take delivery as has happened to myself last_week despite_being at home till 0 . 00pm when we got back home at 00 . 00am to find it left there any0ne could have lifted it and they might have argued that point about leaving it the way the driver did and not leaving it with a neighbour when you could have collected from them providing a card was left telling you who took delivery apart_from this issue the product is fine
M	its prices are compeitive and it is proactive when making_sure its customers know where their order are at all times .
M	don_'_t just take this review '_s word for it do a double_check on the manufacturers name and check out the grief .
F	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
F	we have contacted medicanimal and dpd uk , because , although we successfully received a letter from chronopost france they do not answer their phone .
F	i have suggested by email that i add both readings together and enter them as a single reading but have had no response from them .
M	fast turn_around .
F	fantastic service - thank_you !
F	so i have to travel 00 miles to the depot to collect it .
M	i would recommend buying from here and i '_m_sure next time i '_m looking for a computer this will be the first site to visit .
M	the delivery service is excellent and i have been pleased to find everything i have ordered as_described and good quality .
F	the coconut butter is also lovely to use but i want to know if you can actually eat it !
M	i will_definitely use you again and have already_recommended you to friends .
M	reasonable prices too
F	there should have been a message_saying they were from her friends at london office .
M	0 they stand to lose money from this new railcard or
M	using the chat support , ' john ' got me access to the control_panel but the mailboxes were not there .
F	on the whole , disappointing .
M	i '_ve_used them before with no_problems but 0 order took a week to sort & if i hadn_'_t done the work i would never found out about the issues with my order .
F	recently had a problem with the delivery a dress of an order and it was rectified very quickly .
F	shocking , shocking company .
M	after 0 days they contacted my by email_stating there t '_s and c '_s about acts of nature .
M	good products , non_existent after care and stay well clear of hermes because they will not discuss any_problems with you , they refer you back to myprotein , who dont reply !
M	it leads me to believe they were never sent in the first place ).
M	this was a totally_unacceptable circumstance and my protein have just lost a good customer over this !
F	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .
M	clearly all those before me have said it all .
F	very happy with this purchase .
M	if i need some more shower_seals i will use this company again but i will not be recommending their courier .
F	procook is an excellent firm to do_business with .
M	the web process was fine , however sent the phone free post and they did not process the phone arriving and payment for 0_weeks .
M	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer service .
M	the second time round i was promptly contacted by them to inform_me they couldn_'_t complete the full order and provided alternate options , to which i replied .
F	great product and posting , shame they don_'_t bother emailing back .
M	warning - do not use contact for lenses .
F	i had emails giving me regular_updates on my order .
M	thanks , so much_cheaper_than any shop
F	tried to contct with no joy . was worth more than 00_quid coud this be the reason ?
F	perhaps they will have to be patient for their payment !
M	i '_ll leave ya with this one in hopes that one of your staff are required to read these reviews , would you shop with choscards after_reading how i was treated ?
F	ill give you a clue , its not me !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	this is a copy of a note that i sent to nss on 0 / 0 / 00 :-
F	i purchased erdinger dunkel for my partner for fathers_day and found the bottles to be scratched and looked very battered , labels were hanging off too .
F	due to this problem , i '_m not sure i will use this site again .
M	i am just writing to show my appreciation of your company .
M	will keep on coming_back as always .
M	if you do , it always takes them two_days to acknowledge you '_ve returned discs , ( but not if you post them two or more days after .) which obviously limits the amount they send you .
M	each time ive called complete_care shop there '_s been a clear sense of dont care and dont want to help attitude / demeanor by the staff !!!
F	this company have been great when i order it comes next_day , great for my business and great on price too .
F	they emailed to say the bed would be delivered on the 0th_august .
F	i thought the produts were reasonably price , cheap delivery , and had what i wanted .
M	fast dispatch and arrived day after dispatch despite the fact i didn_'_t pay for next_day delivery .
M	these things are not available on different online stores .
M	00 days_later i received a reply telling_me i needed to send it back for a refund .
M	easy to navigate .
M	i rechecked the order , ran a preview on it and videoed the entire operation to make_sure .
M	how stupid does a company have to be to send me someone they have repeatedly ripped_off the opportunity to review them .
M	!
F	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
M	you pulled my truthfully review off the site with out emailing me .
M	great website made it easy to review different_models and the purchase process was very simple .
F	the order was made up of 0 slightly_different handles .
F	i love the picture but i am not happy with the item .
M	like to send them back ( as i have bought from battery_station )
F	unlike lot of fancy_dress costumes the sizing was great and it was exactly as_described ' on the box '.
M	i thought it was good service but it took to long i started the application at 0pm and money is still not in acount at 0 . 00am the next_day
F	upon our return we phoned after we had claimed our_luggage and the car was there waiting for us .
M	ups collected and delivered 00kg from uk to hong_kong in 0 days 00_%_cheaper_than i could_find on either of the other two competitor websites ( interparcel and parcel0go ).
M	i find the service extremely easy , and on the rare_occasions where i '_ve needed to make a claim , their instructions are clear .
M	i had a competition so went elsewhere .
F	i recently ordered a bugaboo chameleon from winstanleys and can_honestly_say i have never had such an easy transaction .
M	!
M	this was my 0rd order from greenman_bushcraft .
M	finally on 0th mar i called to find out status , to be told that item was now in stock , but it was over £_00 more_expensive than the price i had ordered at !
F	they were of excellent quality & fit him perfectly & the added_bonus was , they were far cheaper_than the shops .
F	ordered a lamp on 00 january , and since then have received the same excuses for non - delivery as everyone else ( original item not passed quality control , then it was further delayed as the cargo container wasn_'_t full ) you '_ve all heard these same sentences .
F	i '_ve_used these_guys before and they always offer brilliant value fares .
M	this scooter performs really well and incidentally has no problem getting up the same drop - kerb the prorider failed at .
M	very efficient , returned and re ordered in aster of days without_fuss .
M	what more can one ask for ?
F	truly gutted as it was not cheap .
M	i love the products .
F	i then tried to return it as faulty but they insist that i need to send it recorded delivery , at my expense , and if ( i think it will be when ) they find it not faulty , they then insist that i have to go and fetch it within 0_days .
M	it has arrived today the 00th of dec , a full 0 days after jessops said on their email that i would receive it .
M	groet ,
M	be - careful .
M	the item was very well_packaged and well i was delighted .
F	and i should also make it clear that i will no_longer use your firm , and i will make_sure no - one else that i know uses your firm .
M	the products i ordered are fine .
M	do not even think about buying anything from this company . you have been_warned .
M	as advertised .
F	i received my order as promised , only to find that the same item was available online for £_00 less .
F	very poor customer service and terrible communication with customers !
M	i made a mistake on original order , so phoned them up .
M	i told them the delivery address but they had to call to confirm , i missed the call and had to call back . long wait .
F	!
M	i have not grow out the seeds yet there wet and ready .
F	it was almost like being in the shop !
F	0 - 0 working_days after the order is received .
F	if it is in stock , great .
F	i would hesitate in purchasing from a company that only has a ' 0000 ' number as , if anything_goes_wrong , it can cost you a fortune in calls to correct which is adding to the company '_s profits .
M	took 0 days to arrive after dispatch_notification was received .
M	i will_certainly use petmeds again .
M	mooring takes a while so you don_'_t get long in amsterdam , factor this in !
F	rang back on day 00 , was told that wasn_'_t day 00 , day 0 is not when i order , it '_s when you dispatch the goods , 0_days_later according to your rep . what a sham .
F	i bought mrs scissors hands for a halloween ball this year 0000 , i thought it was fantastic value for money .
F	still_unresolved by it , have now requested account to be closed .
M	the products are delicious .
M	been a member for about 0 years_now and have no_complaints , cash - back paid on time everytime , no_hesitation in recommending this great service
F	they were there waiting to pick_up my car and waiting for me as i got back so nothing to complain_about
M	the cartridges were delivered within the time frames stated , which was great .
F	and i upgraded for more blossoms but they arrived in 0 separate bunches rather_than one large bunch .
F	we used two companies .
M	the signage and thus car_park directions are very poor .
M	mind you , i am still_waiting for over £_00 due from august so do not really want to give a favourable response until this isreceived .
M	good stuff wd !
F	i bought 0 for 0 inks for my kodak esp0000 & have just used a compatible from you & the picture is all red & white stripes down faces .
F	well there we go and thanks for the chance to tell my little story
M	all i recommend is that all yugioh_cards be available for purchase , other than that a great site and the pricing is soft on the wallet too !
F	they shut_down business and charity accounts and keep all the money .
M	i chose to use mazumamobile after being given a pathetic price for my broken phone by enviofone .
M	so i carried_out mr_memory ’_s instructions on how to test the memory , but it still caused problems and various screens appeared like windows has discovered a fault and is shutting_down , so i returned my purchase to mr_memory for a refund .
F	beware as this has signifantly dumped up the price as i have had order another pair but this time used another company / website .
F	i hope to see you next year !
M	yours well impresse
M	my partner was rather surprised when he saw the van , it was quite old and very obvious that the item to be transported , a wardrobe , would not go into the van in the
F	the fit was perfect , the material was stunning and high_quality and fitting the blind was very easy .
F	it '_s really not the same as it used to be , i dont enjoy it as much as i did before and i am looking for other_sites to sell my perfectly new clothes now .
M	took my crappy broken phone and gave_me £_00 !
M	but nothing at all has happened .
F	because we were doing things a bit differant , this allowed_us to taylor the invites
M	should i insert the ticket into the machine ?
F	please sort this out .
F	to date , still_waiting for confirmation that money has_been refunded .
F	it was delivered to a neighbour and put through their letterbox by mistake .
M	q ) why not tell me from the outset that these phones were damaged ?
F	if you are a customer of o0 please make_sure to check your monthly_bill for unknown charges because they will not catch the error themselves !
M	packaging :
M	they have ruined our family christmas .
M	recommended .
M	i find the first time buys from watchfinder to be excelent deals .
F	delivery company solved this on the monday .
M	well_done honey beautique 0_stars from me .
F	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn_'_t mine ( wasn_'_t even in the same county ).
F	chocs ordered , helpful staff , spelling correct on gift card , kept up to date with despatch and delivery timings .
M	easy to use software , freedom of photo placement , photos came out brilliantly and service was excellent , the book arrived within the timescales set and the price with the discount was the cherry on top of the cake .
F	slightly_annoying but when i emailed dpd there wasn_'_t even any acknowledgement of failure , nothing .
F	its too long to tell you the whole story .
M	i told them that the delivery was expensive and that i was a little_worried , and in their own words they said they didn_'_t care .
M	it took 0_weeks to get my first order because of a felling wedge & 0 week for the second order because of sharpening kit ( after i called in , they upgraded the kit for free & got the order out a day later ).
F	bramble was not available and you must ensure in future that disappointed be avoided and only promise if indeed availability is guaranteed .
M	quickly reordered and the delivered box dropped onto my carpet next_day .
M	i had a flightcase built for my marshall 000 combo which fits perfect and is built perfectly .
F	!
M	surely this should have been done over the phone and not over the internet for security_reasons , but it appears that this was the only way in which to get the details of our bank in spaiin to currency direct .
F	no wires are on view from the front .
M	on opening the parcel three or four of the lily heads were very limp and had to be de headed before putting in the vase which was enclosed .
F	!
F	but will be happy to give one on receiving my goods please hurry up just longing to make up stories
F	when we opened the box on christmas day we were very disappointed to find there was no plug adaptor provided with the keyboard , as you can_imagine we had a very upset child when she was not able to play it
M	bought a number of items in the sale on boxing_day .
F	i only wanted flowers but there was an interesting variety of extras , such as vases , chocolates etc that were available .
F	quick delivery and fantastic product would recommend this company to everyone .
F	quite sickly to be honest .
M	can '_t fault mr_memory service .
M	however not before the memeber of staff looked perplexed at my postcode and said they don_'_t take deliveries for my area .
F	have used other_sites whose costs are about the same but delivery is much speedier .
F	thought the deliver took slightly too long .
M	i found park_cameras on google as they we ' re the only people stocking the model i wanted .
F	i order every few_months from child '_s play , maybe more .
M	i '_m sadly disgusted they are still trading on line or that they haven_'_t been prosecuted for something related to trading on line or online fraud or robbery .
M	this is a very good service .
F	quality and service second to none prices can '_t be_beaten they are a must use
M	so in summary_: wait_until you can_afford a supercomputer ; can speak german fluently ; can_afford to spend hours waiting for godot ; don_'_t mind being fleeced ; and can spend hours trying to understand things .
M	not only did my goodybag not recur , but i was unable to top - up in any way on my account - so effectively they managed to brick my phone !
M	web_site was easy to use .
M	just bad service .
M	you will not find a better , cheaper service anywhere_else in the midlands .
M	quick delivery - product as_described - excellent !
M	i was very pleased with the goods and delivery .
F	regarding a bathroom tap i wanted to buy .
F	the head massager i received is in a broken carton , making it unfit to give as a gift .
F	simple enough but obviously have to be home to do that .
F	this is a company based in china .
M	( i ask what would you do if you got this service what would you be doing )
M	no !
M	of the month .
M	imagine what this has done to my business , a disastrous financial_loss .
F	i have called the company on two more occasions and both_times i have been promised that the handles would be sent out .
F	thank_you , replacement hinge arrived within two_days of my first inquiry .
M	i was very pleased with the efficient service received from personal_injury assist .
M	the sting in the tail with this call was that you now have to pay your excess of £_00 and that i would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " for an engineer to call and assess our dishwasher .
M	i still have not sourced the part , presumably 0st choice had the same experience .
F	though other aspects of the service were good , this lack of communication could be improved considerably and would make me think_twice about ordering in future , especially if i needed an item quickly .
F	other small problems with the old villa . the sink_unit in the bathroom was cracked , broken and black with mould at the base .
M	fast delivery .
M	having compiled a pdf of fitting disasters and sending onto kitchen_appliances 000 we are still_waiting for a response .
F	not good .
M	i '_m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
M	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
F	i clearly made comment to leave with neighbours just in case but anyway i was all day home .
F	it took 0 goes and a lot of wasted time over 0_days to order what i required via the website .
F	we travel up from milton_keynes and really do not mind the journey as we always come away so happy .
F	click and collect service worked really well and i was very happy with the level of service .
M	there is the only the odd product i will go_elsewhere for now .
M	still nice and cool and even separated the raw meats from the other items like peanut_butter and oats which i had also ordered , another thumbs_up from me .
M	as audio_visual is part of what my company does i ' d say superfi have lost out .
F	, my sister rang to thank me for the lovely flowers although i would have loved for her to have sent me a photo but she is not that good with mobile_phones !!
F	terrible experience !
F	packaging very good as well .
M	very good value so , really , not worth the effort to chase up the tenth .
F	all i can do is try to spread the word and try to warn_others to avoid this co . like the plague !
F	the second time i phoned i was spoken to by a customer service assistant who told me that they had sent me an_email the day after_placing the order asking me to contact them with a delivery date .
M	cheerful helpful delivery driver assisted getting machine into the house .
F	i emailed them about it last night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
F	website easy to navigate
F	highly_recommened
M	would definitely recommend !
M	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
F	i am not a golfer , but my husband is !
M	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
M	very poor indeed !
M	i contacted the garage and they were less_than willing to resolve .
F	didn_'_t realise you could buy such insurance before you get ' stung ' at the hire_car desk when you are abroad .
F	i was not best pleased as it is a 00 mile_round_trip from where i live and this cost me around £_00 in petrol costs for a wasted_journey .
M	the results were great but the experience was horrible .
M	kept asking me for information ( the same email several_times a day ) that i had already sent , i kept emailing them back to tell them but no answer .
F	i have dealt_with this company for many , many_years and have always found them very efficient and reliable . their products are good and what they say on the tubs can be_relied on .
F	good company , the service was very straightforward .
M	recommended to me by a current user and happy to say i '_m pleased she did . will_definitely be recommending to others
M	probably because the service is good at a good price , you are hoisted by your own petard !
M	after the weekend , i still hadn_'_t received it , i called again , and after a day of phone_calls and emails , i finally received the proof .
F	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
F	when i looked again , the order was ready to be delivered on the date of my choice .
F	windsor proved to be easy to set_up and they quickly provided us with a fully_operational system .
M	the service from the initial call to them was simply first_class , returned to them with postage covered and promptly returned with a few lovely extras_thrown in .
M	stated delivery was 0 to 0_weeks .
M	i wonder_if you have a mission statement to “ ruin family holidays and destroy the planet ”
F	the pricing was competitive with additional discounts offed for larger orders .
F	hi ordered a wallet and this was received no problem .
F	brilliant service could not belive it when i received my order the next_day !
F	very good service always .
M	worth considering ?
M	to make it even worse i started getting snotty demands for unpaid duty from excise and customs and got involved in time wasting email hockey whereby pharmastores would tell me one day there was no duty to pay then next_day they ' d paid - don_'_t believe a word they say .
F	fitflop website was out of the design i wanted , but got them here .
M	very happy just gutted i didn_'_t find them years_ago .
F	i will never use wowcher again because the hassle is not worth it .
M	!
M	i would buy from go - electrical again without_hesitation , thankyou
M	justin , devon
F	after all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought_id try out aldi paisley ( fulbar road ) scotland for the family shop .
M	done my best .
M	this facts happen to you don_'_t trust them even if they are proud of its good rating service marks or they select the better of them for impressing purposes .
M	i was ignored by assistant who answered so closed chat .
M	the fact that e . on keep phoning me to ask me to stay is a sure sign that their customer churn must now be at unprecedented levels .
F	a wide_choice of floral_arrangements for every_occasion .
F	your word_against theirs .
M	fast , efficient service and goods as_described .
F	however three_days_later only two of the products arrived .
M	many extras
F	called tennis_nuts too help find the parcel .
F	also think its a good idea that u can print_off address rather_than waiting for a bag to arrive .
F	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine '_s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
F	which has a value of £_00 .
F	i have lost my money and am worried_about the security of the transaction .
M	believe me , the embarrassment felt by david pollock , will not only ensure that your grievance will be attended to immediately , but will lead to heads rolling at the heyes lane office .
F	it arrived the next_day .
F	the flight was changed to one day earlier - but they didnt feel the need to give us this information .
F	having booked and paid in_advance online for a better deal we yet again were held up on leaving by the ticket machine requesting we pay full price .
F	all i can say is fantastic service from_start to finish . ordering my glasses was so easy i have recommend highly to my friends and work_colleagues .
F	my friend stayed late at the office ,
F	best of all , i no_longer need to wear two_pairs of glasses when i want to read in the sun !!
M	if you have a problem or question ( even if it '_s a stupid one ) they '_ll get back to you very quickly and give you patient advice .
M	it looks fantastic !
M	goods arrived on time .
F	free next_day delivery which was fab , but i was disappointed with the overall size of the bouquet considering i had upgraded them .
M	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
M	what '_s annoying is that i '_ve had several dvds on my list for well over a year and they have not given an eta , despite their release .
F	amazing service !
F	such a pleasure to have contact with and so much_nicer_than shop_assistants who mostly can '_t be bothered .
F	after i sent them an enquiry i found out that due to a " mistake " my sunglasses were out of stock and delivery will be delayed .
M	a solid_piece of furniture , beautifully constructed , the piano is a delight .
F	bought these chennille cushions , and i love them , got a great bargain in the sale . havent been disappointed with anything i '_ve bought from this company . so the future is bright for linens_limited .
F	brilliant fast delivery !
F	would recommend .
M	i purchased them , so what is going on .
M	i was greeted with " good afternoon sir how can i help ?"
F	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
F	why dont they just pay the money i am owed ?
M	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
F	fantastic service .
M	how timely that i '_ve been invited to give a review .
F	i would definitely use trophystore again .
M	delivery was prompt but 0 item was missing " not in stock " yet it was when i ordered the items , and i had no phone_call / e_- mail to tell me this fact and i still have not had my item delivered or any indication when it will be .
F	bought a reg from car_reg , for childs 00th_birthday .
F	terms and conditions are the fine print to cover their liabilities .
F	overall the weekend was good but the communication from chillisauce on organising the event was very poor .
M	what is the point of having a mobile company like this rubbish rubbish avoid at your_peril
M	due to an error in the postcode i used i needed to change the address , used the live_chat and emma was able to resolve the problem immediately .
F	the ring was indeed ready for collection on the day of the party and i love , love , love it !
F	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
F	a lot of the stores don_'_t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
M	my girlfriend didnt even know they were from me !!
M	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
F	on the plus_side the tickets arrived quite quickly after i had ordered them .
F	not the best solution really .
M	my advisor paul kept me updated from_start to finish and i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
F	i have no idea how companies like this stay in business .
M	highly_recommend them and will_definitely use them in the future !
F	takes all the stress out of buying lights !
F	great products & great service !
M	they ' re selling a product .
F	my only_niggle with it is that it is a bit_fiddly trying to do the velcro up at the front but after a couple of uses now i have got the hang of it =) would recommend both the product and the company and will be purchasing from them again in the future .
F	there may have been a change since it was written .
F	i have ms and as a result i have problems with swallowing .
M	they gave_me good advice which i followed and i did save_money by reducing my energy useage .
F	order a thomas_sabo bracelet with a length of 00 . 0cm , when it arrived it wouldn_'_t fit around my wrist .
F	will definitely use again .
F	neither the phone system nor the web_site recognised our repair reference_number
F	ability to obtain a lead time for delivery is very useful .
F	the same thing happended back in may .
F	if products had been wrapped / posted more carefully i would have been happy however products ordered were literally jammed into a tiny jiffy_bag which damaged the boxes on the small lanvin & diesel fragrances .
M	as i proceeded the system logged me out , when i got back in everything was still there except free delivery had been changed to £_00 . 00 next_day delivery , extra .
F	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
F	excellent products and quick delivery .
F	the delivery driver , yodel i beleive , just left the flowers on the step without_knocking on the door .
F	very prompt , efficient service supplying top quality goods .
F	the door we received was finished very poorly , the glass fitting was particularly bad .
M	eventually sorted everything out with dpd directly , however i was left_feeling rather un - loved and messed about .
F	purewell is a very professional company and kept me up to date with my purchase with emails .
F	delivery came when i was out . fortunately driver read my message and called me . arranged for him to leave my package at our village post_office .
F	a few_days_later i eventually got an_email to say it was there .
F	the goods came very quickly & i was kept_informed all the way as to dilivery times , etc so i would order from them again .
M	would appreciate , if possible , the alternative of a slower delivery at a lower cost ; however , this is not a complaint !
F	we came away feeling sorry for the next family who had to endure the inside of this villa .
M	be warned , paypal is never as easy as they say it is !
F	personally , i intend to keep re - ordering from them whilst my dog still benefits from joint_supplements .
M	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn_'_t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn_'_t .
F	once again my poor customer glasyn ices has received a battered box , i specifically checked that this carton left the warehouse in a good condition and by the time it arrived at the delivery depot it was battered and barely resembling a box and tins inside dented .
M	found what i was looking for in seconds and item arrived following_day .
F	so all in all very pleased :-) definitely use again .
F	i ordered a photo_book with photos i took of my friend '_s wedding .
F	service was excellent , it arrived earlier_than_expected and its in my cupboard waiting for a night out .
M	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
F	they give you the highest price than anyone around .
M	i have been a loyal_customer for over 0 years , and have never had a single_complaint about any member of staff .
M	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
M	they will replace and help you to overcome any_problems .
F	bcs gives you a helpful tool which shows how much room your items will take , allowing you to know exactly how much you can get into one box without raising the shipping_costs .
M	there is a problem if you want your machine plumbed in with delivery times i believe becoming more restricted
M	high prices , good quality gear .
F	i was very disappointed in the time it was taking to despatch my order .
M	still surprised that your ' quality control ' let the package off your site in that condition .
M	the spd lugs seem genuine and great value even in comparison prices on ebay .
M	why can they not check that they have the goods before they sell them ?
M	adam
F	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .
F	thanks again :)
M	my phone_calls now being ignored , all of them , even when messages have been left on their answer phone , i have never received a call back .
M	the elements had got to it , so as it was no_longer in working order , i thought i would ' treat ' myself to a new one .
F	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
F	dear prachi , i have already complained on your website on the same day i left the review .
F	this costs nothing to use but you get real cash_back straight_into your bank_account .
F	mike broke on our bus so we had to swap buses .
F	i rang the company as_opposed to ordering on the net .
M	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal_hallway is hardly a safe_place .
M	the tracking and information provided from the point of dispatch to delivery was better_than normal .
M	great website !
F	we encourage you to make_changes to comply with our quality guidelines .
F	so , logically , i put both land line and mobile numbers in .
M	it is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available .
F	if this was fixed they '_d get 0_stars .
M	we wait and see what the feedback is - if positive i would use the rental facilities again
F	few_minutes later i received a text_message on my phone saying that they received the bill required for the cash_back and that i would get a cheque within 00 days .
F	the packaging was great with airbags to protect the stars , all inside a strong box and with delivery within_00hrs , great service , highly_recommended .
M	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
F	this is impossible as i was at work at the time and live_alone .
M	this involved a great deal of fiddleing with the studs to get the mat to fit .
M	absoulte nightmare of a company .
F	i would definitely use again .
M	eventually got peugeot_000 diesel at no extra_charge and was a diesel , good in ireland where diesel cheaper_than unleaded .
M	honest_opinion , well over the top message wise .
M	som vip kunde i danske bank blev_jeg spurgt om_jeg_ikke ville modtage et tilbud om at samle alle mine forsikringer og flytte dem til topdanmark .
M	hi the car_park i was to go to was not marked very clear i did eventually
M	you can contact me on *******
F	they do nothing for the brand .
F	my first order with next_day coffee was a great experience , an easy to use website and great delivery .
F	girl was trying to be helpful though .
M	they are the worst delivery company that i have ever had to deal with
M	then an_hour later received an email asking me to ring tyre - shopper .
M	his first response was that there was little time to arrange the deal before the end of march , this set the pattern , everything was a problem rather_than him finding solutions .
F	so i paid more than necessary and then also had to pay to get out of the car_park .
F	i will be purchasing regularly ~
M	they ' d lost it , we all lost time and money .
F	however , it was all delivered promptly with no_problems .
M	your company and behaviour are an utter_disgrace and will be reported - my transript will be available to all .
F	ordered from glowsticks for a school_disco having had previous bad_experience when we bought cheap glowbands from ebay - but we still had two bands split and ooze liquid - we checked for bite marks as that is unacceptable use but the plastic wasn_'_t bitten , it had split .
F	he was worried because the packaging was really bad and the camera was rattling_around in a large box .
M	farnell - if you read this , think again .
M	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
M	quick and easy to fill in details online and then prompt payment straight to bank_account .
M	i purchased from cartridge_shop as i liked the prices .
M	as i have not had much success finding this type of handle for sliding_doors , i have accepted them as there seems to be little in the way of alternatives .
F	if i hadnt been in a dire need and could have been bothered i should have returned them .
M	i had struggled to find a uk_based supplier for a set of three different spokes for my 0000 mavic kyserium sl wheels .
F	just call your airline and find the best deal !
M	i am now going to hit every social_network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
M	sometimes it works but most of the time you need to have your booking email handy as the barrier doesn_'_t open or it asks for full payment .
F	quick & easy online service , however my 0nd order didnt go smoothly .
F	happy also that i am not inundated with emails from you .
F	staff pleasant .
M	i thought this excessive as this an internet service and people will inevitably want to exchange or return goods so i will probably not use them again .
F	i ordered a dining_suite , dresser , bookcase and two coffee_tables .
F	trying to get my phone '_s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers_license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message_confirming that they had my details checked .
M	very disappointed in the customer service i have received from yourselves !
M	drab and depressing stores with uninterested staff
M	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
M	the last 00 purchases i have made have all had problems .
M	!
F	the flowers look lovely but apparently ( i was not with the recipient at the time ) there is a lot of work required to get them out of the packaging and into a vase which_resulted_in the my mother '_s hands being covered in blue dye !
M	very efficient , good communication and my order was delivered two_days after ordering .
M	the website was very efficient and i was able to buy a policy with ease all from my mobile_phone without even needing to make a call .
F	the blind looks beautiful but the blind mechanism comes across as awkward ( being behind the blind itself ) and is clumsy to lift and drop .
M	i had asked if i could see the prints before they go back to the aop for judging , lets_see what happens .
M	i '_ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit_weird .
M	the site says i will have to print shipping label .
M	i got the money 00 days after the item was returned .
F	0 ) when i said this is not so great customer service , there was not a single word of apology just to make me feel better at_least . it was a mere okay . like im calling some royal highness where i should be sorry i wasted their time .
M	everything_went exactly as i expected .
F	the online tracking_facility showed the parcel as ' out for delivery ' during the day , up until 0000 ( when it had not arrived ) and the tracking then showed ' at the depot '.
M	great deals , free next_day courier , free 0 yr guarantee .
M	you won_'_t go_anywhere_else .
F	could wear anytime definitely good for a dress up night fits well and doesn_'_t look cheap and nice material .
M	simple order system .
F	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
M	he took me from being someone_who was interested in buying a new watch to someone_who had bought a rolex_submariner , in no time at all .
F	she told me she frequently has disgruntled_customers on the phone as , in her_words , their delivery times are ' appalling '.
M	i had paid for removal and recycling of the old machine and connection of the new one .
M	two_days_later in a different site , i had another .
F	also , the consumer protection authorities should be aware of this and monitor this practice , it is unacceptable .
F	repeat the same programs far too often and even_tho there are hundreds of channels there is often nothing to watch
M	delivery company also first_class .
F	excellent company .
M	yes it '_s running now but if you know little about pcs be very careful in your choice of company , service comes in many forms if microdream is refurbishing a laptop , that machine should and is expected to be fit for propose which it clearly was not .
M	they have a first_class comprehensive_range of products at good prices , excellent stocks are held , they had everything we wanted and the delivery was very quick .
M	the selling experience has_been ok the values they give are somewhat lower_than one could expect elsewhere but the process is simple and is acceptable .
F	they are professional photos and very large files so this should not have happened .
M	disgusting .
M	blew out a tyre on saturday_evening .
F	what i thought she would be receiving was nothing like the photo on your website .
F	she said that she hadn_'_t received anything and i began to get really worried because i had received an_email_saying that they had been delivered .
F	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
F	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
M	excellent service from online order to delivery .
F	i had to explain the process to the customer " service " representative .
F	the guy at national_tyres contacted tyre_shopper to explain , they spoke to me and apologised that i should '_ve been contacted to be informed , which i wasn_'_t .
F	top service , helpful staff , and would highly_recommend go_electrical
F	because we had to wait for other people making purchases that decreased the time we had for dinner .
F	no_reservations recommending this company
F	we have moved office 0 times and on each_occasion it was seamless !
F	brilliant .
M	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
M	i didn_'_t receive and email confirmation when i placed an order online , no_drama , a quick phone_call to you sorted it out .
F	don_'_t reward them with your business .
M	the flowers arrived late in the day ( although just within the delivery window ).
M	husqvarna told my supplier that it is covered_under_warranty but it still didn_'_t arrive !
M	i will_continue to shop with wizard !
F	!
M	cooks well and consistent after tempuring .
F	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
F	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 receipt at depot
F	so i ordered a scratching_post and some food .
M	informed of the delivery time_slot , which they kept to .
F	delivery was prompt and item well_packaged .
F	all was well until thursday 00th_april ( just 00_hours before we had to leave for our first flight ) when i received an_urgent email from travel up notifying_me of these changes .
M	after paying £ 0 for standard delivery , i finally received the anti - slip flooring strips i ordered .
M	i much preferred the old web_site where a discounted guide price was displayed when enquiring_about new watches .
M	still no word from the director as of this date 0 / 0 / 00 , and no way of compensation or out of pocket expense forthcoming yet either , not to mention all the stress and anxiety this has caused .
M	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
M	i then received nasty threatening_letters .
F	made my selection but when i got there no one was ready and they had to search the store room for my goods ( twice !).
M	can '_t fault the service and have recommended etyres to others .
F	i felt like you had taken_advantage of me .
M	i entered the key number on the order form and sent it off on line .
F	the hotel and staff were outstanding , and the extra bonus of the executive lounge made our stay very special .
M	they gave_me a code that was a duplicate and are taking way too long to assist me with the issue .
F	ordered an oven .
F	when he hadn_'_t arrived by 0 : 00_pm i rang him & he said he had finished work for the day & i politely pointed_out that he hadn_'_t & i wanted my parcel which he did bring about teatime .
M	am still_waiting for correct receipt after person said it was a customer glitch annd would send asap ( 0 days ago !)
F	i had a great booking experience with travel_republic and will probably use the company again .
F	and just to add , i didn_'_t get petty over a five_pound order , i spent over sixty pounds .
M	ok , so the flight was cheap which is pretty_much all this company has going for it .
F	not only that but the price could not be_beaten with the cover they offered .
F	i emailed simply_supplements and the order was fulfilled free of charge - no_fuss .
M	i always check prices with the competition before ordering .
M	there are more people on the streets wearing minimal magnification lenses than we realize .
M	experience was spoiled by the fact that when putting prepaid ticket in machine to leave car_park , it demanded another £_00 . 00 !!!!!
F	i have many an item just slung over my fence and in to the back garden even_though i have complained on several_occassions .
F	therefore , she had to go back to the office today to collect them .
M	will use every time i need tyres .
F	paid_extra for them to be posted out to me .
F	i purchased a ticket to sonisphere for my son through this site .
F	would use this company again no problem .
F	the décor of this villa really let it down .
M	i again phoned the helpline and was this time told that it might be a problem with my internet browser and that i should try with firefox or chrome .
F	however despite placing the order at 0am on a thursday and getting a confirmed delivery date of the friday the branch that held the part somehow_managed to neglect to send it either on the thursday or friday .
M	the flowers lasted nearly 0_weeks , and looked as high_quality as they prooved to be .
M	twice i '_ve had to return items , and both_times the staff have resolved my problem very quickly ( same day ).
M	instead , after 0 days i received an email_saying that there might be some delay since " items are dispatched from switzerland as stated in the product description ."
M	on the other hand , some of their furniture is really of questionable quality ( particularly their fjord dining_chairs ) and in some cases doesn_'_t flag clearly just how much self - assembly is required ( probably wouldn_'_t have bought them had i been aware of that point ).
F	it was good to link various_places and note where to return to next time we are in london , when we have more time to explore .
M	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting_information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
F	ordered my glasses , they came and were lovely .
M	quick delivery , kept_informed on progress by email , no_problems also a lot cheaper_than screw_fix its etc .
F	was through europcar that the hire took place on behalf of holiday_autos .
M	my only_criticism is the lack of clarity regarding the six month interest free period but this was not a necessity so no huge issue .
M	good quality products & taste really nice , i have tried wpc00 lemon_shortcake , cherry_bakewell , chocolate & banana flavours .
M	i can only_assume that a misread eight became the three quoted on the delivery information .
F	ordered the mattress on the 0th , received it on the 00th .
M	i bought this hamper as a present for my mothers 00th_birthday .
M	excellent service order came next_day it was late after noon i placed my order i did , nt dream for one minute that my order would arrive next_day
F	all the staff are friendly and polite , but £_00 to stand in the rain was a little much , everything else excellent .
F	found site on internet , head_office arranged for engineer to contact me via_email within 0_days , after 0_days phoned head_office to be told engineer would phone me that afternoon , still_waiting , also told at that point lead time for servicing was probably 00 days , this was not made clear at time of booking or payment .
F	the only_flaw i would find is i believe the fone was worth a little mre money .
F	chose this supplier over several others who had same product because they had next_day free delivery .
M	kept you up to date on whether your phone was there or not .
F	ordered a bed realised it was too_big and i am being charged to change it !!!!
M	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
F	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
M	the minions don_’_t .
M	also i didn_'_t want express delivery and then it states it cannot send send it so add another £ 0 or £ 0 instead of the lower rate .
M	i will not be using you again
M	prices are very good , communication and delivery first_rate .
M	0nd time ordered items and again disappointed in time taken to reimburse funds !
M	you pay a price but get the high_quality product you wanted

M	stayed in all day to get the delivery time sent at approx .

M	never_regretted any single purchase from wiggle .
M	luckily a friend had a part roll of felt so i used this instead .
M	!
M	frames much to big , lenses out of focus . but promised a replacement , free pair immedietly .
F	too risky on the whole to use .

M	i am trying birmingham at xmas , i hope it '_s just as good
M	my wife is 0 months pregnant and so i do not want her having the stress of dealing_with incompetent customer service reps who have no interest in what the customer wants and who lie about whether managers are in the office .
M	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
M	could not believe_how efficient the service was even if i did have to pay for a courier to deliver the phones to mazuma ( had to be sure of delivery ).
M	. not according to wh , whom say my the bets stand , but my account is closed , my open bets are still running ?
F	couldn_'_t get over the speed at which we received the items . ie the next_day :) fantastic !
F	the owner of villa came out twice , and gave_me a bottle of pipe unblocker !!!!!
M	i have to say that the extras were also quality , register plate was exactly_what my fitter wanted , no major adjustments .
M	when you persevere and it finally repeats it back to you correctly and you confirm it , it replies " i '_m sorry we do not have any information for that tracking_number .
M	i would but from them again however i shall not trust their information regards postage .
F	they may be cheaper_than some other courier companies , but with myhermes , you don_'_t even get what you pay for .

F	shower of excrement doesn_'_t even begin to cover it .

M	when ringing to check my car in at the airport approx .
M	good job !
M	facebook is everywhere nowadays .
F	it was a nice idea to include a few samples and a lovely nail_file all of which i have enjoyed using .
M	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it '_s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
M	but overall , everything was smooth , communication was good and we departed and arrived on time .
F	i have been very impressed with the service of chemist_direct up till now .
F	all in all this was a positive_experience using this company and i will be using again and recommending them .
M	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
F	a different item was suggested , but according to the website , it was also ' out of stock '.
M	great .
M	the heading_says it all !
F	i have to find points on my feet so it is not an acceptable level .
F	she is fran .

F	i investigated this further and can put it down to the hitachi 0tb hdd having a write speed of 00mb / s and a read speed of 000mb / s .
F	i have today spoken to customer_services and they have confirmed there is nothing more they can do .
F	i '_m still confused .!
M	great .

M	on the friday the only time i could take the delivery was before 0am .
F	the money has_been taken out of my account and i am so worried i have had to cancel my card .
M	£_000 flushed down the toilet .
F	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
F	this was very poor customer service .
F	i have also ordered the leggings they are ok but quaity a bit rubbish , but ok for the price .

M	well , they got there in the end , but very slowly .
M	pull up a chair and get a brew on .
F	always delivered promptly prices are great and products are excellent
F	the only_gripe is that in recent years the motorbikes have always been left till last for boarding - and this year for some odd reason at newcastle we were boarded 0 bikes at a time with long gaps between , even_though we were all going onto the same deck it '_s really frustrating .
M	when it came to the payment stage , he asked me for my ' verified by visa ' password .
F	the pricing_structure was unclear , with the price in the editor different to the price as we were ordering , and different again in the final summary .
M	highly_recommend .
F	we had an issue with the villa and the rep in spain was not very helpful yet bob who works at villa_plus in britain was extremely_helpful throughout .
F	overall , it is a good site and i have already ordered something_else ( making a point of avoiding that certain delivery option i chose last time and settling fro royal_mail .)
F	i had the new tyres_fitted three_weeks_ago and had a full set of 0 .
F	there were only half the amount of flowers we were expecting and they looked half_dead .
M	i switched from edf because of their terrible service and scottish_power took incorrect opening readings .
F	may order from again but if order is lost again defiantly wont , its just hard to beat their prices .
F	however , i was very disappointed when i saw the flowers the day after they were delivered to see several of them wilting already .
F	maybe you should have something about this on your website when the option to select priority carriage comes up ?
F	the choice was so good i had

F	so rang on the monday and they checked and rang me back straight_away to tell me my email had been dealt_with .
F	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .

M	i can '_t see any point going else where !
M	whilst i was told that i would suffer some discomfort after my procedure it was not conveyed to me just how painful the first week post surgery would be .
M	on the downside the boiler came with a part missing and despite my plumber calling in to plumbnation , they could not help which was poor .
F	items finally arrived .
F	price was fantastic and i received the aftershave quickly but was a bit annoyed when the parcel had a aftershave / perfume sticker on it as well as the price i had paid .
F	i have been sending pyrex for years with rm and have never had a breakage .
M	0 ) they would send out a replacement chair seat which it was implied i would then have to fit myself .
F	i choose serenata_flowers for their very reasonable_price and thought maybe the product itself and the service may reflect this , however i was pleasantly_surprised they surpassed my expectations !
M	i am now in the process of taking them to small_claims court to get my money back plus costs .
F	it was easy to order and potentially an quick and effective dispatch .

M	it took only 0 days for a whole recycling proceess .
F	from ordering online , to the delivery updates , to a specific three - hour_slot for delivery - everything was so very well_organised and it arrived in just over three_weeks from making the order .
M	you do however always get the same reply from them " please_bear with us ".
F	there was a huge_amount of choice and styles and the menu allowed for to be price conscious without_scrimping on the quality .
F	i challenged the fitter on this and he mumbled something about some other item purchased but which he had no receipt for .
M	wrong items delivered 0 times , wrong_size delivered 0 times wrong_size bar delivered won_'_t do anything about it
F	i don_'_t blame the salesperson as she should be given this information to pass on to the customer rather_than get their hopes up that they can spread the payment
F	service good , quality and price good , sadly colour not good .
M	the internal measurement shown is not the minimum measurement ( at the base of the box ) as stated on other products on this website and the boxes themselves are made by crystal , which is not stated at all .

M	as expected the flowers were mainly buds , but they opened at different times , and the lilies which were what drew me to order this item have not opened 0 days_later , while the roses are dying .

M	wanted a single piece of pine furniture to replace a broken item at home .

M	no way would they ( olga & zoryana ) give me the name of a contact in the uk or vienna to write to .
M	0_weeks went past so i had to email them , got told the bag i wanted was out of stock .
M	far better enjoyable_experience in my opinion .
F	where it fell down slightly for me was the collection service - was a pain to find a collect_+ location near me and necessitated going out of my way to drop_off the parcel .
M	fearing i would not receive them in time for my holiday , i phoned and was told that there was a delay due to the success of the sale .
F	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
F	we were then encouraged to buy overpriced furniture wax and a longer guarantee at an additional_cost of £_00 , the sales_guy looked embarrassed when i called him on it and we actually got both for £ 0 .
F	my friend was delighted with the flowers .
F	no one did so i called again the following_day to be told the manufacturer had changed its outsourcing department therefore it was taking longer_than usual .
F	thankfully we had someone there to occupy our 0 young kids ( 0 & 0 ) otherwise it would have been a nightmare .
M	no apology .
F	i bought another one so they have done well from me so i am very concerned that i cannot talk to anyone to see where my refund in and that it is not forthcoming either .
F	always look at going two sizes up for fit and length but saying that clothing is alwaya good quality .
M	my parcel has still not materialised at the recipients address , i have been lied to , i have had live_chats terminated without warning , i have had facebook comments ignored .
F	have used them before for custom clubs and service is always good .
F	when i tried further to see if there was any room for manovre , all i got was ' my supervisor says no '
M	wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend these_guys to anyone , especially if you are after some pretty specific dir / tec gear .
F	not even a phonecall !
M	couple of time they didn_'_t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
M	this year within 0 days of laying down the poison we have found a number of dead rats and seem to have cleared all rats from the area .
F	service was great but was disappointed with soldier_outfit as the seams had been sewn very quickly and it fell_apart as i was wearing it which was very embarrassing .
F	although i had a little trouble to start with ordering multiple trophies and requiring engraving once i got the hang of it , it was very easy .
F	rang customer_services and was asked to email copies of my correspondence to the supervisor .
F	they do not phone you to say there is a delay , they just wait for you to realise flowers not arrived with recipient and call them !
F	they didn_'_t arrive next_day as promised .
F	however they were nir able to fullfill my irder by the date they said .
M	i can '_t believe the post_office is to blame , so either it is a way to penalise free post users or they can '_t cope with the volume .
F	what they show on the site is not what you get .
M	brilliant .
F	ive told everyone i know about ao couldn_'_t_believe_how reasonable my washing_machine was and it was here the next_day
M	a very good way to buy tyres .
F	ordered wheels & tyres .
F	you know when you are expecting something to be pretty awesome , but then you get it and it still way exceeds your expectations .
F	one hour after this email was written i replied_saying the changes were acceptable .
F	fonebank also kept me up to date via_email and the money was paid into my account within a few_days .
F	awaiting delivery , trying to be patient , have given one star but only to post opinion
F	i had fantastic service from ordering my new fridge_freezer , to the guys who delivered it .
M	all the great products , very good pricing , and excellent service .
M	in my opinion their entire ratings system is nothing more than deceitful .
F	my daughter was thrilled with her gift .
M	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
F	i have already_recommended to a friend .
F	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
M	sent pic by email .
M	as mobility impaired would have preferred an airport pick_up .
M	i used the online live help which was good and apparently the watch has_been ordered from luminox and not yet delivered to jura - which i wasn_'_t aware of , i assumed it was a listed stock item .
F	how good is that , a shed thats designed for outdoor use but cannot get wet .
M	they have a service where they will beat another company '_s price by 0 % which i have personally been able to use .
M	i would definitely use them again !
F	we purchased a double glass display_unit a while ago and thought we would get the matching single unit to stand next to it but it does not match at all !
F	the dog_food arrived very quickly , well_packaged and above all , the cheapest i could find on the internet .
M	the delivery company ( m & s based in warrington ) called me to arrange delivery and i was told it would be an " am " delivery , which meant 0am - 00pm .
M	thank_you . i will recommend you to others
M	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
F	i cancelled an order 0 hour after_placing it .
F	fast delivery unless you use the saver postage and then it takes_forever .
F	unhelpful girl when rang them also !!
M	cheers , scott
M	i recently_bought a present from iconic_watches for my wife .
F	i would recommend flowerbags to anyone !
M	natures_best is a great company , efficient and cuastomer friendly , i couldnt_ask for better .
F	excellent delivery , ordered on a friday , delivered on the monday !
M	took a further 0_weeks of constant emails / phone_calls to chase .
F	!
F	told by a bad tempered , rude person_who spoke bad french .
M	it would be good to provide an easy view for cost - conscious , flexible shoppers of the prices for say , 0 or 0 days before the date and 0 or 0 days after the date , so we can decide_whether to travel on the date itself or earlier or later based on prices .
F	would use company again .
F	i was impressed with the easiness of use and the variations of layout i could have on each page .
F	i '_m still_waiting for my delivery refund by the way .

M	they take over 0 days to reply to your emails .
F	this is my second time of ordering flowers theyve both been lovely arrangements , and delivered on time .
F	not only that but they look half the size and half as ' alive ' as the websites photo . and they werent cheap either !
F	wouldve still thought a good deal at full price
M	i looked to order more items from the range when i noticed that they were trying to sell them at above rrp due to the items been in sort supply , not very sporting to try cash in like that , you expect this kinda trick from 0rd_party amazon sellers .
M	i got what i exactly want .
M	the happy_puzzle catalogue is packed with fun things to catch and hold the attention of children , covering a wide_range of ages and interests .
M	wonderful idea to price match if possible depending on other purchases . ingenius !
F	on the morning of the transfer home the bus did indeed turn_up and we then received a call from reception to say that the driver was waiting !!!

M	we assume your glasses should be with you till the end of next week ."
M	it turned_out that the order hadnt arrived , and could have been delivered any time .
F	no trouble i would use them again , did everything as they said they would
F	i won_'_t be ordering again any products from them as this breaches my basic trust and it is too much hassle to try and get your money back after the fact .
M	many_thanks , will_definitely be using your company again :-) :-) :-)
F	right i have returned your slippers , was so excited when they arrived wonderfully made but so tight , i have policemans heel which is very painful to walk on but i think i need to try on cant_afford to keep sending them back , took them to washer woman on the 00thi have my receipt so can you please put my money back into my account so i can buy another pr of fitflops lovely
F	0_days_later ( so 0_weeks after the email i got saying i '_d get the code within a week ), i received an_email ( two emails , in fact ) giving me my tracking_number and saying " your tracking code will show an expected delivery date ."
M	that '_s it no more orders now i '_ll stick with tpw all the time now .
F	postage was quick , secure and it was free .
M	once you could almost take it for granted that if it was for sale in costco then you were getting the best price .
F	highly_recommended - do try them .
F	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
M	we live in south_shields but came to you as we felt our local mazda dealer ( hodgson , gateshead ) was not giving us a good deal .
M	all in all first_class service from tooled_- up .
F	tyres on the drive are quick and efficient .
F	believe me it was bad .
F	nothing to fault - great discount on north_face jacket , speedy delivery - would recommend
F	i can '_t recommend enough .
F	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
F	i then emailed them again several_times and yet again got no reply and had to ring them again .
F	however i found the service i received from the sunglasses_shop to be brilliant .
M	travelup was cheap for flight but e_- mail confirmation letter had link to a visa site that was costly .
F	i received an_email friday to say that my order ( several other items have been ordered ) was due to be dispatched .
F	although website has changed , i '_m not particularly impressed with the search_facility when i searched " yoga " i was told no results , although managed to locate lots of items after quite some time .
M	i will_definitely need use rentalcar . com again !
M	i '_ve been buying boxes for shipping artwork from kite_packaging for many_years , and the product is great .
M	i purchased a sweatshirt from the bank fashion website as it was on sale cheaper_than anywhere_else .
M	i was able to correct the components to enable assembly which was not as easy as ' it says on the tin_'.
F	but they flowers chosen by my granddaughters for their mother ( the recipient ) were specially picked for their bright_colours because she_loves them .
M	i was offered a cheaper shower - screen ( minus the fixed towel_rail ) but at no discount (!)
M	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
M	have used this company twice_now and have received perfect service both_times , website was easy to use and paying was easy .
M	00 months_ago i paid £_000 for a phone that is now worthless and does not work .
M	i was therefore quite surprised , the next_morning , to get a message from them asking if i ' d looked at their quote - i replied that i hoped that the part was on its way !
M	when i initially started_using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
F	the holes that the casters were supposed to be fitted were not not deep enough to take them .
F	i have been with orange on a business contract paying for 0 phones for over 0 years_now , i have never been with anyone_else .
M	how can they justify their charges ?.
M	my shirt arrived damaged .
M	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
F	though this was followed up the following_day with flowers delivered plus chocolates .
M	in the last few_months we have used fastrac and airporter - several_times .
F	the website is very easy to use , the rotary_drier is of superb quality and the delivery fast and efficient - couldn_'_t be better !
F	will definitely use again .
M	i had it returned and then sent it to mazuma who paid me the full £_00 that they advertised on their website .
M	good choice of trophies , speedy delivery , no_fuss , no_hassle , very happy with the service
M	it should have cost 0 pounds max .
M	always .
F	ordered 00pm at night 0 week before christmas and the cards were dispatched the next_day and arrived the following_day .
M	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
F	i will be reporting this company to trading_standards as very false_advertising and statements are made on their web_site .
M	why would i go_anywhere_else ?
F	so unfortunately damart really does not meet standards online shoppers expect : tracking , fast delivery , accurate stock info .
F	i ordered an adidas ladies tennis dress that was advertised as coming complete with bra and under shorts .
F	i don_'_t think you could get better service than that .
M	one pc has_been cloned incorrectly such that it thinks that all data should be assigned to the d drive but that is the one assigned to the optical_drive .
M	quality of glasses ok .
F	if you find anything wrong , no matter_how small , no matter what the delivery men advise . refuse to accept delivery and make them take the whole lot back .
F	i dont_think i would use this service again , i have had better flowers from other similar_sites .
F	no customer service .
F	very disappointed .
M	ordered an item .
F	fordralet :_00000 samsung i0000 galaxy_s0 croco 0 00 , 00 00 , 0000 - 00 - 00 0
M	best services i have use and will_continue
F	it didn_'_t take ten days as both arrived together in a matter of days .
M	i uploaded photos , adjusted as i liked , the prints were sent next_day !
M	______________________________________________________
F	she said that the driver knows the area i live in very well and that nobody was living there .
F	i required the order for my holidays and will now have to go without it !
M	yep , a 00 - hour_window .
M	the last place you should ever shop in .
F	product very well boxed .
M	philip , sthfrance
M	great stock , great prices and excellent staff .
F	fortunately my details were saved .
F	i went online to check delivery times / conditions only to find they can deliver as late as 0pm , the birthday is pretty_much over by that time !!
M	i placed an order on the 00th_feb_0000 .
F	very bad service , this is our second order from greenland .
M	thank_you
F	on opening the parcel i was disappointed with the quality of the product as i couldn [ t open quite a few of the drawers .
F	contacted customer_services , who were only barely helpful ( certainly didn_'_t make me feel like a valued_customer ).
M	da_vi ringede til jeres kundetjeneste lød det som om at det havde de aldrig været ude for før .
F	i am sure they have changed their name as i
M	if he had an_ounce of common_sense he would have tried both addresses , as he only tried one address .
M	booked 0 new front tyres and a wheel_alignment online .
F	excellent service with original order , but when rang for advice as i wanted to exchange for a different pair as these did not fit properly was vague and was told not many sizes available so would be better with a refund , as i really want these before my holiday i felt a bit frustrated , so have returned them and ordered an_alternative pair and am waiting for them as to whether they are suitable or not
M	very doubt i will use again .
F	perfumes are great prices , delivery was very speedy , was kept_informed of delivery details .
M	when it arrived it had my cover but was full of someone_else '_s photos - lots of pages with a full year of someone '_s life .
F	so you can go as kinky as you like or simply keep it simple for your_own pleasure , i thought i '_d try a butt plug this time , has definitely made me grin , i also tried a butterfly !!
M	i wasn_'_t convinced that i would get the keys , but they arrived ,
M	watch awesome service outstanding .
F	my mother had to throw half away .
M	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
F	disappointed and would like my money refunded !
F	clearly a company with no regard for its reputation or its customers ?
F	so basically they have had my money for 0_weeks now , not had to pay for anything at all .
M	their website says all the right things i . e “ as seen on bbc top gear ”,_“ famous reputation by providing the highest_level of customer service and after sales service in the land ”,_“ priority to any sale is the peace of mind which the customer can have ” and “ 0_star back up service and warranty second to none ”.
M	perhaps it could be made easier to change orders , no response from customer_services after 0 hoursis not acceptable .
M	i will book with aferry . co . uk again as they are a very good hub for ferry bookings , but next time i hope i don_'_t have to go chasing to find the confirmation_email .
M	so i tried to contact through the internet site ( luckily i had noted down the booking_reference at the time i booked ).
M	a week_later i received an email_informing_me that they actually did not have the correct sized product and couldn_'_t get any in , i quickly received a refund including my postage cost .
F	updates and communication were first_rate .
F	excellent service from mazuma .
F	the room was comfortable , clean and i loved having the ensuite .
M	machine arrived on time and well_packed .
M	you can '_t ask for more .
F	the delivery firm picked_up one day , delivered the next , leaving me with problems being in on 0 occasions .
F	great fabulous
M	dialtosave made it less hectic to keep track of all the international calls and so forth .
M	if you write to them you '_ll get an_automated_reply_stating that they ' re receiving unprecedented amounts of correspondence .
F	all goods ordered were / are great but i ordered the wrong ones and when i phoned up to return the handles , the new ones were immediately despatched - brilliant service .
F	i think being given confirmation of my order and delivery was brilliant and well priced too ,
F	i was recommended by a friend , so i tried it .
M	the tracking_system is faulty .
M	instructions for use could be fuller too .
F	pictures are very decieving aswell
M	it would have been helpful if they had told me that my course was being made redundant in advance .
F	easy to use software , speedy delivery and excellent quality
M	the " convenient " time could only be scheduled between 0 :_00am - 0pm monday - friday and would last 00 - 00_minutes - hardly convenient when you work full time in the sort of job that has set times ( ie lunch_break !).
M	so after countless_emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
M	love the duchamp shirt and this was a fantastic price and no delivery cost either
M	second time i '_ve_used pedalpedal and on both_occasions they '_ve delivered promptly and kept me informed all the way .
F	scottish_power get your act_together or loose a whole load of customers !
M	combine that with an easy ordering_process and fast delivery and you '_ve got a winning_combination .
F	the website is easy to use , and the deliveries have been carried_out with no problem on the date asked for .
M	all the person wanted to do was cancel my order , they were not interested in making_sure i ordered the right part .
F	!
F	so i went on - line and found partsmaster and the part i needed .
F	would definitely use them again if the need_arose .
M	six days_later , on the appointed date when i went to one of their affiliated garage to have the them fitted , having waited for more than an_hour for one of the mechanics to become_available , only to be told that the tyres haven_'_t been delivered and i should return another day .
M	i would recommend there services to anyone .
F	!
F	logged a claim months_ago about a payment that had been withdrawn .
F	0nd_pair arrived and they frames ( calvin_klein ) are so huge they fall_off my head when l look down and then one lence fell out .
M	i ended_up using my phone to find out who had what parts , which defeats the object !. dissapointing .
F	but wrong item sent .
F	thanks again to your team ,
M	it is 00th_november today .
F	absolutely useless .
F	!
F	will start thinking ab out next year earlier though !
F	would l do it again maybe !
M	these were my first oakley glasses and i was buying first time online .
M	a confirmation code is sent to your phone and you need to set_up a security question before accessing your voucher ( there is also a warning that appears stating you cannot be refunded once you view your code , which made me even more nervous , but i suppose it '_s to cover their own backs ).
M	the brands are rejects that richard bransons team sources and sells to us at over the top prices for inferior products .
M	cancelled order online at beginning of november and expected automatic refund .
M	recieved the product literally two_days after ordering .
F	ordered strange " flat_iron steaks " which have proven to be tender and tasty .
M	added after glasses directs response .
F	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed
M	postage_costs were very reasonable at £ 0 . 00 compared to other_websites .
F	simply_supplements was recommended by my doctor and he was right .
F	i rang first thing in the morning to chase_up my email .
M	i had given up on it coming yet again and then at 0pm , the doorbell rings .
F	i would recommend this to anyone .
F	it was meant to be the same quality .
F	i found my " parcel " ( corset just in a bag ) stuffed through my letter_box ( knowing that i was there all morning , i was disappointed ).
M	sure_enough , we weren_'_t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
M	i was kept up to date with order tracking and didn_'_t have to pay extra for postage .
M	cheap but has problems with signal in many places .
F	the service and delivery were second to none .
F	good delivery time and price
F	however , i was unfortunate before xmas in that they sent me an item of the wrong_size ( i . e .
M	then display the options , i ’_m not worried_about the make , laser tipped etc .
M	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .
M	the goods arrived when expected .
M	items where significantly_cheaper_than high_street pharmacists
M	after this he asked me to pay for a full_tank of gas which i gave half back , the car was great new , clean and big enough for all .
M	does what is says on the tin
M	i went_onto the insurandgo website and was very impressed with the clarity of cover and how fast and easy it was to take out the policy , i would highly_recommend insurandgo to anyone looking for travel_insurance .
M	not really impressed with these winter tights they are warm from the knee down but above the knee thay are not that good even with a pair of cycle_shorts over the top you can feel the cold and i havent been out proper winter conditions yet i wpo ; d have sent them back if i could
M	this is unacceptable .
M	i always found them to be a good store .
F	i phoned the customer service and was told to remove the inks and wipe the cartridge and re - try .
F	everthing was fine but unfortunately item was no good and had to return it . i was not impressed at all with the £_00 charge to return item which will not be refunded so therefore i '_d think_twice about ordering again think they need to start thinking_about free_returns service
F	the delivery and service were fine
M	there was a bit missing in one pack but bestheating did redeem_themselves - a quick call and a spare was on the way .
M	on the plane was ok . everything is extra_cost but that is expected from a budget_airline .
M	på interfloras dårlige service , der gemmer sig under de ringe betingelser at ' de_ikke_kan garantere levering før eller efter et bestemt tidspunkt '.
M	two phone_calls and the dispatched email finally arrived friday at 0 . 00pm .
M	when customers look at the reviews a company receives it quite_rightly expects all reviews to be shown , how else can they make a judgement .
F	after the wedding , the buttonholes and cake_toppers made splendid gifts for the family , and my sister ( bridesmaid ) and i both anticipate our bouquets brightening our homes for many_years to come .
M	i would recommend iconic_watches to anyone .
M	they advertise a next_day service and that '_s what we got .
M	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .
F	i was all day in and no one came and no call card left .
F	omg .
F	a complete_waste of money , i '_d have probably received the goods in the same amount of time if i '_d have just taken the standard delivery option .
M	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
M	the shed was to be delivered in mid april_0000 .
M	item won_'_t show up and you will be out of pocket for at_least three_weeks .
F	phoned customer service and said they would check with hermes delivery and see what happened .
M	i '_ll form an opinion when i have a fact and not a promise .
M	would not_hesitate to recommend polybags to anyone .
F	ordering the costume was easy and delivery was quick even_though i only paid the standard .
M	i indicated that i would wait .
F	escalating a problem through the system to supervisor level has no effect as they do not think in terms of customer service but rather in terms of protecting the team and not taking on any liability .
F	thanks for the privilege of having my nice bmw vandalised and not giving a shit when i reported it to your control office .
F	very pleased with the first_class service and quality of the flyer .
M	overall a not too bad_experience .
M	got an email bounce due to some shoddy forwarding they use
M	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
F	very competitive_prices .
M	it was later replaced by a temporary fridge_freezer in the dining_area .
M	great customer service team , willing to help always friendly and give great customer advice for people who have never purchased from them before .
M	customer_support is a joke , it has to be the worst i '_ve ever_encountered !
M	very happy with it .
M	any well_done sky youve ruined the experience !
F	i fail to see how anyone packing this product would think it was ok to send like this !
M	when the query was raised , your e_- mail to me did not advise that my reply should be sent to a different department .
F	i recommend pediwear socks if comfort , style and quality are what you ' re after .
M	arrived quickly .
M	dropped car off at garage
F	i will probably include more of their products on my next order .
F	would never use again .
F	great selection , price and delivery .
M	i was very disappointed with the item .
M	only to find they have them in stock so i asked richtone to refund my deposit and placed the order elsewhere , which was delivered in 00_hours with great customer service as always !
F	was very disappointed with my purchase , waste of money and will not be purchasing again !
F	by the way , the status of my order when i log in states " processing ".
F	a brilliant product range with fast & efficient service .
M	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
F	daughter replied why did nt they do it for you .
F	however , i did have a query as to whether it was the item on the website .
M	i arranged for the boiler to be delivered last thursday to a rental_property in in luton , which is about 0 miles from where i live .
F	terrible service .
M	the photographs appear grainy ( although taken on a dslr_camera )!
F	excellent service , the parcel arrived after 0_days all the way to sydney and it was is perfect_condition .
F	i phoned sunglasses_shop to check they had not been lost .
F	i was a little_aprehensive_about the service before hand .
F	i ordered my bathroom online , very easy process and very quick .
F	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
F	i sent an_email to customers service right away and asked what they would do about this .
F	found out reason for delay was out of stock .
F	contacted them by email twice , i had no response , i then contacted by phone i was told my item was returned damaged a similar story to another user and a replacement was on its way .
F	branch rang where ever and were told definitely no delivery on original item until nov .
M	so not only had they given me the same copy and paste response each week , they hadn_'_t even chased the item with the supplier and had the audacity to say that a month and a half was a slight_delay .
F	value money i would use it again
F	i was very happy with the next_day delivery service and the amount of communication with the delivery .
F	my husband & i were given this gift from our boss for christmas & despite lots of weather cancellations we finally went up in august this year & it really was fantastic !!!
F	i couple of friends had used glasses_direct which was how i heard about their service .
M	i received the tag the very next_morning , with the omega following on the day after .
M	the apartment was great ( and yes there was internet access ) the location ideal right in the heart of the old town .
F	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay away .
F	i was emailed to keep me informed on day and time , and it was delivered in the time_slot .
F	the prescription was stated on each one but there was no information as to how to use / care for the lenses .
M	outstanding service and so easy to use
F	the ink lasts so much longer .
F	i was skeptical at first so i searched around a bit and saw that they had very good reviews .
F	netflights or aa or both screwed_up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
F	they have their goods and seem to be unwilling to give my money back .
F	i have ordered glasses from glasses_direct twice in the past year - 0 pairs for the price of 0 over all and i absolutely love each pair , great quality and means i have a choice of glasses to match my outfits for the same price as one pair at my opticians !
F	00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 out for delivery
M	i spoke to american_express who told me to beware and to rely only on reputable establishments such as fnac .
M	i tried the website after an online recommendation .
F	the delivery from lesters was extremely promt .
M	you zoe bull ( littlebull - tarwbach ) zoevictoriabull @_btinternet . com seller '_s id : mckennzie00 notorious ebay thief !!
M	as such i '_m increasing my rating from 0 to 0 .
F	the module never arrived , and after trying to speak to interspares '_s customer service department on the phone ( countless messages left ) and by email , and out of sheer frustration i went out and bought another washing_machine .
M	however , the food quality doesn_'_t seem to be the best .
M	thankfully it arrived whilst i was there , but it was only by chance .
F	i work from home and this is completely_unacceptable .
M	i spent £_000 on an all - in - one pc and paid for nominated day delivery .
M	shambles .
F	plus i love their points_system !
F	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
F	the person over the phone - although was able to help me 000_% - sound very dull and bored .
M	vauxhall charge £_00 for the roof_bar key i needed - and they refuse to send them in the post .
F	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
F	however no news until i asked for a refund on 00 may_0000 !
F	the tracking_number provided was very useful for tracking the progress of the order on the post_office website .
M	it says our package has_been delivered to our neighbour below ( we ' re in flats ).
M	he completed the transaction today by reserving the seats .
M	in their_defence now that it '_s here they have made a very good job of it , and would order again , but be aware it doesn_'_t always do what it says on the tin .
F	i won a sony viao ( 0_months_ago ), this week , after several emails , they eventually tell me the item is no_longer in stock .
M	poor poor poor
M	good service but .
M	when our daughter does a wee in these it pours out like regular knickers !
M	no more cold hearts and coronets !
F	very disappointed .
M	quality - excellent , service - excellent .
F	very disappointed .
M	apparently both are now being returned to debenhams as damaged .
F	would definitely recommend !
M	card had huge mistakes due to clash with the portuguese keyboard .
F	not very impressed as it could quite easily have been stolen and i imagine that would have been a complicated and difficult situation to resolve .
F	the mail delivery officer informed that they do not do deliveries on sundays so whether there was traffic or not the flowers would not be delivered on sunday in the first place !
F	will definitely use again .
F	received a top quality product in super_fast time .
M	and surprise , surprise the insurance i paid for didn_'_t cover this delay !
F	quick easy and does what it says on the tin
M	i would recommend them without_reservation .
F	if alpharooms had communicated better with the hotel , we could have at_least been on the same floor , and our rooms would have been ready .
M	all the info was in full view , no additional searching required and quick access to the provider i chose .
M	i had pre_- booked online via resorthoppa . com .
F	i waited a few_days and received no response so emailed them again , again receiving no response .
M	this requires removing the battery for at_least one minute .
M	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con_artists called edreams .
F	i was then told to come_back today ( friday 00th , am ) so i could get the other 0 tyres_fitted .
F	therefore it was delivered when i didn_'_t actually own the house !
F	i can get a proof of the calls made and received from my phone .
M	as the selection , purchase & delivery all went very well , i can recommend go - electrical .
F	definite recommend !
F	hopefully the courier will match this level of service !!
F	i immediately notified outdoor_kit within 00_minutes of receiving the shoes .
M	there seemed to be no option not to retain my card information .
M	when you log on its all very simple , and qwick , fabtastic prices and very qwick delivery
F	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
F	thank_you .
M	the headline_says it all .
M	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so_far , works as it should .
M	at last i thought , our claim has_been accepted and this is to arrange for the repairs to be made .
F	it really took the stress away from a busy conference knowing that i would get everything on time and as_described .
M	a simple ' we acknowledge your order and would advise that we currently have no stock but a delivery is expected next week ! '
F	i have kept her terse emails , and vowed as a result not to use pro_cook again .
M	all the metal lugs on every fitting needed to be widened with a screw_driver to fit .
M	i really would advise you all to shop elsewhere .
F	thanks for some lovely goods
M	i was due my refund on december 00th but did not receive it .
M	because it '_s a large box - you really need to be there waiting !
F	i feel that no consideration is being given to the ability of passengers to walk the distance involved .
M	otherwise i recommend the experience , wish i had done it sooner .
F	the quality of the product is excellent and the service received was excellent .
F	it was not finished well and will have to make adjustments to it to make it look ok
M	rather_than abandon lenstore i did a search for a discount_voucher and discovered a new customer discount of 00_% i . e .
F	delivered the next_day ( saturday ) by 00 am .
M	i came to talktalk business after being a nildram and then pipex customer ( being passed along the line after acquisition .)
M	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth_floor in a building in london .
M	wanted to pay cash on the day , no such option .
M	thanks for the response , but it does not state delivery times on the home page and i cannot see where it says 00 working_days on the delivery information page either .
M	payment was received quickly .
F	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
F	got on bus from carpark asking driver to drop us back at travelodge , his answer no could only take us to airport even_though he was passing it .
F	eflorist was very happy to take my money but did not bother to reply to my email .
M	always great prices and often a good range of car_parks and services .
M	they are now refusing to pay postage_costs for returning the items even_though they were dead on arrival .
F	recently had a v bad reaction to vitamin_d supplements - in retrospect i probably overdosed .
F	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
M	now made arrangements to fit elsewhere which is costing more than tyre leaders original quote .
F	amazing , placed my order at tea time and received the goods next_day , brilliant .
F	smooth process until waiting for payment .
M	i followed the driver '_s delivery route online , and he appeared on the dot .
F	if by some miracle an item does turn_up they will throw it into the back garden or leave it by a rear door and leave no card
F	tech_support is very good and most people very knowledgeable .
M	it often pays to shop around rather_than using quidco - it '_s not unusual to find someone selling something cheaper_than a quidco retailer , even after taking the cashback into account .
M	then silence for a day .
M	the airram is more than perfect .
M	on return of our holiday it was the same , rang them when collecting the luggage and car was waiting outside .
M	hopeless .
F	no such luck .
M	sometimes you win - i '_ve no_problems with yodel , i live on the edge of civilisation in scotland and have to have to lot of stuff delivered .
F	really quick delivery and well priced .
F	please . after all the bad_reviews you lot are still not going to look for ways to improve your service ???
M	i told aol when i ordered a washing_machine that access to my home was via narrow lanes and a big lorry wouldn_'_t be able to make it .
M	would use again and again
F	viagogo response ( not followed up despite my providing the info requested ):
M	so yet another example of chess '_s terrible customer_services and dodgy business_practices .
F	we would certainly use trading_depot again .
M	i rang up and the customer service attendant said that they had the correct one in stock , and he ' d hold it over for me .
M	customer service is not a priority at ryanair .
F	had the guide been timely we would '_ve had one full hour however we were left with just 00_minutes to order and eat dinner .
M	like ed , i ordered my battery ( sony vgp - bps0 ) before i saw the reviews and assumed i ' d thrown my money away .
F	thank_you !
F	i have found the whole_experience of using parcel0go very very stressful , upsetting , time_consuming and costly .
F	thank_you !
F	the fire is cast_iron and came in 0 parts and it is very heavy .
M	would not_hesitate to use this company again .
F	my order was delivered in amazingly quick time .
M	flowers were ok but not as good as website and didn_'_t last that long before they started to die
M	it took about a week to be delivered , which is not really up to standard , and i found out they had sent me the wrong item .
F	i gave up scanning my books in the end as they kept being rejected .
F	the website and all the marketing seems geared to existing users , which is not only unhelpful for new users , it is frankly slightly intimidating , making new users feel inadequite for not being_able to understand the various products , and what they need to include in their first order .
F	i went to the till , they did not have the size so i asked for a credit_note or if another branch had them .
F	but it could only be paid that way and not over the phone or anything which i thought was so wrong .
F	was sent a " rose & lily hand_tied ".
M	delivery is also free for orders over £_00 . 00 .
F	placed request to switch through uswitch on 00 february_0000 .
F	great service , thank_you .
F	good prices .
F	i love the product and loves the payment plans as well .
F	i have ordered flowers from tele florist before - my mum said they were stunning !
F	i received two dozen_red_roses last saturday from serenata_flowers - not ordered by me - but if this was a sales promotion it was very inspired and and made one aware of the quality provided from serenata .
F	the site said it was in stock and i should receive it in 0days .
M	marks and spencers was once called an institution but now more of in an institution , a true shame that they seem so lost .
M	note : although i was given the car free of charge it did mean that i had to pay double the petrol money for all of us to enjoy the outings we had planned .
M	haven_'_t sent it back yet but will be .
M	nearly 0_weeks_ago i received and email_saying that the refund had been issued and i can expect money in 00 days .
M	check out took only 0 minutes as a result .
M	their cheap package also doesn_'_t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
M	those fees when compared to your competitors are much higher .
F	with my last order i also bought household products and again the prices were lower_than the largest supermarket chain .
M	i was insured with multitrip last_year , this year when the renewal came in my premium had increased by £_00 , i learned that the increase was because i was no one year older and that at 00 years of age the premiums increased , despite this i was offered a very small discount .
F	but no function for this eather .
M	i particularly_liked the option to filter products according to price , height , width etc , and this made it easy to choose the right product for me .
F	i use the whiskey_exchange every time i need to order drinks on line , the web_site is easy to use , the driver is always very courteous , a pleasure to do_business with
M	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
F	it '_s a shame , because i '_m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn_'_t say if something is out of stock .
M	we did not appreciate the delay in delivery when royal_mail would have delivered it on time .
F	no_problems at all .
M	good service , quick delivery , no_problems
F	when unwrapped the tree looked healthy and of a nice shape .
F	and your account is to follow .
M	0 .
F	i ordered my hotpoint_fridge and hotpoint dishwasher on a monday had next_day delivery but arrived on the wednesday as i ordered after 0pm on monday .
M	!
F	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
F	not happy at all and would definitely not use the site again .
M	the web_site was very easy to use and the delivery service was second to none .
F	they felt more like a mans , as they were tight in the hips but loose around the waist .
F	hope it turns_up by the 00th .
F	that will help me decide_whether to use your site again for future orders .
M	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
M	the mantle was 00 times better_than_expected thanks again james .
F	the quality of the prints have always been professional .
M	again , ratings are largely meaningless .
M	after_posting my review i received the reply shown below from yodel which states that my parcel is out for delivery !
M	the whole_thing was very efficient .
M	i received notification of safe receipt of my goods the day after_posting and payment in my account 0 days_later . great service and better_than some of the ' fly by night ' phone buyers that appear to give you £_00 more but drag their_heels when paying you .
F	a really disappointing lack of feedback as to what i have just purchased using my valuable credit_card .
F	brilliant fast ordering and even faster delivery , couldn_'_t_believe it .
M	i think this is a brilliant concept that i will use every time i go on holidays in the future .
F	top rooms is quick and easy to use but i booked a balcony room in lynton , devon and chose a particular guest_house because of the balcony and views .
F	when i phoned my mother to wish her a happy birthday that evening i was absolutely disappointed ( to say the least !)
M	however they won_'_t fit over champagne cork cages .
F	meanwhile we have no bed to sleep on as we got rid of our old bed !
M	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again .
M	wow !
F	i would recommend amigo because they are very accommodating and very friendly to the applicant , they check to see whether you can_afford the repayments and are also helpful to the guarantor !
F	from a choice of small , medium or large basket of summer flowers i selected large to be sent to new_zealand .
F	as it worked out , both lots of flowers were delivered on saturday - i '_m guessing they were rather busy on sunday !
F	we ordered some of the plan dollhouse furniture to add to my daughter '_s ever expanding residence .
M	a total refund was expected of £_000 but i got £_000 .
M	thanks to rich and the guys who really went the extra_mile to help me buy my motocaddy trolley .
M	thank_you
F	customer service is so poor it is virtually non - existant .
M	0 days_later so i ask for refund within 0 working_days .
F	the fire_extinguisher and fire_blanket i ordered was a great price , delivered free and very very fast .
M	.
M	my order was delivered within 00_hours .
M	unfortunately despite a great deal and fantastic personal service on delivery , the item was let_down by a badly_damaged front_wheel .
F	product was reasonably_priced and fitted_perfectly .
M	we have been charged this amount before by holiday autoes for a 0 day holiday .
F	i went to glasses_direct for the price but came away amazed by their service .
M	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
M	used to be my one - stop - shop , but since the kingfisher ( b_& q ) takeover prices have gone_through the roof .
M	arrived quickly and fittedmirrorsandglass were very helpful and responded quickly when i asked ( the night before ) , to ask the courier to put the item in my garden .
M	it got here eventually , 0 days late .
F	within minutes they came back to me with a positive decision , found a car trading centre and fixed me up with an_appointment .
F	this website to anyone & being my first
M	the google_checkout wouldn_'_t accept the delivery address .
M	apparently there were five people in a similar_situation and i actually met one of them who had been there for three hours trying to get a resolution .
F	i just wish i '_d been told earlier about the delay so that i could have rescheduled the builder .
F	they eventually said that it would be delivered the next_day .
F	it timed me out in like 00_minutes of me trying to figure_out if the ticket was good for me .
F	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
M	many_thanks .
F	problem was the ' collect +' service did not work as the incorrect label had been sent to me by superdry .
F	i also phoned you after i had sent in my order to say i didn_'_t realize that i had to put in a code for the 0 for 0 offer so i paid full price .
F	!
M	i have tried earlier with another us based well_known website , but they were never able to deliver it to europe somehow .
M	then next_day we got a good transfer back to the boat and a cracking sail home !!!
F	easy to order and colours are vibrant , just what i ordered .
M	staff say they '_ll call back ( as theyre not sure why the order has not been sent ) and never call back !!
F	both were confirmed for delivery but only the base arrived at 00 . 00 .
F	nice email from the company but things i have ordered from other people generally arrive within a couple of days - so what happened here ?
F	with regards to this particular hotel , unlike our expedia special rate hotels , we do not have a room contract with the property and our website is used as a portal by the hotel to facilitate booking .
F	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
F	i know the weather cannot be controlled but i feel under the circumstances the trip may have been cancelled or at_least a refund offered at the time .
F	if you want a fast service i would always recommend them as they are also so very reliable !
F	chemist_direct not only offered the cheapest available prices for the pet dietary_food i needed to buy but the service was swift ; goods arrived securely ( not_overly ) packaged no later than mid - morning of the next_day ( with the £ 0 . 00 next_day service ), eventhough i '_d ordered the goods after the advised cut - off time ( 0pm ) the day before .
F	the seller is now claiming to have delivered the item , when you can see from his email below that that he had already accepted that was not the case !)
F	we ate out a lot so we didn_'_t need much in the way of cooking facilities .
M	after lots of research_into bike lights , i found the cycle_store web_site to be helpful and the price very competitive .
M	0 contacted pixmania the next_day and was told i would be notified in 00_hours of the appropriate_action and refund i managed to get across that i wanted a replacement not a refund .
M	- chat room : nice but they have a tendency at sticking to the book and not really helping you .
M	i wasn_'_t best pleased i had been waiting in all morning for no reason .
M	lucky my gf was still happy as it '_s the thought that counts .
F	never again will i pay over the odds for stylish prescription glasses from a shop .
M	free 0st_class delivery , good price , nice juice .
M	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
F	its great having the menu prepared and not having to think what to have .
M	buy with confidence .
F	first my blinds came without_any of the fittings needed to hang them .
M	in a nutshell probably not the best site to use if you need your items quickly .
M	be aware that paying out bonuses is discretionary ( read small_print )
F	i have been lucky_enough to have some of my work exhibited in the artist of the year exhibition and very much appreciate the exposure this has given me , as well as the confidence to continue to paint .
M	ordered a shower_screen , item cost over £_000 , nearly_£_00 for delivery .
M	do i really want all and sundry to know that i may have brought bed_bugs back from holiday .?
F	if so , please let_me know
F	what a great idea !
F	the order came on day two .
M	he did helpfully suggest that i sell it on ebay , so that wasw useful !
M	£_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else for frontline , will be buying again .
M	next_day delivery has always been on time
M	but they don_'_t .
M	when things go badly ( returns , out of stock etc ) you never seem to get it right .
F	had to help him upstairs ( not easy for woman in her 00s ).
F	absolutely best service , price , convenience , quality .
F	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0_months .
M	0 hours
M	i can '_t be fairer or more honest than that
F	will not be booking with you again
F	amazing roller_coaster arrived promptly and well_packaged .
M	flowers was bought and ordered on the 0th_june for a delivery date 00th_june_0000 for my mothers_birthday , thay was not sent at all i had email them 0 times to get a answer finally thay admitted it was a big_mistake on there side , my mother was not happy with the service and she was very upset as u can imaging on her 00rd birthday no flowers from her son who_lives 00000iles away in auz , i would never buy or recommend this outfit to any one
M	thank_you , what else needs to be said .
F	best regards
M	very straightforward , no_problems and the said item was delivered exactly on time even_though we live on an island off the west_coast of scotland !
F	?
F	i put order in thursday last_week and still do not have it where is it have not email about delivering jet
F	the parcel wasn_'_t damaged in any way .
M	job_done , perfect !
M	i noticed that you took the money from my account .
F	the options on fonebank . com '_s website were ' working ' or ' not working '; for a ' working ' model the cashback was £ 0ish and for a ' not working ' model it was 00p ( paid as an amazon_voucher ).
M	it was over 0 month before i received my money back on the original purchase , and i received no offer of compensation for my bad_experience .
F	if they can email you to start with to say when they are coming then why can they email to say " actually you have wasted a whole day at home waiting as we have more important things to do than come to your address and deliver your parcel the day we said we would " if i hadn_'_t of contacted them they just not have turned_up a shocking way to provide a service .
F	there was plenty of credit on it so no poblem with cash shortage .
M	i was truly_amazed when i ordered my mothers_birthday_present on the friday_afternoon and had it delivered first thing saturday_morning .
F	your car is well cared for and the actual parking and bus are very good .
M	not the cheapest for all the batteries i required at the time so i didn_'_t order everything i needed from battery_force .
F	i will not buy from them again and would advise anyone_thinking of doing so to cross their fingers that the correct set of equipment arrives .
F	thank_you for the great service .
F	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven_'_t received my package .
F	if you know what your looking for they are generally the cheapest and service cannot be_faulted .
F	i was looking for some wow_factor invites and that exactly_what i got .
F	use a reputable_company , not play . com !
M	posted it to them via special delivery ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) and just had two emails , one to say they '_ve received it today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) and the other a couple of hours_later to say that everything is ok and they '_ll be paying me today , straight into my bank .
F	if in doubt then say so on the web_site .
M	always found cheaper prices onlinr and elsewhere
F	the delivery times can be a bit hit and miss . good varity of books and reasonable_prices saves the day ,
M	and now , suddenly , within the past 00_hours , fifteen people have given this company five_stars .
F	so , i arranged re - delivery again for a day someone was going to be in , and i found out he couldn_'_t even leave it with the neighbour because it required a signature .
F	so , it was my sisters_00th_birthday , i live in america and am the only family_member not able to celebrate with her so thought i '_d wow her with a surprise of beautiful flowers and lots of chocolates .
F	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
F	would not advise using this company and how do i tell the lovely friend that sent them for christmas that they came in a split sodden cardboard_box and the flowers looked very forlorn .
M	this was a little frustrating having spent quite a bit of time choosing a vehicle .
F	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .
F	i had to cancel and rebook with city_link , who did show up on time .
M	i ordered another watch , it was small in size ; obviously links were missing - they did not charge me for postage initially , but when returned for refund , they charged me for postage !
F	the impression given by the pictures on the website is misleading in my view .
M	used website .
M	just what you want from an online store .
F	the first one i discarded as i thought that it was just a one - off .
M	although there was a 0 week delay with delivery i was kept_informed_throughout and when they arrived i was happy with the service i received .
M	well , that was good - needed a legal document sent to poland , so booked a collection in the evening , courier came 0 . 00am next_day and delivered to warsaw by 0 . 00am the following_morning , so 00_hrs from booking to delivery .
F	the service was personal and efficient and the end product was beautiful .
F	which didn_'_t really impress upon me the idea that they were a serious online_retailer .
M	even over the internet the friendliness of the service , the feeling of person to person contact , is winningly palpable .
M	<><
F	however , whilst i like it i am really not sure about the quality .
M	she was very disappointed she didn_'_t expect this and to be honest i didn_'_t either .
M	car was old
M	a lot of the suppliers in the heritage car game really need to get their act_together .
F	i would not trust them again for ordering anything such as this , for such an expensive item costing more than a lot of their tumble driers and washers they should take more care and have more respect for the customers by giving it the best chance of getting to them undamaged and in good condition by using protective_packaging .
F	i will be ordering again and i have been already promoting the website
M	!
F	embrassed that i sent these flowers as a present it made me look cheap !
M	when you use the live_chat service you get a team of uncaring individuals who just give you stock answers to your questions like " i '_m sorry i can '_t answer that for you at the moment ".
F	! but rather ridiculous almost as an after thought , not quite the service i expected . had i known such late delivery i wouldnt have booked them . did use them once before and same happened although i thought it was because the first recipient lived in the middle of countryside . this was on outskirts of london .
F	i will be sticking to nice ' n ' naughty from now on !
M	00_hours_later still no joy and a further 00_hours until i '_m due to get a response - never again .
F	just do not like it .
F	all separate_orders .
M	i was at first impressed by such a huge product range available so thought i would take_advantage and buy a few items .
F	i wasn_'_t happy with the quality of 0 of the products i had purchased from british_corner_shop and so requested a refund .
F	also to compare the locations and prices .
F	i would now like a full_refund - can wowcher confirm how they would like me to do this - given that their merchant does not respond ?
F	my boyfriend himself tried to buy the same item at the same time for his_mate for christmas and of course this never turned_up either and he never got his money back .
F	they sent a lot of emails so i knew where my phone was and when i would get my cheque .
F	all i will add is that returns are not £ 0 . 00 .
F	ordering something that needs a prescription needs time so be prepared to wait .
F	quite happy with the hoover , not so happy having to wait for the delivery they had mr address and post_code , but couldn_'_t be bothered to find us , because it was the end of the day it was delivered the day after , after the phone_call for directions i should have had the day before !!!!
M	will be using these again !
M	they did say we could make a purchase at cost price as compensation but i wouldn_'_t deal with them again if there were no other_companies on the internet .
M	when buying almost anything , goods or services , it is always best to check it out first to see if what you want is available there and then be even more in pocket !
M	a few issues - the website payment service failed , the correction to my postal_address was ignored , they used my work e_- mail in error and the box the watch arrived in did not relate to the watch i bought .
M	i bought some verifocals in may 0000 and had them within a week .
F	these tiles were really good value , they were delivered quickly and they look great .
M	it arrived very quickly .
M	having said that , when they did get my phone , they did pay 000_% of the price offered and very quickly .
M	the delivery service couldn_'_t be_faulted either .
F	so to find that money gone from my account meant i had no money for my electricity for over the weekend and my electricity ran_out this morning ( i had used the emergency credit ) so i was panicking of course and i cannot even describe the hassle i went through to borrow money to put on my meter and actually spent my saturday_afternoon in tears thanks to hungry_house and it is not just about an e_- mail of apology and a refund of my money in 0 working_days as it is of no use to me when it was my money for my electricity for over the weekend !
F	we '_d like to look into what happened here but cannot trace your order from the email reference_numbers you have sent .
F	of all the wedding flower suppliers i considered ( real and silk ), silk_blooms offered the best range and creativity with prices in line with or better_than most other_places so i gave them a call .
F	i have left various messages and spoken to the operator on a couple of occasions but still we wait .
F	haven_'_t heard back from recipient in grimsby .
M	good quick service only problem was delivery .

M	for the second time this year i begrudgingly placed an order with the hut , the item was showing as in stock and despatch within 00_hours .
F	the driver was really friendly and put the delivery where i wanted it .
M	arrived at destination at 00 . 00
F	easy to use website , clear communication , swift delivery .
F	anyone want to buy a pewter gaming_bean_bag ?
F	i '_ve given collectplus too many chances and just can '_t take the risk any more - my ebay feedback is too important to me .
M	always love the gear and prices - always get_stung by tagging on the vat at the end of the order .
M	having been ripped_off for years by western_union , it was refreshing to find a new company that operated a transparent foreign_exchange transfer .
F	the response , when i refused to give up on the mysterious hanger - uppers , was scripted , apportioning blame to courier and systems in place , and lacked sincerity and empathy - which i '_m not surprised by really as judging_by the amount of poor reviews on both here and fb , the " customer service team " ( hahaha ) must be on the same loop as the musak * shudders *.
M	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
F	definately considering using the company for my weekly clean .
F	my complaint regarding vodafone
M	he also just read t '_s and c '_s at me saying emails were no good and i had to phone them .
M	on further inspection i received 000 cards 000 correct and 000 incorrect .
M	overall , great products , great prices and great delivery .
F	i do now own a lovely photo_book of our travels , however the whole_experience was arduous and annoying to say the least .
M	i had two upvc doors installed in january .
F	and a nice present of a highlighter !
F	they really need to look into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
M	i did call to enquire_about a lack of email confirmation that the printer was being shipped on time and was put through to a polite but rather lack - lustre and seemingly disinterested customer service employee who explained that they had no further information on my order other than what i could see myself when logged in to the " my orders " section of their website which i found quite astonishing .
M	very good service .
M	i built three systems with parts from scan .
M	i wasn_'_t overly worried_about the delay and would '_ve been less nervous if they had updated me about stocks earlier .
F	on the first evening we ate at the blue_ribbon restaurant , and the food was excellent , but the waiter tried to sell us wine at £_00 . 00 per bottle and made us feel like paupers for having cheaper bottles .
M	!
F	guess_what , the case was broken .
M	rapid delivery and old_fashioned service .
M	in my view they are not !
F	reply to feedem :
F	i contacted them first to see if i could do one big order but they couldn_'_t do it for me so i had to sit & plough thru it for myself .
M	i always look there first .
M	within 00_minutes i had a ' hit ' with a competetive quoted price .
M	( trust me i have tried many !)
M	and of course the return period was over so i lost £_00 .
M	a good range of items from chop sticks to sushi making kits .
F	had to order 0 can openers in the end as the first 0 were faulty - customer service always good although quite slow in the 0rd replacement - great can opener now i have one that works !!
F	i put the wrong_address , gave a landline contact number and was out all day !
F	simple .
M	they may have the best prices , but it '_s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
F	i '_m not really sure what i expected from ready - prepared food .
F	they also emailed three_times , once to let_me know the flowers were being put_together by a florist in the area ( the same area that e_florist told me couldn_'_t do it ) a second to say they were on their way and finally one to let_me know they had been delivered -- now that '_s service .
M	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
M	?
M	in the meantime all the other shops have now run out of stock , so i can '_t even buy a replacement elsewhere .
M	i had to wait over 0_weeks for delivery and sending out sunglasses with no tint at all tells_me that there is not too much or very little of a quality control .
F	i paid smartbuyglasses for some frames on 00 / 00 /_0000 , my first_attempt to pay by credit_card failed , so i opted to pay via my paypal_account ( one of my wiser moves ).
F	thank_you russell & team so much the free gift with the overlocker was a wonderful surprise :).
M	thanks to all at villa_plus .
M	ordered a replacement coupler for my shower_pump which arrived the next_day .
F	i would be very cautious_about using again for that reason as only the small size images looked any good .
M	haveing tried for almost a month on a similar site call the garden shop to be totally let_down twice and ill never go back garden for less will_definately get my custom again

F	see abovemy supposed e ticket is incomprehensible
F	brilliant .
F	amazingly order was reviewed the very next_day and money was transferred an_hour later .
M	they were then taken to the local_depot and she was told she could not pick them up for 00_hours .
F	our neighbour has reported to us he does it constantly !
M	i purchased a sealey stw0000 torque_wrench from ffx , it was a very competitive price and arrived within a couple of days .
F	tryed to buy jewelry set as a present only for the last two_days the link saying no deal found after paying , checking my bank_statement this morning to find they '_ve charcged me 00 . 00 twice !!
F	job_done .
M	very happy with made . com .
M	so .
F	i have complained about this numerous_times and have been repeatedly fobbed_off .
M	diversity of diet techniques from rapid weight_loss to long_term adjustments means that one can try an_alternative technique if one suddenly finds oneself struggling with temptation or suddenly more motivated to see a quicker weight_loss .
F	as this special aunt does not live close to us and does not have a telephone - she has to walk to a phone box . really not in the 00st_century and does not help matters !
F	bought honeypot bramble playhouse for my granddaughters - thought it sounded really good - not so .
F	however p_&_p v . expensive as it comes from spain .
F	one customer service representative told me that photoworld received thousands of orders and cannot be expected to trace every one of them .
F	i contacted wowcher for a refund 0_weeks_ago and the only response i have received is a copy of the email they sent to the salon 0_days_later .
F	i called up to rectify the problem and there was no explanation for what had gone wrong or any apologies or discount .
F	waste of money .
M	so after 0_weeks nothing was here , called up their abysmal customer service to be dealt_with by a very argumentative advisor with the worst attitude , blaming royal_mail , telling_me to wait longer , to go the sorting_office , anything to detract blame from themselves .
F	the delivery was pretty unsatisfactory - expensive at £ 0 . 00 and slow , took about 0_days to arrive .
M	wait another 00 working_days apparently .
M	asked for their guidance on selecting a replacement as stock_levels low and few sizes and was just sent a link to their web_site , bikes now gone back and waiting for guidance on how to proceed .
F	by 0 : 00 i still had not received the goods or a call from the store to inform_me to what was happening .
F	i '_m absolutely_delighted
M	ordered the cheapest beech_worktop on sale for a utility_room , and was expecting a very " blotchy " affair made up of cheap multicoloured woods .
M	clear account offer a really good alternative to payday lending and they are cheaper !
F	why or why do companies do this !
F	i was happy with making my purchase as the glasses were a good price .
F	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
M	as a result delivery missed my clients deadline .
F	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone_call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i '_ve heard that one before !
F	happy with the insurance and the people are lovely but i am not happy with the amount of hastle i have received !
F	very happy with the service , very quick delivery would recommend .
M	this is an area where high_street_opticians score of course .
M	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
M	i was dealing_with a lady .
F	the bench is nice but the feet do not angle out as on the pictures .
F	in fact , the way it worked was that i could text tutors but not actually meet up with one without first selecting that tutor , paying the fee and having a situation where that tutor was deemed to have been chosen without us even meeting .
F	!
F	sincerely ,
F	you get free delivery but i selected to pay for 0st_class delivery as i needed the products urgently .
M	upon placing order i was asked to change my preferred colour as it would take a longer delivery time , i was then given three choices and told the car was in the compound and would be delivered to me in 00 days .
F	the site is great , easy to use and i normally use the collection option for my orders which is free .
M	the only potential downside is that i assume goods purchased from_hk will not be eligible for a uk warranty ( classed_as grey_imports ), but should anything go_wrong with the lens or future_purchases , then i just hope digitalrev can deal with the return in an efficient and painless manner as they were to deal with when buying the goods in the first place .
M	why ?
F	one of the parts did not fit so spoke to maxine in customer service who said she would either get me a spare_part or deliver another stand the next_day .
M	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn_'_t answer any questions !
F	i completed the online form with my address and the recipient '_s address .
F	not a good experience although the item is great .
M	will use again .
M	i hadn_'_t done anything wrong , all i had done was order from amazon and paid straight_away .
F	called the customer service but is absolutely no helpful .
M	super quick delivery
M	i really can understand how a company like this can still be in business .
M	waited 00_mins in the end to get the car collected .
F	i love the msm_beauty cream , it melts on your fingers and face and is lovely to masage in .
M	many_thanks in the end .
M	our delivery conditions obviously not and discuss_options with us
F	the service has_been excellent every time and shipping is fast too .
F	first issue : if i want to change the quantity , i have to start all over again , making a new order .
F	i was then told by the guy there is no need to check we just pay for any damage !
M	on oft advice i sent a further , final , letter to qs .
F	i bought a samsung laptop which arrived yesterday .
F	i am very disapointed in the service .

F	hopefully paypal will help .
F	telling all my friends about this fab company .
M	they still owe me money - but its not worth the hassle trying to get it back
F	!
F	we were kept_informed of the exact delivery .
F	complete_care shop shows nothing but contempt towards its customers once its got your money !
M	i tried to ring customer service but the line was dead .
F	i ordered persil advance on 00th_april .
M	parcel arrived the next_day . brilliant
M	neither flowers nor delivery worth the money i paid .
F	easy to order on line , easy ways to pay , and very little time needed to complete order .
F	very happy with fragrance_direct as they delivery is speedy and the price is very competitive .
F	i am 00 this year but felt 00 years older until i had this done - now i feel younger and much more confident - even walking into a room full of people , i can now see their_faces .
F	just what i ordered .
M	them .
M	best price on the net .
M	the villa has many plus points , it was spacious , clean and had everything you needed for a lovely holiday .
M	a number of the cream coloured roses were tinged with brown and the freesias only lasted a day .
F	the boat was not travelling and so by the time the pilot landed and we finally embarked we arrived at the drop_off point in amsterdam at 0 . 00pm meaning we only had 0 hour in amsterdam - in the dark !
M	great products that come recommended .
F	only 0 sofa turned_up .
F	i needed a new laptop as the one i had wasn_'_t good enough for what i needed .
F	got money back on an item i was going to buy on stores own a site so using top_cash_back it cost me even less
F	avoid this company !
M	i decided to take a punt .
F	seriously , avoid this company - i can '_t_believe that they are legally allowed to continue trading , such is the breadth of their incompetence and downright shifty business practices .
F	the picture was a false representation of what you receive .
F	quite straight_forward
M	our joiner told us this would be very expensive .
F	luckily , got taken to the correct house by honest people who lived there !
F	customer_services were very efficient and refunded the delivery charge which had wrongly been added to my order .
F	these cigarellos are perfect to give that ' touch of class ' to a cake .
F	my second phone was stolen and reported with a police and insurance number .
F	the value of the perfume was lower_than other_retailers .
F	i have lost money on phonecalls and time waiting in for a delivery that never arrives
M	plus they claim that as an ' oap ' i have been using up to 00 gb '_s in the first two_days
F	but all '_s well that ends well and thank_you .
M	the price is the best around you won_'_t find them cheaper unless it '_s second_hand .
F	very quick delivery
F	this service is easy to use at very reasonable charges .
M	a real_shame .
M	i would reccomend simplygames to everyone as it stands_out from other_websites .
F	when i took the flowers out and put them in a vase they toppled out as the stems had been cut too short .
M	thanks guys !
M	i '_ll certainly use winwware again
F	ordered in january_sale on 00th_jan_0000 .
M	loved the flowers online , especially as they said they could deliver same day .
F	00 drop was actually 00 !
M	i called 0 days ago , got put on hold for 00mins than gave up and emailed instead .
M	0_weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
F	the wig that i ordered turned_up frizzy with a massive kink down the middle from how it had been packaged .
M	a subsequent delivery date was also not met , and i am still_awaiting delivery of it .
F	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
F	it was delivered a day late and was damaged on arrival , despite clear_instructions that the parcel was very fragile .
M	i had to chase up the order by email and instead of a personnel response was sent a standard response asking me to give feedback on the service .
M	thanx for the caring service folks , keep it up at the wiz !
F	the company was really efficient and the product arrived quickly , well_packaged and as_described
M	when i say ' upgraded ' take that with a pinch of salt .
M	frustrating at the time .
F	my goods had been left with a neighbour which i was glad about but it would have been nice to have known this was where they were .
F	00 days_later , many phone_calls with long waiting times and many emails , i still have not received any refund and am told it may be at_least another 00 days .
M	ordering online was easy .
M	well really , my solicitor advised me to take this to court .
M	for those of us on a budget but want a decent camera , look no farther than digitalrev . com .
M	very competitive price .
M	( 0 months down the line and im still with out frame and my £ 0000 .
M	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible . so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave_me a full_refund .
F	doesn_'_t deserve a star .
M	there is plenty of padding in these shorts which makes them great for long_distance riding .
M	only had this a week and the band it is already splitting .
F	i heard from family around 00am that we had lost a loved one in the isle of man and wanted to send some flowers just to let them know we were thinking_about them .
M	my purchases have gone without_any real incident but i do have a complaint when asking for information .
M	this pan shows to perform very well .
F	i hope the cards i will hand won_'_t get totally unreadable within a few_days , this would not make a good impression .
M	very good material and fast delivery
M	i shopped_around different online tyre stores before buying a new set of tyres for my wife '_s car .
M	your website and ordering_process confirmed the item was in stock when in effect the item was not in stock .
M	the amazon platform is very easy to use & i like the way the site knows you and has reccomendations .
M	grrrrrr .
F	i ordered , on 00 / 0 / 00 a kingsize_bed which was supposed to be in stock as it was under clearance and 0 bedside_tables .
F	i have not received the perfume , and it cost me £_00 . 00 i am very disapointed in this company and want a refund of my money .
M	had front_wheel_bearing and tracking done charged extra (£_00 ), 0weeks later i had front tyres changed due to excessive_wear and tracking at same time £_00 ( half price ), i was told 0mm out .
M	like most people i was attracted_by the price , and the ease of use of their website .
F	bee
M	tomorrow will be the sixth day since i placed the order !
F	the posy was still beautiful but i am very dissapointed especially for my reasons behind selecting this one .
M	surfdome always have top quality and deliver really quickly
F	however , the outside of the car was in terrible condition .
F	just done my first order , delighted with prices and service .
F	excellent service and husband now using this also .
M	i only hope the alternative tyres will arrive or that there will be no problem with a refund !!!
F	the best online shop i '_ve_used .
M	the cost of the hire car when i enquired 00 jan 00 was £_00 after waiting for the
F	i had a problem where my order was rejected - the reason being that it was too far ( if you could say 0 mile was too far !)
F	couldn_'_t be_happier with the service i have received from affordablesupplements .
M	emails are ( eventually ) responded to by non - english personnel so stuff gets lost in translation !
M	reckon they should be active opt in rather_than passive .
F	dog '_s meds ran_out yesterday .
F	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
F	they took the payment immediately and then emailed to say that the product would not be sent for over a month .
M	bravofly : " oh , jesus , i don_'_t know !
M	i booked an apartment in paris and made the deposit payment by creditcard only to find out days_later that the apartment was actually not available .
F	i don_'_t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
F	no response .
F	will never shop with them again .
F	to suit us .
F	the packets i '_ve had to date don_'_t have any of those nasty additive after tangs , not sure how they '_ve done it but you can also recognise clearly the ingredients , they aren_'_t made up of the usual sloppy mess you get in some packet products that i '_ve tried and wasted before .
F	the initial response was excellent and the telephone interviewer was very helpful .
M	i ordered some flowers for my wife '_s on our_anniversary .
M	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
M	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without_any warning .
F	so i '_ll never buy from them and i ’ ve told family and friends not to , so just splash_out the slight extra money and be happy with the knowledge that you will get your item !
F	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
F	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
M	great prices ( half price of shop where fitting took place ).
M	whenever i follow trip_advisor ’_s top_rated restaurants quite a number of times , i get disappointed about the quality of the food and the big hole in my pocket .
F	!
M	that never happened the last time .".
M	nobody got in touch to ask why id cancelled they are now just writing letters demanding payment .
M	it is very refreshing to find a company that makes it '_s customers satisfaction their priority .
M	to make things worst , they took the money straight_away , with no emails about any updates about my order .
F	had not recieved it a week_later , i e_- mailed them to ask how long it would take , was told item out of stock , getting more in next week .
M	it might only be 00p but there is a principle at stake
F	not happy !
M	this company passed my order straight to another supplier who sent the goods direct to me - along with a copy of their invoice which showed the goods , packing and postage cost mytub half what they charged me .
M	but , they didn_'_t have a better pair of tyres , just a cheaper pair .
F	i have contacted the customer service line and they were actually really helpful , they just had a problem with my address .
F	there was no way of talking to the company to find out an approx delivery time - not even a morning or afternoon and i had commitments which_meant i couldn_'_t stay in all day .
M	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
F	so glad i did - my husband unpacked it and got it upstairs himself .
F	their customer service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
M	will let you know later on .
M	returns were very responsive and instructions were easy to follow .
F	( however as a frequent user of paypal , it had already been in my paypal_account for 0_days !)
F	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
F	we took the risk and used one of these , trusting our car would be there on our return .
F	sews quietly and smoothly .
F	i love the pillow - it '_s so comfy and versatile .
M	i was able to pick_up the car ok at the airport , alamo '_s staff were courteous and efficient .
F	item was as expected . service excerllant
F	considering my dog is 00 and her insurance is more than my car insurance each year any savings i can make without_compromising on quality for her is a bonus !
M	extensive selection of hostels but irritating that non - hostels or rooms where you need to book multiple beds come up when you search for one bed .
F	fantastic prompt service .
F	quick , as_described , good product , great service !
F	this was eventually unavailable .
M	i didn_'_t take up their offer and accepted a refund .
F	yes i '_m furious !
F	opening package shortbread / biscuits broken , drinks were leaking over everything :-(
F	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
F	i shopped_around quite a bit before_deciding on this product ,
M	it '_s good , quick , convenient , etc .
M	do not agree with the friction rating on the star system .
M	the problem starts with support : emails taking days to be replied to ( if at all ) and not all emails being read .
M	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
M	i found the correct_size at a good price
M	great i will be using toolstop again without_hesitation .
M	however as " deluxe " @ £_00 expected a lot more than what you would get in tesco for £_00 .
F	i have also contacted watch dog to report them .
F	at the moment i had better
F	i went to get tyres checked .
M	in short , i can '_t think of a better place to buy your ski_gear in the sure knowledge that it will be properly sold , prepared and shipped .
F	although i was exceptionally pleased with the speedy delivery of the flowers i ordered unfortunately they looked nothing like the ones i had ordered .
F	the delay in supply of the waste_baskets delayed our build and , despite the fact we were promised next_day delivery of the waste_baskets and arranged for our builders to come_back that day based on that assurance , the waste_baskets did not arrive as promised .
F	i purchased quite a few different eye make - up brushes from a variety of the collections and am pleased with every_single one !
F	please_beware .
M	well_done babla '_s
F	beautiful flowers , but bit_pricey for ten stems .
M	this is something i have never had to say before about any online company .
F	he was a very unpleasant and intimidating person .
M	top_notch
F	that was my experience during half_term at taunton asda .
M	the website then said the courier would arrive that day between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
F	the instructions say screw the " hooks " into the wall until 00mm is showing out of the wall but that '_s not possible as they have a shoulder on them and therefore the depth is not adjustable and it sticks out significantly more than that .
M	can '_t fault it , great service
F	i will totally be recommending this company to my friends and family .
M	great tyres at a very good price
M	problems ordering internationally for the second time .
M	had no problem using swiss_vans , service was excellent , any questions i had were answered straight_away , would definitely use them again .
F	around 00_hours went past before i contacted them , having not received a reply .
M	i find it very strange that these days it should be a cheque payment , it then had to be chased before it arrived .
M	emails at each_stage of process - quick delivery .
M	come on holiday_autos , you let yourself down with a cynical money_grabbing practice .
M	and the tyres i wanted without been hassled to upgrade to the next price bracket , etc .
F	also free delivery and light arrived the very next_day - what more can i say !
M	cannot recommend highly_enough .
M	and noticed a major problem .
M	communicating via_email when i want tp talk through best options / how to best avoid issues is not really customer friendly
M	really pleased with service .
F	as if .
M	price was very good , but i was completely unable to contact snowinn via the uk phone number and they did not reply to my email .
M	i would use them again but not if i really wanted to impress :-(
F	well_packaged & great quality .
M	wrong item delivered ( probably supplier error ), helpful again on being notified but received only an hours notice of exchange delivery - good job i was in as the driver had driven for several hours !!
M	catalogues and internet clear and easy to locate spares needed . once ordered kept_informed of delivery times by text . packaged well . only_critisism is unable to contact during the weekend for advice
F	when they came the holder was something you get from primark i wont_be using your site again sorry .
F	botifies them twice .
M	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
F	ordered a camcorder and a freeview_box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
F	i did get an_apology reply when i sent the relevant links to prove the info i had .
F	terrible terrible experience
F	ordered one evening , delivered within two_days .
F	i would be very wary of them - i certainly won_'_t be using protechshop again .
F	i ordered flowers for mothers_day .
F	i found the site messy and not at all user_friendly .
F	it is thickly lined and has a smart exterior .
F	great quality , prompt delivery , much_easier and cheaper then printing photos and personally putting them in an album .
F	well i will not be using you again , in fact you have put me off ordering flowers on line completely !
M	i received my flax seeds soon after and it was of a high_quality .
F	i ordered flowers for next_day for my gran '_s 00th only to be emailed the following_day in the afternoon that they couldn_'_t do it .
F	i will avoid them in future and post this review on other_sites !
M	only after accepting it did i realise the £_00 only covered the first four weeks , and the remaining eight_weeks would cost an additional £_000 !
M	i was really happy to find brandosa was selling merrell footware normally only available in usa at usa prices .
F	always cross check their prices !!!
F	the wrong item was sent but replacement was sent quickly and the courier took the wrong item at the same time .
M	did send a email asking where flowers were to which a reply came 0 hour later explaining that flowers were on there way and could not give a sopecific time , but would be there before 00 : 00
F	i had to delete them didn_'_t feel that was secure
M	" the best decision i have ever made with regard to a pc ".
M	det burde dog være muligt at få_en buket leveret til_en adresse et stenkast fra den valgte forretning i løbet_af_en otte timers arbejdsdag - eller hvad ?
F	so went there , spoke and showed manager the state of car , he did look a little shocked , he gave_me telephone_number ect to complain .
F	the 0cm foam is actually 0cm max as the bed designed to look much deeper than it actually is , this was a dissappointment for me as i chose this bed because of its delux feel and that they claim it to be the their top bed .
F	first time ordering from company .
F	i placed an order on december 0th .
M	like for like aloe vera was maybe 0 / 0 of the cost of " the high_street ".
M	my order was processed within the expected time scales & arrived when advised it would .
F	now then , the downside .
M	i have repeated lost deliveries here in spain .
M	i had to post the prescription as 000 rightly wont provide a prescription item without sight of the document .
F	i wont mind admitting that i had a little cry .
F	the customer support person confirmed it was latex free .
M	delivery was lightning_fast too with step by step progress texts and emails so i knew_exactly where my item was all the time with a 0 hour delivery slot by text .
M	i purchesed a set of wiper_blades from np_autoparts recently , but on receipt found a connector was missing .
F	also , they have a pouch for knee_pads , but because the pocket is too long , they end up as shin_pads .
M	email response was a bit frosty to the returned item and a refund took two_weeks after repeated_emails asking why no refund , the postage yet to be received is to be posted by cheque .
F	wonder_how many people have been ripped_off like this and do not know !!!!
F	normally buy the ear cleanser from the vets but with 0 dogs and at £_00 a bottle it is quite_costly .
F	there are some fraying in the stitching around the cuffs .
M	first things first , physioroom delivered my kinesio_tape on time and with no_hassle and i was more than happy with their service .
M	flowers arrived in good condition and looked beautiful but within 00_hours had to throw out the gerberas and roses were all wilted
F	we have recently come_back from a weeks holiday in mallorca .
F	not enough protein and is the sugar necessary .
F	unhappy customer
F	0 .
F	i only used this website because they were offering a gift set that my son had requested for his_birthday and this was the only site offering it at a fantastic price .
M	fast prompt service delivered when promised - what more can you ask for
F	00 contact attempts later , emails , web contact forms and several phone_calls , including a message left on voicemail of dave forsey . without response i spoke to the receptionist carol at head_office .
F	my son saved his pocket money , xmas & birthday money and bought a laptop at pc_world on the isle of wight .
F	a ) the original claims_form was completed in line with the timescales
M	i am still_awaiting this call .
F	i therefore did not expect my money until at_least monday .
M	i hope that is clear .
F	they told me the parcel was just waiting to be picked_up from a warehouse or some such .
M	when i tried to ban them from sending bumf , their legal team said they couldn_'_t !
F	since timeline post people have moved over to twitter .
F	so .
F	unfortunately my son advises me the roses quickly drooped and did not last
M	i willy use these_guys over and over , they are bang on with the price and the service .
F	i therefore won_'_t recommend this product to anyone and am very worried as i purchased one for a friend at the same time and now i '_m worried i have given her a very poor quality gift .
F	item ordered , money taken , item not received .
F	my glasses were really cheap (£_00 for the frames , glare reducing lenses , case and postage ).
F	overall an excellent service throughout the process .
F	after weeks of haggling and threatening to take legal_action_against them to try and get my phone back they called to say that there had been a mistake and my phone was actually undamaged and they would give me the full price .
M	delivery was quick - by 00 . 00am next_day so full_marks there .
F	when the delivery arrived the van_driver phoned me because he couldn_'_t find our office , although we receive a number of parcels every day and they all come straight to our door .
M	a few items were direct from amazon and its stating asa delivered left in the porch but i have no sign of the delivery , i have contacted amazon about this a week_ago they said we will reply within_00hrs but still nothing .
M	just check that what arrives is what you ordered .
F	thank_you for your kind attention
F	however , i have concerns about the delivery .
F	there is a nice little seating_area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
F	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
M	the dressing_table and bedside_cabinets , were in a thousand bits , and took_forever to put_together .
F	i was lucky to find escapade and a costume that needed to fit in with ' the theme '.
M	the price was very competitive and the items ordered were delivered through very quickly .
F	my car was left on the thursday_evening and when i returned less_than 0_days_later my car had significant damage to the passenger door , so much so that the whole door has since had to be resprayed !
M	no , i was not .
F	every oned i spoke to was so , considerate and efficient , i can quite honestly_say that this was old world customer service courtesy at it '_s best and have already_spread the word to all my family and friends .
M	i feel let_down by this , as i '_m often tempted to place an order because of that product , and then add other stuff on to my order .
M	she also arranged for some flowers and chocolate to be sent to us along with a cheque to cover the cost of the phone_calls .
F	i have bought supplements from simply_supplements for several_years_now , and have recommended them to my friends with confidence .
M	.
M	but some bad points is that the price quote on this site were really cheap and the process just took for too long from receiving the packet , checking it and sending the payment .
M	the customer service from groupon is shocking .
F	i waited in the whole of the next_day but by 0 . 00pm i was rather fed_up with the wait so i telephoned to simply be told the carrier had made a mistake and my box would not be delivered until the next working day .
F	always a great selection of events and locations .
M	they ask you to pay the full_tank before at a forfait price different by the real value and i brought it back with the 0 / 0 of the tank and they refund me only the 0 / 0 of the tank on my credit_card .
F	also easy to use website , and quick replies .
M	i replied to change the date , they text back confirming the change , yet they went_ahead and delivered on the original date anyway !
M	the assembley instructions were quite good but not perfect .
F	i have tried_calling but the number seems to be disconnected and i have tried to complete the online contact firm but it will not allow me to submit .
M	emailed them .
M	i ordered some tube and rod from theplasticsshop .
F	i purchased the longchapman handbag sets on wowcher roughly about a month_ago now and i still have not received my purchased items .
M	don_'_t waste your time looking at other solutions - this is the one to go for !
F	need i say more ??
F	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
F	but nothing !!
F	regular re - ordering service .
M	it was a pleasant buy .
M	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
F	i have had to raise a dispute with paypal and then escalate to a claim and still_haven_'_t had my money back ( 00 days_later ) which also means i have had to pay my full mastercard bill with this on it or face a full month '_s interest ( about £_00 ).
F	my partner is always a size 0 and the woman assured me that this style did not come up large .
M	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
M	should not tell you / advise not to talk to anyone_else as it arises suspition as to why not
M	i hope advanced read this and take_heed because they could be a 0_star company and in there line of work that '_s rare and recommends are even rarer .
M	as far as postage and packing goes there where no_problems , well_packaged and arrived before expected , the problem was that the item ( a synthesizer module ) was described on the website as obviously second_hand but there was no mention of any_problems with it , basically used but in full working order , turns_out the the headphone output was only working on one channel , volume knob was not original ( not that bad i admit ) main data selector knob was missing with just the shaft exposed , fare enough it could still work with a new cap fitted but this selector knob its self required for all essential functions was completely_useless as it didn_'_t actually work meaning the device was un usable , luckily i fix things like this if they are not to hard to sort so decided to do so , having the correct knowledge and tools i managed to get most of ot working apart_from the headphone_socket , one resistor broken in half , anyway after a few hours of work that i didn_'_t expect i had it up and running and sent an email back to cash_generator in manchester complaining that they had sold a completely faulty item as a fully working item and predictably they just ignored the email of complaint , i suppose i should have gone_through the hassle of sending it all back for a refund but i wanted it to work so i could use it but beware buying from this place as they obviously don_'_t give a crap about what they sell and don_'_t even check the functionality of the things they sell and just sel as fully working , and also ignore any correspondence , beware !
F	thank_you .
F	i fought back and told them under no circumstances would a late payment charge be accepted when it '_s taken them over 0 years to bill us in the first place .
F	a fantastic service to recycle old_phones , i have now £_00 . 00 in argos_vouchers now !!!!
M	p - printer choice was made easier by the clear and detailed specification comparisons on their website .
F	ordering is simple and the items ordered are delivered within a couple of days .
M	what better way to tell your beloved of your love than to have a bouquet of her_favourite flowers delivered to your home .
M	bike was received by tnt very quickly and i cannot_fault anything .
F	have returned it and am awaiting news !
M	i will then need to visit the garage again
M	totally_unacceptable the item was a present and not cheap !
M	after a while i tried to contact the company to see when my product would come .
F	😃
F	he is currently trying to get people to give him £_000 for stands at an_exhibition in milton_keynes - they may well find themselves shafted .
M	maybe it is a website setup issue that requires correcting .
M	ordered 0no . welsh shirts with welsh water_bottles !
F	although the colour was good . it needs a little green sprig or something to make it less stark and sad looking !
F	did try and call a couple of times but no reply .
M	stay_away
M	best price and service for hills_prescription cat_food .
M	they were exactly the same as old rockports i already had , so there were no_surprises there .
F	also my messages via online_chat , which were initially being answered , are now being ignored !
F	the car was almost new , clean but a bit damaged - what do other people do to hire_cars to bend them ?
M	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
F	it might have lots of protein and fibre , but surely i '_d be better off eating a banana ?
M	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway . says a lot really !
F	this is the second time we have used oak_furnitureland and both_times we have had such prompt and polite service we will definitely use them again ( a smile and a cheery hello goes a long way in a wet english winter !)
M	they may offer you a little more for your phone but when it comes to paying out they will offer you less making_excuses because they think that the seller will just want the money and take what is offered .
F	brilliant service .
F	alertpay ??
F	staff always seem helpful but always a wait in this shop !
M	thanks
M	you have to chase and chase better shop on ebay and take a less risk this company will go belly up soon just like comet big fire sale on its way
M	ii was so pleased that i had several members of my family sign up to talktalk .
M	next year , we will travel hull - rotterdam on p_& o .
M	i had no such worries with this company .
M	productsvs are top_notch value for the money and theres_nothing_compares on the high_street .
M	i created the album on my pc to my own design and selected the no further adjustment option .
F	i use asda , now via a laptop , every couple of months .
F	really appalling .
F	i had to write to them on the day itslef to find they could not deliver before 0rd nov .
F	delighted with product and service
F	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
M	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
M	i ordered a bathroom rad specifically from best heating because of their same day despatch promise ( i could have got it a bit cheaper_elsewhere but had 0 - 0day timeframe ).
M	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
F	ideal for a wheelchair_user or disabled_person .
M	i like sportsbikeshop but they need to have a word with there couriers
M	anyone reading the reviews on this site will see this as a regular concurrence .
M	thanks
M	of course not .
M	would use again
F	waste of time & money .
M	finding my cabin and navigating around the ship was easy - peasy with staff on - hand to assist those who could get lost in a cupboard .
F	the illustrations were good so it didn_'_t take long to find what i wanted .
F	phone_call from driver 0_hr later confirming delivery would be between 00_noon and 0pm .
F	i ordered on tuesday and the item arrived via ups on friday , within the timescale of 0 - 0_days delivery specified on the website .
F	east ordering but only 0 of 0 cold_packs received .
M	nothing more to say .
M	there is no need for rudeness of this nature and i will not be using this company again .
M	i woyuld not recommend this company it does not carry out deliveries on time .
M	the flowers were eventually delivered on the following_monday , by the next friday nearly all of the flowers were dying ( so much for their 0 day fresh promise ) and the so called full_refund had not materialised .
M	i also made further calls to try and make contact - and i ' caught ' their office worker who told me her name but it escapes me .
F	after a while the noise twindles into the background , but only after about an_hour or so .
M	latest order : the items i wanted were all showing as in stock , i placed the order and waited and waited and waited !!!!
M	i shall_certainly deal with this company again .
M	han var utrolig serviceminded , men_det viste sig hurtigt , at de fremsendte forsikringer ikke levede op_til det lovede .
M	after the product failed to arrive i contacted the company twice to be informed the courier had lost it and another one would be dispatched .
M	i don_’_t feel i should have been the one to contact them .
F	customer sevice department indeed !
M	- a ' designer chiminea ' i would say its a rip_off basically .
M	cons .
F	some great deals , and real_bargains , some really dodgy places and offers also posted .
F	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
M	well it would be if it wasnt such a drag to watch something online .
F	it is coming to two_weeks since ive ordered from directsight and one pair of glasses still_hasn_'_t been dispatched . in my opinion this is very poor .
M	the action was shot and the pick_up was faulty .
M	the products came as promised , bu t £ 0 . 00 charge for a £ 0 . 00 stamp / small jiffy_bag , pushing the boundries of whats acceptable
M	would highly_recommend these to anyone who_wants something comfortable and versatile to lay on in the garden . they also brighten_up the space inside or outside !
F	but they are very friendly and always try to do their best to help .
M	without_hesitation i was told " yes ".
M	if completely alienating your customers for absolutely no reason is keeping you in business then who am i to suggest your terms and conditions suck .
F	just ordered some cable and rechargeable_batteries , excellent price , excellent service and excellent packaging and delivery .
M	i waited and waited_patiently .
M	coat itself is excellent , brilliant quality and no_complaints there .
M	if you were going to design & build your own this should be the end_result & i have an engineering background .
F	my only_gripe was that i missed my flight ( my own fault ) so also missed the transfer at the other end to the hotel .
F	otherwise proof process and communication was fine .
F	bottom line they acted like they were doing me a favour by refunding my card 00_% unbelievable !!!
F	communication was excellent , was kept up to date via_email at every_stage of the process - thank_you i will be back .
M	couldn_'_t have asked for better service .
M	had my mother waiting till half 0 at night for these
M	very impressed and would definitely buy from here again .
F	it took daays for them to acknowledge their mistake and added insult to injury by offering me a complimentary bouquet .
F	they don_'_t know the meaning of customer service .
M	good work .
M	email confirmation said my order would be with me on the 00th .
M	will_definitely be shopping here again in future - many_thanks !
F	with respect to order delivery they are the best i '_ve come_across , but i haven_'_t yet sent anything back .
M	thanks , always let us know when something is not going to be in the delivery and when it is due to arrive .
F	our order arrived on time and was very competitive_pricewise .
M	even when i ordered the wrong items doorstuff didn_'_t quibble about me sending them back and providing a full_refund .
F	i also stressed the fact that i was looking for the t - shirts as quickly as possible .
F	i did not receive my product for 0_days .
M	thank_you for our gorgeous push chair !
M	has listened to my complaints and has responded in a manner that should be_applauded .
F	he was so rude as well .
F	only_downside of primark if you want to take anything back you go to customer_services with two people on , queue for ages as everyone takes one item back and pays for two basket fulls while they are there , i recommend that the refunds counter is for refunds only . as i wasted all my lunch hour queing to just get a refund very frustrated , or even more people on to deal with just refunds .
F	i bought the cigar for my husband , as his friend has one , and thought it would save him money and cut him down on real cigars as they are expensive , he_likes the cigar look , but would like it to have a cuban cigar flavour , as he_finds it very bland in taste , as he put it , its tasteless as far as a cigar goes but its something to do with my hands , if i don_'_t have any proper cigars and feel like a smoke .
F	sorry jessops .
M	far from it , the courier liam uses an ipad on 0g so can ( and does ) respond to emails regularly , from anywhere .
M	three_days_later nothing .
M	can '_t comment .
M	very quick service also very help full on phone would purchase and recommend again
F	i had a problem trying to get anyone at the company to reply to my phone_calls and emails as i needed them urgently for a works meeting .
F	another niggel would be that the company didn_'_t offer a disposal service for the old mattress .
M	a replacement board may fix it or it could be the panel was the diagnosis .
M	my printy finally arrived after about 0 days . on very thin paper .
F	!😄
M	brilliant service , wonderful bouqets , what you see is what you get , pick a pic .
M	delivery
M	eventually lenova supplied me a pair of discs but it cost me £_00
M	the items i ordered were also delivered in excellent time
M	it '_s never happened before in the 00 years i '_ve lived here so it was carelessness on the driver '_s behalf .
F	i found the website bad and will phone if i decide to use them again .
F	impossible .
M	despite the wide_range the website is easy to navigate and to find what i want .
F	their customer service extension is never manned , it seems , so i then tried choosing the sales extension , and that was when i spoke to a lady called [_name_removed_], who after_hearing my account instructed me to return the motor for a full_refund and said that the part that had not been delivered would also been refunded .
F	i have used diet_chef on and off for a few_years with reasonably good results . as it is fairly expensive , i was pleased to buy at a reduced_rate through_groupon .
F	just found this website by_chance whilst trying to get a price to replace my ka '_s front_tyres .
F	they gave_me the wrong amount 0_months_ago when i paid off my bill in full .
F	transglobal offered the best rate , but ups were not helpful .
M	i bought a tool set from merlin_cycles , it was a great product but one of the tools happened to be bent - they couldn_'_t have been better about the exchange , good communications and they sent the replacement immediately
F	i am not happy with my purchase at all .
F	i was advised that this could not be done but that my order would definitely be delivered on the 00th .
F	a faulty item was sent to me and when i complained it was immediately put right .
F	it looks like great quality :) and will do what it says on the tin .
F	it states 0 - 00 working_days to receive order , i am still_waiting since 00th_oct_0000 , still no sign of order .
F	very happy with the garage & worth_checking when they tell you which garage it is going too .
M	the website is really easy to use .
F	had offer of free_postage so very good deal , item delivered next_day .
M	i would prefer if they had a more intelligent system , whereby they sent me specific offers i would be interested in .
F	the company are not prepared to do anything to investigate , refund or replace until 00 days after dispatch .
M	thanks again , a very happy customer
M	very easy to use , quick , simple process and good values offered .
M	they '_ve take almost £_000 from me , yet where exactly are the results ?
F	made the order & was directed to payment page & i put in my details , then i hunted for a pay now icon . saw an icon above my details & pressed it , a page came up that said the page or something like it didn_'_t exist . tried again & the same thing happened . i ended_up ringing animed & ordering over the phone i had no apology when i explained what had happened .
M	the blinds arrived quickly , were the right size and straightforward to fit .
F	i visited the next_day - less_than 00_hours on from receiving the flowers and they had dropped completely and wilted so much that we had to throw them out as they were well and truly dead .
F	very disappointed the flowers look nothing like the picture on the website .
F	order came the followiing day .
F	orders are handled quickly and correctly .
M	avoid_avoid !!!!
M	i had paid for a transfer with a maximum of 0 stops however the coach stopped several_times more than this .
F	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single person that works in customer service / fault department / cancellation departments .
F	fantastic little surprise when we opened our tickets !
M	i send flowers to my girlfriend alot .
M	ordered a bouquet for nearly_£_00 (£_00 . 00 ) including delivery for delivery on valentines_day : comparable to other_suppliers prices , however i really liked the picture on their website so decided to use them rather_than one of the more established suppliers - a mistake i never intend to make again !
M	opened and checked the contents and a key part missing making it useless .
M	every change has a £_00 charge as i found out the hard way when making two changes at once .
M	so i said it hasn_'_t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
M	have bought 000 items from ebay .
M	the metal used is so thin that the cooker sways under the weight of a saucepan .
F	!
M	website easy to navigate .
F	i complained afterwards and asked for a refund but i was told as long as i could only send back the faulty balloons but not the empty helium_canister , which we had of course discarded the same day already , they would not refund anything .
F	revise my review .
F	the cost of one first_class stamp would easily have covered the item i ordered .
M	once i sent my phone payment was received three_days after_posting .
F	great packaging .
M	hopefully i will receive a response this time or i will be taking up the issue with my credit_card provider under section 00 .
F	i am absolutely_disgusted with the apalling service i couldnt recommend to anyone .
F	i bought a dress for my holiday , it looked simple but nice on website .
F	item ordered , order confirmed as received , date for delivery given and then time_slot , all arrived as stated , correct product received , fitting_instructions followed and item installed with ease .
M	great before the tourists started to pour in at about 0am !
F	no more travel_agents foe me .
M	the roses were nice but unfortunately they had no scent .
M	i only got my money back once my credit_card company took money back off them .
F	i have been using it for many_years .
F	this is the third time i have purchased from sunglasses_shop .
F	när vi fick korten ( snabb_leverans ) så fanns det på hälften av korten , 00 st , en missfägnningskant , troligtvis av ytbehandlingen ( glatt yta ).
M	in the end i received a bag which i did not want but im having to keep hold of it as they have ignored my email for refund .
M	so when you phone the phone rings for six minutes unanswered .
F	what a difference !
F	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department . 00_minutes with a broked connection . oh let_me direct you to the faults department .
M	booking the service and service reception were very straightforward , the service itself was priced very competitively but although the service book was signed , there was no other paperwork to outline what had been done and no vehicle condition report .
M	i guess you get what you pay for .
F	they have always delivered quickly and i have always been pleased with my purchases .
M	easy to navigate website , friendly email_updates on order and arrived straight_away .
M	these_guys are great !
F	i paid almost 0 times the amount of the actual ticket price and only received 0 whereas i was sure i had ordered 0
M	i asked to be told when the goods would be shipped and when i could expect to receive them knowing that someone had to sign for them .
M	thought that was a bit mean but anyway all was nice in the villa .
M	i '_ve been using paypal for the past 0 years , but recently i was robbed of over £_000 by a scammer on ebay .
F	i have just bought a samsung eco_bubble washing and i absolutely love it , after waving good bye to my old bloomberg of 00 years the eco_bubble is a wonderful replacement .
F	still wanting the product , and not knowing better (!
F	i was delighted when my parcel arrived the day after ordering it ,
M	i am extremely pleased with the quality of the suits , ties , cravats , waistcoats and handkerchiefs i have purchased from my tuxedo and the exceptional customer service when needed help .
F	well_worth the money paid and would use them again .
M	very unhelpful when it comes to arranging a convenient time for ' service agent ' to visit .
F	i tried this , i requested that my item was delivered the next_day when i would be home ( and had a message_saying request was accepted ) but instead they delivered it anyway and left it with a neighbour .
F	i do enjoy_browsing your site but feel there are not enough departures leaving from glasgow .
F	we had great weather which made up for the down falls of the villa .
F	not happy with them and won_'_t use them to buy anything_else .
F	as they were for a colleagues 00th_birthday , we then had to run_out and go to a local_florist to get some more flowers , therefore inconveniencing us .
F	previously very good product and service excellent .
M	i originally made a mistake and had it posted to an old address .
M	new website and company to myself .
F	we were shown to another room , but before our bags hit the ground we were whisked out again as that room wasn_'_t available either .
M	very user_friendly website , actually phoned me to make_sure the dose i ordered was correct .
M	hertz did a great job in providing a good vehicle at a good price , but we should have been able to pick - up the vehicle from the booked location .
F	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
M	outward_journey quick boarding although rough at sea the princess and crew is a lovely ship with a happy crew . cabin with a double_bed excellent for a mature set of o . a . ps .
F	i '_ve just found this website - wish i had before placing the order .
F	i haven_'_t contacted them as yet , i will do today .
M	with my partners help the wardrobe was delivered and put into the right room .
M	watch dog also had a good moan_about this very thing too .
F	i used to spend hours trawling websites looking for bargain breaks but with dealchecker you have regular_updates on what is available and it takes all the strain and hassle from you .
F	- order was correct
F	all_round great service .
M	make false and damaging statements about ( someone ).
M	definately would recommend to a friend !
F	however this morning a very kind person took the flowers to my friend '_s house explaining that they had been left_outside his property yesterday by mistake .
M	the cost was very good and the delivery was really quick .
F	easy to find what i wanted , even products i struggled to find elsewhere , reasonable_prices and very quick delivery
F	when we were eventually deposited in estepona we were left thoroughly unimpressed with the arrival transfer , however worse was yet to come .
F	vet_prescribed calmex for tb horse , it was extremely expensive and i searched online and found viovet who did it at a better price .
M	i ordered in november but the order never arrived .
F	the reason i am particularly upset about this is because my dear boyfriend did not get his_birthday_present in time .
F	i got straight on the phone to parcelhero to complain and sort this out .
F	i bought a package from groupon so to be fair it was a cheap deal , they group all the groupon appointments into a couple of days a week and its very much a cattle_market , no sitting going through treatments plans etc just get on the bed , zap you , get off , next one in .

M	perfect .
F	i '_m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
M	great service
F	they never knock they simply leave the parcel on the doorstep regardless of whether i '_m in or not !
M	then on the followin wednesday got an email to say it was in ship .
M	ordered a large , custom_sized mirror for a bathroom .
F	i had thought it would take three or four days as quoted , so was delighted at the speedy service .
M	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
F	my mum loves her_birthday orchid , speedy delivery and a plant in good condition with many buds to bloom .
F	my order was sent to milton_keynes rang them up i had to post there order to them and they sent mine to me , not what you want 0_days b0 xmas , thankfully we were honest poeple , not what you pay for ,
M	clothes which sizes fit accurately now are far too small / short .
F	so i was a bit_miffed and said i did not appreciate being lied to and treated like a twot !
F	avoid !
F	i have been trying to escalate my complaint within the company , and despite_emailing and calling on several_occasions i am just ignored .
F	won_'_t be able to get glasses and phone in it !
F	so i got it .
M	the extra couple of weeks delay in getting my bike back on the trails , caused_by having to source and order a new part again , has_been really frustrating .
M	the price of these drontal_worming_tablets is very good .
F	although i wanted to purchase the table , chairs , display_cabinet and table ( for my lamp ) i did not require a mirror but was informed that i could not have the table for my lamp ( which was cheaper ) instead of the mirror .
F	customer service fine , prompt .
F	ringtons_tea good as ever , ginger snaps the best in world , sultana biscults really moreish .
M	even_though your site has an excellent memory tool , i wanted to make_sure i ' d used it correctly and that the memory i needed was in stock ( i had an older mac ) the person i spoke to on the phone was extremely knowledgeable and helpful .
M	happy with the service ,
F	i have had some bargains off the site . 0 lovely swing dresses for christmas and a couple of t shirt dresses for my hols , but the last delivery was really disappointing . quality was pretty crap ! one dress was so cheap looking i '_d have struggled selling it on a car boot . not sure if i '_ll use the site again as although missguided keep in touch , it takes a while getting your money credited back

M	i made an order for worktops to be delivered first week back in work 0000 , the order was delayed but then rectified .
M	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so_far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
M	excellent service and superb products
M	even now ( tuesday ) i am waiting for money to arrive after it had been ordered - before_lunch - last thursday - and it still has not arrived !
F	it is easy to order at sunglasses_shop and the freight is paid by the sunglasses .

F	only_reservation would be that royal_mail is used for delivery .
M	thanks for the new head skis that arrived today - can '_t wait to take them out !
F	so not sure i would have chosen
M	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
F	the product and postage_charges were competitive with other and when i emailed them sophie maynard from their customer service team was very helpful and responded quickly .
F	when these items were suppose to be received as one package .

M	that was on 00 october_0000 .
F	paid - got my email and delivery date conformation .
M	i called them to ask for a refund .
M	- all_kinds of hidden_costs .
M	highly_recommended and pointed this way by a helpful sales_assistant in pc_world .
F	i know the item was reduced but i thought it was for a full kit including all the items to complete the project .
F	as we are pensioners the salesperson makes you believe such a good deal speaking so fast its difficult to understand .
M	very disappointing .
M	delivery is fast and i have never in the year i have been purchasing from affordable_supplements experienced any_issues and the service is a0 .
M	i would not use their services again .
M	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd_sports .

M	this is a disappointment after such a great initial experience .

F	had an_independent technician look at it and he said he had never seen such a low spec computer .
F	my initial order was badly packaged and as a result , the courier refused to deliver it to my house .
F	they ought to mke it a bit simpler for us ' oldies ' to navigate the site .
M	i have spent hours on telephone speaking to advisers in very bad broken english , who really couldn_'_t care less - one being a manager who was rude and lied to me .
F	do not use this company to buy or rent a house , even if your life were to depend_on it ; if i could of put less_than 0_star , i would have .
F	this has now been a week and still_waiting for my new 0 :-(
M	sent the wrong_size .
M	asked for the collection at a time and the delivery at a time both came exactly as stated and with good care .
F	i had to send them proof of my payment why when they already had the payment .
F	i have never had this problem before & i have been very pleased with my orders in the past .
F	this time i made the poor delivery guy check what was missing ie 0 items not a happy_bunny what is it with asda they can '_t get any delivery right .
M	in the end i had to ring the carriers & explain my predicament .
M	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
F	not happy with the courier service .
F	actually zero_rating - delivery person couldn_'_t even bother to ring the doorbell - the dog would have heard and barked like mad .
M	it '_s very rare that i work with a company that feels_like a family !
F	terrible .
M	00days now since i paid for a cordlees drill battery .
M	if you go into norwich store watch out for there surveyor name darren .

F	very disappointed that i did not receive my order until 00th_december !
F	the actual costume i was really disappointed with , my son has worn it once to a halloween_party and the whole back along the seam has ripped .

M	really simple to order and delivered quickly with no_hassle .
F	as you will see on twitter , i have had several warnings from people via vianono , that the replacement ticket will not materialise .
M	no_problems , good choice of lenses .
F	i contacted dixons ( ho ) and went right to the top but this made no difference and i am now in the process of going through the on line small_claims court .
F	!

M	thanks for all your help and support in enabling_us to get exactly_what we needed at competitive_prices .
M	follow_up

M	also spoke to visa and they are going to do a fraud investigation .
M	could they just be cancelling these flights because they don_'_t get to apply the credit_card mark - up ?
F	luckily the product inside wasn_'_t damaged .
F	i tried to call him numerous_times and his phone keeps saying unavailable .
F	i was impressed by the quality of information available and the speed of transaction
M	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional_costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
M	thank_you from hertfordshire golf .
F	i found the extra_charges ridiculous who is going to go on holiday without a suitcase huh , even if it is only one between two , so why is it classed_as extra .
M	no customer service & only a partial delivery of valentines order .
F	i would not be surprised if this one gets deleted , too .
F	i did actually i call your office to compliment the staff who dealt_with me in the beginning as i was impressed with their customer service but the girl who answered the phone asked a little tartly why do you want to know when i asked for the managers name . oh_dear what a shame i hung_up
F	delivery was well over a week from proof approval .
F	need a bit of breaking in as they are leather .
M	!
M	that was option 0 on their list , so thought i ' d try option 0 their sales line . nope , silly me , after trying several_times on every available option & constantly getting cut_off . i slowly started to panic , i ' d paid this company i '_ve never_heard of before a few_hundred_quid of my hard_earned_cash & now i could_find anyone who cared enough to answer the telephone .

F	this is by far the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
F	seriously ?!

F	very good promt service
M	delivery ahead of time which pleased my wife in particular .
F	i have used aria technology to supply computer parts for many_years and they have always proved very reliable .
F	i am still struggling with them to get my money back - even if this wouldn_'_t make up the dissapointment they caused us by this spoiled holiday .
F	they delivered only part of the order .
F	from this company again .
F	i was looking for worming_tablets suitable for a 0 month_old puppy weighing in at just over 0kgs and came_across some worming_tablets which seemed to be what i was looking - wrong !

M	i was impressed with the way they looked after me , even_though the mix_up was not their fault , top_marks .
M	i am_afraid the product was faulty and is being returned for a replacement
F	parts ordered friday_afternoon and arrived next_morning .
F	hotel für amstersdam ist uns ein fehler beim erfassen des datums unterlaufen .
F	was a fast delivery .
F	* update to initial review *
F	i have recommended the site to many of my colleagues and they have received an excellent service also .
M	there was no hanging_around waiting for the envelope and the bank_transfer took only a few_days .
F	line - wait on hold - and go through everything , then ring your co ,.
M	park_cameras .
M	maybe it was an honest packing mistake , but as the substitute product is suitable for purpose and the order value is small won_'_t bother returning .
M	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
M	friendly response when i phoned in my order - arrived the next_day and was excellently_packaged .
F	and now to top it off you have started free delivery to store again so i have needlessly spent on delivery .
M	the flowers arrived the following_day mid pm by a driver who left them inside the porch .
F	book the wrong tickets or need a refund and it will cost you dearly .
M	0 week prior to event received a phone_call to advise tickets were not available - no apology .
F	great quality .
F	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
F	i hope you can look at this and make some improvements
M	i '_m not from a snowy country , and the need for winter_tyres was never explained to me by alamo or anyone_else .
F	ordered and delivered in 0_days . polite and friendly delivery staff .
M	don_'_t get caught out .
F	did not deliver before party date !
F	as they only arrived a few_days before we were due to go away i did not have time to return the items , so ended_up having to spend half an_hour sewing up the hole .
F	i '_ll be using viovet again and again !
F	friendly team from_start to finish .
M	i have been shopping at dabs maybe for 00 years or more .
M	this time thought i was mortified to find that even_though i paid extra i got a standard bunch of flowers and the message in the card was not added so it simply said ' no message required by recipient ' in the card !!!
F	i was disappointed by the length of time the product took ro arrive .
F	thought we had left it to late but you came up_trumps with the faster delivery option - but just one amount for the three costumes .
F	the depots landline_number is actually a voicemail for a mobile number .
F	i was a loyal_customer to another well_known online adult retailer but have been looking elsewhere since they stopped offering free delivery on any order amount and only applying it to orders of £_00 +, having paying for batteries of which i think should automatically come with a toy if it needs it ( either from the manufacturer of the toy or the retailer selling them ) and a few unsatisfactory customer service enquiries that have been less_than useful .
F	meanwhile mm kept sending emails to say my ( much smaller ) package was still being_processed .
F	i would give no stars to this company if possible as their customer service is awful , they ignore your questions and queries and only answer what suits them .
M	but when i called to enquire_about a product they took the information and said they would call me back , i was never called back .
F	it '_s mainly for storing films and music .
M	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
M	don_'_t go crying to groupon either - they are actually the worst when it comes to customer service , trust me .
F	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
F	when i had eventually finished my book i then placed the order and waited for the book to be uploaded - this i had to attempt 0 times as it kept freezing after only 0 minutes or so .
F	i tried to ring on friday 0rd may , when it still hadn_'_t arrived , but unfortunately phoned at 0 , not realising that this is closing time .
M	to sum_up , sky is fine but over - priced .
F	they also kept me informed during the process and i would recommend them unreservedly .
F	luckily this cannot be seen as it is against the wall but i would not have been able to give it as a gift due to the damage .
F	i checked my account and saw that it was " released for delivery ".
F	i recieved my order pretty quickly ( 0_days ) and am pretty happy with the product .
M	excellent no_quibbles service .
M	our customer_support_team are open monday to friday 0am to 0pm uk time .
M	failed to deliver items in time stated .
F	disagreed with the diesel policy .
M	very frustrating .
F	yodel ( need i say more !!!!!)
F	the interest_rate for buy now pay later is quite_expensive
M	i cancelled my direct_debit after allowing them 00 days ( not the 00 days , mind you ) to action it and they start a hooting and a hollering .
M	called on the monday chap at other end did not seem to be able to operate the computer properly .
F	! ang great prices compared to some stores and other online shopping companies 0 / 0 x
M	i was able to return the remote easily and had a refund a few_days_later minus a handling / postage cost .
M	next in the queue was a gentlemen from glasgow for the very same reason .
F	great service & product .
F	recently i contacted wowcher three_times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
M	and now my session has ended so i have to post a review again - really crap
M	this meant having to delay my departure to ensure that this delivery arrived .
M	avoid !
M	after a couple of more emails , both of which received prompt_replies i decided to accept the product sent me and datakits ' offer of a partial_refund , which was in line with the price i could have got it elsewhere .
M	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
F	car is so shabby - paint peeling_off , dents - no washer fluid - driving at night home from airport dangerous couldn_'_t see out of front windshield .
M	they had been deleted by 000reg hence the error .
M	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
M	will now enjoy a few bottles of agwaleaf over christmas which i advise you order and try !
F	i '_ve already become a repeat customer and am happy to recommend them .
F	once we bought the car , we soon found out this car had been in an accident at the front and back and had airbags missing !
M	deliver of my new thermostat was very quick arriving the next_day .
M	my wife was at the airport sometime before we travelled , and while waiting went to the monarch desk , who were able to book in everything we wanted , but travel_republic were not able to do this . why not , if monarch can do it ?
M	great banner , well printed , good quick service .
F	lucky for us we had booked to stay a night otherwise our mini_cruise would have consisted of an_hour and a half in amsterdam which would have been a complete_waste of money .
F	told them i couldnt do week days and it would have to be delivered on a saturday ( which they wanted to charge me for !
M	i wont go any where else from now on .
M	checked with me and recipt given .
F	will definitely be using e_- tyres again & recommending .
M	the bed arrived the next_day ( tuesday ) and when we went to assemble it found that the side_bars had no holes for the slats to fit in .
M	i asked her to refund the credit_card and told her that their business model lacks honesty and integrity ( sucks !).
F	my mum received them 0_days_later when delivered by a member of the public .
M	correct item arrived with fast delivery and without_any dramas everything you would expect from a first_rate organisation
F	i cancelled one of my orders after it did not arrive before it was needed despite_being advised that they would make it a priority order .
F	i was a bit disapointed with my last order a bag of 00 . 0kg applaws dried_dog_food because when i took it out of the delivery box the bottom of the bag was spilt so it went all over the floor .
M	i do not recommend buying anything from them , especially not expensive products .
M	there are plenty of other_companys what offer very similar prices and operate a lot quicker ( inside 00 days )
M	easy to order a wide_range of products from a well_laid - out web_site .
F	due from my past order i requested the driver went through the shopping with me so as to verify what was missing .
M	despite many emails and phone_calls from me , 00 days_later guess_what ??
M	sent paperwork out the next_day . once posted it took less_than 00_hrs for them to pay monies into bank_account . very easy website to understand even your mum could use it .
F	a good service and i dont see why you would have any_problems if you a making a minimal order but the bigger the order the bigger the chance of breakages just because of the way they are packaged .
F	after 00hrs i made enquiries , had to wait for on - line staff the next_day only to be told that the item was discontinued .
M	the furniture was delivered on time by cheerful and helpful guys .
F	had found it slightly cheaper from another_supplier but they didn_'_t have good feedback .
M	competitive price .
F	the processing and delivery time was very fast .
M	good value tyres for my caravan fitted efficiently by a professional and friendly guy at a convenient time and without my having to move my van !
F	would recommend these if ever need fancy_dress outfit .
F	i really can '_t recommended printernet enough .
F	first_rate service all_round , thank_you
F	don_'_t waste your time on this company .
M	some time its disappointing , like when the order didn_'_t tracked by quidco and you need to claim the order , its takes_ages to approve and confirmed .
M	customer service rep didn_'_t come off script so it '_s obviously a regular one .
M	trouble also could not find a contact number so had to send email .
M	ordering a new appliance has never been so easy , with no_fuss next_day delivery , arrived on time with great communication from delivery driver .

M	can '_t wait_until my contract_ends and i can switch .
M	great savings_compared to the high_street .
M	there was an 000 premium_rate number i had to call to check details , with no rate warning to tell you that it would cost you a fortune .
M	we have used this company a few_times , never any_problems .
M	better_bathrooms need to improve their own internal quality standard checks ( see below ) prior to dispatching goods and not place the oneous on their customer .
F	i now have limited time to find the item elsewhere in time for christmas .
F	however it seems to take this company several days to reply to emails and a courier tried to deliver a second mixer which i refused to accept .
F	i have just bought a siemens washing_machine which went wrong on the third wash three_days after delivery .
F	i was surprised to find that there was not a road map included as part of the information as when leasing cars in the past from other_companies i have always been given a road map .
F	i came_across paperstone only last_week when looking for some replacement shelves for a bisley tambour unit .
M	!
M	i can recommend this company for its friendly and quick service .

F	a nice garment but not quite what i expected so returned and ordered a lined sweater
F	it was worse_than aeroplane food .
M	appalling service , no follow_up at all .
M	really pleased with service and product
F	i '_m an international purchaser and my purchases were cancelled after debits went through my account .
M	didn_'_t see this clearly mentioned on the front page
F	i was initially very pleased with the service .
F	helena silva
M	the purchase of my outfit was easy and arrived quickly but the outfit , which was lace up at the front wasn_'_t stitched properly and was not secure even before i put it on .
M	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
M	i had a faikled delivery because the delivery driver made a mistake with my address ; but instead of trying to correct it and deliver later the store tried to convence me to reschedule for another day .
F	i got them for a good price and was really happy with the next_day delivery .
F	creditsafe - can you please do something about this !!
F	bought these for my mum who had been suffering with her joints and muscles .
F	it was very frustrating that the pen didn_'_t work as my granddaughter was keen to use it and it was completely dry .
M	even better was the discount offered for further_purchases , which i took up when in the market for another pair of quality shoes almost a year later .
M	i found it cheaper to book direct with the ferry company .
M	do they expect me to give up ?
M	yes , you get there with your design in the end but for a company that specialises in printed products , i ' d expect the website and build process to be flawless - it '_s more like a beta site that '_s still in development .
M	if i do get a refund and apology before going to court i will update on here .
M	i will not be using your service again .
F	good quality and fantastic service would recommend this company to anybody . well_done !
M	product that i bought the price was excellent .
M	no amp .
M	there was no offer of a loan product , there was an attempt to talk me into taking the 0nd_hand unit & returning it under the " distance_selling rules " if i wasnt happy later .
F	i sent them on june 00rd .
M	0 phase mcb '_s from the website , received the confirmation_email and the money left my account all £_000 of it .
F	fortunately , the person i spoke to sorted it out for me straight_away and sent the policy whilst i was still on the phone which gave_me back some confidence in your company .
F	si tout_ceci devait s ' éterniser , nous_avons trouvé un moyen de_faire appel à différentes instances ( avec juristes , etc .) pour régler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les même problèmes et_tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .
M	waste of time and i will not use again steer_clear .
F	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
M	ordered a double grill_element , arrived quickly , part was correct , however , the packaging left a lot to be desired .
F	my husband and i have been using lenstore for over a year now and their service is nothing less_than perfect .
M	we looked at over 00 solutions before choosing bluepark .
F	( the pole was now fully extended - unlike the other 0 packaged in the box and half the size ).
F	i ordered two x factor buzzers , only one arrived .
F	no bad_points - simple and easy to use and quick and easy service - very happy customer !
F	do not use them !!!!!!
M	i have no connection with the business other than being a very satisifed customer .
F	absolutely_appalling as we are 00_minutes from the city and having ordered dozens of parcels over the last few_months i have not come_across a single company that has added any sort of additional_charge .
M	consequently i made 0 single journey bookings but had to pay the 0 pounds credit_card fee twice
M	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
F	filled in as necessary , although the " do you take any tablets " name them section , which then dropped down 0 reasons for this was very technical .
M	will be back .
F	helping you is not on their job description .
F	it has now been 00 working_days and i have no go pro and no response to my emails regarding this matter .
M	prompt delivery , great prices and good customer service .
M	when i spoke to them that just mentioned you can have your postage refunded .
F	however once fully_assembled it looks ok , just not as real as it looks in the picture .
M	but on a plus i did get a new set of strings , whoopie !
F	the quality of the card and the print was reqlly good but they had been poorly trimmed , with a think whit edge showing on 0 sides .
F	it was just a cheap marketing ploy to feed o0 '_s pathetic ego , keeping ppl hanging about with false hopes .
F	i have a linux dedicated server running fedora with fasthosts web hosting .
F	will definitely use again .
M	i went on to the mega_fancy_dress website to see what they had .
F	great !
M	the delivery van arrived at 0 . 00am .
F	repeat this about 00 times over .
F	well_packed and as_described .
F	the lever cannot close as it ought to .
M	second order wrong item dispatched and product id blacked out on item sent but to their credit refunded cost of item when contacted and was told to keep it , so again 0 / 00 a shame the websites promise is let_down by poor stock updates and incorrect picking from stock .
F	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
M	i also have proof of a cover note with their company details on it stating the type of windows and an energy report on the windows , as well as of course the guarantee with their details on , but still they won_'_t accept it and therefore won_'_t investigate my fault .
F	thank_you to diamonds_factory and the whole team who helped_me choose my perfect diamond .
F	this product did the job within days .
M	if you shop else where you are missing out .
F	thanks to first_tutors for providing an excellent service .
F	unclear how to claim free_postage when spending over a certain_amount .
F	good price .
F	if i ran my company like this i wouldn_'_t have any clients .
M	delivery was excellent however there were one or two problems .
F	queue visit to garage next_day to put car through re - test .
M	mum was realy pleased .
F	told courier had tried to deliver twice which they hadn_'_t
F	so i have adefective part and am £_00 worse off .
M	this worked faster then expected .
M	i use your long_stay car_park 00 weeks each year and have done for the past 0 years .
F	another £_00 spend .
F	i loved my experience with them and will be shopping with them all the time .
M	i ordered 0 ultra_thin magnets which would have fitted in an envelope for the price of a stamp which i could have got the next_day via_royal_mail but instead i had to wait a few_days and got charged £ 0 . 00 for postage and when it arrived it was in a huge cardboard envelope that would hold a yearly calender .
F	goods arrived in time as promised .
M	the service has got better and better durning this time .

M	the item i purchased was a bc rich kerry king warbeast in mint_condition tuned perfectly for me to play and when i was having second_thoughts about getting the money together to purchase it the staff reserved the item for me as we '_ll as giving it a complete check over and even sorting me out with a case which would suitably fit for a affordable price .
F	i ordered the bouquet on thursday_evening and it was delivered on friday_morning .
M	dreadful company .
M	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
M	this cost being more than the item itself .
F	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
M	on fitting the wheels were over tightened , and the tyre under inflated , air_gun as usual .
M	i bought 0 low_voltage lightbulbs (£_00 something pounds ) because of the 00_%_off promotion emailed to me as a previous customer , but paid the full_amount .

F	how a " company " with such horrendous customer service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big_names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .

F	can you ask speedy delivery one very happy chap
M	holiday genie said on their we page they offered the same deal , except their site kept_crashing and when i called they hung_up on me and were not helpful in resolving my booking .
M	i know that this was not the fault of worktop_express but i did always had to call them they did not call me to keep me informed .
M	i had to go to the trenitatlia website to identify which types of ticket were still available , before then booking through the excellent online ticket booking system offered by loco0 .
M	this was difficult to source which may have been responsible for my lapse in not googling wae_+ before ordering .
M	i send the phone and tehy no paid is working and i check , its was something with insurance , i dont care about that is working i paid for that phone 000 pouds

M	we had decided we needed to invest in some company branded_usb_sticks and after some online research flashbay seemed to come out on top .
M	faultless service
F	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
F	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
M	the rma takes 00 working_days and i have found out that other owners of the same graphics_card globally are also experiencing the same issue and rma / replacement didn_'_t actually resolve the problem .
M	the booking was made on - line and i printed_off the confirmation on my paper , a cancellation_fee , which i did not want and a fee so they can text me a confirmation , when i have printed_off the confirmation on my printer , ( not necessary ) these extras added a further £ 0 on to the charge - not impressed , this should have been made clearer before booking .
F	not good enough !
M	my wife works until 0 : 00 and i would have appreciated some kind of update or assurance that it would arrive by a certain time ( it just says " on the day " - does that mean they might be delivered at midnight ?).
F	great service good all_round experience bought sunglasses will be using again for my reading_glasses
M	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more than happy to take your money !
M	unfortunately they didn_'_t have anything i wanted so agreed a refund which was issued promptly .
F	paying on - line , ordering , delivering , and fitting was also easy ( my husband said !
F	i have always bought really good beds i believe its very important to not scrimp on something so important .
M	i obviously noticed when i went into the car_park that my licence number was printed on the ticket .
F	after_trawling the internet ace -_fx gave the best deal .
M	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
M	i contacted trekkinn only to find out that they couldn_'_t get my order form there supplier and didn_'_t know when to get it .

F	unfortunately on the day it was due to be delivered , the courier contacted me and said they had not received it for delivery .
F	i ordered sanderson curtains at about 00_% of the retail cost at most online outlets and they were delivered within four days with no delivery charge .
F	after mortgage went through various people were ringing me daily leaving messages trying to sell me insurance when clearly i was ignoring them , after couple of months i had to call and say stop calling i am clearly not interested and even then the girl said shall i call again in few_weeks i just thought is this robot even listening .
M	the design facility was quite basic but in my case turned_out to be adequate .
M	cash in my bank_account a couple of days_later .
F	could not wait to see them for real .
F	well boohoo make the most of that money because i will never place another order with you again .
M	it spoiled it for me .
F	in the cold , had to ring three_times to find out what was going on .
F	the funeral home informed my family that this wasn_'_t the first time they had encountered difficulty with this company .
F	payment for my ' phones was made literally on the same day as mazuma received them .
F	all this - and the cost of the worktops was less_than any other supplier ( including trade only suppliers ).
M	thanks
M	delivery company provided regular_updates including a call an_hour before they arrived .
M	so a very good company to deal with , thank_you rich .
F	maid service often , the garderners called to tidy round .
M	although the staff were always polite and friendly we were over charged on our order , & it took several weeks and several phone_calls before we were reimbursed the amount .
M	i will make a note not to use your company again .
F	however , in the end , we had to park at the heathrow_terminal 0 business car_park , because :
M	seriously ?
M	we hav ' nt fitted it yet , but as an electrician i will have no trouble ( they even supplied the plugs and screws )
M	product arrived late ( monday instead of friday ) due to their delivery problems .
M	tried to contact the store via_email 0 days ago still_waiting for them to get back in contact with me piss_poor customer service its like u got my money now you don_'_t care .
M	no delivery .
M	first they sent a text to my wife saying that the delivery would be here “. anytime_between_0am and 00 . 00_hours ”.
M	overall therefore disappointed , to say the least .
M	still no porting .
M	so , i put my trust in them and my money .
F	when you are selling an item that will always be a winner , you really should not be able to go_wrong .
F	so much for ordering the correct_part from partmaster .
F	i will not be ordering on line again .
F	when we were eventually picked_up an_hour late , we were shuttled to marmaris where the driver drive around several back streets looking for another minibus , where we had to get off ours and change to the other .
M	brilliant savings , great food , what great end to a busy week .
M	this was excellent service - considering my mistake - on a small order .
M	great website with the best selection of tunes around !
M	day started well in nottingham on my stag_do with paintball which was awesome , we then went to book into our hotel_rooms to find there had been not rooms booked and we were left waiting for approximately an hours ( vital time on your stag_do ) eventually we where put in a taxi to the other side of town moving us away from hooters where we had to be in 00_mins .
F	reliable service with cheaper and good quality products .
F	excellant service and deliverly .
F	unfortunately what i didn_'_t know was that i must have accidentally signed_up for a premium account that i did not want which would cost me £ 0 a year .
M	first order placed they forgot to deliver the grout , second order they forgot to deliver the tile spacers .
F	good value for money and postage rates reasonable .
M	their service was first_class and i would certainly reccomend them .
M	i have found their service excellent in every_aspect , with prices very resonable and delivery quicker_than forecast .
F	why ??
F	and my stuff wasn_'_t delivered until 0days_later .
M	what '_s not to like ?
F	i found mattress online & browsed through their mattresses & thought why not , so i ordered one & it came nice & early the next_day .
M	speaking with customer_support was a little difficult , i had a mix - up with regards to what course i was enrolled in and i didn_'_t get the feeling the customer_support was genuinely listening to my concern .
M	i '_m very disappointed with the quality of the product !
M	i booked a collection on tuesday for 0 day delivery .
M	they know most people do not check their allowance and by not notifying them will put their already massive profits up .
F	i paid €_00 . 00 for this service and asked that the florist call my sister - in - law prior to delivery .
M	we dispatch our goods world wide and have collections from every courier company available in the uk , all the other drivers park outside and walk up to the first floor to collect our goods without_any_problems .
F	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
F	the spray_tan was a particularly good deal , recently tho i ordered a mini cam corder and it failed to arrive .
F	i then emailed to find out when it would arrive , and when it did it was a nightmare .
M	looks nice though !
M	i ordered 0 taps from tap centre , one bathroom and one kitchen_tap on 0 - 0 day delivery .
F	this offer was was over 00_% cheaper then offered on airport comparison_sites what a great deal .
F	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
M	surprisingly , event_tyres fitter didn_'_t carry tpms spares , implied the problem was my fault , and left me to get the problem fixed .
F	so , we got on the bus for the full red_tour and had a great first 00_minutes with an affable and knowledgeable guide .
M	very prompt delivery and very high_quality good as always .
F	great communication all the way through
F	i booked a dinner / theatre trip as a special outing for myself and three friends through lastminute . com .
F	no correspondence from them at any stage of this saga and no apology just some rubbish about chinese new year .
F	i would recommend it to friends that need to create a company quickly without_any hassle .
M	package was despatched next_day but delivery is now 0 days late !
F	0 . refuse to help you ,
M	you admitted on the phone that the advert was misleading , you even suggested we cant send you what the advert suggested i should have recieved because you didnt have the full set in stock !
F	not a big problem really , i would still order from them again .
F	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
M	no_problems , no_fuss just good service .
M	i recently_bought an a grade panasonic zoom_lens - it was boxed and in mint_condition .
F	right product delivered but slow and with little / no_indication on dispatch or delivery date .
F	i '_m sorry but as a customer who has paid for a service and your company has failed to meet my expectations i have a right to complain and share my experiences with others .
M	fair to say i rang nvc as soon as i got home and continued with the quote .
F	i am pregnant and have ordered items to ease the pain i am feeling at the moment , so having expected said items on thursday the longer i wait the more uncomfortable i am getting .
M	easy wellies are reliable and efficient and i would buy from them again .
F	do not order from these people
M	easy to use website , quality products at competitive_prices .
F	unfortunately my car failed so i was told by the lad on reception to phone back on monday and he would see if he could get the parts to do the job .
M	advice to any customers : get samples !
M	the technician told me that the table , leather and chair were all defective however the customer service representative told me that these were normal , somebody is lying .
F	you are giving me a full_refund which i am grateful for but it '_s a shame that this is not made clearer on the web .
F	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
M	i contacted the company again and was told another pack would be sent , which it was .
F	advertised as uk registered company by actually conducts business out of hong_kong .
M	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
F	very easy to use , quick and effortless .
F	it did take several days after that before the items were dispatched and arrived .
F	this then prompted me to telephone my card_issuer who told me they took payment ( that was authorised ) at 00 . 00 but that at 00 . 00 that same day they tried to take the same amount .
F	!
F	all now present and correct and duly installed - will shop with more handles again
M	another bad_experience was that of my sister ordering a shirt from them quite a few_months back .
F	simply_supplements have a good range of products and their prices prove to be very good value .
M	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
F	up until this order i '_ve always had a good service , with prompt delivery , but i '_ve been waiting a week now and still nothing !
M	thank_you rxsport
F	0_days and still_waiting
M	this was all done with no_fuss and in a very short_space of time .

F	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .

F	i have no problem with the company , just the products !
F	can '_t recommend this juicer or this company any higher !
M	0 .
M	i picked my cheque up only to find that they did not need to bank my cheque the cheque was from the insurer straight to myself & was dated over a week previous so there was no need for them to hold my cheque .

F	!
F	ordered a washing_machine at 0 . 00pm on sunday and got it delivered at 0 . 00am the following_morning !
M	i had to remove these myself on the way to the test and have the wheel rebalanced .
F	having saved the company almost £_000 , 00 , i felt aggrieved that the girl i spoke to didn_'_t even say thank_you to me for my honesty , until i reminded her .
M	since the sale to ebay however , customer_services has degraded massively and several of the companies policies are , at best , highly dubious .
M	i have used mercury_av for over 0 years and found their service exceptionally good

M	we have ordered our halloween_costume twice_now but still have nothing to show for it apart_from being out of pocket .
F	the box had obviously been thrown or dropped from a height .
M	we were in at the time they claim they delivered , and not even a " you were out " card left .
M	in the interest of fairness i thought i ' d update this review .
M	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
F	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
M	the mini pen is a real find ~ well made and elegant .
F	i had to assemble the barstools and wasn_'_t as impressed with the quality of the barstools - the color was a lot darker_than_expected and there were some issues with the chair assembly and the pieces fitting correctly .

M	as yet no apologies or explanations .
M	phoned interparcel first thing this morning and after apologising they assured me that my parcel would be collected today .
F	will not_hesitate to trade with again .
F	i paid £ 0 . 00 for my first order , £ 0 . 00 to send it back and then another £ 0 . 00 to have a larger_size delivered .
F	very unhelpful .
M	they were competetively_priced compared with other_sites and were delivered in a timely_manner .

F	i am delighted with my half eternity_ring .
M	ordered a set of knobs .
M	will be ordering again from this supplier .
F	the flowers were however beautiful and more than met my expectations .
M	hermes won_'_t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual_obligations ' are the reason , although i '_ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it '_s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
M	easy to use / great comms / super_fast service , thank_you
M	they were absolutely_beautiful , measurements exactly right and looked fabulous , would definitely use net_curtains direct again .
F	i '_d even consider purchasing again but the only_thing that puts me off is the delivery arrangements .
F	ordered from appliance house ltd , purely_because they were so much_cheaper_than others , and would definitely recommend .
F	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn_'_t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it '_s arrival .
M	kind_regards will
M	i always used the local supplement_warehouse store to physically purchace my products .
M	have used rock_+ run many_times and always had the same great service .
F	my only_complaint is that , when i placed the order , i specified that the parcel should be left in the greenhouse if i wasn_'_t at home .
M	rip_off !!!!!!!!
M	poor customes care
F	i did not understand that it was not automatically_added to me phone and that i had to ring orange with reference_number
F	however , they refuse to take_responsibility of the theft ( ie their staff_members ' behaviour when he was still employed by them ) beyond giving me a £_00 gift card .
F	within a day of posting the phones back i had my vouchers through the post .
M	the original order was delivered 00 days_later by the first courier .
F	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
M	if i had know that this is how they deliver the flowers i would have gone and bought it myself from sainsburys .
F	i have posted on their facebook_page .
F	after some back and forth they did get the item to me within the next 0_days .
M	no one has rung me .
M	i can not fault spartoo with their web_site , choice of shoes , contact and delivery which was free and my shoes arrived four days after i ordered them .
F	until now i still don_'_t have a broadband / internet_connection .
M	i had previously always bought my glasses on the high_street because i wanted to be able to try the frames on first , but gd '_s free home_trial service meant i could be sure to get the right styles online .
F	i wanted to hire the vehicle for 0_days but an_error was made and it was only allocated for 0_days !
M	i '_m not much of an arts and crafts person but i found the paper i was looking for on the website , it was easy to order and the item turned_up on my doorstep very quickly in high_quality packaging - can '_t really ask for more from a retailer
M	i wasn_'_t able to figure_out where to fit the valve to stop the drip from the shower_head so went to their website and explained my dilemma with their online tech_support .
F	o spa never delivered , groupon didn_'_t want to know and refused to refund .
M	the accuracy was very poor , up to 0mm out on a 00mm length and they were hand cut nowhere_near square .
M	they claim to deliver in a week but mine took 0_weeks to arrive .
F	it was then extremely difficult to find a document to actually print , which was the only_thing that europcar could work with .
M	and use a variety of model body types .
M	this was the second order i have paced with made to measure_blinds and i would use them again .
M	( the gpo did provide the final leg of the journey .)
M	tailored to meet my requirements .
M	it '_s a real_pleasure to buy from toolstop items were sent within half hour of completing purchase , when arrived well_packaged and reasonably_priced .
M	having waited over three_weeks for my net to arrive i phoned the company saying that the web_site said ten days , so where was my net .
M	whilst i love the website and the despatching of the goods is very quick , the courier ( city_link ) that drinkshop employ is a disaster .
M	so why post six days_later for next_day delivery ?.
M	i would recommend echo_supplements to anyone who_wants to purchase supplements online and without_any hassle .
F	i was very pleased with how quick it was to order the flowers on the website for my mam '_s birthday , however when the flowers came two of the carnations were quite brown around the egdes and looked a little withered , also some of the leaves were very brown and damaged , therefore i was very disappointed with the quality , the flowers weren_'_t very expensive but i still wouldn_'_t of expected them to be of this quality , it has slightly put me off from ordering again .
F	firstly i paid for a premium delivery for saturday and my bouquet did not turn_up until the sunday after waiting all saturday for it .
M	it was not !
F	as far as i remember the postage was very reasonable ( about £ 0 ?)
F	plus , the registration process sends confirmation_email to you with your password in plain text !!
F	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
F	the next_day i received an_email_saying my order was out for delivery .
M	i know it was much of an extra_charge for delivery but still , i paid for it and it didn_'_t happen .
M	i '_ll always check here again for future gear purchases .
F	overall service was ok , i ordered the bespoke wedding_invites that you can mix and match .
F	i would just like to say thank_you to hotel_direct for our fantastic stay at the thistle_hotel marble_arch .
F	so after wasting my time and my money i decided to go to a proper agency and i found the most amazing flat in fulham .
F	i sent the mone on sat and i will receive the money in my country 0_days_later , the same than i used but saving £_00 !!
F	and , he took the time to explain things carefully
M	read the other reviews , they do not hold stock , their communications are non_existent , and they couldn_'_t care a hoot .
F	the girl put me on hold to enquire_about the two missing chains .
M	i have a 000 weight berghaus_fleece and i believe the ia fleece in the jacket is of the same insulative value as that .
F	would recommend them to everyone .
M	regards
M	very quick service and looks_like an excellent product i have not fitted it yet but i am hoping it is very good .
F	i needed to keep my existing phone live , with all the contacts , until the switch over .
M	another big_mistake !
M	i was during my 00 day stay very nervous because i didn_'_t want another scratch ( there were 00 more scratches than the lady told me !!!)
F	i love the food but received no reply to an_email i sent about varying my plan .
M	however , you do need to be very careful with their promotions as i have found out when checking the site , today , to put in another order .
F	hello ,
M	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
F	the communication after ordering etc was excellent and kept me in the loop .
F	would highly_recommend this company as they are easy to deal with either online or over the phone .
F	this was last_year .
F	its only a short_walk to the strip or a fifteen min_walk to the old town .
M	the tyres arrived a week_ago now and unfortunately were so badly packaged that they have been squashed out of shape .
M	having placed a number of orders online following my purchase from eb , every other order arrived before my eb purchase , including a 0nd_class postage from a public bidding site .
F	would have no_problems recommending to anyone .
M	then the nightmare begins .
M	balls received where ok !
F	top_class
M	guess_what so were they .
M	i would have lost a good chunck of the money i paid for the items , when there is a bedeck shop only 00_minutes drive from me , so simple to return items there .
F	could not fault the service .
F	i can '_t fault the service i received but was disappointed not to be able to buy the easter_eggs i wanted - i . e .
F	. but delay in delivery from manufacturer to marks_electrical was bordering on unacceptable . perhaps online stores should only offer what is in stock ?
M	i made an online enquiry about the flash keys and within minutes i had a reply back with our logo on the preferred usb .
M	only one payment in now im told they dont take master card debit_card not a credit_card also told i cannot pay monthly , wasnt told this in the beggining , not starting off to well , was told if i make four payments by card i would be able to change to monthly , no i carnt
F	i ordered my appliances on thursday and they were delivered on saturday .
F	delivery in a few_days .
M	we went through the plot - it website and chose the model which matched our needs ( and our budget ).
M	delivery was as planned , although take_note that they can be delivered up till 0 luckily for me they arrived nice and early .
F	not only did they fail to actually deliver the item , their communication was very poor .
M	excellent , good value very fast service .
F	however - as an octogenarian i would just say that the worry of whether this was a complimentary bouquet or not does not make one easy - and i have asked serenata to confirm that i will not be charged for this - but so far no reply - which is not what i expected . as i say beautiful flowers - but they must realise that some promotions worry the elderly !
F	omg was so happy with my personlized wedding ribbon , to be honest it was not the colour i thought i orderd but i loveit , my bridesmaids are going to be in the same colour as the ribbon , so a great big thank_you xxxxx
F	i did not receive a confirmation of delivery until over 00_hours afterwards .
F	my order went through quickly and was dispatched the same day .
F	fast and efficient service , and they send you updates on the status of your order every time .
M	says it all really , spot on .
F	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
F	on 00th_november_0000 i bough an acrylic knife_block ( 0 piece ) but it wasn_'_t suitable to my knifes .
F	and no cookies please .
M	the staff were polite , courteous and understanding wishing to conclude the matter asap .
M	nice to see a company that communicated effectively through out the buying process
M	ghd rang them but i had already spoken to someone at parcel_force .
M	everything was as it should be .
F	as she was mistaking between buy and sell rate !
F	ringtons change the delivery company for one who at_least makes an effort .
M	a 00 year_old bloke .
F	they think this is ok but nice little_earner when you submiot diofferent accounts tothe vat man !
F	i saw a copy of the request from hotel_direct to the hotel so they were telling the truth .
M	the ground staff at the airport checked us onto the bus promptly and the driver was very apologetic , and speaking spanish i was able to find out information .
M	cjs is efficient , cheap , reliable and out right the best game supplier i have found !
F	my recommendation - pleases avoid them and save_yourself your money and peace of mind !
M	i had to phone two_days_later and ask what was going on .
M	the phone was answered quickly and i was able to make the change quickly with no_fuss , confirmation e . mail was almost_instant .
F	got a reply from the company and they just come up with lies after lies , saying now that he was waiting for us before we even called him !
M	i recently_bought some cupboard handles for a bedroom project i '_m doing and i was very impressed with the quality and finish of their handles .
F	would recommend to everyone .
M	0 .
M	this is utter_rubbish and i have had no such communication from you either via the post or email .
M	very personal and helpful service would recommend these anyday
M	i knew i was going to be over paying for this tax on the ignorant but that was a bit much .
F	i am_disgusted with xdp and their service and not impressed with bedroom world either .
F	absolutely_shocking customer service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
F	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
M	bike then turns_up with what looks_like factory damage to the gear cable , then follows a 0 day charade of being told customer_services are too_busy to reply , asked for their help as needed a bike for the weekend and nothing .
M	firstly , they sell great clothes and secondly , it always comes when within the time said by the confirmation .
F	even_though i am not very competent with a computer , i managed to put_together very acceptable photo_books that we can conveniently pick_up at any time .
F	normans have so much common_sense , which makes them so efficient with a great customer service .
F	we will certainly be looking to marks_electrical for our next purchase , a replacement cooker and hob .
F	make the post_office look like a fabulous service
F	this is one of the best companies i '_ve ever had the pleasure of dealing_with .
F	live_chat was great as i needed to change the delivery address .
F	spoke to 0 people who hung_up on me .
M	they now have my money and are not responding to emails , they are based in malta , if your looking for a good reliable service this isn_'_t the one .
M	in the end you just think ah sod this and switch it off , well i did any way . and it does this quite often . the player is the worst player ive_ever_seen used on the web by anyone , and sky are meant to be one of the biggest out there so youd think they would have the best player !
F	criminal .
F	not happy at all
M	so sadly minus 0_stars for supplying non - uk product .
F	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
M	nice_touch .
M	flights with easyjet are exactly as advertised .
F	just wanted to say that gear_zone was very good and i got my product fast which was perfect because it was for a late minute present .
F	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front_gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
M	owns the cables , posts and infrastructure . a monopoly .
M	but they have 00_% of domestic phones because most people think it '_s difficult to change . half an_hour on the internet could save them hundreds .
M	this is not what you expect when you pay over £ 0000 for something .
F	not keen on your delivery company [ signed for ] really who '_s in all day had to go and collect it .
M	i said i would insure elsewhere and asked for the renewal to be cancelled .
F	iflorist say flowers have been delivered when this is not the case , i can only_assume they have been delivered to wrong_address .
F	don_'_t trust these people .
F	- i sent my mobile on a wednesday , they recieved it by thursday and i got my payment on the saturday :)
F	your website is misleading - ordering a print at lunchtime and paying for next_day delivery implies that you will get the print the next_day not up 00hours plus later .
M	grrr .
M	she has clearly been once and put three cards through on the same day .
M	i ordered two prints and a poster .
F	i was also pleased with the price !!!
F	i was a little disappointed when i saw the flowers especially as they were to celebrate the birth of a new granddaughter .
F	brilliant excellent conpany
M	i sold it on e_bay for £_00 .
F	very easy site to navigate with good views of the product .
M	their answers are automated and evasive and i have not yet had either a satisfactory_explanation or resolution .
F	otherwise everything was satisfactory .
F	problem with delivery and as soon as i called it was sorted within 00_minutes !
M	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
F	when i contacted customer service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
M	i wanted a diamond necklace for my partner , so i called dg , told them my budget , the design i liked and that i needed it on saturday at the latest ( this was tues lunchtime ).
M	i arrived at kwik_fit nottingham - new bradford at about 0 :_00am and was told that i needed to wait for about 00_minutes before i can be seen / served .
F	thank_you .
M	i have never had this problem with another ferry company who are normally very accomodating .
M	i cannot_fault the speed and quality of printzones service .
M	will use again .
M	very glad i chose this company as a supplier .
F	i got the exact money i was quoted and it went in extremely quickly to my account !
M	looking_forward to the new range from the promoted teams .
M	this to me is a monumental cock_up as it '_s not as if you can get the two confused .
M	he rang back shortly and said that the tyres were not available at the moment , being on back order , and that the person at tyre - shopper had said that an email had been sent to me a few_days prior .
F	although the tom_tom was second_hand it wasnt checked as it needed a password andall the information was in polish
F	good selection and choice .
M	it was classed_as a and was in very nice second user condition .
M	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
M	however it was only after purchasing that i discovered windows 0 00bit systems can only utilise a maximum of 0gb .
M	however i was ripped_off on fuel
F	fortunately my father saw the van and collected the flowers but if he had not they could have been there all day as my parents tend to use the backdoor when coming and going .
F	we have been buying from dobies for several_years , one year we went to someone cheaper , but they were not such good quality , and went back to dobies the next year .
M	i know that this is a common way of doing things and came up again with this ' in the dark ' collection ' in geneva as ell .
M	sometimes it feels_like these_folks aren_'_t even interested in making a sale .
M	i took the 0 none working ones back and was told i would need to bring back all 0 and have the whole box swapped .
F	so although customer service was initially poor they did acknowledge their shortcomings and rectified the situation .
F	ecco_shoes are beautifully_crafted and the results are in the skillmanship of the craftsmen .
M	ordered goods on 00nd_september , partial delivery on october 0th .
M	good price .
M	when that didn_'_t happen , i emailed again , and this time the refund time went up to 00 working_days .
M	the handset arrived along with an invoice to say i had been charged £_000 .
M	i have been impressed by the efficient service and excellent prints all at a very reasonable price .
F	christmas_presents for 00 year_olds .
F	really good service from this company .
M	email requesting import_tax payment paid on day of receipt , however , held by courier for a further eight days requesting payment .
F	i '_ve been with t mobile for about a year now , and they have been absolutely rubbish in every instance of customer service i '_ve needed from them .
M	seems every one can move a 0 bedroom house in a transit regardless of the i finery or volume requirements .
M	have used them and will use them again .
M	most users expect a decent business to provide a fast service .
M	!
M	we will use the site again but maybe next time we will order before the holes appear in socks !
M	not exactly " express delivery ( by 0pm next business day )"
M	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
F	what a coward .
F	by the next_day , the roses were already dying .
M	it '_s friday_evening now and there '_s no news , is this a joke ?
M	the item was delivered very quickly , but was not as_described .
M	no delivery paperwork had been left , there were no assembly_instructions and the roll of roof felt was ripped and had holes in .
F	i am not too adventurous on the layouts and backgrounds - just one image per page normally to get a good view of the bouuqets - but if i were to have another project i am sure i would make use of all the amazing designs available .
M	otherwise the whole rental experience was genrally pleasant and professional .
F	customer service is very poor it took 00_hrs for somebody to email me back , you cannot track your order on their site and when i rang up their telephone system apparently suffered a technical fault as i was explaining my issues and went down .
M	customer service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
F	thought i had done with the everlasting dog treat ball but she still managed to get lumps off the rubber
M	batteries are the cheapest i '_ve found anywhere and much_cheaper_than buying from the supermarket or high_street .
F	the whole_transaction was completed quickly within 00_hours , i was notified of the whole_process by email so i could watch the progress .
M	we have never had an issue with them and effectively they are invisible once you have booked .
M	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
M	i never pay for goods up front until i '_ve received them or at the most 00 %.
F	i left a telephone message explaining the error and have not had any response from jessops .
M	yet they are still being promoted via_groupon .
F	the cleaner did a great job !
M	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn_'_t received it .
F	her fire_alarm is also linked to the care line which requires a phone line to operate .
F	ffx is now my ' how much is that on the net ?'
F	has never_failed to get whatever we want , whenever we want it to wherever or whoever we want to get it to .
F	ordered a sofa and dining_table online on may the 00th .
F	right price !
F	easy to contact customer support if needed .
F	ended_up cancelling order .
F	in response to your reply .
M	only one small drawback concerning somewhat difficult to contact sales staff .
F	i have used serenata a number of times but have never seen the product .
F	i wouldn_'_t use any stronger words than that .
F	i was disappointed with the cleanliness , this may have been because we arrived the same day we booked , but the mould on the bedroom curtains and window frames had been there for some time .
F	we contacted " know how " that is a joke , we had to wait 0_days for an engineer to be told " oh we don_'_t carry that module as it rarely goes_wrong .
F	this time i chose to get paid in argos_vouchers posted phone on monday_evening after work by special delivery , updated by mazuma the very next_day .
M	can '_t complain !
F	feel a bit_cheated this time , i '_ve had to put the old one back in which has practicaly run_out and colour is distorted .
F	for the amount of spend i do with topcahback it was not worth the extra fiver but it has taken me days to find out how to log a request with them .
M	" we saw these in the shop and after sitting in them decided they would be great for our new tv room .
M	really quick service and no_problems .
M	this company is not to be trusted .
F	this is disappointing as it is not my first order to this address and i very much needed the flowers to arrive on a specific date , so i feel it is only luck that they got there .
F	i was kept in touch with my order by emails_telling when they were going to arrive which was 00_hours_later .
M	i checked this out on line and agreed this was ideal .
M	surely is to do with money and they are waiting to advertise good reviews for this company , even_though this company was named a different name months previous on review centre with terrible reviews .
F	which is a shame because they seemed nice when i placed the order .
M	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
F	the recipient emailed to say parcel had arrived_safely .
M	excellent facility wth more information and choice available than at most tyre_depots .
F	a further 0 day delay on receiving my order .
M	many_thanks & keep_up the good service .
F	the machine was delivered when they said it would and fitted with packaging removed would definitely use again
M	i won_'_t be switching from nespresso yet , i love my coffee too much .
M	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times . nothing from superfi , ok , bit_worrying , but ok .
F	00nd nov still not arrived !
M	i therefore missed the cruise .
F	i could not book the flowers on a bank_holiday monday for my parents wedding_anniversary so booked for them to be delivered on the saturday same day delivery , i had a phone_call to say that all florists in area either closed or run_out of flowers so could not make delivery that day , the assistant was very apologetic and we arranged to have them delivered on the tuesday .
F	i made a complaint and told i would get a call from manager in charge , never_heard a thing .
F	am very happy
M	i '_m really pleased with musclefood - they provide a quality product at a lower price than you ' d get off the highstreet - it tastes better too .
M	practice principal
F	my only problem with superdry is if the item doesn_'_t fit and you want to return for a refund or another size is needed .
M	hadn_'_t made a strings_direct order for a few_years , still as good as it was last time i ordered .
M	own_brand zinc_oxide tape not as anticipated - expected a firm hard wound roll not soft and floppy .
M	having a faster_payments method of payment would make you competitive with other recycling firm .
M	i brought the canvas as a surprise for some of my friends and they absolutely_loved it
M	fast shipping , great , fast helpfull communication .
M	i buy loads from this site never been disappointed
M	would have no problem using or recommending this site in future to anyone , simple and easy to follow_instructions .
M	box was torn exposing the underside of the table so no damage was by luck rather_than anything_else .
F	the furniture was so well_packaged that the large bookcase wouldn_'_t go up the stairs and they were very quick to suggest returning the whole order as they were a matching pair of large and small bookcases .
M	it was easy to select the right tyre after simply entering my reg .
M	sweatband gave_me a partial_refund , and didn_'_t cover the cost of my return postage .
M	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
F	wowcher - disappointed with the poor service from your provider and your customer_services
M	i despair of this company - please see and take_heed of the numerous online warnings about this shambles of an organisation !
F	aaaaaaaaaaaa
M	i don_'_t buy tv_stands every day but two out of two purchases went very well .
F	quick delivery .
M	he rang me about 00_mins later to apologise and said the driver was definitely on his way .
F	received email_updates .
M	the bags i ordered were just what i required to store 000 + pieces of orchestral music .
F	buy a different brand from another shop .
M	not only did it not arrive when i contacted yourselves i was told it could take up to 00 days to arrive !
M	i have been using the vitabiotics range for several months now and am totally impressed not just with the service but also the product , it '_s true what the old_adage says " it does_exactly_what it says on the tin " asked if i would recommend them the answer would be yes without_any reservations , keep_up the good work guys .
F	after waiting 0 working_days i contacted buydirect0u via_email and got an_email back saying that there had been an issue with stock .
M	!
F	everything arrives safely_packaged and delivery is always super_fast .
M	well i must_say , that i will not be going back to the conventional type mattress !
F	i went to the kitchen and added it to my shopping list , to be bought on my next trip to the shopping centre , which was in 0_days time .
F	i chose 0 - 0 day delivery but it came on the 0th working day after i had ordered it ( and was too late for the actual birthday day ). i ordered it on a tuesday_evening but it wasn_'_t despatched from the warehouse til thursday and that caused the delay i think . please try to despatch on the day after it is ordered or be more realistic in your delivery estimates .
F	lady helpful but just keeps saying " we ' re sorry you didnt like your frames " overall this is truely one of the worst online retail experiences ever .
F	i think it was poor of them not to even attempt to knock on the front_door and actually do their job .
F	the quality of the meals , especially the buffet has reduced greatly , there is much less choice , very poor quality fruit juice at breakfast , very little fresh_fruit , and much more .
F	i got a very impersonal reply_saying there had been a problem with my card and i would be getting an_email shortly .
F	lenor spring awakening 0 . 00 lt x 0
M	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn_'_t be delivered when required .
F	i would definately recommend this as it is comfortable , classy , warm and nice if you want to make an effort at xmas without wearing skimpy clothes !
F	highly_recommend this company .
F	speedy delivery .
F	my canvas looking perfect
F	i have actually seen nicer bouquets in m & s for a fraction of the price .
F	very efficient .
F	they even said that i hadn_'_t contacted them , when i had phoned them previously about the order .
F	i bought a bean_bag for my daughters_birthday .
F	00th of june now !!!
F	once back they then realised that they didn_'_t have the key to open the trailer , it was still back at the depot !
M	purchased my policy , then attempted to register online .
M	so not the best of experiences unfortunately .
F	again , i spent_ages trying to get through to the customer_services .
F	payment debited_immediately which concerned me as i '_d never used the company before .
M	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
F	i have been told they will be delivering the sofa back to me as it is now mine .
M	call_centres in india reading scripts , not helpful .
F	the rooms were spotless , food excellent and the staff catered well for the amount of people all entering the restaurant at the same time .
M	what '_s most_important -- the glasses are excellent .
M	when watching programs on the bbc_iplayer i sometimes get a message_stating ' insufficient bandwidth ' which i was assured would not be the case .
M	i recommend the executive_shaving company to you with absolute_confidence .
F	they didn_'_t reply .
F	so far so good .
F	i wish i had known about cheapsmells years_ago i would have saved a fortune .
M	i ordered 0 wi_-_fi antenna extension_cables .
F	other_companies had messed me around but mazuma did the job and kept there promise .
F	communication excellent letting you know each_step of the way from point of sale to point of delivery .
M	would still use again though as repair was good and value for money .
F	however i feel the owners let villa_plus down terribly .
M	she said they had to contact the warehouse blah_blah_blah .
F	but , i charged up as instructed ( twice ) and behold they have lasted for 0 nights from 0 - pm to midnight .
F	i ordered a second drill and was informed that the drill was discontinued but another one would be available at the end of feb and they would send out to me . this did not happen so i contracted them and they said they would ring back with information , but as previously happened they failed again . i feel the staff employed at ray_grahams are very poor when customers are promised some action to rectify specific problems and will cost the business future return business .
F	would not recommended .
F	the package arrived exactly when they said it would do , and i was very excited to receive this particular product of make up called bare_minerals that i had been told is the creme_de_la creme !
F	reading other people '_s orders , seems as though they need to work on their supply_chain .
M	there on time , but due to the long check in / passport_control i have been made to miss my boat .
F	thank_you
F	some of my bonaparte purchases are amongst my favourites - unusual items , good durability and quality .
M	the customer service is extremely un - satisfactory !

M	ordered task lights & turned_up on time .
F	it was very good service !
M	i '_ll definitely be a return customer and would recommend bella_barista to a friend .
M	although i do grant them some grace for it being close to christmas but that does not forgive being given false information no less then three_times .
M	i don_'_t rate the quality of their produce nor think much about their chauvinistic staff - akin to police who murder and practise double standards .
F	please_avoid this company like the plague !!!
F	despite this , i am happy to re - order , as the service is reliable with excellent comparable pricing .
F	why was the item displayed if it is not available ?
M	how they can call themselves such a department is a joke .
F	i would recommend this company .
F	clear , informative website .
M	left it 00 days before i contacted them , unable to trace the order - after several minutes ordered traced but had not been processed ( 00 days wasted ) i must_admit the girls on the telephone were very helpfull .
F	i dud t purchase anything !!
M	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted £_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
F	ordered fibre for my dog , it only took a few_days to get here , brilliant service thank_you .
F	than i gave up .
F	we chased him then went direct to the claims_department who siad they would look into the issue .
F	we enjoyed our stay .
M	not endured anything like that since going on a jmc aeroplane to magaluf when i was 00 .
M	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
F	cheapest price around i could find as i got mine on a star deal but service and updates weren_'_t too good , unhelpful delivery dates and misinforming me of information was frustrating but overall average experience .
F	followed the procedure to raise a case on thursday of last_week and put a landline contact number as i was working from home .
F	i have tried 0 varieties and only like one !
M	easy to order , superfamily delivery , great pants !
F	if you are tempted , then use paypal so at_least you are protected .
M	the costume was perfect !
M	cons - website has_been a pain to use , shipping_costs weren_'_t clear on the site , slow response to emails
M	probably thinks her commission is safe ?
M	will use company again thier service and delivery was outstanding
M	although at the beginning there was no follow_up call to see if my bank_statements arrived in the post - which was disappointing and i still do not know where they ended_up !
M	ok , so it '_s only a couple of quid , but it '_s the principle .
F	the guy arrived on time , was friendly and efficient .
F	the company advertised next_day deliver however after 0_days i contacted them who confirmed they had my order but had not got around to dispatching it yet !
F	i found this suit to be great all around .
F	i had to laugh though when 0_days ago i received an_email_stating my item had been shipped , it has_been sitting in my mothers lounge since christmas day !
M	i can not recommend tpw enough !!
M	with no doubts hostelbookers is the best hostel reservation website .
M	easy to use , quick , simple step guides , and better rates than anywhere_else , no faults , cant_complain really .

M	got a groupon deal , but could have got a bettter deal by internet_search .
M	i then emailed a complaint demading a refund to which i have had no reply .
M	0 ) changed browser
M	i specifically gave authorisation for the delivery to be left in a safe_place as i knew that there would not be anyone available to accept delivery - this is apparently not good enough and meant that i was without the item when i needed it .
M	i did not receive an email with log in details either .
M	i ' d ' like ' a refund , and may well pursue this with ' aferry ', unless of
M	so we ended_up booking 0 nights in lisbon , 0 nights in the florida keys and 0 nights in new_york .
M	never had a problem , always listing quality and informing customers of latest sales offers , exelent dilivery , always next_day , great service
M	this was a call to go through the same questions i ' d already been through directly with the warranty shop and the assessor .
M	the tiles were great .
M	we took out the premier plus cover with multitrip . com costing over £_00 for our_honeymoon to vegas & hawaii .
F	it has_been my misfortune to have recently had dealings with this company .
F	envelope just had royal_mail first_class on .
M	surprise !
M	for 00 years i have lifted heavy weights & trained my butt off , worked through the car crashes , surgeries , injuries etc .
M	i bought my scott cr0 and i was delighted with the service and expertise shown by all staff .
M	other than that the service is good and i will probably use again .
F	excellent service and prices .
F	it was dirty and had oil on it !!
M	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
M	i have had nothing but excuses and delay tactics since regarding my refund
F	item is exactly as_described and worth_every_penny !
M	customer service manager is poorly_trained & dosent understand customer service , offered to pop round with a customer return product to replace the one i ' d ordered and refund £ 0 . nah , thanks , but . i ordered new & kind of thats what i ' d like .
M	why would anybody consider risking a huge excess in the event of even a minor collision ?
M	in a way it was a relief to be told definitively that the parcel would no_longer be coming and to get some sort of closure , the waiting had finally come to end .
M	can '_t fault the service i required them by the 00 july and the were there for the 00 th fantastic
F	i haven_'_t bought any other items from cheapsmells so i can '_t comment but looking at the prices i would say if you find what your looking for you would be saving money . :)
F	would never use again
F	always on time , no_problems , takes the hassle out of parking or getting dropped_off .
F	i can get nowhere with them
F	excellent service very pleased with the flower plants i purchased and look_forward to a blooming 0000 .
F	wish i had seen these reviews before ordering a high value item from argos .
F	really easy to use the site , and good prices .
F	and the customer service girl on the helpline told me the fastest way was to get to a nearest tmobile store and pick_up replacement sim at £_00 !
M	ie order placed and accepted on a wednesday order arrives on monday 0 - 0 delivery paid for delvery ends up four days
F	will definitely be using this company again and have recommended them to family and friends .
M	whilst it was the cheapest tape on the website , it certainly hasn_'_t been value for money as it began to peel away from my shoulder almost_immediately after application .
F	however , to my surprise and pleasure it was a perfect match , arrived within a week and also there was no trimming to do as they made it to fit my window .
F	hello ,
M	excellent service and quality !
F	good service and communication but double the price of the actual ticket of the event so i felt as though i '_d been ripped_off when the tickets arrived .
M	the ship is very expensive .
F	thank_you for such a great service , will recommend to friends and family any day .
F	the company was very apologetic about the situation and i hope they will improve their customer service .
M	got a call to say they ' d arrived and were fantastic .
M	i would say it was well_worth the wait and the cost for the extra quality paper , my only_concern was the packaging used to deliver the product to my door i don_'_t think this was well thought of .
M	the birthday hamper left your at 00 . 00 ?
F	i have been with quidco for a couple of years_now , and although i have always been impressed with the rates of cashback they offer , the service just isn_'_t what it could be .
M	my computer eventually arrived on christmas_eve itself .
F	whilst the efficiency of the company was very good ie .
M	the following week , the order '_s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
M	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
F	i genuinely cannot recommend this company enough .
F	chatted to 0 or 0 guys and met a lovely guy and we are now in a relationship so it does work !
M	topcashback regularly top - up their offers and there is even the opportunity to gain an extra 0 % bonus by accepting the cashback in the form of vouchers .
M	i sent the phone off special delivery that day and same day had confirmation my order had been received and processed .
F	instead of going to my usual one - i decided to try something_else . lots more choice for the sympathy_flowers .
M	nu , 0 måneder efter besøget , er_der stadigvæk problemer_med mine forsikringer .
F	love my new flit_flops , came really quick and a bargain !
F	whilst you did respond promptly and refunded me the card , it would be good if you could set_up a system where cards are not forgotten .
M	i called the retailer ( fridgefreezerdirect ) and fortunately they '_ve been really good and managed to arrange_redelivery this afternoon so i haven_'_t wasted my entire day .
M	we ordered the dish_washer at 0 . 00 pm on the friday and it was delivered in the stated window period at 0 . 00 pm on the saturday .
M	in general i am happy with range of products and the prices of course - but now i have to wait approx 0 month and twice the delivery has_been postponed . so therefor a 0star
F	i then had to phone back as surprise_surprise they didn_'_t phone me !
M	no email_apologising .
M	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
M	i ordered 00 hr delivery ( lincolnshire -> london ) and it arrived in 00_hrs .
F	ordered flowers for my parents 00th_wedding_anniversary for delivery on fri_00th_march .
F	the flowers did not arrive causing anxiousness and disappointment .
M	what let it down was the total_lack of anything relevant to install the option i had ordered which was surface mount .
M	00 am etc .
M	00mm 00mm 00mm & 00mm .
F	i know i only went for normal delivery but two_weeks does seem a long time !
F	i thought that the products on the website were a unique collection and it was easy to find what you were looking for .
M	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
M	tiny arrangement ( despite ordering extra large !
M	i '_ve been using quidco for over 0 years_now , and have made cashback of almost £ 0 , 000 on my everyday spending .
M	took the shine off another wise excellent holiday .
F	two_weeks_later it still hadn_'_t arrived but they were insisting it would arrive any minute .
F	but overall i was happy with them .
F	the audio tour was clear and easy to understand and added to the experience .
M	they advised me to send it back by a freepost service .
F	having shopped on the internet for years i got caught out buying from this supplier after checking their " excellent reviews "????
F	be appreciated .
M	saga with getting the correct glass to fit the windows but all tradesmen involved have been first_rate and the finished product is excellent .
M	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0_weeks to replace the faulty_unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
M	not convinced that i will use them again , as i have in the past .
F	goodmorning ,
F	but i never got it back .
M	it took another call - a week after ordering - to establish that they were actually unable to supply the part ( they have since repaid me ).
F	not a web a would buy from again !!
F	!
M	. ' cos you ' re going to work through a lot of them before you can get your problem_solved .
F	i have ordered 0 different articles and in five weeks only two of them have arrived even_though money was taken for the goods on ordering day .
M	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
M	just as fast as promised and perfect product !
F	i really don_'_t understand_why the whole_process is so slow .
F	great service , great prices and great range of products .
M	it wasn_'_t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
F	altogether a very friendly and professional service .
M	despite_being advised to trust the sizing , the swimsuit is way too small .
M	when my phone needed repair , it was astonishingly expensive , and my queries about why were ignored .
M	a great company cannot find a fault .
F	thinking this was not an option , i phoned around as many companies as possible and managed to find a company who could do them in such a short time .
M	the product was excellent value coupled_with an excellent five_star service .
M	as the watch was currently not located at that branch , i asked a couple of questions online first to which kieran was able to answer and also send me over additional pictures of the watch ( omega_seamaster 000m ).
M	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling_regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
M	the one time i '_ve had to return something for a refund ( i ordered the wrong_size ) that was processed quickly too .
F	i so much regret that i purchased for 000_gbp on this website as my refund hasn ´_t been made .
M	so_far i have paid nearly_£ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’_t received and nearly_£_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
M	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
F	received willy_wonka suit which i was told was for a 0 - 0 year_old ref_: jmt0000000 .
F	would definitely recommend them and use them again .
M	mistakes can happen but it was a good job i was not working to a schedule .
F	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
M	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
M	very good quality .
F	we were disappointed not to get as much discount as we thought we were entitled to .
F	!
M	failed to give me the ' first - timers ' discount .
F	brilliant service , fast delivery and an excellent item , half the price than local_shops !
F	excellent service , delivered quickly , fantastic products better_than described two very happy christmas_present receivers .
M	what i like about t - mobile connection ?
F	regards
M	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
F	our son_loves the andover creative play frame and all his friends and cousins played for hours at his party - it was well and truly tested by kids from 0 - 00 years .
M	website is a doddle to use .
M	was told several_times it was now on priority order but nothing received .
F	easy process to sell and great to get money into my account quickly .
F	i was informed of the delivery date soon_afterwards and received my foreign_currency shortly_afterwards .
F	and two_weeks after cancelling order . no refund received as yet very disappointing !
M	highly_recommend the ebookers site for ease of use .
F	excellent .
F	there '_s only one shop near me that stocks scandi clothes but its great to be able to purchase online rather_than dragging 0 small people around !
M	in my experience though , i can '_t say anything great about the courier which was used ( uk mail ?
F	having inherited a wee red foot tortoise from a friend , there were lots of things i wanted to know about and many questions to ask .
M	i will recommend glasses_direct to anyone who really care how they and need not pay a fortune .
F	my friend was delighted with them .
F	never ordering from ' slow pharmacy ' again
M	wont use allbeauty . com / cheap_smells , again and will not recommend them either .
M	posted back ram .
M	this stuff really should be sorted_out electronically .
M	top_class , keep it up
M	will_certainly use this site again .
F	it arrived a few_days after the date promised .
M	the service was excellent .
M	pre ordered limited_edition gibson bill kelliher explorer and securing what was promised to be the first uk distributor to have these with a £_000 . 00 deposit .
M	took the car to the local fitting_centre on saturday_morning ( 0 min drive from home ).
M	ah not as easy as that , it will now take 00_hours . and so on it went . being_fobbed_off and continuously asked if id like to make a desposit and they would give me another bonus ?
F	return was easy and refund was made rapidly .
M	i was kept_informed by email and telephone at all_stages .
F	it helped to know exactly when it was to be delivered as well .
M	we travelled on one of the busiest fridays of the season friday 00th_july , to one of the busiest airports alicante , at the busiest of times , after work on friday .
F	i '_m delighted with my new hallway runner .
F	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
F	thank_you , i have passed on details of your website to friends so they can also benefit from your well made , affordable products .
M	i will_definitely use this company again .
F	they had taken my order knowing they were having delays with dispatch but didn_'_t tell me this .
M	no wonder mp are getting a bad rep
M	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly_agreed .
F	good service and easy booking .
F	item was delivered promptly and packaged very well and would definitely use again
M	finished item indistinguishable_from factory finish .
F	i had to buy a new mains charger when i got fed_up with trying to have a permanently charged battery at work and home .
M	got an email tonight calling me a liar !
F	so in fact our tickets are up much higher than we wanted ., in what would have been the 0th_row .
F	from now on i will avoid both companies at all cost .
F	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn_'_t turn_up .
M	on the rare occaision there is a problem , it is resolved quickly and politely .
F	i now have the choice of a lovely ' rainfall ' shower , plus the hand - held hose .
F	i think not !
M	eventually i explain the situation to my wife who is understanding , but nonetheless miffed .
F	i would be unlikely to use this company again .
M	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par_excellence .
M	i will make_sure i ring a local supplier and not be conned by using any multiple again .
F	!
M	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
M	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours so i asked for the head_office number but they don_'_t have one as its in france .
M	sds turned_out to be out of stock of the finish style for my item but emailed me immediately with this so i could proceed with something similar which came quickly .
M	this may be true , but it '_s pretty unhelpful .
F	took at a contract on the galaxy_s0 after two_weeks had problem with the phone when making phone_calls the person on the other end sounded very distorted , so sent my phone into three for them to repair , after receiving my phone back the issue had arisen again and this happened two more times where i sent my phone in for repair and it '_s wasn_'_t repaired properly i asked for a new phone but they didn_'_t give me one in the end the phone repaired it '_s self after months of problems with it .
F	this review replaces the one i left on november 00th 0000 .
F	also the cost of taxi from the villa to the hotel just added stress .
F	was easy purchasing and fast delivery with good communication_throughout .
F	would use this company without_hesitation again .
M	always a reliable service .
F	excellent communication .
M	i had moved from rackspace to save_money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
F	we list the following as missing :
M	one of the two front usb isn_'_t working .
M	although most e tailers are quite efficient this one is the best i have dealt_with so_far .
M	the site advertises that their prices could not be_beaten .
M	also everything you pay for - cocktail , dinner , sausage roll , whatever - if you pay by card you '_ll get asked every time to add a gratuity .
F	now experienced 0nd attempted delivery from yodel .
F	despite the fact we were not to blame , i was made to feel_guilty about the fact the company ' could not claim the courier and would be out of pocket ' and to add_insult to injury , my emails were ignored when requesting my refund .
M	great if everything goes_smoothly but if they mess up they just ignore you .
M	i am probably biased but i think mine is better !
M	was delivered within 00_hours however as this was a gift it would have been nice to have packed the item rather_than just putting an address_label on the outside of the box so the contents were shown .
F	why use anywhere_else !
F	now they are lying and patronising me !
F	but then it went corporate .
F	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
F	it wasn_'_t at all straightforward to use .
F	the same driver delivered 0 pallets to us over 0_weeks and was as unhelpful and unpleasant each time .
F	they need to up their game if they want to sell on the internet .
M	being the first time i have ever bought a second_hand watch , i was nervous especially as buying online you can not see the product 0st hand ; however i need not of worried as the photo '_s of the watch were great and the customer service of the highest_standard ( many_thanks tom_holland ).
M	garage contacted me to bring my appointment forward , i arrived early and all appeared well , until i got home & realised that the tyre_fitter had fitted the new tyre the wrong way around on the rim & had also damaged the edge of my alloy_wheel .
F	i had never bought glasses on the internet before but found best0specs on the internet .
F	had bit of a problem getting the right boots ( big calves !
M	good review i '_m_sure i will .
M	0 .
F	no it isn_'_t free delivery as advertised it is delivery free to somewhere local ie 00miles_away is the closest
M	i found the website more informative than any other i looked on , and the prices competitive .
M	i sent a complaint letter to chillisauce - their response :
M	if you dont mind being picked_up late and driving in a stinky car then i can recommend this company otherwise steer_clear .
F	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
F	additionally , a friend told me justsearch verbally said over the phone that 00 - 00_% of their clients have been hit by google penguin update which is around 000 other_businesses / websites .
F	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
M	i offer to pay by credit_card for order and they can put through order as they want and i am told they cannot do that because of data_protection !.
F	will be using mazuma next time .
F	i have used this company for many_years and their supplements are great .
F	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
M	it is very noisy .
M	every time we have a delivery using citylink , without_fail , the first day will end with a gleeful " successfully delivered " status on their tracking with some bizarre name having signed for it .
F	i have been emailing these people since christmas and the very charming_young_man who dealt_with me in the beginning is completely ignoring all my communications .
M	very good website with great choice , prices , packaging & speedy delivery which is free in most_cases except foodstuffs , i believe .
F	p0g might be cheap but please do not use them .
M	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
M	thus_making good customer_relations , which in turn has a knock on effect .
F	i water_damaged my iphone_0gs , and i was unable to get it fixed anywhere , it was truly destroyed !
F	i ordered an item from another company on sunday 0th and this was delivered by citylink on tuesday_morning as agreed so totally_unacceptable that this happened with this parcel and very inconvenient .
M	we were told by linda that if it got to the 00st_january then they would simply replace the tv .
F	when it arrived i was so excited and couldnt wait_till try it on him , to my total disappointment it was huge .
F	i will not be using you again !
F	i have tried 0 times via_email to contact wowcher but no one will reply and i have also telephoned twice only to be on hold for 00_minutes then to be cut_off saying no advisors are available .
F	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
F	this year i decided to use them again .
M	i got a new one , but then my bt_vision stopped_working .
M	in reply to this they offered me a £_00 refund which i accepted
F	i had these glasses one week and one of the nose_pads came off .
F	the proof of the meat is in the eating .
F	if you are looking for good value find another place
M	ordered my locking_wheel_nuts on 0 / 0 /_0000 .
M	i then returned back to the store a week_later and asked for the manger , i asked_him if there was any chance of changing it for cash he then was extremely rude and gave_me a number to call after refusing to deal with the matter over phone he then told he couldn_'_t help me further .
F	the company ignored this .
M	seeing it cost me £ 0000 . 00 to have the surgery for no good reason .
F	i '_ll definitely use serenata_flowers again .
M	item arrived quickly and well_packed .
F	they failed to deliver , much to my disappointment and embarrassment .
F	i dont like when the company force a policy on me .
M	it really helps that the items i wanted to order had a lengthy description and told me what i basically needed to know .
F	also emailed twice which were both ignored .
M	easy to follow website and so_far every delivery has_been made as promised .
M	0 .
M	aftersale delivery communiction is non_existent unless you request it ( scan . co . uk '_s courier is fantastic for communication )
F	!
F	i will now be getting my cat_food from a different supplier
F	rebooked tickets and rang to confirm , a ) would get refund and b ) get emailed another voucher .
F	terms for delivery was that i had to be there to sign for it - like most people if i '_m ordering online i '_m probably working and don_'_t have time to go to stores hence wasnt in when yodel tried to deliver .
F	extremely simple ordering process , good price , rapid delivery , excellent quality !!!
M	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave_me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
M	i have been instore many_times so i know it '_s a reputable_company , however i can only_assume the online business has_been pushed to the side because the service is atrocious .
M	sent me 0 emails in 00_minutes , all the same , offering 00_%_discount , none of the discounts worked and when i rang them , they didnt even know their " outsourced marking company " were sending the emails out .
M	read the reviews for yourselves .
F	when i arrived in the road the next_day , i was unable to find the premises .
F	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
F	0 - 0 roses with some cheap filler , the recipient was not impressed either !
M	as it happens this was quite inconvenient . no apologies received .
M	i have paid £_00 for a cd booklet size photo_book .
F	i placed the order 0 minuted after 0pm and was told the order would processed the next working day .
M	might just have been an unlucky once off for me though as i '_ve since received a follow_up explanation from darren , so your mileage may vary .
F	when it was received it was only 0mm_thick .
F	will be visiting this retailer again .
F	unreasonable !
M	the new socks i ’ ve just bought are the best cycling socks i ’ ve ever had .
F	very pleased with the watch .
M	ok i called allbatteries and they was very helpful .
M	booked the car in may , got to the airport then was told the car that we had booked was not available and was told that we had to take a smaller car , not good with 0kids 0adults 0hand luggage 0suitcases , good news after 00_minutes of stand off managed to find us a nice little upgrade convenient but appreciated , thanks
F	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0_days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn_'_t happen .)
F	what is the point of inviting customers to enter delivery instructions if they ' re not going to be used ?
F	this also happened to my partner with a different order !
F	i would definitley use you again .
F	recommended and i will use again :-)
F	on the plus_side , there was very good communication_regarding delivery date etc .
M	i '_m so feed up with talktalk , they are from far the worst internet supplier i ever had !!
F	they have been absolutely fantastic , and made sure that they have done everything for me .
F	nang item , fast delivery .
F	i would recommend them as i had a good experience
F	overall cheap and did the job so would book with them again dispite the drop_off hiccups
M	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
F	the website was easy to use & eflorist have a fantastic variety to suit all tastes & budgets .
M	install the phone app asap !
M	the process was easy enough but you need to fill in full detail if you want to try and match exactly_what you are after but in my case there were zero returns so cannot review nothing .
M	i '_ve been buying skis and ski stuff from edge and wax for about four years_now and service has always been perfect .
M	definitely a great service .
M	what more can i say !
M	why pay for prime if the courier is rubbish !!?
F	it is a story of two_halves . electricity switch smooth as silk no_problems . my gas switch . i am still_waiting . following 0 separate calls into first_utility all with a wait time of over an_hour before being answered .
F	an easy website to use and always quick .
M	it might be useful .
F	we are going to order another couple of pairs so he can have spares in the car , office etc .
M	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated .
F	back to interflora . com for me next time .
M	i took a business flight from amsterdam to edinburgh , a pilot was stiing at the middle seat , which should be empty , made the journey unpleasant .
F	poor and in this day and age myprotein , you are failing in a lucrative market and should either pull yourself up by your wrist wraps or do what i had done to me - hang up .
M	so , tescos together with sainsburys are worthy of three and a half stars for range of items sold .
M	i would recommend them with no_hesitation .
M	the package never showed up on saturday .
F	i am_currently using the name stickers for some dementia patients in a care home where items get mis_- placed daily .
F	by having such response , i reported the problem to manufacturer directly and , oh miracle , the phone was repaired for free .
F	the shoes where ordered from a friends wish_list for his_birthday , they were too_big so had to be sent back to exchange for a smaller_size .
F	the same is true for suppelements ).
F	i was very disappointed as i had to miss my granddaughter '_s drama show to catch the delivery man .
F	they helped_me loads when there was a problem with the delivery of my item and they sent replacement .
M	we '_ve tried other car_hire_firms and have been disappointed .
M	rung handtec and they apologised saying they would send the items and they should be with me on saturday or monday .
M	i wish i had checked this site first , i don_'_t know how this company is staying in business .
M	we used both phone and online methods of contacting them and they were always quick to return our calls . if you are looking for a one stop booking process use tickettree .
F	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00_min journey .
M	well be back as a customer .
F	i love my daily contacts , they fit really well and they were delivered very quickly
M	really amusing that of course its the customers fault as he " didnt see " hidden away information_relating to the companies stock_levels , nothing what so ever to do with my " order was accepted on a next_day delivery basis " & that no attention was drawn to the fact that the item was out of stock .
M	i didn_'_t like the item i purchased and took it to my nearest superdry store in birmingham bullring , i asked kindly if i were to have a refund a member of staff then rudely spoke to me and told me to ' ask him ' and pointed .
M	don_'_t think i '_ll be buying again .
F	den kunne i midlertid heller_ikke bestilles med levering , så_det måtte jeg selv klare med_en taxa , da_jeg_ikke har bil og ikke kan have en stor gulv lmpe på_en cykel .
M	it seems to me that this company either has very little stock of items it advertises or they blatantly don_'_t exist .
M	i would highly_recommend this website to my friends .
M	however i am sure this will be made good as it was in a previous order with the same problem .
F	0 ) generic replies to emails ( we are sorry for the delay , awaiting dispatch , high_level of orders etc ), none of which answered my questions
M	i bought a samsung_galaxy s 0 from buymobilephones recently .
F	quick easy and good product .
M	the gear was good but the delivery has put me off
M	no reply to e_- mails
F	very poor .
M	reported all this to holidayautos on my return and they said they could do nothing about the condition of the vehicle and hid behind the small_print in relation to the fuel_policy .
F	after paying & order confirmation coming_back ok , got another email to say - sorry , now monday , then another to say oops , now tuesday !!
F	finally received and are lovely frames but disappointed i paid for something that said in stock and then had a prolonged wait .
F	only bonus is that someone somewhere may get a recycled phone .
F	also a very quick service .
F	a shame but would now hesitate to recommend on the two negatives alone .
M	simple to use site although could of got a fit date 0 days earlier from tyre_shopper at the same branch .
F	otherwise i like quidco very much - getting paid for doing your usual shopping , it '_s win , win .
F	goods have always been delivered very quickly , and they are so much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
F	" i can see it is lost in transit "." i can refund you "
F	they were so helpful , efficient & could not do enough to help me .
M	the items came quickly with no issues .
M	i would quite happily have paid extra for a better factory fit finish as it is i am now having these things corrected by an after market company .
M	also very fast delivery of purchased items , would definitely recommend to friends & definitely going to buy again in the future !
M	however i will await the monthly_bill .
M	can '_t fault such a simple and straight_forward service .
M	after_speaking to cretin number " in customer service " employee of the month goes to the woman not uk_based who asked for details and then of the account .
M	ordered item and received goods a few_days_later .
M	cheap , quick and efficient .
F	i will_continue to use the topcashback service but find it very frustrating when this happens /
M	craig bottomley

F	no_hesitation in recommending .

F	excellent quality and excellent delivery .
F	i think they took payement in full for the bed and next_day delivery knowing they woudlnt deliver .

M	was kept up to speed with email_updates concerning the tracking and the service was efficient and rapid .
M	i ordered a new stick on the afternoon of bank_holiday monday and by wednesday i had the order delivered , everything was spot on with the order and being a valued_customer i even got a better discount , not to mention the chocolate easter_egg that came in the package ( even if a little crushed thanks to the courier drivers :) )

M	visiting my sister in nottingham i decided to go to a company i heard of on tv / radio as i don_'_t know the city .
F	i ordered a 000gb ipod_classic online .
M	would have been a 0 rating if it was not for stupid error which should have been caught before leaving but found customer_services to be more efficient .
F	i heard_nothing for 0_days so called them again - the guy i spoke to was helpful and apologetic , said the doors were due for delivery on that day , but explained that they use an_independent delivery company who he would need to contact .

F	as first time customers , we would have welcomed a tweak here !
F	i was relieved to find out they had been delivered , but for hours i was worried_about it , and they weren_'_t delivered properly .
F	perfect .
F	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
F	going back to the velcro_straps , they are very very difficult to manage .
F	shame , as the first time i used them they were good and will think_twice about using them again .
F	my son arrived home about 0 pm friday to find the flowers outside the front_door of their flat , whilst i am amazed_at the speed of the delivery i did not request same day delivery and was rather cross that a £_00 arrangement was left unattended on the doorstep .
F	this herb is wonderful to reduce high sugar it has brought mine down to normal range i prefer it to capsule_form as it seems to work better .
M	arrived next_day with one set of lights missing .
M	the trip on the ferry / cruiser was great , plenty of places to eat , the rooms are fine and staff are awesome .
F	i have been given excuses like they have a backlog , the driver isnt answering his phone , the drivers are behind because they cant go out until the hub arrives ?
M	how you get 0g of something into a 0 . 0g serving is quite beyond me - but that is what the label said !
F	it has taken over a week to get my refund .
M	bought a specialized echelon which i measured and found to be the wrong_size ( my fault ).

M	seams puckered by machine so had to be sent back and resown .

F	my costume arrived quickly and is great on :) will use again have passed the website to a few friends .
M	the delivery is very quick , safe , but no wasted packaging .
F	i was given an initial date for delivery ( albeit provisional ) but there was subsequently a delay of 00 days .
M	mark bowles
F	just never received my confirmation of flight / booking .
M	as i expected no goods turned_up .
M	an unusually poor experience from resorthoppa .
M	i deliberately chose to order from uk web sites to avoid import_taxes etc .
F	i was kept_informed when it would arrived and the delivery company texted me in the morning to say exactly when they would arrive - and they were accurate to 00_minutes - a rare happening these days .
F	it '_s always delivered within a couple of days of ordering , the sacks i buy are always very secure and so are the packing boxes .
M	the next_morning , the guys emailed me at around 0000 !
F	i have paid on the 00 / 0 for my item and also paid for delivery - yet isme is doing nothing to get my item delivered to me !!!
M	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
F	easy to order
F	it was a shame as they did look smart on arrival although there was not very much colour in the bunch ."
F	the engineer arrived promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
F	not sure how they justify that .
M	in our case we did supply the reviewer with goods , but the user obvoulsy ordered something else from elsewhere and got mixed up .
M	checked they had stock , discussed delivery options , ordered and arrived next_day .
M	i used to shop around for the best price but i don_'_t bother now because i have always found they give the best value .
F	what a company - i was thrilled .
F	i would have been fine with late delivery if someone had let_me know that there has_been a delay .
M	but they are still probably ok value - i guess you pay for what you get .
M	you create an unhappy customer from a happy one - not , i would suggest , a sensible strategy !
M	well_packaged and quick delivery .
M	!
M	i ordered product that i didn_'_t want , and overpaid for it .
M	ive found the signal to be always good but the tariffs arent the best around
M	the lady on the phone was very helpful .
F	i am amazed by the results , the detail , the quality and it was so easy to upload especially with faces to indicate whether it '_s good , ok or rubbish enlarging a print to that size .
F	they are an underestimated asset as they brighten_up the day for so many people .
M	twenty two and a half hours from ' click ' to ' bing - bong '!
M	a great site for newbies with lots of free money and rewards availible .
M	' that '_s no good ' i said ' i need it up here ' sorry cant do that health and safety ' he said .
M	a quick email to paulo and he called me to find out what i needed and he then set about packaging up all of the , now , urgent stuff and has just informed me that it is being despatched today , with the rest to follow once it comes in from the manufacturer .
M	!
M	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
F	i asked for this to be forwarded .
M	picked the car up with no_fuss and even got an upgraded model to the one i paid for .
M	i hope someone contacts me !
M	i saw the item i wanted , it was easy to order and had good communications from the company , delivery was excellent , and item was just what i wanted .
F	!
F	so much of it was dented , scratched , chipped etc so even before it was fitted i was told a french polisher would be out to rectify .
M	provide an excellent one to one service with good knowledge_base .
F	received an_email on 00st_march saying that my order had been dispatched .
F	they '_ll make_sure of that - they talk in riddles - go with a decent company , not them .
M	i was told that the original transfer was not done properly and another attempt would be made , which would take . you guessed it upto 00_hours to complete .
M	i would not say dont stay there but be aware it is basic , room above the pub so all noise can be heard unntil pub closes , also had to ask for bathroom to be cleaned which was done promptly , friendly people , stayed 0 nights and no other cleaning whatsoever was done .
M	especially as now you can get paid electronically .
M	regards
F	budget was a bit_tight though but for £ 0 . 00 i managed to send a nice little bouquet of flowers to my friend ( including a message card ) and it arrived the next_day .
F	i loved the simple text that was on the cards and i just edited a few details to personalise it .
F	however , i have never had any_problems with payment , although seeing negative_reviews online of ' sagepay ' the payment_method i have seemed to be fine with that .
M	easy_peasy .
F	i appreciate there would be some variation on available blooms but i ordered pink and they turned_up yellow and white .
F	call returned by cs at 00 : 00 missed the call ( phone was on charge in my kitchen ) so i phoned back at 00 : 00 spoke with ( name_removed ) and he has informed me that ( name_removed ) team_leader at the store will be calling me tomorrow .

F	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two_days_later but never mind i '_ll just book a days annual_leave !
M	they like to have their own piece of everything and if someone does something better then they just try and kill off competition with buying companies out or buying exclusive content / hardware for themselves .
F	watch shop web_site is really so easy to order from , and their delivery and information on progress of the order is really impressive .
M	i have also bought glucosamine tablets for my dog , and they have worked_wonders , making her arthritis much more bearable .
M	furthermore there are no plans to ever upgrade my local exchange , let_alone me , to fibre .
F	:_d

F	i then checked junk_mail and not there either .
F	i have checked my hard_copy print and the copy on the order and it does not occur on the original so it must be a fault on your system .

M	i used thesignbuilder as it had a design it yourself section which i found intuitive and quite easy to use .
F	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd .
M	a fixed ip is esssential if you want to view your cams while away from home .

F	i am awaiting a refund and will review back again shortly .
F	i can only_assume the rough_handling by the courier ( none of them handle parcels with care ) had caused the bottom tray of 0kg_chicken_breast to split and leak its liquid content .
M	i have now used shima_uma on two occasions and both_times have found them to be cheapest on price , good at communication and fast on delivery .
M	crap .
M	that was the exact_model and year i was after so was great to be able to find it on here .
F	great website and prices
F	have used the one near mine which is handy .
F	the item was worn twice and the seam came undone and frayed

M	as it turned_out , the locauto office at palermo airport couldn_'_t have been more helpful . though i have only been back one day , i have their reassurance that my card_details are now blocked , and no money can be taken as we signed the vehicle off in full .
M	it was delivered on time , for free and is every bit as good as the description on the website .
M	fantastic range of products , delivered next_day , at very competitive_prices .
F	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .

F	made have a lovely selection of items but the waiting and the delivery ( we don_'_t all work at home , you know ) can be a right pain .
F	trousers arrived monday_afternoon .
M	the quote was the most competitive for eurostar and i did not_hesitate to book .
F	as new users of e_- cigs we had never filled a cart before and were a bit_nervous aboutb handling the e_- liquid .

M	i ordered a sax mouthpiece via the website where there was no mention that it might be out of stock ( unlike_other_websites ).
F	luckily i have a very handy husband who had to cut the barrel to make it fit .

M	three parcels to oz , £_000 said the post_office , ' nuts to that ', i said , so i got on my trusty google and found me . transglobal_express !

M	definitely worse customer service since the takeover by cartrawler backed by eci partners and guess_what no reply from international regarding my complaint .
M	would thoroughly_recommend both models !
M	not as_described , incorrect , damaged , general poor seller standards and products .
M	why would i write to a friend who gave_me a parking service ?
M	you must get complaints all the time .
M	then i realised that the water coming through the ceiling ( and wrecking the timber ) was independent of rain - it was condensation .
M	and , most_importantly , the promises are kept and no last_minute surprises involved .

F	how this company makes money is a wonder .
M	i phoned for some information_regarding the product and they were very helpful .
M	i had complained on the telephone and followed this up with an e_mail , that has_been received , asking for some money to be refunded to compensate for the wrong shorts ( obviously could not return as we had to wear them ) and for the very very poor print quality , to this day , no one has had the decency to reply .

M	had a cheque for £_00 within 0 days of selling the phone .
F	thank - you for restoring my faith in a pleasant shopping_experience & excellent service .
M	have dealt_with this company before without problems so perhaps it is just a glitch .
F	on other occasions i have connected to the same number i always ring 0000000 ** 00 ** 0 , & an auto attendant then some prostitute chat line on many occasions telling_me what bikini she had on , & what she was prepared to do to me .!!?!
F	i do like the items but i don_'_t think they are worth £_00 . 00 , £_00 . 00 but maybe around £_00_-£_00 without having to pay for delivery .

F	i have always thought raja pack too expensive , but i love their silver kraft_paper it is excellent quality so i always buy it .
M	even then , it didn_'_t arrive . i had to go to the post_office to pick it up .

F	received the remainder - even then i had to go in to one of the stores for a credit - i will never book a home delivery with them again !
F	had a small problem when received damaged , however they were very very quick to respond to my email and replace the item .
M	told at this stage that refund would take up to 00days , why ?
M	despite ordering something shown as ' in stock ' on the website and payment being taken immediately , it '_s now been almost two_weeks and still no delivery .
M	!
F	i am totally_disgusted and shocked that a company can operate in this manner .
F	pulling my hair out with frustration at customer non service based in india who read of a script , probably the rudest negative customer service i '_ve ever_encountered .
F	some thread was coming off at different places , and i am a size 00 - 00 so to be sure to get it to fit nicely i bought a 00 - 00 ( i have a large bust but a smaller waist ), well it is good for a size 00 size as a plank , i mean no boobs bigger_than an a and a man '_s waist !!!
F	easy ordering system .
F	i am feeling slightly let_down and irritated that ill need to add more brushes to my kit so soon as i feel several of the brushes just don_'_t have the finishing quality look i am looking for unfortunately .
M	used before and will use again
F	will be returning lights as no good to me like this . you did not make it clear that you need all the attachments , feel conned .
F	when we go on board , all we want to do is have some food and rest for a couple of hours , but it isn_'_t very pleasent when is not clean .
M	if you find a really good bargain , just don_'_t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
F	however i have a coded gate at the end of my street and was in all day and recieved no calling_card
F	very pleased with the product purchased .
F	i feel as if the payment i '_m due to make was purely for advertising on the web ; other services were very limited .
M	once i reached the train_station i decided to check my emails but something was wrong as i could not check my emails , instead i got a message_saying there was no credit on the sim .

F	i emailed and telephoned my designated sales_advisor and had no reply .
M	quality - again not very good .

M	i would not trust them again in the future .
M	their prices and range are excellent though so as i am generally happy in the knowledge that if i were more organised this wouldn_'_t be an issue .
F	yodel is useless and i would never use them again .

M	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
M	assembled today but had to take to engineer to fix the infill washer and cost me money an time .
M	while it '_s understandable that mistakes_happen , i noticed the sweatshirt had been re - labelled as the item i wanted , almost as if they were trying to give me another design hoping i wouldn_'_t notice .
F	by 0 . 00pm i was told they couldn_'_t get_hold of the cleaner .
F	thank_you
M	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
M	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
M	a couple of frames i '_ve ordered have had scuff_marks when arriving up by van - so perhaps more padding on the floor / between other frames in the van would be good .
F	not only are they tiny , but they have also chosen colours that make it even harder for the customer to read them .
M	easy to understand with the registration_number search ; a good range of tyres with explanatory details on each ; and an easy way to sort_out a suitable fitting_station .
M	je_n ' ai_pas pu indiquer que_j ' avais un animal de compagnie pour effectuer la traverser aller retour de nice vers ajaccio .

F	so pleased with it , looks_stunning in my bathroom !
M	everybody complains about this at the airport and i feel this is something that rental_companies should deal with .
M	the delivery was well_packaged .
M	good service at black_circles but a day late due to courier problems
F	the product arrived as_described , value for money .
M	i have used this company a few_times and every time had problems , parcel not collected on time , parcels not delivered on time , i can reach them only by chat , latest package was lost , had to do all the legwork for them and send all the documents , it took me about a day or 0 to get this sorted and finally refunded .
F	luckily it all worked out but it might not have done .
F	after phone has_been cut_off two times !
M	one of them wasn_'_t aware of the problem and seemed baffled , saying they would get the software developer to look into it .

M	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
F	they have several delivery options including_saturdays .
M	without a doubt , one of the best customer service based companies out there . great range of e_- cig '_s and extras , best prices , best forum_members and a great team led by abe and matt . hightly recommend doing_business with this company if your giving up smoking . im using them weekly
M	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won_'_t pay for the goods potentially a year in advance .
M	i won_'_t be buying from made . com again if that '_s their business model
F	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay away .

F	day 0 - no parcel
F	the flowers were lovely , but let_down by the delivery .
M	ive tried others , i '_ve tried ebay .

F	we love homebase and have never had an issue .

M	marcel was grumpy ( given i had complained ) despite him being in the entertainment industry .
F	i had already advised the controller that if i had to pay any change of booking_fees that these would be forwarded to the company as the whole idea of booking valet_parking was to ensure minimum delay .

F	following our stay at the ciltern hotel and restaurant , princes risborough , bucks , we were left with very mixed_feelings .

M	i have dunlop tires , but the higher_grade ones ( not the cheap ones ).
M	the re - arrange_collection facility does not work .

F	i called customer service twice both_times the agent tried to cancel my order .

M	great prices on the tyres too !
M	regard
F	jennifer lowe
F	i had my veneers done at perfect smile studio hertford and i am very happy with the result .

M	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
M	i have been using ebay for a number of years , but no other company has even come close to rawk .
F	when i went to add the other driver the waiting time was anywhere between 0 to 0 hours to have this done .
F	regards ,
M	they claim to have sent me a replacement battery , but i have never received a replacement battery and the bogus tracking_number doesn_'_t work with any provider ( note they didn_'_t provide a courier name !
M	it ´_s a good seller
F	i had to call once because of a glitch in my email ( i wasn_'_t receiving my confirmation ), and they were incredibly polite and professional .
M	all in all , reasonably satisfied .
F	it was not capable of doing what was needed and what we told the salesperson in pc_world we needed it for , i . e .
F	as we needed the tiles quickly - which is why we placed the order for a tile that was ' in stock ', we had to cancel the complete order and go elsewhere .
F	however , i am disappointed with my slippers .
F	the meals were ok .
M	the prices for the items we bought were very competative
M	i ordered a camera lens off them over £ 0000 worth .
F	excellent service couldnt_believe_how quickly my order was actioned and received wouldnt_hesitate in recommenidng your service
F	phoned up and they said they had a problem with their supplier .
F	thank_you x
F	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
M	!
F	absolutely_brilliant !
M	then the glasses turned_up without the amends despite_being charged .
F	just first_class .
F	good quote for the phone , good communication and very quick service .
F	this company , brittania , was excellent and our car arrived back more promptly than through any other company i had ever used .
M	!
F	there is a distinct theme on this thread which csl are clearly not addressing and which , sadly , is letting them down big time .
M	all_round , well_worth the money .
M	prices were good , details for payment appeared simple ,
F	luckily this did not happen so no_harm done .
M	they did refund me my delivery charge , but that is the least they could do under the circumstances .
M	they phoned up , informed me of the delay and suggested an_alternate product and matched the price .
M	the free returns_policy will not be needed which does not surprise me as timberland are extremely well made shoes .
F	excellent blinds
M	they couldn_'_t care less about the disastrous effect this had to my business , or my health .
F	the product was cheaper_than i usually pay at my vets .
M	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’_t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
M	first i had to remind them that i put a order in after a week of waiting , then when my order was sent out it was not pack it was just trong in a box so when i open it there was not packaging just the good and part of the order the snorkel was damage ,
M	best regards ,
F	delivered next_day both_times and a fantastic refund policy :)
M	i had a small problem with the boiler but this was very quickly resolved to my complete_satisfaction and without_any hesitation on the part of plumbnation , in fact they couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
M	would i buy from ao again ?
F	once i had a delivery date it was hassle_free .
F	it was delivered on time , just what i ordered and very happy with it .
M	all - in - all we are delighted , and we went on to purchase some bedroom_furniture too .
F	contacted steve again and reordered another style calvin_klein which are unfortunately again huge , but now l just give up and l am going to have the original frame l liked with the wrong prescription changed at boots for a cost of 00 pounds .
M	to get an evening delivery £_00 . 00
F	same with 0 & 0 , sometimes i have people on the phone that are trying very hard , and sometimes they are just rude .
F	shower cabin instructions very unhelpful , item described as easy to assemble and made in a way to eliminate need to channel in pipe work both statements wholly inaccurate , instruction refer to a " skirt " which is not supplied plumber had to make a base for tray to sit on as it is far too shallow , basically quite dissapointed with the whole_thing .
F	i sent in monthly readings to first_utility , who did not use my electric readings as they were so low . perhaps it could be the solar panels and the fact that i live in a sustainable house with low_energy needs .
M	my grandma never received her flowers over xmas .
F	very slick , professional service .
F	there were a few out of stock but i have received emails to let_me know how long they will be and i am sure they will arrive as soon as possible .
F	i will certainly have no_qualms about using glasses_direct again
F	they then said it was faulty due to my mis use . ie the hand piece was full of white powder .
M	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail_lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
F	would definitely recommend .
F	the packaging was also very good .
F	the only_thing i have to complain_about is the flowers never arrived until 0000 on thursday 00 / 00 / 00 which i had to keep telling my partner that i was getting something deleiverd to her address so she had to get her daughter to stay in when she nipped out so my surprise wasn_'_t a surprise cause she new something was coming to the house .
M	everything advertised was provided .
M	of the 0 or 0 check in desks available only 0 were open meaning customers like myself unable to fit into the cabin and queuing in the rain .
M	and so i had to cut the foreign plug off and fit a uk version instead .
M	excellent service
F	if i am looking for tee_shirts i always check qtag to see if they have them first .
M	if they offer 00p give the book to charity shops .
M	redruth the town is a bit drab but is a good central spot to stay if you want to explore gorgeous cornwall .
F	its now exactly a month since i placed the order , which by the way was a christmas_present !
F	the price was very good given the high_level of quality .
M	also , adding / changing addresses on the site is stupidly overcomplicated .
F	good communications , excellent product , ultra rapid post .
M	really happy with the skis , fast free delivery and was delighted with the free poles that i did not expect .
F	then a friend said to try advantage and so far so good .
F	he was so pissed_off about it he was going to take a day off work and visit their_offices .
M	then the flowers i had oroginally ordered showed up at 0000 !
F	just wish i could find what i '_m looking for .
F	with regards to this particular hotel , unlike our expedia special rate hotels , we do not have a room contract with the property and our website is used as a portal by the hotel to facilitate booking .
M	the retailer suggested they ' re supposed to * actually * attempt delivery and are obligated to wait for 00_mins at each address or they really get in trouble .
M	brilliant service , no_hassle .
M	unfortunately , its gone off the boill recently .
M	now for the first time in over 0_weeks i have had a response !!!
F	they delivered my item very quickly and it was a good price .
F	items arrived a few_days_later with instructions & proper packaging .
F	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .
M	they said they would do that .
F	he finished the call and told me he would give me back my old phone only if i gave him back the new one and he would come_back tomorrow and do the swap as he had other deliveries to do .
F	ordered a special custom club over the bank_holiday_weekend .
F	if these above problems are not resolved , then the tour needs to start at_least 0 hour earlier for those who have paid to see such a fabulous place .
M	when buying my item it said , free delivery to uk ,. but later was ask for £_00 . 00 to ship to belfast . did not say free only to uk_mainland at the time .
F	an_alternative was offered , but at over twice the cost ( plus_vat ).
F	great smooth service
F	not been delivered yet
F	it is really difficult for me to check my bills .
F	have recommended to a friend already .
M	this is the first time we have used hfe_signs & banners and the level of service at every_stage has_been superb !
M	delivery time :
M	in the end it did turn_up next_day , so im none the wiser why it was cancelled in the first place
M	the staff were pleasant and polite but not that helpful on reception , never been there before - booked in and asked where to find my room , i was carrying my bags / suit , staff pointed towards the entrance and said " its just to the left " - so i walked out the doors and turned left - all doors on the outside are locked , walked back in reception to ask again - and only then did they show me the door on the left next to reception - so they watched me walk out of the building after asking where my room was , carrying everything and no one thought that i had missed the correct door ?
M	below is copy of the last e_mail from customer_relations of lastminute . com !!
F	great experience and fast service .
M	nice easy to use site too
F	took 0_days to get key
F	i am very seriously_considering moving to another_provider , orange has_gone so far down in my estimation .
M	highly_recommend .
M	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an email asking why you made it .
F	brilliant service would recommend them anytime
F	i sent it straight_away and the next email i had was a week and a bit later saying my payment had been processed .
M	for example , the rear drum / shoe brakes needed cleaning and adjusting for £_00 which i thought should have been in the service - after all they would have already taken off the drum to " inspect " them as per service schedule - surely all the dust would have fallen out !
F	tried to use item but the volume is extremely low .
M	good fan ( airflow icon ) 00 , easy ordering , brilliant delivery service so i will always look at fastlec first in future .
M	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
M	i took my daugthers car in for a " half price full service " at the wolverton branch and found that the car had lots of " recommendations "
M	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
F	so easy to deal with , will_definately use again .
F	!
F	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit_harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround sound ' baby crying .
M	flowers delivered were a good quality and i would have been delighted had they been what were originally ordered .
M	i like the website for the price but quality is poor .
F	came on here for a birthday_present and it was a bargain .
F	( the exception to this is if items are out of stock . i understand that )
F	i am very happy with my storage_jars , thank_you , they make a great present .
M	if it is stated in the product description , it '_s well hidden .
F	we ordered some specialist_cat_food from viovet and they were quick and easy .
M	she said your order has_been dispatched and i asked here tracking no she said courier will give us in next 0 to 0 days so then she will give me .
F	couldn_'_t ask for better
M	i had to call a friend to assist me in getting it up to my flat .
F	they are holding_onto people '_s money .
M	no packaging or seal leaves me sceptical_about whether or not genuine product .
M	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
M	i call monday mid_morning and i '_m told the tyres are not there yet and they would call me when they were .
F	seller has now lied to paypal about the delivery of this item ( despite providing photographic and email evidence to the contrary to me )
M	i told my doctor that i was now getting my supllies mail order and he said that you should never do that because you can '_t be sure of the quality .
F	we had a bad_experience at the holiday desitnation and it took lots of correspondence to feel as if we had been taken notice of
M	great service but annoyong if you miss a text as the advert comes down .
M	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
M	save_yourself the bother and disappointment , will have to reclaim my money through my credit_card company .
F	you might be a slacker but i '_m not , another day thats going to be wasted !
F	when i first booked the car , i booked it from france mainland as we were heading for chamonix .
F	already ive started recommending to friends and family and would definately shop_here again .
F	no apology from the store , no gratitude gift for the length of time it took but at_least they had taken my money .
F	their cost for parts and labour ( 00 minute job ) £_000 plus_vat .
F	i probably would shop with bedeck again but possibly not for curtains .
M	but the prices and range i think are good .
F	every time i have contacted t - mobile , i have also spoken to poliet , extremely_helpful people and any concerns or problems that i may have had , have been resolved quickly and efficiently .
M	i needed to replace the rollers in my shower_door because they did not work .
M	absolutely recommended and will_certainly use them again .
M	i '_ve been for more than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer service team .
M	comfortably pleasant purchase experience from_start to finish
M	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
M	we started with the footstool first which was a doddle .
M	selectspecs offered to changed them for a a fixed lens pair , but i declined .
M	happy days !
M	this i did , but xmas day came and went with no diary .
M	but wait , there '_s more .
F	i ordered some drumsticks as part of my son '_s christmas_gifts .
M	this was an easy process to do and ended_up going to a very nice hotel in london .
M	excellent communications explaining issues clearly .
M	great free service but it would help if the driver took the boxes
M	, and still is being , ( even_though they did not despatch one within their advertised delivery perameters ), so i cancelled due to non delivery in time .
M	i have been a member of my local costco since it opened many_years_ago and i have been a regular customer and a huge_fan .
F	i chased to be told they were looking into it .
M	it '_s still retail - and it '_s still contract law .
F	i ordered 0 separate bouquets for 0 separate people .
M	thanks bbw !
F	cosmetic_damage to the table and cups ( which were not the ones ordered - different handles from those shown ) were lose in box rather_than being wrapped .
F	i should say -- there was one very nice , helpful , and intelligent engineer who came to my flat .
M	i am almost in tears .
M	thanks
F	the delivery service is outstanding , the one and only mistake was speedily rectified .
F	i placed my order on a sunday_evening and although i required express delivery , i certainly didn_'_t expect to see the delivery man on my doorstep at 0h00 the following_morning and with great smile too .
F	i had to contact them again and again .
M	on the occasions i have had to contact them they have always been receptive and resolved my issues .
M	i find it most offensive and unwelcome .
M	many_thanks .
F	i emailed customer service ( cs ) & 0_days_later got a reply to say that even_though it was their mistake i would have to pay to send the dress back , then reorder a replacement (& pay for it ) when they received the returned item they would refund me ( within 00 days of course ).
M	not for me .
F	it '_s a fantastic website with great products , for items like specialised renal_cat_food , it '_s not only the cheapest around , but you know it '_s coming from a trusted_source .
F	amazon will never do this .
F	the licence has not yet ( nearly 0_months later ) arrived at dvla . according to the tracking_information on the royal_mail '_s website , it is still at the post_office branch i handed it into ( not so , incidentally !
M	they finally turned_up the afternoon of the following_day .
F	this is the first time i have used this company and will do so again i would also recommended to anyone
M	the value for money ratio is quite good .
M	the actual sizes are 00mm 00mm 00mm & 00mm .
F	ideal .
F	i would not_hesitate to use this company again .
F	great to see all the other positive_feedback posts but wasn_'_t such a good experience for me .
M	martin
M	when i raised this , i was told that scent cannot be guaranteed ; it depends on the order on the day .
F	find myself using it less
M	maybe a training program or gym routine page with reviews could push the website and consumer community further .
M	i bought a refurbished lenova thinkpad from them .
F	i got more bang for my buck and my products were delivered at the right time and i even knew who by .
F	the lenses arrived within_0days and i am very happy with both the price and quality
F	i did so , opened my parcel and it was broken in two parts .
F	ordered a light online on sunday_evening and paid up front so i could chose a collection day of the following_tuesday .
M	they take your money and don_'_t deliver your goods .
M	so i phoned , to be told that the masks and ear_defenders were out of stock but that one would be sent as soon as stock was received .
M	bars and entertainment were pretty good although i didn_'_t really indulge much .
M	we were in but no one knocked or rang bell .
F	really pleased with the rocking_horse can '_t wait to see my little_ones face on christmas morning thanks to precious_little_ones for such a prompt hassle_free service .
M	the product looks good , but the fitting instruction were diabolical .
F	i was informed that the driver had been taken ill the day before and had missed the trunking deadline so it never got to the local_depot for delivery to me .
F	i know other people have used the site and say it is brilliant but i would not use it again given the experience i have had
M	- next_day delivery was inckluded as standard for me ( possibly due ot order size - £_000 )
M	obvious they just couldn_'_t be_bothered .
M	was booked in for an am appointment , travelled 00 miles to garage in the morning only to b told that the tyres wernt in yet !!!
F	the service was very efficient and speedy all_round .
F	they have great price and they are very fast in sending me my order .
F	i couldn_'_t find a phone number anywhere .
F	great price given too .
M	but i said my purchase for the whole package was done through and monies paid tovery ?
M	on contacting them we paid an extra £_00 to get a table that we were told was in stock and would be dispatched the same day with next_day delivery .
M	flowers arrived at approx_0pm which was acceptable .
M	i messaged serenata about non delivery .
M	dont get you item , dont answer the phone , and dont answer your emails , and you dont get your money back
M	i will not be back and i would not recommend on that basis .
F	not having to see a consultant , a wider_range of products including meals which are all veggie ( as am i ) and being_able to buy it all online .
M	this is unacceptable , especially_considering my complaint .
F	i know my husband will be delighted .
F	great price and would definitely use this company again
F	i contacted tesco via_facebook asked them to chase their suppliers .
F	it is really annoying when this is ignored .
M	when i go on a ferry for two hours journey after driving for long time i just want one thing : to be able to sit_down comfortably .
M	when we both got home , i was disappointed as the original accommodation was nearer to the town_centre and had access to a swimming_pool .
F	my dog_chews alot never found anything that lasts .
F	rachael
M	nothing .
M	great can '_t ask for a better service
F	i recommend worktopexpress highly .
F	i feel that i '_ve contacted the company on several_occasions and i am being totally fobbed_off .
M	the service was excellent and was despatched quickly .
M	( the physio tells_me i should not cycle !!
M	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
M	they send out broken good and unsealed containers ignore phone_calls and emails avoid with a barge_pole .
F	first_rate service .
M	i ' d been sending apologetic e_- mails to my customers all week , keeping them informed of events , and fortunately they were ok about it .
F	lovely to be able to speak with a " person " who was very helpful and i will_definately be visiting again .
M	they have refused to send the 0 perfumes that i ordered , stating that they are awaiting dispatch , ( they '_ve been waiting dispatch since 0th_december ) and will not refund the money after three_times of asking .
M	but it all worked well in the end .
F	it is no_longer social_networking , it '_s just scary .
F	very user_friendly no_hassle website .
F	it is easy to be cheapest , when you hide charges .
M	the sailing experience was spoilt by the attitude of the car deck stewards .
M	yes is worked .
F	when i ordered the item i didnt_realise it was just a chart that i was ordering .
M	the leg grippers work well and are not noticeable .
F	i waited in all day , when nothing had arrived i telephoned them .
F	an appalling service .
M	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
F	but happily placed my order with harts of sturs , and received exactly_what i wanted stunning service with £_00 free gift , free 0 day shipping . and a 00 no_quibble return guarantee .
F	avoid this company like the plague .
M	order shipped
M	well_designed villa and contained all that we had been promised , swimming_pool , table_tennis , pool_table but it just lacked a good clean .
M	really happy with purchases , delivery of 0 - 0 days which i paid a premium for didn_'_t quite happen - i ordered weds_evening and received goods on the following_tuesday .
M	i have checked the yodel online tracking which is a joke .
M	stephen martin
M	having being recommended usb0u by countless other photographers , i was excited to get started on designing my own wooded usb_sticks .
F	i found the website easy to navigate .
F	i called printspace to ask if they could reprint at their expense so i could collect in person and avoid the problem .
M	sink ordered was a very good price but took longer_than_expected to deliver and then when it arrived it had the overflow missing which as on this model of sink is at the rear will necessitate the removal of the fitted sink to install .
M	recess
M	at the time i placed the order it was late at night so wasn_'_t expecting the goods to arrive for at_least 0 days .
F	friends of ours have stayed in your villas and been happy , but obviously for some reason you do not have the same standards in all your villas ?
F	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
F	would say though , the delivery was exactly_what i ordered ( one week started pack ) and it arrived all on time along with my free calender and book .
M	if the engine is damaged , i '_ll be back .
F	appointment made on the phone and long descritption of the glass required .
F	price was £_00 on directferries , £_000 on p_& o .
F	only one wee thing is that it would have been helpful if there were instructions aka ideas of how to use it to its best effect .
M	batteries ok .
M	the package arrived on time .
M	no refund and they said it could take 0 months only if goods were returned and then they would deduct the carriage .
M	great customer service , great selection , fast shipping even from italy to us .
F	at this point i got angry and said if the delivery was not am with me in two_days i did not want it any more i was informed that the 00 days was not up and he counted out the days to me on the phone and told me it was 00 days then admitted he was wrong and it was in fact past the time .
M	in the end it was resolved as all they really wanted was proof of address and this was easily_obtained by other means .
M	however , i had my eyes_tested about 0 months_ago an re - ordered from glasses_direct .
F	i originally went to 0000rpm as my laptop screen just showed white and couldn_'_t do anything .

F	in a consumer world where you can end up banging your head up against a brick_wall just to get an item , never mind dealing_with a complaint , it was refreshing to deal with ffx and i would highly_recommend their service .

F	i called the next_day & the assistant spoke to the opperations manager who said the jacket looked unrepairable & would most_likely be elligible for a full_refund however it would once again need to be sent back to the manufacturer for them to confirm this before they could refund my money .
F	they will take you money , not deliver the goods and then lie about it .
F	i cant_believe the website is still online after so many people reported they never received their orders .
F	without speaking to me he phoned his depot keeping hold of my existing phone so i couldn_'_t even make use of the time he was taking to enquire as to whether he should allow me time to do this .
F	as the servic we received from you from the delivery to nailsworth was excellent .

F	i have ordered from country_attire many_times and can always get my size in all the jackets i like .
F	i searched for our house details today after it had gone very quiet and they had vanished from the sites .
M	not only did it take more than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again .) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer service placements ).

M	thanks to my advisors we were able to negotiate with my creditors a realistic monthly payment plan .

F	the second time was very different - the driver collected me from the airport and first of all could not remember where he left his car ( not ideal after a 00 hour flight ), then had no idea where he was going ( despite having a sat_nav ) and tried to take the wrong road a number of times .
M	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
M	person was very polite and explained company is not about to go under .
F	they are totally unprofessional , incompetent and downright rude .
F	but i did read up on reviews before ordering and will be pleased to use you again many_thanks erika .

F	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my £_00 per week will go elsewhere .
M	spamcop is a great service where they do actually act on unsolicited emails .

F	i dont_think so somehow .
M	danny .
M	drum_stop claims to provide :

M	customer service were very helpful in sourcing and delivering the shelf .
F	i now have 0000 bags that i cannot use , and it will cost me almost the same price to send them back as i would get refunded .
F	goods did arrive but i never did receive that second email as informed .
M	i '_ve parcels containing electric items thrown over my 0 foot garden_fence , parcels wedged into my gas_meter box , parcels left in my recycling_bin which was 0 / 0 full with garden cuttings and rotting vegetables , one time my wife had forgotten to lock her car and the parcel had been left in the drivers footwell ( this is something i '_m completely baffled about , do delivery drivers go around checking whether car doors are open for the houses they are attempting delivery at ??
F	i cannot understand_why the company has never responded to my emails - and when i telephoned i got through to something like a call_centre who could not actually do anything .
F	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .

F	we ordered around £_000 , worth of bits including blow_up saxaphones and guitars what a disappointment - they were rubbish they never blow_up properly and the ones that did went down .
M	my girlfriend finished work at 0 . 00 pm and had been delivered nothing ( not acceptable on valentines_day - if they cannot guarantee morning delivery then they need to either her more drivers or make customers very aware of this on their site before purchase !).
F	it '_s pathetic to see the animals in the shops in very small cages , and them being willing to sell them per one degu .
M	great product coupled_with prompt , friendly and efficient service .
M	none for the delivery driver , hence 0_stars
F	made a complaint to expedia by phone shortly_after arriving at the " hotel ".
F	had a good look on - line for the best quality stamp at a reasonable_price and stamps_direct ticked all the boxes .
F	the choice made it was easy to order .
F	we went to the box office and asked if we could change seats as there were plenty of empty seats elsewhere but they said no , we had to stay where we were .
M	great service and delivery , my order arrived next_day , will use again .

M	the flowers were for a funeral and i did not have time to re - type out myself and would have thought some one would have used their common_sense to correct it .
M	i posted a review here on trust_pilot , and glasses_direct got in touch .
F	also advised that it item was advertised as ' minimal_assembly ' but it is in fact flat_pack !
M	avoid like the plague .
F	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
M	in general not a bad_experience , the problem i had was when the web booking site crashed on me , then had to wait two hours before i could try and book again .
M	so the key points are : screwdriver , insulated , bit type & length .
M	an order number accompanying keys would have solved problem
F	i was then told , quite casually , that the products had been_discontinued and if i wanted to receive part of the order i would have to pay separately !
M	order and receive your purchase via_email in the time it takes to blink .
F	i was amazed with the customer service !
F	sure enough , they arrived well within that time , and i have been wearing them like a new pair of glasses ever_since .
F	i will definitely use this company again .
F	will be using again
M	as they dont_know what they are giving me they at_least have the decency to charge me only for the cheapest of the two alternatives .

F	product not perfect :( some of the bags are coming apart at the seams . haven_'_t checked them all so could just be an unlucky first couple . if major problem , will give them a call and i '_m_sure they '_ll replace :)
M	his inviice numbere is q0000000
M	i believe these should be clear before you get to the payment page .
M	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc_etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
F	the next_day i tried to track my camera ( being delivered by dhl ).
M	high_quality products with more affordable and wider selections than any site i have searched in the past .
M	an excellent , easy to use service and i received my money the very next_day .
F	sue nicholas
F	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !

M	i was kept well informed .
M	the products i bought are really useful . great taste and quality . all delivered really quickly , i ' d highly_recommend
M	i do have two comments and they are related to the bed_frame .
F	i ordered my item on friday and it arrived this afternoon monday - absolutely great service homebase will make_sure i share my experience with anyone who will listen !
M	there had to be a catch .
F	have emailed them about it but have not heard back as yet .
M	the money is now tied up with them and i can '_t afford to order one from somewhere_else until i get the money back into my account .
M	the sharpro grips i ordered are spot on and every bit as comfortable as the golf_pride ones at about 0 / 0 of the price .
F	still no sign of it several weeks_later .
F	i continued to call the store ( as the stores communication was not the greatest .)
M	my prescription was unclear and i asked " does the line above the cyl number mean the number is negative ?"
F	my card was charged at the time of booking but 0 week_later i was told the item was out of stock .
M	and unhelpful !
F	i got it the next_day .
M	would buy fromoakfurnitureland again .
M	!
M	suggest any pet_owners use " vet uk "
F	i would recommend simply_supplements to any one who takes vitamins regularly .

F	i am so pleased with my new trolley .
M	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
M	my order was delivered well within the specified time and in perfect_condition .
F	timewasters .
F	was a bit_worried at first ordering cash over the internet but have to say after a little glitch in the ordering process which ended_up not being anything to do with the currency_club , who responded really fast to put my mind at rest the money came the next_day
F	try them i am sure you will not be disappointed .
F	later in the day i received a phone_call saying that there was no availability on friday but they could fit it in on monday .
M	would use this company again without_hesitation .
F	i quote .
F	the bottles were beautifully_packaged .
F	it is therefore impossible for another service provider to offer a faster service .
M	i have only used the site twice but my current third order i have been waiting almost a week for a ' guaranteed 0 - 0 day delivery ' which i paid for ?
F	i did just that and they still charged me .
F	they looked so awful that i have dug them up and had to replace them with plants from my local_garden_centre .
F	they seem rather disorganised as a company , and customer_care is a bit lacking , but they '_ve rectified any_issues i '_ve had . eventually .
F	in my opinion £_00 plus postage for these items was expensive for what they are .
M	ordered some flowers on a monday to be sent on the thursday , they never showed up despite_being told at 0 : 00 in the evening they had been sent .
F	i was informed that the courier had the item on 00st_october and first the courier claimed they could not access the house ( its on the main_road and has a wide driveway easily_accessed by all other couriers ) which was then changed to the house could not be found - there are only a handful of properties with the same postcode all next to each other , then it was changed that the courier would contact me directly to arrange delivery - that was over a week_ago and surprise , surprise that did not happen .
F	the stars rating i will give a 0 because of the prices you charge for the products and shiping it is way to high .
F	i ordered my cat_food after being told by a friend that it would be a lot_cheaper .

M	but it needs 00mm wide sandpaper .
F	i thought i had been sent the wrong product but later found out it was actually my mistake .
M	i saved around £ 0 on a bosch fuel filter , still came next_day why go to the more_expensive site !

M	took me several tries before i worked out the problem .
F	best price i could find on the internet .
F	the young_man was very helpful , he explained_everything to me if i didnt understand something he said it in more detail , it was as if he was appologizing to me for the incident .

F	the first case i ordered was just too small for my lens , but the customer service and ease of returning and re - ordering removed any disappointment .
F	when i did this i was told that i should speak to my travel_agent :-( not very helpful to be sent round in circles when you are clearly upset about having to rearrange travel .

M	otherwise people will just ask to unsubscribe .
M	i had placed an order online for my partner '_s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
F	love_primark . every time i go in there there are masses of different clothes . such good value . like oxford_street london a visit to london doing whatever can '_t_resist a visit . clothes wear well and wash well such good value . as brighton is my nearest_store enjoy a quick visit whenever .
M	if i could give them - 0_star i would have done that .
M	would recommend paymentsense to anyone as the service i received from the start till end was amazing and very helpful .
F	where is the sense in that ?
F	thank_you ; i will not_hesitate to use your service again and to recommend it to others .
M	sadly then the courier was tnt who only tell you which day the delivery is going to be , and don_'_t give you a window like many couriers do now , so i had to stay in all day .
M	the flowers where damaged and the teddy was stuffed in the bottom of the box and the note was crumpled up .
M	continually suggested that they would be delivered on the 0nd dec .
F	i will definitely order from rubbersole again however maybe not whilst they are using yodel for deliveries - the van_driver left the parcel outside my door ( on a busy street )!!
F	ordered one day and delivered the next . couldn_'_t be quicker_than that , and exactly_what i wanted

M	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
F	the two beds i have ordered are just as good .
M	it seems that they have had " website " problems and the person we spoke to was unable to resolve the pending payment issues and / or reorder for us leaving us to sort_out with our bank ourselves - just spent 00_minutes on the phone to barclays sorting_out - apparently this is a regular_occurrence with homebase !
F	i kept tapping to see if they were made from glass or plastic ( i still don_'_t know but fear they are plastic ) and there was a sort of weird sheen on them that made them look like they need a good clean .
M	i tried to buy some wav '_s from beatport .
M	camera was a " used " one .
M	would it not have made good sense to used a tracked delivery service for an item of its value ?
M	for example , with the occasion suits , you are offered things like shirts on the same page , with no detailed images of the shirts being worn without the suit jacket .
M	received a third call from the debt_collectors this morning 00nd_january_0000 - when we moved out november 0rd 0000 .
F	i always use cheap_smells for fragrance and beauty products .
F	the recorded tour was more informative , but i could not get the volume to adjust so it was extremely loud and i spent more time messing with my headphones than i would like .
M	after a short while i decided to go downstairs to check my mailbox , and surprise_surprise an attempted delivery card !
M	the description on website was very accurate and the fact that there 0 different channel widths to choose from was ideal .
M	the prescription i have has the numbers 000000 , 00000000000 , fp00ss0000 or another number is 0000000000 .
F	the service i received was excellent , i placed the order late in the evening , on the easy to use site , posted the prescription and duly received the medication all within 0_days .
M	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
M	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
M	would definately_use again
F	cant recommend highly_enough , lovely quality and always efficient and my 00 year_old_son_loves their golf_gear !
M	my oldish nokia classic stopped_working ( water_damage i think ).
M	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
M	and dont just leave it and do nothing about it !!!
M	i wanted to buy more than was showing as in stock , one quick call stock_levels checked , and the qty was updated at their online store to reflect qty i required , enabling_me to click and buy .
F	however the products themselves were cheap looking especially the headdress for the older childs costume .
F	great price even with delivery , great communication .
M	many_thanks for the first_class service with my order for my future requirments i will order from you .
F	there was no way we were all going to fit in there !
M	!
M	the software was a bit of a learning_curve .
F	this time in tenerife transfer to resort was very speedy but return to airport again was more than 0 and went a strange way that took longer .
M	a good service , in the end .
F	and my goods haven_'_t arrived in 0 month .
M	however i did find item missing when i opened the box , but was replacedby another item i had not orderd or did not want . plus it was way cheaper !
M	0 pair way too big and very annoyed to discover that the cost of return for refund is down to the customer .
F	however , they did deliver within the allotted_time and the furniture was fine .
M	it was one of our best trips ever .
F	i probably would have bought a baby grow too had all the sweetest ones not been gender specific .
M	i dont_know why but that has_been my experience .
M	!
M	good selection of items
M	buyers_beware .
F	they text me when it left the shop , then when it was delivered great .
M	highly_recommended !
F	i will mmore than likely make a purchase in the future and will have no_reservations on recommending precious_little one to anyone , fabulous service a **** company .

F	i ordered a wedding planner one for myself and one for a friend . these were a offer , and on for free and cost 00p p_&_p .
F	the original offer had been £_000 for an iphone 0 .
F	glasses received quickly and as_described .
M	what terrible service this represents - customers booking online for later collection must have an assurance that the goods actually exist .
F	the person on the other end of the telephone knew what i was talking_about immediately , and processed my order efficiently .
F	brilliant !
F	hi
F	once the member of staff finished his job he told me he has not fitted my spare_wheel back under my car because it was too " stiff ".
M	well recommended !
F	on 0 / 00 / 00 we were then informed that the goods were out of stock until 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	the service was faster_than a homing pigeon . i was pleasantly_surprised . i will recommend you to others .
F	the bundle of lights arrived after about a week , not the fastest post .
F	:-)
M	the items were delivered quicker_than_expected and the delivery service itself was commendable but i felt that the whole_experience was marred_by the issue in the store .
F	having paid an extra 00 . 00 to have a saturday_morning delivery and waiting in all morning the delivery company failed to press the right bell and therefore didn_'_t deliver the product .
F	fantastic service !
F	also , if 0 reads this , please don_'_t contact me with offers of better deals or apologies .
F	i had a groupon deal for a two week pack so ordered the only pack i could see on exante website to find out i was also charged_£_00 by exante aswell as the groupon deal .
M	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
F	mmmm not sure_whether i '_m putting it on wrong but it doesn_'_t stay where i want it , so not so sure that was a good buy , but it all arrived with a speedy delivery in a non descript brown box so there was no need to blush as the postman handed it over !
M	good cash_back site but very slow on responding to questions raised .
M	to be honest i expected at some point to see a £_00 /£ 00 charge for fuel on my bank_statement .
F	goods arrived over 0_weeks after ordered so although good quality they were in fact much later than_expected .
M	kept telling_me to choose something else but i wanted this particular one .
M	ordering is simple and you are kept up to date with it '_s process .
M	the delivery , installation & setup all went very smoothly and the whole_process was quick and easy .
M	they even apologised for lying .
F	i purchased a deal with living_social , two photo canvas_prints ), one of which was a gift for my parents .
F	the customer service was appalling !!!

F	the material was quite heavy and cutting a straight line wasn_'_t easy .
F	!
F	i am very very unhappy .
F	i '_ve just ordered two_pairs of glasses plus lenses from glasses_direct and can hardly_believe the service and cost .
M	no reply to the question regarding this .
F	appalling !
F	the bunch was smaller_than pictured but were pretty none the less .
M	the company did contact me promptly and sorted_out the refund to my credit_card .
F	dear_sir / madam ,
M	i sent 0 bouquets of flowers to my aunt , unfortunate incident of 00_hours stuck in a bath , and my mum going to help look after her who ended_up tripping over and needing stitches to her cheek .
F	my land line has_been off for 0 week now and still no sign of it being fixed despite a promise that it would be done yesterday at the latest .
F	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
F	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should '_ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
M	i have bought , p / x and now sold to mpb , i have always been satisfied with prices and service , good communication and fast payments makes this company highly_recommend to anyone looking for camera gear .
F	car parked for you , bus to airport waiting and within 0 minutes at the arrivals_hall .
M	zeppelin really excellent lives upto the hype excellent service and prompt accurate delivery . first_rate however spoilt by the fact that the the web_site boasts a free_gift for every order over £_000 which i was never offered and when enquired online was ignored which has marred me ordering again dont offer when you have no_intention of supplying !!!!!!!!!
M	0 hour delay on our thomson flight to tenerife sud - apparently because of a spanish baggage handlers strike there .
F	the staff at e flowers were amazing when i called to complain and instantly refunded my money , however it was a shame that my moms flowers were definitely not in their first bloom !!
M	thanks .
F	i '_d definitely use them again with confidence .
M	i offered to pay via card and extra for postage . they are so light and would go in a jiffy_bag .
F	if i don_'_t receive any contact from them by the end of this week , i will be contacting cab and escalating this further until the matter is resolved .
F	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
M	as above .
F	i was not informed of all the fuss that would be made about sending used personal effects home .
M	i received an email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they '_ve dispatched my goods , but it didn_'_t mention which courier .
M	0_stars are given on price and delivery time only at the moment .
F	i had to make other arrangments because they could not get their act_together with 00_hours notice .
M	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
M	ebay is a market for lemons .
F	the clothing range is limited .
F	i checked their t & c and found nothing to that effect .
F	i received notification the next_day that my massage_table had been dispatched , it arrived in good order the following_day .
F	the customer service you try to phone and report that you would like a visit , because there is a problem on my new siute i '_m still_waiting a reply as to when they are coming
F	i only purchased because of your ticket guarantee but do you actually honour this ?
F	consistently not turning_up for appointments .
F	i have no idea how long my delivery took to arrive as several days afterwards i discovered it ( completely by_accident ) outside the house on the doorstep of a door that we never use !
M	- outrageous !)
M	the others have so_far not appeared .
M	when amazingly someone answered !
M	they sent a two speed clipper instead of a variable one !
M	love the site , tracking is good , customer service is helpful
M	the very reason i went on - line .
F	the salesman dismissed us immediately when he realised we could not buy the couch we wanted due to it not being the correct_size , there was no offer to look at alternatives with us .
M	slightly frustrating as had to go through booking_procedure twice as first time round the site inexplicably kept saying my card_details not entered correctly , although they were as input them several_times the same and finally had to totally reload site and start again which then accepted them !
F	money went into my bank the same day !
F	one time i just had a query and the guy was really helpful .
F	i would definitely use iflorist again .
M	the shoes ordered were in stock , ordered on the 0th and despatched on the 00th !!!!
F	arrival at dalaman was ok , there were only 0 of us travelling seeing as it was out if season in april .
M	i would suggest anyone purchasing anything from primark keeps their receipt very safe , although i personally won_'_t be shopping there again .
M	thanks very much .
F	very disappointing
F	i tried online but dissapointed as it took much longer then expected . will go back to the shop , better service and i get bonus points . i did spent £_00 igave 0 points but on reflection i dont_think it '_s deserved .
F	good communication both on email and on telephone .
M	.
M	it doesn_'_t take that long to banka cheque !
M	received my order without one of my items .
M	on a busy bank_holiday_weekend i was lucky they still had a room available .
F	came_across webuybooks online and they were offering the best price for the books i wanted to sell so i decided to give them a go .
M	amount of flowers was not £_00 + other half was happy but she didn_'_t know how i paid .
M	perhaps this company doesnt rely_on repeat_business
M	i was sending a birthday_present to a friend .
M	didn_'_t appreciate who the customer is and i couldn_'_t get a word in .
F	also they kept me updated the whole way through my order .
M	graeme
F	i like natures_best products very much as they are good strength and made in england i would recommend the products to my friends
F	i ordered a soup_maker but after a week i had not heard_anything .
M	i was told by the girl on the phone that the post_office would not accept a package over a certain weight which i thought strange as i get items shipped from the u . s all the time by post .
F	now the parcel which apparently has_been delayed in chinese customs now since august time .
M	there best feature is the bar_code scanner but that is one of those apps that can be picked_up free almost anywhere .
F	i am now 00 weeks_pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0_weeks because of this company !
F	have tried to contact company on their site but keep being instructed to go to a complicated link of numbers and letters which doesn_'_t get me anywhere .
M	" go to the blue terminal_building , they '_ll sort you out ".

M	i purchased a panasonic gx0 with g 00mm_f0 . 0 ii kit along with a lumix g vario 00 - 000mm_f0 . 0 - 0 . 0 .
F	having received a message at 00 . 00am to say that the replacement flowers were on the delivery vehicle and a further confirmation as follows_:
M	after some digging on the site i found a small piece of text that said delivery services might be delayed_due to a warehouse relocation .
F	excellent service thank_you !
F	in essence , we '_d chosen the item because the ' freebie ' it came with made it good value compared to other_sellers .
M	the goods are of quality and so is the whole ordering and delivery of your items .
M	i have never in my life dealt_with a company so disinterested in dealing_with a problem .
F	it '_s good that you have other delivery options for your customers , but when the chosen delivery company lets us down , then the reviews you receive from us will let you down .
F	but at another , so i drove there . guess_what - yes it was at the original depo . i have to drive all the way back again . even the staff at yodel said their service was awful !
F	( horsemeat saga proof of that )
F	thank_you for choosing expedia . co . uk
F	i needed the money so accepted begrudgingly and it '_s taken forever to actually receive the money .
F	i was pleased with the items which were nice quality , arrived quickly and at a good price but one of the aprons had a hole about 0 centimetre long in it which looked like it had been made with a sharp implement .
M	i would quite happily_recommend them on my present experiences .
F	was advised by my neighbour ( whom i purchased the flowers for ) that after 0_days they had wilted and were dying .
F	my only_moan is the cost of the products , i was shocked if i '_m honest that they were so expensive .
F	we complained to maid0clean and they booked in another cleaner for the following_morning .
F	!
F	had i paid full price for the cabinet i would have been sending it back as it is i cant be bothered with the hassle as it isn_'_t that noticeable .
F	the sofa was delivered 0_months later after we paid in full , and we rang the very next_day to say the recliner_chair on the left wobbles and sinks and is uncomfortable , they took 0 and a half weeks to send one upholsterer out then another 0_weeks for the next upholsterer who both say it was normal for this chair to be wobbly and sinking as it '_s due to the pins ??
M	thanks !
F	i was horrified to discover at approximately 0 . 00_pm on saturday_night that at 0 . 00_pm i was sent an_email to say they couldn_'_t deliver the mother '_s day basket until tuesday .
F	i interpret sainsburys slogan " live well for less " to mean " live with less money as that '_s how our business practices leave you ".
F	i can '_t eat red meat or dairy and found it very diffcult to pick the meals that i could have , this of course isnt diet chefs fault .
M	good feedback from company to let you know at what stage your order is being_processed .
F	only_downside at all was that the engine signel kept coming on and when werang them all that was suggested was " if the water temp is ok and there nis no smoke from the engine , diregard it and drive on " this is ok but still does not feel comfortable .
F	they sent me black pumps instead .
F	this isn_'_t acceptable you '_d think in this modern age that if someone has the handwriting of a 0 year_old that they would have the card printed instead .
F	i found this very difficult to give to one of my cats .
M	first time completed your questionaaire - was returned not enough information askd to complete it again .
F	products were as ordered and a great price , but delivery incompetence overshadows this .
M	example 0 . i nowdont get my cards anywhere_else !!!!
F	i have used beauty_bay for quite a few orders and have always had quick correct orders , until this last one !
M	i do not recommend them .
M	yes , i think i will ."
M	delivered great quality
F	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
M	i couldn_'_t believe it , as this is the second time this had happened !!
M	but very fraindly staff .
F	superb service , order to delivery five days and an added_bonus is no p_&_p over forty_pounds .
F	this is because the couriers used don_'_t deliver on a saturday .
M	what a shambles of a company
F	once again this had been highlighted in the guest_book , yet the owners had chosen to ignore the comments and not fix the problem .
F	see that it had automatically ticked the next size up tab so by the time i had got to the payment it was nearly_£_00 i only wanted to spend £_00 in the end it nearly_£_00 but it was very easy to use lets_hope they deliver on time and of good quality .
F	ordered a top , had to email twice to chase_up delivery as paid for next_day !!!
F	we eventually found one on the raised section and then waited for 00_mins for a coach .
M	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can '_t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
M	would be happy to purchase from them again .
M	so this means that we basically signed a blank cheque & after signing_up to the deal , petchy leisure had the rite to then make up any rules they wanted & if we couldn_'_t comply with then we lose all of our money ???
F	very reasonable_prices and it was buy one get one free .
F	still_waiting for customer service to contact me after 0 emails !!
F	thankfully i kept my eyes peeled and as soon as the pair i wanted was restocked , i grabbed them before anyone_else could .
M	i emailed customer_services with all the details and received an_automated_response saying that most enquiries were dealt_with a day later , however more complicated issues might take two working_days for a response .
F	you just won_'_t get the same quality products for prices like these , the choice of products and service is excellent .
M	she just said the delivery office are asking for this info .
F	luckily my parcel had already arrived the following_morning .
F	this was not highlighted on the through and vigorous multi point check .
F	ordered a pair of platform_shoes , the money was taken and order confirmation received .
M	they said it was my fault even_though i asked them if they ' d ever_seen an email notification for selecting a nominated post_office and they said no !
F	just_kampers kept me updated on the progress of my delivery via_email and the product arrived on time and in perfect_condition .
M	good service , order received within two_days using 0nd_class mail !
M	i hope spectrum is also strong in recycling and caring for the environment , i '_ve a feeling it is !
F	great website , easy to order but unfortnately didn_'_t deliver on the requested day which was very disappointing .
F	my response from floraqueen when i raised my complaint was to only offer a 00_%_discount on my next purchase which is fine if my experience was good but after this experience i will certainly never use this company again and i hope other would be customers will think_twice before using them too .
F	the quality of the make up is ok but for the amount you get i really don_'_t think that it '_s worth the money .
F	we had a real problem on the way back though with finding our ferry boarding point in the huge calais terminal .
F	( parcel_force tracking service wasn_'_t working ).
F	flowers took 0_months to arrive and they were for a special_occasion !
F	i will be doing our ensuite out within a couple of months and will be purchasing from better_bathrooms again .
M	it was hot that day and the wait was very difficult .
F	beautiful flowers , delivered less_than 00_hours after ordering , would highly_recommend .
F	she will be made up .
F	i usually use inter_flora but tried this as there was a promotion but what arrived was very cheap looking and i don_'_t_believe it had a value of £_00 . 00 as i was lead to believe .
M	a company who have a personal_touch and make a customer feel like a customer and the unusual decency to apologise in the event of a hickup .
F	i will be very annoyed if my email is ignored .
F	right result !
F	sort_out the booking recognition errors and it would be a great service .
M	excellent quality .
F	i '_ve already made some truffles with the chocolate which is beautiful .
F	i feel let_down and scammed by the company , and feel that it is their fault as the website is not clear .
M	steve and the sales_team are highly knowledgeable and a great company to work with fulfilling our i . t .
M	sick of fu completely now .
M	it is my belief that reputable and responsible organisations should not encourage their customers to divulge their passwords .
F	the good thing was they were always quick to respond and the glasses that finally arrived are as pictured and i love them !
F	no communication .
F	i had emailed and phoned a couple times .
M	i am aware that this is not your fault and this is the only product on the market that will do the job .
F	hadf tyres_fitted last_week and couldn ’_t be_happier , offered the fitter a warm lunch but he politely declined and got on with the work .
M	not what was wanted when laden with suitcase and golf_clubs .
M	i really feel averaging insignificant and significant criteria makes the whole review system frivolous .
M	the quality and design are excellent and the modern look is a great contrast to
M	i had sent the wrong prescription but glasses_direct very kindly re - made to the new specification without charge .
F	so ordered on line with [_external_reference_] and the same flowers were at my friends house in less_than 0 hours .
M	my advice is to by better grade or larger_quantities where you can accept damage due to poor delivery packaging .
F	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
F	no helpful support when reported just brisk dismissal .
M	fair_enough you may think , as it gives the supplier a chance to put his case which they did .
F	the room was fine , the service was fine .
F	the cheque came on time and i was an extremely happy customer !
F	on 00th_april i received an_email_stating that my order status was ' awaiting fulfilment ' ( this basically means payment has_been accepted ), but no delivery .
M	i have been promised calls from someone looking into the case but have heard_nothing .
M	on 00_% of the pages the background image has not been faded to the 00_% that the preview confirmed i had done .
M	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed . not great .
M	they trade under cresentdirect on amazon - you have been_warned
F	i wouldn_'_t normally mind , but the fact i '_d phoned to ask and was told they were fine clearly shows lack of knowledge .
M	had to buy other food in mean time thus changing dogs ' diet and so the two pups got a dicky tummy .
M	mostly large with heavy contents and very strongly packaged . at our age trying to unpack was a nightmare and eventually disposing of the packaging was another

F	that '_s what i call trustworthy .
M	i placed my order on june 00 full of anticipation of receiving my print promptly !
M	good price and speed , but when i checked out via_paypal my delivery address was correct .
F	they have loads of styles and sizes , more than the high_street and have speedy free delivery and returns .
F	and to follow we had to stand in the isles as the train was so full whilst first_class was empty and the conductor tried charging us for standing in the hallway between two carriages .
M	bad company
M	a lot cheaper_than the high_street and i will be buying trainers from your website more often .
F	mycket_bra service och_jag kan rekommendera att_beställa från dem .
M	i reserved 0 child_seats but was only given one .
F	ordered two_pairs of glasses for just under_£_00 . 00 , received both in just over a week , excellent value for money , i have also recommended glasses_direct to friends and family , will definitely be using again .
F	the platters in the picture were round and oval ones arrived !
M	i have heard bad things about fitness first , but i decided to have a look for myself .
F	used to be good , what '_s happened to this company ?
F	i enjoy the rounded edges for myself although a client has already complained of feeling that their shoulders arent supported ?
F	they randomly don_'_t send reminders and having your domain on auto - renew is pointless because their systems don_'_t work properly .
M	!
F	didn_'_t even pay a premium as i '_d have expected for the convenience .
F	to prove this i had to send them a bank_statement .
M	so .
M	it arrived promptly with no_fuss .
F	they would call me back with an update
M	hopeless .
M	shoes were exactly as_described and came earlier_than stated so was pleasantly_suprised .
M	they rang me to arrange delivery .
F	could print_off own_labels to make it quicker
M	value for money .
M	which was originally supposed to arrive on 00th or 00th of march aftera phone conversation with them .
F	people see the total_rip_off prices for a glass of wine , for example , and decide to have a soft drink , not realising that they pay almost the same amount of money .
M	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn_'_t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
F	i was disappointed and embarrassed .
F	when she returned , i have once again been told that there is still no delivery information .
F	i have had everyone that received them call to say thank_you and have said how good they are along with many asking where to get them from .
M	the strimmer arrived within a few_days and all seemed good , however it was missing the safety mask with ear_defenders ( worth £_00 )
F	!
M	good swift service all mechanic '_s used matts and seat_covers when moving my car .
M	same as just about everybody_else .
F	they kept me updated with emails and my glasses arrived on my doorstep in 0 working_days !
M	after the first delivery attempt , things get much worse .
M	the following_day .
M	poor effort and very badly run e_- commerce shop .
F	huge_disappointment and will be avoiding wowcher now as no contact from them when something does go_wrong !
M	i bought a giant_defy 0 at a great price , it arrived in no time at all and was really easy to set_up .
M	i '_ve ordered stuff several_times from wetsuitoutlet and it always arrives quickly .
M	i will now have to contact the branch direct tomorrow to see if this is the case !
F	very good prices
M	this is not how a respectful companies do_business .
M	however a small item ( dog training treats ) on my last order proved to have been charged with a fifty percent hick (£ 0 . 00 instead of package printed £ 0 price ) on the printed price on the package .
F	i order a box of 0 x chicken chips pet treats a number of weeks_ago and was puzzled when a few_days_later i received a single pack in a jiffy_bag .
F	i am a very sad vacuum fan who loves vacuuming and the gtech is just brilliant .
F	they came in good packaging and it was exactly_what i had ordered .
F	far from it .
F	i arranged an_appointment for 0_weeks_later to have a full head of micro loop extensions fitted .
M	so i called the person_who was due for the flowers to be delivered and she said she hadn_'_t received them which spoilt the surprise .
M	having stayed in all day they did not arrive_till thursday_morning only to find that the packaging had been damaged .
F	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
M	!
F	i '_ve given then one star as it seems you cannot_rate them with zero_stars !
F	i consequently wrote a letter of complaint , sent to the address on their website .
M	could do better
M	second time i '_ve purchased from cjs and will do so in the future again .
F	i want to return one pair and am having a bit of trouble getting a returns_label as it was not in the parcel and they need to be sent back to denmark so i do not want them to get lost .
M	i have now emailed hostelworld about this issue on three_separate_occasions without_any response , acknowledgement or resolution to my issue .
F	the driver refused , i had a sick child in the car and even when i told him this he said " i had to be patient and wait !, i threatened to report him if he did not move and he said " report me then ", so i did .
F	however . looks like it was too good to be true :-(
F	company also known as firesgalore .
M	searching for a specific pair of ray_ban frames and lenses .
M	i would suggest more help is given when the students request for it because they genuinely need it .
F	i had to ask for it .
F	won_'_t buy from them again .
F	would recommend to any friends or family and will most definately use again to add to my dinner service .
M	shipping_costs are terrible .
M	this arrived in just 0 days and it was clear these were quality frames .
M	there is limited undertaking from pt
M	ordering online was much_easier , especially with available sizes .
M	the initial purchase was faulty ( due to the courier mishandling ) but millennium music were very helpful in resolving the issue .
F	fantastic rate and service definatley use them again and would reccomend to friends .
F	would recommend to anyone
M	if this had been explained to me at the time of purchase i would have organised to get some assistance with this weighty furniture .
F	when they arrived the card that i had paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for was wet for where the water that the flowers were packed in had obviously spilt over and also three of the stems of the flowers were dangling off .
F	tt is losing a lot of cash offering cheaper deals rather_than fix !!!
M	chose halfords auto centre slough for the fitting , not the farnham road one as i had experienced bad service there in the past .
M	plus the website will help you with your goals .
M	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
M	only a few day in but very happy .
M	fortunately i was sat at a desk all day so she could take as long as she liked as far as i was concerned .
M	i like ebay overall and have got some good value stuff , but i don_'_t enjoy the agro you can get from other users .
M	ordered strings on tuesday , they arrived on wednesday !
M	unfortunately the descriptions are getting worse , loads of pretty words but trying to find the key information is useless .
M	i ordered good from them never received it . they are con_artists beware !!
F	!
M	sent on a wednesday with a promise of a return by the weekend .
F	mara was exceedingly helpful when discussing what i wanted , as i was looking for small cake_toppers which weren_'_t quite like anything in their published range .
M	the vehicle itself is exceptional , the build quality is superb , so why do vw spoil the overall effect by penny pinching ( thats all i can assume it is ) on the interior finish .
F	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont_be using again .
M	the companies who send parcels by this company should be_ashamed of themselves . yodel is not fit for the purpose . 0 cards were left and each time we went to their depot but was told we needed a tracking_number , but we didn_'_t have one so we couldn_'_t give one . on the 0th visit we were told it had been returned to sender . the manager refused to talk to us . the sender has not received it back even after 0_weeks and yodel does not know where the parcel is . reading other reviews i can believe they still exist . i would be_ashamed the even admit i worked for this company , thats if i did work for them but i dont .
M	the next_day my wife misses the courier ( we do have better things to do dabs that wait in all day for you to collect your untested junk ).
F	very pleased .
M	to date the website has not been changed so i am awaiting a call back from trading_standards on that matter , purely due to the way i have been treated by this farce of a company .
F	they were finally delivered after 0_days .
M	easy way to get_rid of old or none working phones
M	ordering was easy , they kept me informed on delivery and it was delivered when they said they would .
F	daughter had problems with boohoo . com do not touch at all spread the word to avoid theft by them !
F	superb service .
F	ordering easy , prices good and delivery on time .
F	but , although the courier service kept us waiting for longer_than we had hoped , the contact with justtvstands made us feel very comfortable that it would arrive .
F	big_dug gave_us a small credit towards this inconvenience .
M	i heard they keep gps logs so i wonder what story the evidence tells ?
F	i always use serenata now when sending flowers .
M	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
M	tnt messed_up an excellent service .
M	a richer_sounds engineer looked at photos of the crack rang me and said i must have hit it with something .
F	i like this cleaner because it is lightweight , easy to use , easy to empty and is amazingly capable of really deep cleaning .
M	though this may have been a one - off !
F	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
M	very efficient , just the bouquet was a lot smaller than what i expected .
F	( max £ 0 postage ).
F	insisted that wasn_'_t good enough but of course no way forward so now waiting for a call .
M	i '_m honestly not sure .
F	i did bougt and pay for item 00 £ by paypal . i thought it done and after transfection thei did ask 0pounds extra for shipping in 00hrs , and any other options could not find . i would not buy if i would now it is a 0pounds extrabecause in other_sites was much_cheaper with postage . but i coud not do anithing because of 00pounds was allredy deducted .
M	the only thing offered was a refund and they were not willing to re - ship .
F	i told him i knew he was lying and he didn_'_t even apologise , just made up some excuse .
F	i did this then again received another email_saying that no i cannot order anything as florist do not cover my area !
F	when i called eflorist to track delivery , i was told they were with the courier for the next_day .
M	i attempted to phone several_times but long_waits and still no pick_up , so i sent an email minutes later .
F	booking was easy and price competative , departure collection was efficent , however it took 00_mins from the call for our car to be returned to us , we had been delayed 0 hours so this could have been the reason but hey the guy said 00_mins when i rang from baggage collection . 00_mins after a night spent in an airport lounge was no fun .
F	then i was told i '_d receive a call back . 00_hours_later i '_m chasing them up again as you guessed it . no call back received . this is now going on for 0_weeks
M	!
M	picked out a suitable scraper , and because the site takes paypal , i didnt even have to sign up .
M	jason payton - smith
M	i was careful to order the right prescription and sure_enough the glasses were fine and corrected my vision properly .
M	i wanted to buy a guitar .
M	the company are now spaming me with emails about their special_offers .
M	ordered my tuxcedo , came next_day good service
F	as the total_cost of the 0 flights was about £ 0 , 000 , we felt that it could have been a lot better .
M	if it wasn_'_t for these two problems it would have been a 0_star_rating / review this is not what i expect from a 0_star hotel .
F	i still_haven_'_t received a reply , so i placed my order with tesco it was quicker and cheaper .
M	i even changed the order to ensure that my new kit ( mixing desks , mics , amps , the whole nine yards ) would be able to cope with future_projects and allow me to cover all bases .
F	the service was good and i got the dress in time but after paying for the dress and postage i also received a customs bill for 00 pounds which i didn_'_t expect
F	we got the delivery 0 or 0_days late ( everything sat in cambridge parcel depot over a weekend ).
F	i am thrilled with my new_washing_machine .
F	the delivery man tossed the box in the air !!!
M	slightly expensive for my liking , finding some bargains elsewhere .
M	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
M	i have just spent £_000 with tyre_shopper on four premium avon_tyres
M	expedia never informed me it was cancelled and i had booking confirmation e_mail .
M	it '_s a shame as they are usually great
F	bought a samarkand gazebo £_000 . 00 , painting not so great , one of the flowers broken off , one of the flowers bent out of shape , the very top of the dome was also bent .
F	this is an awfully long time to spend on the ship .
F	i would have said they were worth half the price .
F	this is the third order i have made the internet sight is excellent , easy to use and order from .
M	ordering was easy and there was an impressive level of attention to delivery details and even a helpful relevant video on the website .
M	would buy again for sure :)
M	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
F	perhaps i should have given the company the chance to refund me but i feel that if they are going to sell cheap and nasty that people should be warned .
M	delayed the order for several weeks due to one item being out of stock .
M	i ordered inks and a usb hard_drive .
F	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only_assume that this mishap has_been a one - off .
M	sorry ba despite your recent pr exercise on sky in truth it '_s still not what you expect from britain '_s premier airline .
F	we were reluctant to open the wardrobe in case the guest was hiding inside !
M	kitchen needs_updating ( 0 ring hob not big enough ) shame about the ants .
M	i '_m struggling to form a consistent opinion about made .
M	!
F	the prices they pay are not mega but if you want to get_rid of stuff and actually earn some money for it then it `_s ok .
M	will use them again without_doubt
M	my expectations were exceeded and i will be placing many more orders in the future .
M	i can wait weeks at my well_known high_street_opticians .
F	it arrived about 0 . 00 .
F	apparently i had been emailed . i '_m still_waiting !!
F	wide_selection of colours and patterns .
M	communication and it wwould never been lost .
M	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .
M	oh an the actual sunglasses were a bargain too !
F	we have just had a large_amount of fencing installed and wanted a fence treatment that we had used before .
M	overall i wouldn_'_t hesitate to order from express_watches again which i guess is as good a recommendation as you can get .
M	great service said what it said on the tin and delivered when will use it again thank_you
M	so i rang customer_services and queried this and was told that they can '_t contact the driver but he is aware that i need the parcel today ( 00th ).
M	i did tell her in the end as it was obvious the conversation would not progress any further if i did not .
F	great service would definately use again
M	anyway eye - sale did exchange them which i appreciate they are legally not obliged to do .
M	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
M	it seems their parent_company telephonica was a fortune in debt .
F	still not received my order after over a week .
F	- £_00 delivery felt like a lot . but the product was reasonable so we swallowed it and went_ahead .
F	i really do hope zen_bedrooms reads these comments ; judging_by the comments i '_ve found online from other people , a recurring issue is your delivery process .
M	not great value for money .
F	gut gut gut gut
F	my sick_friend could not even see the package and would not have known about it , if a visitor had not brought it up to the house .
M	who_knows if i will ever receive anything !
M	ordered a pair of rayban_sunglasses from fashion_eyewear after being messed about by another online site .
F	the restaurants were plentiful and a wide_variety to suit all tastes and purses .
M	definitely use them again .
F	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
F	the best thing in this story ( which was not as good for me ) is that although the packeges arrived at the same time i was charged three_times for p and p .
F	my husband has thought that we might not bother again , as the plants we bought in the local_diy_store have been really good .
M	i was told that if the engineer has_been to assess our dishwasher and it is decided that they will not honour our claim then we wouldn_'_t get our excess back as costs had been started .
F	the delivery arrangements were brilliant my furniture was delivered on time and the delivery guys were great .
M	don_'_t get me wrong , the guy was not unpleasant , just inept .
M	more like 0 . 0cm or less .
F	return_journey .
M	weybridge_audio were definitely good value and shipping was fast informing_me when they were dispatched .
F	it was very easy to order , and my order arrived very quickly .
F	i am considering just sending the glasses back out of principle , although i '_m reluctant as i wonder_if the " 00 month return_policy " has similar unwritten restrictions on it !
M	an email to customer_care yesterday lunchtime has_gone_unanswered .
F	if not its fraud if i do not get my money back !
M	i did , i wish my wife had .
F	the delivery arrived as per schedule and it was easy to track .
F	the only_downside was the price of the ubiquitous photographs that are taken at the start of the visit and very hard to avoid ( without being rude ).
M	the cuts of meat are fantastic and of good quality .
M	in this day and age of slapdash printing firms thesignbuilder are a breath of fresh_air .
M	buyer_beware .
M	this companies determination to build a monster store in place of the present perfectly_adequate supermarket has created huge local resentment - they should listen to their customers many of whom have ,
M	unlike_other advertisers who gave delivery date of maybe in 00 days time !!
M	excellent service apart_from the fact that i ordered a right handed guitar and they sent me a left_handed one .
M	i was surprised at how quickly my item was delivered .
F	i needed two hinges for my chest_freezer .
F	i emailed photos and my disappointment to customer service and received a reply_stating they would reply within 00_hours , but three_days_later i had to chase as no response .
M	i received a response saying i had to go to the store , but that the store manager would be made aware of the issue .
M	i ordered a towel_radiator and straight ( inline ) thermostatic valve set .
F	unfortunately , i disposed of the packaging etc .
F	i have spoken to over 00 people over these days with each one promising me that the driver was on his way .
F	needed a new spring padding for my grandchildrens trampoline .
F	there were no freesias or carnations and not one pink flower - it was quite a pretty blue and white display but generally i was disappointed .
F	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
M	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it '_s mostly no wins and i '_ve not had free_spins for a while now .
F	they arrived to my friend at 0 . 00_pm , which is apparently within the t & c of serenata .
F	they need to change their website to be more honest about their delivery times , and make themselves more easily_contactable so that they can answer queries ( preferably by telephone ).
F	the automated email i received in response stated they hope to respond to 00_% of their mail within_00hrs .
M	i received a txt_message on the day i ordered the items telling_me they had been dispatched and would arrive the following_day then gave_me the options of different delivery dates or ' leave with a neighbour '.
F	would and do highly_recommend .
F	only good thing is when the sunglasses eventually turned_up , i loved them .
F	would have thought bus would have spare mike .
F	just pay the extra £ 0 -£_00 and get your goods elsewhere !
F	time_consuming and fail to deliver on promised .
M	the cheque finally arrived a week_later , the date on the envelope from fonebank . com '_s franking machine indicated it was not posted on the same day , but rather some 0 day after they told me !
F	will never use this company again , nor will my niece or her friends after this .
M	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
M	very good company , would recommend to any one , and will use again .
F	unfortunately on our return_journey to collect the car ffs car_park had us coming_back at the wrong time .
F	products are good but customer service is terrible .
M	when speaking to their customer service manager , he seemed unable to offer any kind of service , instead just fobbing_me off quoting policy .
M	poor product advertised very misleadingly .
M	many_thanks for the help and advice as to what i needed .
M	goods ordered on sunday , arrived on tuesday .
F	i had to ring them to confirm my booking at which point i was told it was not going to be possible , at what point were they going to let_me know ?!!!!
M	after looking at the costly process of buying a replacement screen with a matt screen presentation_media suggested that we could retrofit an anti - glare layer to the screen .
M	i '_ve had problems
F	you need to get your act_together .
F	it was exactly as_described and fitted_perfectly .
F	fortunately this blind is in the spare_bedroom but i '_m disappointed that there the last slat doesn_'_t sit as well as it should when the blind is closed .
F	i sent through my design and asked for approval before printing .
M	all the extras are written down if you scroll_down below the headline price .
M	if you are looking for electronic bits for you computer or phone , always try mymemory ,
F	funny that !!
F	the whole_process was seamless from ordering to delivery - the delivery team had to remove the doors of the appliance to get it into the house - this was carried_out without_any_problems .
F	will never be using this site again !
M	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
M	amazingly , on requesting a refund last night , my wife gets a call today from amazon , confirming they have located our missing box ( after saying there was only one box ) and would arrange a second delivery ( another day of work for my wife ).
F	nice looking offers but when i received my " bead mix " a lot of the weight was in very large chunky beads in odd colours i . e .
F	always delivers
M	rentalcars is by far too expensive .
F	00 : 00 .
F	car was very nice and what was expected .
M	surely as a repeat_customer i should be offered the best price , my having to start as anew customer again seems to me to be a waste of time , multitrip are not being honest with repeat_customers as new customers get better deals .
F	i ordered a flame failure device for my cannon gas_cooker main oven .
F	obviously i didn_'_t even want the washing line after that !
F	confirmation and delivery spot_on - we were somewhat disappointed with the quantity of flowers presented in the spray of flowers .
F	as i have said above this is the 0rd time i have used glasses_direct after a friend '_s recommendation .
M	now why couldn_'_t they have put a note in with the order to explain that , or why could they have not replied to the email to that effect .
M	the first i heard the delivery was incomplete was when it was delivered .
M	i was informed at each point among the process of when payment was required , when they were in the process of being made and when i would expect them .
F	when i opened it , good grief !, " corset " was in poor state !
M	quality appears to be ok but time will tell .
M	i '_m paying £_000 per_month and it would have been £_00 !!
F	!
F	the contact phone numbers don_'_t work and when i have been able to get someone they tell me someone will call me back and noone ever has .
F	tomorrow i '_m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
M	as luck would have it my previous printer was from the same manufacturer so the problem for me was solved .
F	i am so disappointed and upset .
M	in common with the majority of others , you must avoid this company , i have waited 0 months now for an accurate bill that reflects my usage .
F	thanks !
M	would buy again .
M	thank_you for your understanding thus_far and we look_forward to completing your refund soon .
F	rapid service and the was cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
F	yes , their sizes are quite small .
M	i purchased a roof_rack for my camper_van , totally wrong product for the actual van , rang customer service , they were no help what so ever .
F	i scanned florist websites for next_day delivery so late tuesday_evening ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) never thought i would find anyone , then came_across serenata_flowers . com .
M	great service and perfect flowers , however specified free delivery on the website yet i was charged a delivery fee of £ 0 . 00 even more anoying is my mum could of picked them up they are only around the corner
M	why is the onus on the customer ?
M	so , if you want one of the milano radiators , then the prices are good , the stock_levels seem to be accurate and the service is fine at bestheating ( though the courier is a little hit and miss ).
F	even_though it wasn_'_t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
M	once in the house and all packaging was removed after a few_days , and then my son noticed a pencil sized stab hole - oh_dear .
M	what more do you want ?
F	the blinds are fine however , there is too much of a gap at the top of the blind and the last slat doesn_'_t sit very well so as we have a street light outside our house , the blind doesn_'_t block the light very well .
M	customer service is unbelievably slow and totally_useless .
F	i ’_m defo not a happy shopper maybe time to change provider i ’_m sick of no apologises and the fact the mess up so often .
F	item was exactly as we were expecting
F	***** 00 / 00 - still have not been paid ( although called yesterday was told i would get paid today ).
F	thank_you .
F	thank_goodness !
F	thank_you x
F	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
M	they , like me thought they were dealing_with a reputable_company , and have been mistaken , taken for a ride and lost money on it .
F	without_any doubt the probiotics have really calmed my bowel frequency down , having suffered 0 or 0 movements most mornings for 00 years .
M	explain what your company pays you for . what exactly do you do ?
F	having just been on the bus for a full tour with no_problems_whatsoever having our children sat next to us , as did many other families .
M	in my opinion a first_class company let_down by their courier company .
M	i '_m an 00 year_old student from birmingham and i ordered a gladiator mask for halloween to resemble one of my favourite rappers ; mf doom .
F	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
F	i called the manchester bead_shop only to be told they had not been in stock before and were in fact being sent that day .
F	product very good just wat i wanted and quick delivery and service would definatly_recomend !
M	i think you may get a better response if you mail people at a reasonable out of the day !
M	ebookers is very good , especially if , like us you like to do round trips .
M	!
F	when i didn_'_t hear that my sister had received the flowers , i phoned the receptionist and she said she was not aware the box contained flowers .
M	tried to check in online at 0pm at which point i was informed my flight had been cancelled however expedia only acknowledged this at 00pm after a number of very lengthly phone_calls .
M	films i returned being sent straight back to me and probably the world '_s most confusing web_site that i can no_longer be_bothered to navigate .
F	for that reason i won_'_t be using viagogo again
M	use with extreme caution .
M	the eggs were delivered the very next_day in the morning .
M	will_definitely be using next time
M	it '_s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
F	i contacted them , they asked me took photo but they can ’_t see the scratch from the photo , i posted it back to them and they agree that they let_me choose another glasses .
M	otherwise , i '_m happy .
F	i order my floor_tiles on the monday & they were delivered on the wednesday !
F	animed certainly are cheaper_than the previous company although i did not find communication from the animed side was forthcoming as i had to make the contact on trying to find out re my order at what stage it was at .
F	competitive price / fast delivery *****
M	the flowers were delivered on the day in question but not the message .
M	i heard_nothing back for a few_days until i checked my account today and found my pre_- order cancelled .
M	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
F	easter was meant to be special for her this year , surrounded_by colour and spring indoors as this could well be her last one .
F	later in the day she rang to advise me it was missing as she had not managed to locate it .
F	avoid at all costs . you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
M	to make it worse , after several letters ultimately threatening to take them to small_claims court they then couldn_'_t cancel the order at the shop without my full card_details which implies they pass card payment details to the shop manually rather_than electronically which no doubt means me card_details were exposed to all and sundry along the way .
F	will definitely be ordering more .
M	so i returned to checkout and used the standard checkout .
F	we couldn_'_t have been more delighted with the superb stand we purchased from justtvstands .
F	very efficent .
M	great case tailor_made for my guitar .
F	would recommend !
M	gives the other main cycling sites a run for their money !
M	the delivery location was a business open at the time .
M	sitting with a friend the other day , i was discussing buying a christmas_present for my wife and lamenting about the cost of perfumes , he suggested i tried cheapsmells .
F	0 .
F	i sent phoned to fonebank , they claimed one did not work and when i queried it they ignored my email .
F	the order was confirmed and payment taken .
M	ordered and got the stuff pretty quickly .
F	i downloaded the software as instructed , which was easy to do .
F	!
M	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
F	how could i have got through the online checker ?
F	sorry !
M	compared to all other_suppliers that i checked , ' insulation place ' were very competitively_priced , particularly as i was only needing a small_quantity of insulation .
M	i called them three_times to try and get a pickup driver , but was forced to leave my wife and luggage shivering by the roadside , whilst a warden made me drive around the block .
M	brilliant service
F	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
M	a little annoying to receive newsletters / specials a few_times a week .
F	i '_ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
M	however .
M	beware .
M	i had to check at the parking office how this worked .
F	i even paid a delivery charge to ensure i would receive it on the 00th_december as i wanted it in time for christmas but this did not happen !
F	the communication from the company was really good , keeping_me up to date on how the order was progressing and the glasses arrived about a ten days_later which was faster_than i had expected .
M	i '_m happy that things eventually got sorted_out through " travel gateway " and that i was lucky_enough to get a good response from a human_being when all the automation and previously failed .
M	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
F	not much choice in the shop . french / belgium beers / calvados
M	i took my computer in last saturday as i had a problem paid my £_00 and also paid £_00 for anti_virus under there recomedation and was told computer would be ready that afternoon .
F	it was clear from the conversation that the item was not in stock and had to be obtained from the manufacturer .
F	used this service before and always satisfied .
M	there is no system to log in and gain updates of your purchase nor any emails saying your purchase is in the warehouse or ready to be dispatched .
M	from this experience , i decided to buy my own version , which arrived_safely a day or two after_placing the order and i was immediately comfortable with it , following installation .
M	please call the customer service line to report any fraud so they can immediately jump on it .
M	only_snag , i didn_'_t realise it didn_'_t have an sd_card slot , cos i didn_'_t read the spec closely enough .
M	the only_downer was that despite having been told the contrary , the car was not available for collection at the airport .
F	i have been very happy with the website and would recommend it to anyone interested in finding or letting a room .
M	it '_s made really well , great quality and fit .
M	i will probably use this company again .
M	seven_days have now passed and i have received no communication from anyone and i have not received any payment .
M	i bought an electronic product from them some time ago and it failed after a couple of months .
F	with the help of the books i have selected my seeds and have everything ready to start them off indoors so i have something to plant in the tunnel when it '_s up .
M	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
M	i have been using cnp for a few_years and would always recomend there products .
F	as promised the machine arrived on the saturday_morning . i was also delighted with the extras in my sewing pack . what a lovely and unexpected_bonus .
F	the only positive_comments i can add - they smelt nice and they arrived on time !
F	the replacement was eventually recieved well over a month after_placing the original order .
F	they do not reply to any emails you send and just take your money !!
F	ordered0 hp000 cartridges on sunday_evening , and the arrived by tuesday .
F	quick delivery and very pleased with quality .
F	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
F	brilliant service , reasonably_priced , easy to use .
M	goods exactly as_described and delivered promptly .
M	so the fault lies with the delivery company rather_than with madfun .
M	to be fair i think one . com do an ok service for a good price but the support is definitely lacking .
M	realy bad site you will not get any help abroad from anyone , my hotel was cancelled the day i got there and the lady said you can stay but you have to pay again shouting at us kept walking of here english was not good nor my prague . very scary so i wish this site nothing but loose and misary like we experenced
M	the website was easy to use and took next to no time to order and pay for the tyre .
F	the website images should be sorted_out !!
M	. update .
F	needless to say , will go direct to an_independent florist in future .
M	see my review for cashmyphone for full details .
F	the portulacea , described as bred for the british climate , spreading and free flowering ,
F	the wheelchair is very light_weight , wheelchair is easily set_up from packaging , easy to storable , has handles on seat that you just pull together to close and transport in car boot with room for the shopping as well .
M	if only they communicated , would make life so much_easier .
M	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can '_t take that long to cook ?
F	thank_you again for a 0st_class service !
F	very unprofessional .
F	i tried_calling iflorist and they had one of the most busier day of the year and they are off .
F	i sent them an_email back and said that the only alternative for me would be if they could send me a new dress right away without waiting for the faulty one since it would take to much time if they first had to wait for the faulty one and then i had to wait for the new dress to arrive .
M	prompt accurate service as always .
F	i called the number but was intercepted by a receptionist who pretended he was not in ( of course he was , but hiding from all his creditors and customers no_doubt ).
M	while i had no phone i lost orders from my customers totalling_£_000 . 00 .
M	the description stated 0 batteries came with the drill but only one arrived with it .
F	dell_computer purchased 0000 with whatever happens cover
F	the site was relatively clear and easy to use but i would not describe the prices as ' discount '.
F	we went on the trip to salisbury , stonehenge and bath .
M	quote process is good , but once the quote is accepted it gets annoying .
F	i purchased inks when they arrived they were not compatible with my printer even_though the website states they are .
F	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance . now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
F	no offer of extra postage refund either !
M	i contacted parts_gateway because i needed a wheel in a hurry ; i entered my details on the website , and within 00_mins i had 0 offers !
M	my criteria was simply to get the cost as cheap as possible , and for it to be convenient .
M	bus collects you outside airport ( on ground_floor ) and leaves you at hotel entrance .
F	paignton , devon
M	avoid .
M	we placed our rental flat with urban_sales and lettings and got an immediate_response .
F	would not_hesitate to recommend oakland to others , or come_back in future for other purchases .
M	the decision was easy - we went back and ordered our rings from alba_rose .
M	no its not its appalling its only 0_stars purly because of flawless fitting by mcdonald windows sub contractors from linwood totally professorial fitting , as for advanced its 0_star sort your customer service out
F	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
F	partyrama prices were relatively higher than other uk party stores .
M	i used to have an account on behalf of the swimming club with excellent online ordering and tracking of orders .
F	as it hadnt arrived by the 00th_december i checked my account and to my surprise , it stated that this item had been delivered to my home on 00th_december which was a sunday .
F	took over a week for someone to sort_out the day before_departure !
F	being somewhat of a penny pincher i always check multiple websites for the best rates and hostelbookers . com has never let_me down !
M	p . s i rang my customer as soon as i realised there would be a problem today so they could get on with their lives .
M	no excuse , no apology .
M	then i was told my order would be shipped the next_day but it wasn_'_t until a week_later , when i enquired if my order had shipped , that dhl picked it up .
M	i '_m a uk customer and this is my first order and no doubt from this experience it will be my last .
M	i ordered pairs of plain wireless reading_glasses .
F	i am even more appalled at infurns level of customer service , how_dare they go after their customer honest_opinions , if they dont want bad_reviews maybe they should get their act_together .
F	im a pregnancy testaholic so these are so beneficial for me .
M	i now have two_pairs that i am pretty_much satisfied with , despite one pair being a second choice .
F	what else could we ask for ?.
F	i checked the reviews to make_sure that there wasn_'_t a reason for the comparatively low_prices ( they are still not cheap ) so i felt_confident that i was buying a decent product .
M	the service was great and the item was approx .£ 00 cheaper then major shops i will buy again from yourspares again
M	great efficient service tyres ordered and fitted next_day no_fuss .
M	i wasn_'_t sure whether or not anything was happening with my order .
M	disappointing , as otherwise okay and value for money .
M	i explain that the ups department already have the parcel and were told it contained a bike was and they had no problem .
M	items always arrived by post within three_days .
M	contacted
M	very happy with everything .
F	however , when i rang up to request a refund on the delivery charge , the people i spoke to were abrupt , and quite rude , and would not take_responsibility for the company '_s mistake .
M	i bought a hatchbag a few_years_ago which i sold with that car .
F	i am most unhappy with their customer service as well and have left them a seperate review on this site .
F	ordering was quick and easy and transaction was straight_forward .
M	what more could you ask for .
M	now , i am still_waiting for it ( 0 days_later ) to even leave dhl '_s pick - up hub for their their export hub .
F	and i just want to watch a normal film
F	.
M	0 poor
F	won_'_t use again .
F	in my honest_opinion i would not yet recommend this treatment to anyone and i say this because my outcome is not yet known , i am advised that i am_currently undergoing a process of neural adaptation and this could take quite some time as it '_s different for everyone .
M	so unless you absolutely need your glasses urgently ( why ?
M	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don_'_t think they got the email "
F	very please with this firm we have used before and are great .
F	my email to the company was unanswered .
M	the message included the following sentence : " we really do value our customers and your custom and look_forward to continuing our relationship in the near_future .".
F	the racking system engineering was not great with a lack of precision in the making .
F	my album was nice and is a gift for my daughter however i feel the quality of the album was not as good as my other purchases from you .
M	if you can resist this , everything else is good .
M	is she paid based_upon the number of times she attempts a delivery ?
M	thankyou
F	so thank_you iflorist for a great service .
M	they do not listen , never admit fault and basically are becoming a complete monopoly .
M	it was sent out the same day , and i received it the following_day .
F	i then e_mailed go - electrical on 00 / 0 / 00 asking them to ring me as they only have a ' 0000 ' contact number which is expensive to phone but they did not ring and did not e_mail back until 00 / 0 / 00 .
F	the literature for lasik is slightly_misleading in that it goes on about how quick the surgery is and how you only need to come_back for one optional after care appointment .
F	had a great experience with viagogo .
M	cannot_fault the service .
F	00 days_later and several chasing emails , and i '_d still not had a refund , even_though i provided proof etc .
M	flap on seal was rigid and when i fitted it , which required me to cut it to size , the door on the shower would not open
F	i also had a technical_issue where i would sit a test an prior to it recording my score , i would be logged out of the course and therefore required to sit it again .
M	the service was second to none ; tails arrived when they said they would and i was kept_informed by text and email at all points , truly great customer service .
M	awful
F	lovely tiles , arrived on the day promised .
F	i eventually received another email suggesting the same alternative and i accepted , although it was not what i would have chosen to send to my son , but by then i was rather over the experience .
F	easy to navigate web_site , extensive_range .
M	!
F	its made life a lot_easier knowing i have this in place when i am no_longer here .
M	terrible service , deliberately aimed_at getting you on the phone .
M	brilliant service from_start to finish and a quality product
F	he said it was common_practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
M	order reference :_000000000 .
F	no other packets get lost nor take longer_than 0 week to arrive here . i dont live in mongolia . only southern_spain .
F	if it '_s an average occasion you can put your trust this company , cos you will not get the wow_factor , nor your monies worth and to boot , whom ever is getting them , will think you '_ve been cheap !
F	i felt quite distressed and then went on to chat and nathan put me at ease immediately .
F	emailed their office with feedback but no response as yet .
F	the basket shown on line was lovely , the basket had a handle , the one delivered was just a shallow posy bowl / basket and the main flower being very scruffy / uneven michaelmas daisies - definitely not what i wanted to see for a much mourned relative .
F	we did confirm in our online booking and again on the telephone that morning about the trailer so were very disappointed at the error .
M	first_class service from sale to delivery .
F	i really didn_'_t like any of them much and they are certainly not up to nespresso standard .
F	half the price of the competitors for the toner i bought , very impressive .
F	good company
M	i bought a large copper frying_pan in the sale at a great price .
M	quickly got what i ordered
M	i would have bought them myself had i known .
F	he also promised that a refund for the part that never arrived would be made .
F	not a happy experience .
F	good price and speedy delivery .
F	i will definitely use this service again .
M	i immediately got on the phone and the company spoke to the delivery driver who took the item back .
F	the lady_who took the call understood the wrath of my mother - in - law and kindly sent out a gorgeous pair of sandals on next_day delivery .
F	i don_'_t know why your email couldn_'_t explain that they were free flowers ordered by yourselves .
M	the car_seat box was heavily water_damaged to the point that the entire seat fell out of the box when the delivery guy moved it from the van to the front_door .
F	i '_ve made a few orders with rubbersole and had no_problems so been happy .
M	for me , taunton_leisure is such a company .
F	i wasnt_expecting my order to reach me in time , however i was very impressed to recive my engraved cup in 0_days , and for the price i paid it was fantastic value for money .
M	very pleased with the service provided , excellent advice given and my wetsuit arrived the following_day .
M	carphone_warehouse
M	probably the worst online company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
M	gls '_s system would not accept my post_code , so could not request information from them .
F	the flowers arrived and i was absolutely horrified at the state of them .
F	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
M	!
M	great service and would thoroughly_recommend them to others .
M	all i have remaining is your automated re - delivery service which is simply not good enough when your delivery driver has not been here .
F	need to work on checking all items correct .
M	easy process to arrange through the website and the fitter was on time .
M	the villa was great , good location with lovely sea_views .
M	went like clock work .
M	what a complete_joke .
F	apart_from that the car was ok . as the office would be closed when we were to return it we were told to park it at the car_rental hertz near to the airport .
M	then again someone came on wed !
M	they will be passed there use by date at this rate .
M	the services on the vessel were plentiful and good .
M	love fra mig af < 0
M	happiest feet in devon !
F	usually after a lot of nagging !
M	still waiitng for purchase ???????
F	that '_s when things are going well .
F	you ' re going to the airport and you don_'_t know which terminal your going !
M	it '_s now saturday 00th & still no sign of the parcel .
M	no real complaints , wonderful bike at a price which couldn_'_t be_beaten .
F	i was rather disappointed as i tend to prefer a zip on the outside to put my keys in .
F	had one lot of tablets and received them , only by luck as it seems now !
F	the flowers arrived on time but that is the only good thing about serenata_flowers .
M	it was accurate at 0 litres , brim full , but as the lid needs about 0 cm at the top this left us well short of 0 litres with the lid on .
M	and i still havnt got my money back .
F	what a sad existence to steal from a company and make a fool of yourself !
M	i offered to go 00 / 00 on getting an independant engineer to evaulaute they refused and ignored all my calls and letters thereafter .
M	i like that they make it easy to price match from other_sites , because i '_m cheap !
F	please_beware that the clarion bus only leaves every half hour , so time it correctly !
M	knowing they would arrive in time and exactly as ordered !
F	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
F	we will be back to order others , probably for christmas and or presents
F	i called monday and there '_s an answer machine saying they are closed but they should be opened .
F	i ordered special food for our cat , the delivery man said he had tried to deliver it twice but i think it was just the once .
F	i received the badges within 0 working_days but would have liked a cheaper delivery option , ie_: 0st_class_post !
M	get all your musical_needs and desires from guitarguitar , the place to go !
F	what a shame .
F	the ferry , which was scheduled to leave at 00 : 00 , was delayed by one hour .
F	i ordered a bottle of rum from this company as a surprise christmas_present for a friend .
F	disappointed this time round but will_continue to use printzone and hope to receive the excellent service previously experienced .
F	the restaurant on our return crossing didnt have enough food and the offers were not told to us regarding the sweets .
F	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’_t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’_t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
M	just a last word .
M	i was happy with the time it took to deliver .
M	goods as_described , promply received in safe condition .
F	my mum is in her 00 '_s and not strong .
M	aol '_s service continues to be execrable .
M	not even my pants are now made in the uk .
F	i then rung back the following_day only to be told again that there was no one that could help me !!
M	ebay and paypal , are the most greedy , unethical companies in existence .
F	i have always been happy with the service . really great site to use .
M	the delivery service that they use is the best i '_ve ever_experienced .
F	but as this was my first experience using this company , i '_m in two_minds as to whether i will be using them again
M	i have used several competitors in the past but for peace of mind , simplicity , speed & traceability i highly_recommend hifx , my first choice for money transfers .
F	i '_ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
F	the service was very fast and within a couple of days my money came through !
F	nowadays delivery times for things you buy on the internet are usually fast and efficient .
M	waited_until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
F	blue_chip offered to pay for a dongle ( although they never called back to confirm this despite saying they would ) but the owners eventually replied the next_day and put a booster in the property which did enhance the signal and enabled_us to have contact with our family at christmas .
F	it took 0 & 0 / 0_weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn_'_t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
M	i had written everything down that was wrong and told the ccl tech .
F	i mean , at some point i was even trying to help the rep by login up into my computer and finding flights myself !!!!!!!!!!!!
M	upon complaining i was sent a voucher to redeem off my next purchase but this had been used by me on the original order therefore is invalid .
F	if you look around you can find the items a lot_cheaper and with better stock_levels .
M	did not buy one single item from argos this christmas as nearly every item seen on the website cannot be reserved for store pick_up as out of stock not good enough and i went elsewhere
M	as for hdcctv as a company ?
F	i was disappointed in this service , my local_garage in falmouth would not take the parcel , despite it being well within the sizes , the shop owner said he had no room to take .
M	it still hasnt arrived .
M	fortunately i had the gumption to submit another inquiry .
F	i was looking for a suitable gift for my mothers_birthday who had recently_moved some 000_miles_away .
M	good luck !
M	!
F	firstly , photo on package shows a complete suit including black trousers .
M	ordered my worktops and upstands from worktop_express .
M	i recommend to everyone and i would use parts_gateway again !
F	i would have prefered him to say that it will be 00_mins at_least we could have gone for a coffee as_opposed to waiting in the cold .
M	i was more than happy my purchase was protected but this was complete over kill in my opinion .
F	ordered flowers and they never arrived the next_day as they should have been .
M	even_though in my may statement : your nominated_bank_account will be debited with the full balance on 00 / 00 /_0000 or soon after .
F	i haven_'_t bothered to email about the size discrepancy as i received no response regarding my last email .
F	luckily amazon package products well .
F	delivered what we wanted when we wanted and in time .
M	i was extremely happy with the service from madfun and would recommend them to anyone .
M	but i got another set of glasses and they ordered the original glasses i wanted .
F	the flowers that eventually arrived look a lot smaller_than what was shown in the pictures and the flowers are so dry and are half_dead .
F	my order was pending for many days .
M	the shelving is easy to put_together and once you '_ve done one unit very quick to do further units .
M	and thank_you for the sweeties .
F	although the brush_heads were a great price it seems that this is because they are of inferior quality .
F	thank_you for making my garden look so beautiful .
F	promised i had bought the best seats , my girlfriend usually buys all our tickets so i am novice and believed viagogo .
M	just one tiny mark on the lid .
M	not quite the saving that was advertised !
M	regarding my order # q0000000 your online picture_shows the this selection displayed in a vase , hence i didn_'_t order a vase as i assumed the package would be delivered with one .
F	i will be using their trusty service time and time again , i '_m so pleased i found them and would recommend them to everyone
F	they are normally cheaper_than some other online companies and they are free
F	i have missed it and only wanted to suggest some improvements but have faced negative side of cs_team .
M	very satisfactory
M	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .
F	the size was perfect , good quality .
F	it took more than 0 . 0 hours to do all of them .
F	the returns_policy_states refund within 00 days of drop_off .
M	i said i wasn_'_t prepared to divulge my password to anybody and was amazed that i was being asked to compromise my personal security .
M	i thought i was getting a better quality product and was disappointed when they arrived , especially when i saw how they were packaged , which was minimal to say the least , compared to other internet based plastic box suppliers i use .
M	having forgotten about easter ( was very busy work wise , i ordered easter_eggs on the wednesday prior to easter .
M	i have saved a lot of money on my tyres and it all seems to be effortless so_far and i even managed to get straight through to an advisor at this time which made me really happy .
F	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night '_s accommodation that '_s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .
M	all of them said they ' d get someone to call me back . no one ever did .
F	omg suprise_suprise !
M	if you are a seller be very , very careful indeed whenever accepting payment via this company .
M	really ?
M	and even more finally ; i will update this review , same time next year and let you know how the furniture does over time .
M	i will use him for future quotes , failing which i will again use shiply . unless its a small package .
F	from some couriers this cost me £_00 . 00 . picked_up and dropped_off when they said they would . all_round great service .
M	my wife traded her ipad in and was in excellence condition with no marks !
F	the show_room was lovely , and buying the furniture was very easy .
M	i '_ve never had cause for complaint with eiither the goods or the delivery times .
M	would have no problem going back to them .
M	even when i had mentioned that a certain time limit to deliver was important due to our travel schedule . the item was very late .
F	i first saw a tweed jacket like this over three years_ago at cheltenham races and have wanted one ever_since , but never been able to justify the cost .
M	they kept me updated on my order , when it was dispatched and delivered .
F	i checked to see whether my phone had been received and the post_office tracker said it had , however , i then received a text from orange advising me to send my phone in quickly if i still wanted to recycle it .
F	i am pretty disappointed at this after_spending over_£_000 but as i have my daughter '_s christening at our home this weekend , i can '_t wait for a new one to be made .
M	m
M	not convinced i '_ll use them again .
F	the whole_process took 00_minutes and by the end a new contract was signed , he '_d sent me a copy of the termination i then posted to my current_supplier . deal done and dusted .
M	also , there are cheaper sd_cards available in the uk on the internet .
F	to make an_appointment you have to contact the central call_centre - not the local office - such a pain as they don_'_t have access to the same number of appointments as the branch .
F	pleased with goods , when arrived .
F	i would stay well away from pet_supermarket , they are cheap for a reason and probably subsidise their business by using an expensive customer service telephone_number .
M	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
F	was looking for a shaving stand to fit razor and brush as a present .
F	shoetique is my first stop for shoe shopping .
M	i could do with hints on how to adjust the fit .
F	found some boots in tk maxx but they werent in my size , so googled them and mastershoe_- myshu was the best online price .
F	why was my review deleted ?
F	finally , after 0_weeks_later , they said they '_ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
F	have all been seamless and the communication is good so you know exactly when your delivery will arrive .
F	0 ) when i pay full price for a ticket for my journey home that consists of 0 trains and my ticket doesn_'_t even get checked .
F	your customer service staff was very patient and polite .
F	thank_you !
F	i don_'_t understand_why certain places offer collect_plus if they have no storage ?
F	i have an odd prescription but they phoned to check it was right and were able to adjust the lense thickness of one eye accordingly .
F	their costumer service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
F	*** please_note that due to restrictions in place with one or more of the merchants for which you have requested payment , we ' re unable to payout via this method .
M	items ordered together sent separately and at different times .
F	for me personally , a happy outcome ( eventually ); i wish all other_reviewers the same success in getting a good result .
M	was told delivery will be before the 00th but no delivery today ,
F	which i was upset as they were for my friends birthday that day !
F	gf
F	duly attended by technician , the results of which * i * had to chase a couple of weeks_later , after finding other faults .
M	it was tricky to locate .
F	when i tried to track the order , it said " dispatched " but i didn_'_t receive them .
M	it '_s the 0rd time i '_ve_used mazuma and the service has_been impeccable every time
F	jeg_vil til enhver tid advare venner , der ønsker at_bestille varer hos nelly .
F	however buyabattery had just what i wanted at a very fair price .
F	some stuff is really good value and it is convenient to find a lot of things in one store but recently there have been some changes afoot in our local_store .
F	would recommend .
F	i rang up immediately and the office was closed , so i made a return phone_call at 0 . 00 saturday_morning only to be told that i had entered a contract and was going to be charged_£_00 for an_amendment .
F	i just want to warn_people to stay away from you .
F	good communication , poor attention to detail , got them wrong twice , third time lucky ?
M	by obtaining a six month prescription from my vet , ( i have to pay them £_00 for that !)
F	keep_up your great standards .
M	so many want to just take the money and run .
F	my items were received the next working day and i will certainly use this supplier again .
F	consequently by the time i arrived at the festival venue , hyde_park , i had missed the first 0 acts .
M	ordered chart arrived by return of post - well_packaged etc
M	would and have recommended this item and bondara !
M	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
F	we are delighted with the company whom we used and happily have the sofa_bed here .
F	cannot register on - line .
F	they were very quick to get the new stock item out to me with no_hassle whatsoever and would have made a plan if it was urgent .
F	having this surgery truly has affected my life immensely as i now suffer from high anxiety and often get depressed about my situation .
M	they have accepted money from a person_who made a self inclusion , then closed the account for being void .
F	my washing_machine purchase was great value compared to other high profile competitors so i was very pleased .
F	im not happy that i paid over eight_pounds for a chart only .
F	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
M	i was dubious_about spending so much money on line despite all the great reviews i had read from other customers so i decided to pick my watch up from their shop in blackburn .
F	he got a phone_call at 0 . 00 the next_day saying that i had agreed that both packages would arrive today , which he immediatly say no only the second was agreed reluctently the first was ment for yesterday .
F	day 0 - thats today . still no parcel
F	nothing turned_up after 0_weeks so i emailed them .
M	not as the picture appeared
M	it was , and they did .
M	have dealt_with juno for years as im an_avid record collector and never had a problem with them .
F	no voucher after 0_days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn_'_t work on weekend .
F	your glow in the dark_pink lenses were not glow in the dark and my red cat eyes split as soon as i put them in : ( made me and my sister annoyed as this was the main part of our outfit !
M	0 .
M	when the flowers didn_'_t show up on the day
M	unfortunately , the vehicle was not available at the pick - up location and we had to take a cab with all our_luggage to the airport depot and then wait in a queue for an_hour before being_processed .
F	i don_'_t know how to fit it so it is still currently sat in my boot .
M	no apology for the delay ,
M	i found the services i paid for were perfectly_adequate for my needs , the staff helpful and polite .
F	i opted for next_day delivery and was kept i formed of delivery time .
M	i ordered a rucksack from trekkinn on 0 / 0 / 00 , paying in full through paypal .
M	i have had to go back to optical_express for them to monitor my vision , monthly for 0 months and they want me to come_back another time in another month to see if i need further corrective_surgery .
F	the customer service is incompetent and the website provides no alternative online_chat .
F	trying to get a response from customer service was impossible without having to shame them into it on facebook .
F	good communications .
F	it looks great on my living_room wall .
F	as the back of the costume contains an elastic , a size smaller would have been perfect .
M	i '_m absolutely fuming and so angry with groupon .
M	?
F	disappointed my order wasn_'_t delivered to my door as three of us were in and waiting .
M	not notified which courier was being used so could not track the parcel . not given a tracking_number . took two visits by courier to deliver . arrived eventually .
M	brainwashed staff had stock answers which tuned out to be lies .
M	my reason for 0_stars is that i went back to them for a submariner on the basis of initial service and this time it was terrible .
F	great service to start with , ok service resolving the problem .
F	as the literature had said that if i wasn_'_t in to sign for delivery there would be a charge to re - deliver , i emailed the store to ask if i could make a charge for non - delivery , and got no reply .
M	i eventually chose a year_old seamaster which was £_000 cheaper_than the new model .
F	prices pretty good
F	service very good would def use again !!!
F	the finish of the metal was extremely rough to say the least & had to be filed down !!
F	fabulous communication_regarding order , dispatch and delivery - love it !
M	one also wonders , given the nature of what they are delivering whether there is actually intent to get you to pay for delivery ?
M	companies should not have the right to pass peoples details to debt_collectors due to their mistake - especially when you spend sooo_much of your time contacting them to get it rectified .
M	so i '_m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
M	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we '_ve had , and your response was to delete it .
M	the goods were in the local courier '_s hands on friday_morning bit didn_'_t get to me until monday .
M	the first pair sent had one lens incorrect which made them useless .
M	you have been_warned
M	they have not replied to my mail regarding this .
F	customer service has also been extremely good .
M	avoid !
F	no matter what type of ironmongery item i have needed i can virtually guarantee that it can be found here .
M	i have been using cs for seven_years for all my transactions abroad and can find no fault .
M	the ordering_process was easy and let us see a mock_up of the card / magnet prior to finalising the order .
M	just to add , it '_s been 0_weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after_contacting them .
F	the reicher shoes were lovely , felt hand made as stated and colours were correct .
F	still_waiting for confirmation for repayment of delivery charge .
M	ordering was easy and the outfit came as promised .
F	never been disappointed to date .
M	0 months later i check my bank_account . 0 transactions showed up , each from the carphone_warehouse .
M	it '_s the first time i have dealt_with them , but it won_'_t be the last !
M	no driver ever attempted a collection .
F	i was very impressed at how quickly my order arrived , especially as it is coming up to christmas .
F	it '_s just gorgeous and fits me perfectly .
F	i love the outfit so much , it looks very sexy on without revealing too much !
M	the lg washer i purchesed stated 0 - 0 working_days , and once purchased , got a text to say it would be 0 working_days , they then had the audacity to charge me £_00 to get it delivered in that time ,( although it does state in terms and conditions , it may take longer ).
F	please be aware if you are considering making a purchase from this company .
M	paul was extremely_helpful but it was 0_weeks before i received my tv .
M	the response was along the lines - we are looking in to this and will get back to you .
F	i then communicated via chat again on the 0th asking where they were .
F	this was the first time i had used oak_furniture_land , and i would not_hesitate to use them again or recommend them to family and friends .
M	i '_m able to keep learning in my sixties .
F	the tracking also showed that the parcel was delivered to 00 buckwood avenue , which was untrue , it was delivered into the hands of a workman , who i have never met , to no 00 buckwood avenue .
F	if in doubt , buy it , you wont_be disappointed !
M	this company is out of credibility .
M	. still to see how it pans out .
M	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
F	i called the call_centre on 0 occasions in order to try and cancel my booking and was simply cut_off after 00_minutes of holding .
M	i bubble_wrapped the phone to be safe and sent it special delivery .
F	it was let_down by the insurance .
M	!
M	my computer is not the newest model and it struggled to run the online software .
M	i felt the course structure was excellent , it was broken down into manageable and easy - to - digest sections .
F	my gripe is with the additional service they provide were you can request a different delivery option before your item is delivered .
F	not very helpful indeed when the shop is busy .
F	upon_opening the box and inner foam liner i immediately noticed that the paperwork in the top was soaking_wet , with raw chicken juice !!
M	i '_ve placed two orders with bananafingers so_far , the first one was missing an item , and when i contacted the company to tell them , it was sent out the same day and lead to an interesting email conversation with one of the guys there .
F	it was all very quick and easy , just how things should be !
F	the villa was also in quite a convenient position , quiet but only a short_walk from the shops and restaurants .
M	i reccomend to everybody .
F	thank_you !
F	there is no phone number on the website to discuss this with someone and the emailed response via the website is not very helpful , with a slow response to comments .
M	i rang the courier to point out what she had done and she hung_up on me .
F	some chocolate buttons , a very small bag of stuffing and some choritso nibbles . two wine_glasses were suppose to be free .
F	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
M	it would have ben helpful if the delivery team were able to unpack the furniture .
M	good old_fashioned service like this is not found too often , i will_certainly use them again .
M	the only reason i was disappointed was because on steam i ordered sniper_elite 0 only to later come_across this site and see it for cheaper , but we got wildstar together and sometime soon elder_scrolls online too !!
M	looks fine .
M	the delivery company did nor delver when they said they would .
F	- lack of assistance to find an_alternative property ( 0 phone_call to another owner who didn_'_t answer and they never followed up or tried again )
M	they phoned back 0 hours_later by which time i had given up and gone out .
F	i would like to say i had no_problems with this purchase however that is not the case .
F	a loyal_customer at present .
M	fairly good selection but very expensive when used to buying wholesale
M	placed an order on tuesday , it arrived in the post on wednesday .
M	but it went really wrong !
F	very happy :) defiantly recommend !
M	great prices and very quick delivery .
F	i looked online and compared prices to other_sites and stores and appliance direct was far cheaper by far ,
F	my order number is f0000c0000 - 0
M	icebreaker clothing is brilliant .
F	this had been added to my invoice (£_00 . 00 ) and there was nowhere i could cancel it .
M	will be seeking a refund now .
F	very expensive for the amount of flowers supplied .
M	i now use printerland as a benchmark for good price and quick delivery .
M	as most phone companies own insurance do not cover missuse calls after it is stolen you wonder_if this is to help more with there profits , though most of them also do not allow you to put a cap on your spending either .
F	delivery was good but the flowers were a little_disappointing - they were somewhat crumpled and looked more like supermarket bought quality .
M	you cannot ffault this service is 000_percent
M	but setting_foot in wythenshawe post_office , manchester and having committed the apparent mortal sin of putting a couple of staples in a bubblewrap envelope i certainly would never ever go in there again !
M	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
M	i ordered one day on line through the web_site , opted for normal delivery and received it the next morniing .
M	i have saved several screen_shots of what i believe to be false_advertising and misleading and seemingly for no reason , in a recent response from them they have acknowledged they have their it team updating the listings , which to me suggests they acknowledge my claims .
F	but sadly you never made the re - fund you promised - it '_s been over a month .
M	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
F	the other company said if you could find prices cheaper they would see if they could match it .
F	day later ive received a phone_call with information that tyres i '_ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
F	i bought the photo_world album with an amazon_voucher offer .
M	mobile number . nothing !
M	don_'_t imagine you can complain though because they wont be there .
F	and i got it a week before the 00 wich was great .
F	the bedside_cabinet looks great , and came ready_assembled .
F	basically good service and good correspondence but i had to chase_up a refund for returned goods .
F	delivery was when stated and as_described however i orders an exhaust that was informed 0_days_later it was out of stock
F	.
M	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
F	phone system particularly frustrating too as you can '_t speak to anyone but the online team were brilliant .
M	i now need to explain this whole sorry story to my credit_card company totry and get the money refunded by them , but my advice to any potential_clients of either company is totally avoid like the plague .
F	the poles themselves are good , so no_worries_about products .
M	great product , very helpful , quick delivery , look fantastic when on , will order from them again
M	ie ten days after_placing my order .
M	they won_'_t lend .
M	delivery was extended .
F	but come on none of the above services existed at this hotel , completely falct advertising , would never use ebookers again and i wouldn_'_t advise anyone to use the service
M	to be fair spoke to car audio fitters ( none local ) who very helpful , said its not that difficult , again a but , am still trying to get sensible quote from local_fitters for doing it , they all say it is a big job .
F	the dog likes them too , especially when you are lying on them - and they survive his sharp claws .
M	you have been_warned .
F	you do find bargains but some ppl arent so friendly or reliable at all and becouse you dont get to try on the clothes / shoes , its a risk sometimes not worth taking
M	just one thing , i ordered it in friday and payed for next_day delivery expecting to get it on saturday .
F	the item was made of good quality material however wasn_'_t manufactured very well so the seams look quite messy .
F	it is with regret that i will not return to serenata :(
F	there is no phone number for this company so consider the pitfalls when something does go_wrong .
F	i '_m not happy at all with the situation .
M	still_await refund when items get returned to sender , very unfair and unprofessional company , will never use again and will not recomend .
F	they still have not arrived .
M	the clothing is of good quality , there is no issue there .
M	very professional .
M	i will_certainly use again .
F	from booking , when i had problems using a discount_voucher , to delivery the whole_process was very disorganised .
F	0 beanbags ordered on 0th_december at a 00_%_discount - immediate payment taken on my credit_card .
F	the person i was speaking to just didn_'_t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
M	not the first order i have placed with end and certainly won_'_t be the last !
F	if they couldn_'_t do that i wanted a refund but i had some concerns .
M	i book every year a golfing holiday to spain the hotel alay appartments this year had to book 0 appartments with lowcost hols because was told none available from yourselfs !!!!
F	i had to do each order separately .
M	every cyclist knows another and the tech_savvy are always comparing gear .
M	specifically_asked for friday ( valentines_day !)
F	i '_m very happy with camera jungle -- the best customer service i think i '_ve ever had .
M	a bit frustrating when i got back because i phoned in whilst i was waiitng for my luggage and was told to phone back when i had it .
F	when i got my credit_card statement three_weeks_later and saw that the money had gone_through my account , i wondered when i would actually get the fins .
F	well past its use by date avoid !
M	the web_page from which i ordered my battery shows a picture of a sony battery and i did think i was ordering a genuine sony product .
F	had no_problems_whatsoever during the week and returning the car was as easy as collecting , no_issues at all .
F	make_sure you order up a size .
F	my vet provided a prescription which was scanned & sent .
F	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
F	please can you choose an_alternative payout method .
F	ordering was easy , the photos were good , so you know what you are getting and then they delivered them on easter_sunday that is impressive .
M	the nextday , the delivery day , i still hadnt received any email or any response from superfi , so i called them .
F	good quality and arrived within a few_days accurate sizes to
F	i did email the sunglasses_shop but didn_'_t hear back for 0_days and was also unhappy that if i had left ordering i would have received 00_%_off my order simply for leaving them in my shopping_basket .
F	i am very upset and very unsatisfied with my order .
M	bunch of idiots more like .
M	i bought a baby belling cooker .
M	a first - class buying experience which i would heartily_recommend .
F	?
M	this is very misleading on the site !!!
M	i had to pay for my own parcel ( delivery to hifi_gear ) on top of that they took 00 days to " assess " the speakers state then they charged me a further 00_% of the total_cost that was about £_00 as a " restocking_fee ".
M	the first pair came the next_day .
M	i emailed another 0 times on the 00 / 00 / 00 00 / 0 / 00 and the 00 / 0 / 00 all went_unanswered .
M	it was all a rush , pushing through as fast as you could go to complete the sale !
F	really pleased with the bar and restaurant areas , enjoyed a good evening_meal and a few drinks .
M	be warned though , it '_s not as easy to do it yourself as it looks on their site / video .
M	your presentation is over the top and the idea of free_gifts is tacky but your service is fine and the flowers admired .
M	got a voicemail during the day to say driver had broken down and was returning to birmingham , new delivery date friday .
F	arrived at the airport to find the chap was waiting for us .
F	i was very disappointed with the delivery it took 0_days to arrive
F	super_fast delivery .
M	that '_s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
M	for both orders i had to ring or e_mail to find out what was happening .
M	oops .
F	a website messed me around with my order so i looked them up on google which lead me to here .
M	two guys , not the chirpy friendly sort but they bought in it and put it in place and it works !
F	they have attempted a delivery , whilst it was true that i was out of the house on saturday and didn_'_t come home till after 0 , why was there no calling_card left ?
M	that '_s right .
F	tescos used to be where we shopped all the time but recently we have found the pricing and deals not as appealing as they used to be .
F	!
F	well_done kate .
M	she did not answer any of my questions and took a very long time ( i mean 0 mins or more per line ) over each short reply .
F	reasonable_prices and choice of delivery makes the process a pleasing experience .
F	it would have been nice to be informed of this before i had to make the phone_call myself .
F	i will be researching to see if i can take this further , but in truth , don_'_t think i '_m strong_enough to fight and will just accept something i don_'_t want .
F	thank_you .
M	first_rate site & service .
M	i have ordered from this company sometime ago and found the service speedy , however this does not seem to be the case now and i have concerns : -
F	it was delivered quickly - no_problems .
F	!
F	now have to wait_till monday !!
M	i called up customer service and told them about this issue , assuming this was happening to other people as well .
F	has taken two_weeks for an item to be delivered ( there was no_indication when i ordered that the item was out of stock ).
F	the town area is small with a man made beach .
F	this is one place we will be returning .
F	great choice of on trend clothing and range of prices to suit .
M	hi there ,
M	- still to recieve this one in white hopefully
M	platinum superking was a very good price after comparing other_sites , so_far great nights_sleep would consider getting my son another mattresss maybe a discout is on its way ?
M	their systems have also changed , mostly for the good , but not always , and their claims for buyer_protection are rather over - stated .
M	impressed !
F	bit of a nightmare .
F	they fully refund the money i paid for the cleaning service and they have covered the cost of replacing the scratched plate in my new shower .
M	they looked about quarter the size bunch and had no roses .
F	bought an adaptil_diffuser for my dog as a few_months_ago we sadly lost our other dog .
F	i requested a refund but they refused .
F	they don_'_t often have what you want in stock but come on , we love argos because most of their stuff is cheap and cheerful .
M	would buy from again , just not any bt products .
M	the bus was horribly overcrowded and we felt_like_cattle .
F	i would use them again
F	the dressing_table is good value for money .
M	i ordered online a number of shirts spent_nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely_ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
M	i '_m not fully sure about these_people .
M	i wasn_'_t in any hurry but the product came the next_day .
F	then i had a knock at my door at 0am which was yodel , shockingly out of order as they are meant to call and arrange the appointment and 0am , really !!!
F	!
F	the jacket was in perfect_condition and just as per its decription online .
M	very quickly delivered .
F	the tap arrived very promptly ; well_wrapped and excellent delivery as the tracking options gave time slots which is extremely useful .
M	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
M	they were there from early morning only for me to receive a phone_call at 0 : 00 pm to say they could now not deliver as their driver had gone sick by the roadside ( funny some years_ago when i ordered from this company i was given the same excuse when the item did not arrive .
F	very much looking_forward to wearing it out !
M	many_thanks .
M	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
M	one evening i spotted the mouse about 00 times in the front room , where the sound gadget was switched on .
F	bought rechargeable tea - lights and thought they might need constant recharging .
F	if you do try and use the website to find a property the only search_criteria is by country !
F	it was my first and - most highly likely - my last purchase from pet_supermarket .
M	must be an epidemic down there as they are ignoring my emails again !!
M	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .
F	received goods quickly , well_packaged and exactly_what i required .
F	i was given an estimated delivery of 0_weeks time and it was finally delivered 0_weeks_later after i sent a chasing email .
M	getting out , that same evening and much later the same day , was a wholly different proposition .
F	don_'_t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer service .
M	.
M	good price .
F	flowers very small and deceiving some had already died .
F	arrived two_days_later .
F	why have four - weekly payments ?
M	but . it turned_up !!
F	by the time i got home , the parcel was already returned .
M	staff unhelpful and unable to give any indication of whether your goods will actually be collected resulting in disatisfaction / bad feedback from the recipitant .
M	luckily while this was going on , my wife noticed another audi quattro being parked nearby .
F	always on time and has replaced another website which i used to buy lenses from before .
M	i used to visit it daily now i just don_'_t bother very much .
F	this was the first time we used this service and thought they were first_class .
M	customer_support is friendly
F	very quick to deliver good friendly service would use again
F	disguisting experience .
M	i use mail order a lot and it has_been a number of years since i encountered such intransigence .
F	very many_thanks .
M	i have the utmost_confidence that when i place an order , my items will arrive with 0 - minimal delay , and i '_ll be updated along the way .
M	delivery prompt and very efficient .
F	!
F	from the online forum i found i wasn_'_t the only one experiencing this issue so hopefully it will be resolved soon :-) good intro to project_management .
F	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
F	will be continuing to use regularly .
F	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
F	never ordered anything .
F	i can '_t say enough to praise the quality of the design , the efficient personal service , the choice on offer and the impact factor the finished_product has .
F	one of the orders has_been returned , which i know will take an age to get a refund - plus its cost me an extra £_00 for p_&_p for a double duvet_cover value £_00 which was crap !
M	i was furious , i had made sure i had stayed in all day , so was not at all impressed .
M	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
F	very disappointed indeed at this bad service and what a wasted day considering it is so near christmas and we could have spent our time getting the bits of shopping . the driver obviously went home early or couldn_'_t be bothered to do all his deliveried .
F	overall , would recommend but if it '_s a present ( these were wedding gifts ) then make_sure you get them and check the packaging first !
M	used argus to rent a car from green_motion who are in the holiday_inn hotel at gatwick
M	got my parcel dead quick with some vouchers and realy neat parcel
F	the straps need either to be thinner , or have some sort of end on that makes for easier gripping .
F	please read the customer service rssponse
F	also the doors were not aligned properly and so i set about phoning again and was told if i kept the wardrobe they would give me £_00 . 00 refund , which i refused as i paid £_000 and now as i have no more days off until christmas i have to wait_until 00st_september so it can be delivered on a saturday !!!
F	authentic costumes that everyone admired , at a reasonable_price , if i go to another fancy_dress i would definitely use this company again for good value , they do a great range in accessories too , which set off the outfit and made them more believable .
M	i felt really bad as it was me that got my manager to do her the deal which was superb whilst the dongle was useable .
M	not impressed .
M	still the parcels didn_'_t arrive .
M	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
F	bought a new small_sideboard and next of tables from new oakfurnitureland in speke .
F	all my ' go to ' ejuices are from lf .
M	excellent
F	00hr delivery as standard and no charge .
F	they didn_'_t have enough in stock , so they contacted the suppliers to get the right amount .
M	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable_company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn_'_t charge you a fortune .
F	i was quarantined at home due to a contageous illness , desperately_needed printing ink to complete a project .
F	excellent service and communication_throughout the transaction .
M	pick_up for free if over £_00 .
M	having ordered a banner i was contacted several_times to discuss the specifics of my order , including an upgrade of the poor quality image i had supplied .
F	even the manager of the store where we bought our sofa ( who we had to visit after our frustrations in getting through to customer service on the phone ) admitted that he is frustrated that the quality of after sales customer service does not back up the front line sales_staff .
M	when i got back , i noticed that not only they did not have a tint but centering etc .
M	have been trying for three_days to get through to this company , to pay my disabled and elderly mothers electricity_bill , average of over an_hour eating every day regardless of the time of day , definitely will be changing provider to eon , disgraceful service !!!
M	0 .
M	good range of phones but cannot get them where i live and seem pricey .
M	i was left with a mountain of packing_material .
F	this meant we had to spend a lot of time making things fit .
M	dont intend to use again !
M	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
M	i am now in the process of making a claim for the loss of the product .
M	but - on driving 000_miles on the m00 and m0 , i noticed the balance wasn_'_t right .
F	!
F	so i sent an_email only to be told that the product was out of stock and that i will be refunded within 00 days .
M	it was very competitively_priced parking for our 0 day stay .
M	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
F	the prices are outstanding too .
F	it '_s literally the next town over , it '_s at_least a 00 minute to an hours drive and i live in a street that is really not hard to find because it '_s outside the city_centre which is small .
F	regardless of the fact i paid less_than full price a company has a duty , surely , to fulfil their promises !
F	most operatives are also happy to discuss that we have diagnosed the correct faulty part before despatching anything incorrectly .
F	i was told that i would also receive my payment within 0 - 00 working_days and it took a month !
F	apparently , it is next working day which off course they forget to advertise !
M	found some of my old_phones in the cupboard , went on line , printed tickets , posted them off , money in the bank in two_days !
F	the viovet staff replied to emails very quickly , unlike any other company who reply in a few_days !
F	i then managed to find the certificate of posting and called him back the following_day .
F	this must have affected a lot of other customers and could have been extremely dangerous for my dog and other customers animals .
F	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
F	really good service and slightly cheaper_than buying on the high_street meant i could buy an extra present .
M	first and last time i use expedia !
F	i was happy with the service from orange , but i was underpaid by £_00 with no explanation why .
F	every thing is a high_standard and arrived fast , a little_pricey but would buy with them again
F	cooks lovely and tastes nice and tender .
F	i have a very good dslr_camera and the print quality in the book is very pixelated .
M	they still show the item being in stock .
M	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
F	i made an order and over a month later i still have not received it .
M	then i ordered sunglasses clicked for one then two wowcher codes were sent to me when i only wanted one !!
M	another order i made was dispatched for next_day delivery , nothing turned .
M	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn_'_t_argue against the dispute i had raised .
F	motivates me to visit the shop !
F	and i received a cheque the next_day !
M	!
F	i then found the price matching guarantee on the cycle_store website , so the following_day after i had ordered the glasses , i emailed the address as instructed on the website , with details of where i had found the product and evidence that it was in stock and available for delivery .
M	the site is efficient and the staff ; friendly .
M	when trying it on the button was sewn on two inches
F	i rang travel_republic to ask for assistance with another transfer and was told to ring the company directly .
F	i emailed the company and got a reply indicating a new delivery date which wasn_'_t right either .
F	:-)
M	tried this for the first time for a batch of batteries .
F	very happy with the moses_basket , gorgeous classic just as_described - perfect !
M	have used feedem for years , always well priced with good communication , easy to use web_site and prompt deliveries .
M	would recommend to anyone !
M	not going to bother getting it back as from reading the other reviews they come_back in all_sorts of condition without other parts and bits you sent them .
F	they have not replied to emails or phone_calls or answered my on - line chat attempts .
M	the memory_sticks look great and they arrived two working_days after i ordered them .
F	many_thanks ,
M	plus the glasses only came with a cloth bag rather_than the standard hard shell case .
F	phone me with what you intend to do and treat this as an official_complaint .
F	i cannot_believe that in a modern office block there would not be a way or someone_who would be able to gain_access .
F	there was excellent communication and the item was posted extremely quickly .
F	shocking service , wrote to them before purchasing asked if in stock , purchased the pants to be told guys in warehouse cannot find them and they will have to come from me and they should be here by the end of the week , received a message on my phone today saying it could be next week now , will be contacting_trading_standards
F	i got a much_cheaper price than parcelforce and what was even better , i could just take the parcel to a local shop .
F	brilliant and fast service .
F	all i got was a text saying the visit had been cancelled , no explanation .
M	), i '_ve had parcels left with complete strangers ( it '_s amazing that delivery drivers think that just because they live a few houses away , that they can '_t be strangers ), i '_ve even had a parcel left_behind my car and without having a note left ( car had been unused for a number of days and only after moving it did i find the parcel there .
F	i found this website through looking for the product , it was new to me as i had used the same one for some time , i telephoned and the man was very helpful and i received my order within days .
F	good range of products
F	will definitely be using again
M	however , i didn_'_t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
F	like all delivery drivers , they are cheerful , pleasant and helpful .
M	i am now awaiting the computer to be shipped out and delivered , i am truly happy with how things have gone so_far .
M	items are beefing sent from_hong_kong , they only posted them today according to dhl for delivery tomorrow !.
F	complained nicely but got nowhere .
M	not sure i ' d recomend them to friends .
F	?
M	00_% would be a more realistic amount .
M	when i did get through and explained that the app isn_'_t working_properly they were of no help what so ever - i don_'_t really think they know how it works themselves .
F	i '_ve never complained about an online order before but this level of customer service was not acceptable and caused much stress and wasted a lot of time .
F	really good company to buy from and would recommend to my friends .
M	hence 0_stars .
M	the tap was faulty !!
F	finally , i have to go to the trouble of writing a letter of explanation to accompany the returning quilt , which i have to wrap up and address , then await your driver to collect .
F	the only issue i had was it took a little_longer_than_expected to receive the cheque .
F	we had a three hour flight delay arriving into gatwick , phoned them when we were getting our bags , but skis took a while and by the time we got to collection_point , they had arrived , waited 0 minutes and left again and we had to wait half an_hour for them to return with our car .
M	i measured up the dimensions of my door then looked at the range available at showerseal .
M	for the amount if money i have spent its left a sour_taste and ill probably look_elsewhere for my next order .
M	such prompt delivery i was wearing my jock all ready for the weekend !
M	never again .
M	000_%.
F	very easy and reliable , thanks mazuma :-)
F	just needed a bed to ' dress ' a room for selling , so opted for reasonable_price and good looks .
M	brought a suunto viper diving watch , came with all the added bits and pieces that i didnt get when i ordered one from the states a few_months back i . e .
F	what matters in customer service is how you try to help the customer . they don_'_t . they just robotically repeat their policy and don_'_t try to help your situation .
M	ain
F	bad reception on south of england !
M	easy to find what you are looking for online , easy to order , good service and prompt delivery .
M	i don_'_t live in the middle of nowhere .
M	they are unsure and thus hesitating while they decide which car_park to go into .
M	i ordered a fridge_freezer that was delivered in time , but it was damaged and getting them to pick it up has_been a nightmare , over two_weeks_later they managed to collect and after a further 0 days i got a refund , i reordered from appliancesdirect and withing 0days a perfect appliances arrived from two friendly drivers ,
M	easy checkout .
F	the sizing sucks , theres never anything decent for anyone a 00 or over and anything i have managed to get into didn_'_t last long once washed and the shoes have worn out quicker_than the wind changes direction .
M	after_reading the reply i sent them an email ( around 00am ) with the shipping reference and my contact number , no contact has_been made as yet .
F	however when i opened the cabinet three brass screws rolled out which concerned me slightly as i couldn_'_t see where they had come from .
M	there are also a lot of search_filters , which are helpful .
M	heard that a number of companies will only deliver to the front_door .
M	i constantly get asked to order items , but when i go online they are usually out of stock .
F	speaking with your adviser was like speaking with a friend and i would recommend your company to all of my friends .
M	used the webform on tuesday to ask for details of delivery , no response .
F	the owner has advised me on the many occasions that i have phoned her that it was posted a week_ago , however it has never been received .
M	thank_you .
F	they only had a standard double at the back of the house .
F	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
M	it ’_s as though i ’ ve gone back in time and brought a brand_new omega_seamaster from 0000 .
F	picked_up car following_morning - excellent new car and efficient staff , but confirmed they do not wait after midnight even for confirmed ( and prepaid ) bookings
F	a quality product that was delivered very quickly .
M	some good bits , some less good .
M	well boxed and packaged , rapid_despatch i was very happy with my trainers .
F	i have been inundated with post from legal and general as a result .
F	ordered two items a potty n clips .
M	no reason given for non delivery either ?
F	there are a number of marks & dents but i am hoping my kitchen_fitter can work around them by putting them underneath or by sanding etc .
M	website crashes 0 times at checkout when paying by credit_card so i pay by paypal .
F	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
F	i also bought , at the same time , a safety skirt and a weather cover , but the accessories that were sent were for a 00ft_trampoline and were therefore too small .
F	the box was huge , however the flowers inside were tiny , for £_00 i would expect more .
M	thankyou .
M	poor all_round experience .
M	i ordered a replacement battery as00a00 and on your sheet it states genuine spare_part , so i checked your spec . sheet and it states classic power as00a00 laptop battery , and below it says acer as00a00 but that is not what was delivered it was ml0000 comparable .
M	there is little else i can add and therefore must now consider this matter closed .
M	thank_you
F	and we definately paid well over the odds for the experience we had .
F	i had upgraded the bouquet to grand and they were supposed to be white and orange . was disappointed , lots of white daisy like flowers , very few of the orange flowers and filled in with small yellow ish flowers .
M	would recommend to any parent !
M	furniture arrived a day late , which cost us two_days in time .
M	they failed to deliver when they we ' re originally supposed to , failed to re - deliver when they said they would , provided a number to call that was never answered , only offered a redelivery window of 0 . 00am to 0 . 00pm , impossible to contact to track the parcel , labyrinthine central phone system that eventually cuts you off .
F	since my last update argos have phoned me to say my items got lost in the system but are in stock .
M	it was the joint cheapest place on the contract i wanted with a couple other_places , but buymobilephones give quidco_cashback so i went with them .
F	a complete_rip_off .
M	fast and true to there word sold my iphone best price and super quick
M	since_0000 and at last i have seen what can be done , by good people
M	this is the third time i have purchased from them and would recommend them to everyone .
M	michael hudson
F	fast deliveies and a even better after care service .
M	after confirming my payment i realised the booking was for the next_day 0 / 0 even_though i had never changed any of my search dates .
F	the company reacted quickly to my order .
F	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
F	thanks !
M	i waited at home again ( took time off work ) and again no delivery .
F	the roses were fine but the stocks were damaged and dying on arrival .
M	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
F	they spoke to the owner while i was on the phone with them and advised that i should find alternativa accommodation in the middle of the night and with a pregnant wife !
F	great
M	very happy good product for the money and arrived on a saturday_morning at no extra_cost
F	the price was also reasonable .
M	i got a free eye_test at optical_express ( book online ), asked for my prescription and bought these glasses based on that .
F	needed items asap and got in less_than 00_hrs .
M	easy web_site to use .
F	they felt grubby and dated , especially the stained shower curtains and the thick dust on top of the mirrors .
M	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
M	they did this without even asking me !!
M	will provide a update if / when i ever get the item
M	i have now sent a request into barclays to do a chargeback on the payment .
F	i was charged 000 for a 0 nights_stay !!!
M	wouldn_'_t it be good if this company was on don_'_t get done get dom !!!
F	no apology from him .
M	our apologies for this inconvenience .
M	i like the fact that my credit_card was not charged until the items where shipped .
F	i ordered a sharpening steel for my husband 00_hours before xmas_eve .
M	had to wait for wrong item to be returned to pcw before they would despatch the correct item .
M	smartbuyglasses denied any responsibility and have left me with the broken frames and no refund .
F	the arrangement was in oasis covered by plastic wrap and placed inside a small box !!!
F	it was opened and over half the packet spilled out into the box , in my house and some out on the street .

F	a completely frustrating and appalling experience when trying to arrange a lovely surprise for friends .
F	the wheelchair is not suitable for rougher ground and going up drop down curbs .
M	previously i have owned four_pairs of ecco chiltern shoes over the the last 00 years .
F	i will be returning it to them and am sure they will supply a replacement with a reimbursement of my postage .
M	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
M	as above really , the drill ordered arrived in a timely_manner and was as ordered .
M	would reccomend
F	many emails back and forth with serenata explaining the situation , but serenata said they would not help by contacting the property_owner .
M	like most people i got into debt slowly , due to no life style changes and decreasing value of my income .

M	| i have used tyre_shopper before and have been totally_satisfied with an easy to use website , good advice and really good value for money , i would recommend this service to all motorists who need all the help they can get in the present economic circumstances .
M	mistakes_happen but it '_s how a company deals with them that is a mark of the company .
F	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
F	the pictures that were delivered that were the right size and werent blurred were very good however .
M	[_name_] bad attitude is the reason we will not use you .
F	received an_email claiming the florist has run_out of roses and so has the wholesaler , yet they are still advertising roses on their website , would i like different flowers ?
F	perfect for those out of office meetings .
M	i am usually pretty pleased but i had to cancel my last order down to the eight day delivery time
F	waited in all day , daren '_t even vacuum up in case i didn_'_t hear the door , you know how impatient these companies can be , and parcel never arrived .
F	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
F	will probably not go with aferry again .
M	first off , this wasn_'_t a holiday !
F	i have now resorted to opening a paypal claim ( i am glad i paid by paypal ) and they have not yet responded to anything paypal have sent them so hopeful i will receive a refund .
F	i would use this service again in the future as the costumes were amazing and the costs were also reasonable .
M	had amazing vision in my right eye and my left eye was only ok , but my combined vision was good .
F	very good communication also postage was free and item was sent with a courier very speedly .
M	my overall experience with mr_central_heating was excellent and would highly_recommend .
F	unfortunately the first flowers i ordered died within a day but after a complaint another bunch was sent which were much_better
F	will i use them again ?

M	also an excellent website
M	order was not delivered on due date , as it was damaged in transit and returned to sender by courier .
F	delivery by one man and not two .

M	would recommend fast and reliable
F	disgraceful response three_times from customer_services .
M	tried to buy a couple of copies of nightwatch & daywatch on blu_ray .
F	i was overall pleased with your service , however the colour of the flowers were not of that shown , as i was attracted by the colours this did let the side down . i would however use the service again but recomend future custmers to clearly state the colours of the flowers that they would like and are purchesing .
M	ebay has set its self up as the internet policeman , you can buy stuff on the high_street , but not on ebay , you can buy stuff on their foreign websites , but not their uk website
F	called at 0 . 00_pm and spoke to steven , who said there was nothing in the notes about returning the old hard_drive !
M	foolishly got caught out on the full to empty_fuel_policy when we all know it '_s impossible to return a car empty .
F	je me suis donc renseignée , ai consulté différents forums et suis encore plus inquiète !
M	then in my opinion they have no business being in the retail sector and are a poor reflection on there industry .
M	i personally do not give a damn if the supplier has an issue , as you ' re the guys selling me the guitar , and it '_s your duty to inform your customers if there is going to be a delay , not keep them bloody hanging for two months with my money !
M	i e_mailed my brother in law to check : no sign of the flowers .
F	the small stated up to 00 " waist and my client was only a 00 " waist .
F	i need these mats as we stay on a farm and hopefully they will preserve the interior of the car
F	fast delivery , easy purchase to deal with .
F	then i replied to him terminal 0 . i had no problem from the booking etc , but we were not happy with the actual service .
M	oh no , ah well maybe this time after_placing an order of 000 quids_worth . oh no they just bought the staff all coffees .
M	open your eyes to a country that exploits us all through underhanded and abusive trading methods . loan sharks and criminals !
F	just to mention that i wasn_'_t in when they first tried to deliver it , so they just called again ( i thought i was going to have to pick it up from the parcel depot ) - brilliant service .
M	( although the date says 00th_jan )
M	this was all done on the 0th_march .
F	i '_ve_used ocado probably about 00 times .
M	i can '_t believe you can buy such good quality and unique clothing at less_than high_street prices .
M	what can i say about this company ?
M	( they do make deliveries on sat ) but i only got it on monday .
M	not interparcels fault exactly but still a bit off that citi link try & pull the wool over your eyes and your just expected to live with it - people usually book a service and pay more for it for a reason .
M	don_'_t think i would be using this site again even if they are a few_pounds_cheaper .
M	we ordered a semi - integrated_dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
F	it '_s the last time i will ever order from here i '_d rather go to my local mobility shop to get goods instantly !
F	all about posting the items through the letter_box .
F	they were easy to install and look really good - great price too !
F	i ordered the first phillips master led from this company via_amazon . co . uk and it took 0_weeks before i got it .
M	i purchased a chocolate smart phone and a chocolate games hand control for two of my nephews .
M	out of respect at this stage i have chosen not to mention names of the conversations i had when and with who .
F	on the morning my mattress was due to be delivered i had an_emergency , my daughter was taken ill and i needed to go to my grandchildren .
F	tickets are not those ordered .
F	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
F	he was waiting for me on my return in the allotted place which was great after an 00 hour flight .
M	if there is a problem with the order , they will contact the buyer immediately .
F	my phone was working , and the cracked_screen did not hinder it working , so i was a little surprised to only receive the minimum cashback .
F	!
F	i will not be using them again .
F	my hunch is either the company are extremely disorganised and have lost my return package , or they decided the gloves are not resaleable without the cardboard label so not to give a refund .
F	chose standard delivery and arrived when it stated .
M	i raised an order for some polishing kits where the price was significantly_reduced on the website .
M	well_done alamo at buffalo airport .
M	claim rejected .
F	hopefully it will arrive at some point and i will be able to rate more favorably .
M	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".
F	so by giving me the money back it in three or four days this is not suitable as your offer may have expired .
M	all good but one the smoke_detectors does not work so have asked for a replacement .
M	there was alot of stuff i did not understand and there is nothing to understand and learn , its just listen and move on .
